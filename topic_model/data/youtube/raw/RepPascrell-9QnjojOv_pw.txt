Representatives so fat welcome great to be here honored to have you I'm honored to be on your show and we III I'm thrilled about this I'm I'm excited about this because you have been a great friend a true friend the man of this work and not everybody in the Congress keeps their word as they all right that's anywhere do the work so so the point in the matter is I'm anxious to talk to you about this experience I'm looking Pat in your history you you majored in journalism I majored in journalism and I'll tell you too funny a crazy story I don't have a TV show like you I I'll tell you this crazy story about when I went out to look for a job in communications in journalism when I saw what they were paying I said I'd better find something else so I wound up teaching much to my parents should rent another they passed that gone to the to their maker they wanted me to be a lawyer and and we have similar backgrounds I was the first one to graduate you were to first want to graduate high school and yeah alright I was the first one to graduate Grammar School in my home so I was the great hope in the neighborhood there's a lot of pressure packed I bet did your parents have like aspirations that this is what they wanted you to be when you grew up no my mom and dad both me and I'm the oldest and my sisters they they just wanted us to give an education because they believe that an education in America was the great equalizer neither of them had a formal education in America they both came over two smartest people we ever met though that's exactly right I was just gonna say that bill I mean my my dad has a sixth grade Italian education and he's the smartest guy I've ever got was and what he was able to accomplish he's a steel worker but think about it well he was able to accomplish and you have the same story he came to America at 16 with nothing not with his older sister didn't know the language didn't know our culture didn't know anybody and he was able to provide for me and my sisters and encouraged us to get an education go to college get a degree and with with with understanding English and in that formal education you could make something of yourself whatever that might be right when I look back a lot of a lot of guys I hung out what didn't make it didn't make it period education was important but up just to a point and I I don't know how I made it through high school I think I know to go into college to make it into college and I want to be a baseball player yeah you you played an instrument in the high school event you played a trumpet I played the trumpet by the way and I and I wanted to be a professional baseball player for the Cincinnati Reds when I grew up really didn't work out so well I had to try outs with the Phillies I didn't even get that far but you know I you know I was young vinegar and you're still spitting it they they wanted they wanted long ball hitters I want to rather than punch it as I was a point shooter but we have similar oh I'm looking at it very funny this is interesting you know yeah I'm older than you are but we have we have backgrounds that is saying how did they take that you ran your parents how'd they take it when you say I'm gonna run that's one thing to be that in this legislature I was a legislator too right you were the Speaker of the House Majority Leader I was the Speaker Pro Tem so I mean it's pretty close I'm bored alone but when you when you were gonna run for Congress they were all in right absolutely so my parents were Democrats my dad was a steelworker yeah he was a Reagan Democrat so Reagan was the father was similar so my dad first time he voted for a Republican was Ronald Reagan right and so I began when I was in college I accidentally got assigned an internship I feel political science class that I had with my congressman whose name was John Kasich Wow they love John Kasich he's now our governor of our state and John Kasich then hired me part-time as I was working my way through college and that kind of opened my eyes a little bit because I while I was a registered Democrat I really didn't know anything about politics or government but I liked Reagan first person I voted for in 1984 was Ronald Reagan so you know interesting background but my parents well they were Democrats I would say they were conservative Democrats like like many in the Italian community in central Ohio right a lot of a lot of the members of the Italian community were entrepreneurs and so it wasn't it wasn't shocking to them but they did change and become Republicans when I had a primary when I ran for Congress and they became Republicans Wow yeah so I had a vote for you in the primary right well as an FS and I won the primary that is a fascinating kind of thing my father voted more republican than democrat Wow and then of course when I became a congressman he felt obligated that's probably why that's the only reason but he was proud of me my dad and my and my mother he lived to see me get sworn in I saw some and he didn't died too long after that it was a great time we had died sure thing we held up tried for buses down from New Jersey remember that those days when you got sworn in that the first line you brought your family here and came in buses absolutely right we're very well our streets are Columbus yep I was a kid off the street of Paterson New Jersey right and now look what you did you you you you rose you became a chairman of a couple of subcommittees that's a terrific history Pat yeah is that your best time in the Congress when you served on ways and means ways and means as an awesome committee just coming here that first year was you had to pinch yourself and I still often pinch yourself but it was like I'll tell you a funny story you'll appreciate this my uncle from Italy my mom's youngest brother said to me when he came here he said you have no idea what a big deal this is because in Italy even Italy still it depends what family you're from and we're not from the right family and in America somebody like you can get elected right and he mentioned Bill Clinton getting getting to become president that's a big deal for him from his bowl away from hope Oh only in America that's right only in America what's the most exciting time you had in the Congress of all the 16 17 years you know there are so many things to point to bill but one of the things that you and I have had the ability to share together and you mentioned it at the beginning is being co-chairman of the italian-american caucus and having a shared heritage and putting our our partisan labels aside in our in our ours and Di's aside and celebrating the alliance between a very important ally of ours Italy and in America and getting to know people on a more personal level that share that common heritage and I think that is so important and quite frankly lacking in Washington DC today not just in the house but all over Washington DC and in our country yeah and you know back in the good old days there was a lot more of that and a lot more things got done yeah I I am not too big on identity politics I take you get you a lot of trouble I'm not either I'm not either and I you know I judge everybody equally everybody's born equal it doesn't matter what country you're born in agreed hunter born in the middle of Sahara Desert if they have no constitution you're still absolutely right god-given rights and the Constitution protects them absol but to share our common heritage history of where artists are our forefathers came from and the Alliance which is important strategically between Europe and Italy and Italy in the United States is very important too and that's some of the things we got to do more so than we would have and we hadn't been part of that before we got here yeah this place was a lot more friendly absolutely I read about it I hear about it from folks of an era where a long time and I don't know you don't have you don't have to but I would want you to respond to what I'm going to say about I noticed the big change happening before I got here in the early 90s when Newt Gingrich ran worked very hard for that position I read his books right and how we got to this point what he studied and and followed very very carefully and he took over at an interesting time in the early 90s 94 the Gingrich revolution but I remember him saying something which really angered me you know in our business you better not get angry we'll stay angry yeah you know you got a how to deal with it really he said at that time when he took over now the Democrats are irrelevant and in 96 when I ran and got elected I beat an incumbent and Clinton ran that year for the second time yep and one after Clinton won they still though we had a Democratic president again and we had Republicans then and he said you're irrelevant then I saw him go back down Pennsylvania Avenue to make a deal a couple of times and those guys worked out something where we balanced the budget for two or three years but something changed maybe part of our heart changed I don't know if you noticed cuz you didn't get there to 2001 right and when you got here what was what what was your observations well it was certainly less nonpartisan then the state house was in the legislature in Ohio where I had come from but you know I look back now over the last 17 years and in your right but it's gotten worse yeah I mean it wasn't great but it's progressively gotten worse and it's gotten worse in Ohio too by the way and I think we're kind of a reflection of society you know people have gotten much less polite and talking to elected official right I'm sure you see it as well yeah whether they be Republicans are Democrats by the way you know I'm not conservative enough from too liberal you know it it's it's it's mom's yeah right it's all over the political spectrum and people have lost their manners I think social media has made it worse oh yeah they like that social media is great technology is wonderful but it's also used in in ways that make people a lot you know a lot less polite and people don't have a time to be with their private thoughts that's right question your honor your Flash there and your Flash there that's exactly I've always got to be on oh really that's exactly right but you know I'm the big difference and I think that is a big difference I think that is a very very big difference respecting one another you know I could be very vociferous when I get into a debate etc so I've always tried to be respectful of the other person give me other person the benefit of the doubt but some people have come here to be simply in a pedantic debate and agree with you and sometimes people miss Reid because of where we are today if you if you raise your voice or get emotional they they don't hear what you're saying but they see the emotion and they think that that you're being rude that's correct and I think I think that happens more often today as well to your point because I think I don't I think you are not one of those those folks try not to but when you get what you get emotional you are pretty emotional yes probably probably part of the heritage part of her and but but you know you or somebody bill and I believe this and I know a number of my colleagues would agree with that you're a guy who wants to make the trains work on time and is willing to give and wants to govern and respects somebody even if their opinion is differently and I'm I'm you know I'm I'm living proof of that because we've disagreed on things absolutely what we do in a disagreeable and in I said to you a couple of years ago I remember saying it's a meaning well look if t burning past grow or in the room yes will come out with a resolve will well resolve the problems yeah well all of us should be able to think that way absolutely right and I meant it and it's missing today it is it's missing day particularly from the higher levels of government yeah in the leadership in both parties quite frankly until we get a president you know a speaker Senate Majority Leader both parties who's willing to put that aside and work with the other side like our founders intended this is gonna be a tough slog yeah all right we don't want to end the age of controversy but the question is in conflict you must respect the other person correct any other person position right if it's the other person's position and that we don't become sink offense to our party we don't simply become followers absolutely how did you make that how did you do that balancing act between party and own your own independent conscience because you do have it you've demonstrated it yeah not only in the bills that you put forth but how you debate how you discuss issues yeah well you know what you you have to be willing to lose an election I had a primary in 2010 or 2012 I think it was when I had both the same time what I had a boat owners who called me a lap an Obama lap dog right in a Republican primary was to the right of charlemagne it so I beat him 8020 so you had to have confidence in the fact that I know what you got to do what's important for country first and I have a philosophy my philosophy is more conservative than yours but nevertheless at the end of the day I know that we don't live in a dictatorship we're live in a republic and you have to compromise at the end of the day and you have to you have to you know weigh both sides of it and and try to work with the other side as best you can sometimes the other sides to my right example of that is how we started off this the year of 2017 I'm of the belief in the minority party we Democrats are in the minority that if the president started off in trying to deal with the subject that we might get some agreement on not all but some he would have been better off the country would have been better off I thought the wrong subject was health care it it's personal to everybody it's personal we got beat up remember in 2010 I do we got that knocked out of us and I remember in in forums out there you know public meetings town meetings but if he can't stand the heat as Harry Truman said get out of the kitchen but there was a Perth example now why did he think that that was the way to get through to common ground or maybe he never hoped to get common ground I thought it was the world the worst subject you agree or disagree yeah well it's always easy to be armature quarterback yeah but yeah yes you're absolutely right infrastructure probably would have been the the the best big issue to kind of kick it off and try to get some bipartisan reappearing and and the president had you know he quite frankly had the chops to do that on infrastructure and to get Democrats support based upon his history of soaring Democrats and infrastructure it was a big deal to him so I don't know why they chose healthcare they certainly gonna listen to me and it's still not because we did the same thing you did in 20 2009 in 2009 when we started off that year yep before the ACA the Affordable Care Act we started off talking about the carbon yep cap and trade and and they Kappa trade in the in the Senate said they weren't going to bring it up no I remember that and a couple you know a couple guys in the Midwest aren't here because if that's correct in the house that is absolutely correct so you lay the foundation and move on to the tougher things that's what I would have history tends to repeat itself doesn't it it really does really the regardless of which part of your if the absolute toughest subject you out of face since you've been in the Congress in the 17 years you've been here you know the most emotional one I mean there have been I would put two out there equally because they were they were gut-wrenching emotional and and one was the decision on Iraq quite frankly and I think we were on opposite sides of that that was that was voted for yes oh you did okay I didn't realize that I didn't look at that I I made up my mind that morning after I had read the New Yorker magazine I fasted on mousse and I'm saying that's exactly I had used chemical weapons yes that was the second time I read about that and that pushed me over the top in my district up in North Jersey it's 80 to 1 to vote no I vote yes I said we only have one president at the time and then six months later when I apologized to my constituents I said I made a big mistake I didn't blame Bush so I made the mistake yeah not Bush said I'm a grown adult you were eating you remember that that was it I mean that was hard and the other one that's heart was hard and you might remember this too it was that week I voted no the first time then I voted yes the second time after some of us Democrats and Republicans got the speaker to change the bill a little bit it was when the the market crashed during the 2008 campaign I remember that like remember we were on the floor and we were getting calls when Paulson comes in yes right the crumpled up paper yeah the end of the world that's exactly he's got to act now yes yes and I you know I wasn't convinced and I would write down I would a president Trump Hitler he said he handle all what a mess I got when I became the president I what if you were the president in no circus this is what would you already done pretty tough time when when there's no investment from the corporate America and there's no money out there so what do you do in that particular position you spend money in order to get this economy moving again it's not the answer no but you got to do it it's a series of bad choices there's no good choice but we have people calling you saying you know University saying I can't meet payroll people I can't get credit because the credits frozen you have a bank president say I did 85 year old widow who just took out in cash a hundred and fifty thousand dollars to put under her mattress yeah because she's afraid she's gonna lose it all even though we know she wouldn't because thanks revenue exactly right but these are the decisions that you have to make right what what what do you think you remember most about the Congress now you're gonna be here another year so I know I'm not trying to you know put you push you aside you're gonna be a very I got here that long finally act but a little while so remember when I came in 2001 remember September 11th and all of us do mean especially your constituents in in New Jersey and and New York oh my goodness and here in in DC or Northern Virginia oh my goodness what a horrific thing that you'd never believe that you would see in your lifetime ever you're thinking you were in the middle of a movie or dream or a dream or a nightmare in that that that is unbelievable and you know quite frankly they're just the mere fact that a kid son of immigrants could actually walk the halls of Congress and and try to make good and and not worry about not worry about getting credit for it and working with people like you and others to to you know make life a little bit better for everybody else I was fortunate to go to the pile with the president of several of the congressmen went up there I thought it was it I thought it was a nightmare I thought so I said to myself as we're landing in Long Island he saw the smoke stone and we're taking a bus to to the pile and I couldn't believe this I said this is gotta be a gym it cannot happen this way cannot and I remember President Bush that day getting people together and I'll remember what he said at night we cannot blame the Muslim community right he's like these are crazy people that did this right and and let's not take it out on it right what what a spiritual thing to yep I mean I didn't vote for the guy leadership at earlier had a real real critical real leadership at a career leadership does not pile on or divide this is the or divided and in and folks that are watching us and listening to us right now right you don't have to tell them what you're talking about and I don't have to tell them what I'm talking about they get the picture and it's clear as day it's clear as day but it's back to what you talked about earlier bill its identity politics and Republicans use it and Democrats use it you don't use it I don't use it and we got to really work hard to try to get more of our colleagues not to do it because we're elected you try to not divide but to unite yeah and I think in my own opinion I probably don't agree with me that this tax thing that we just have gone through and are still going through and we're filming this on Pearl Harbor Day very apropos could have been done different and I always thought that we should have been in in it in the beginning I don't and I think we would have come out with something I don't disagree with that and by the way you know I I'm not the chairman so I mean I didn't have I wish you had I didn't have the the choice but yeah I mean it's we got to get back to that we got to get back to where the Committees of jurisdiction actually get to be involved in the hundred percent of riders and dictate whether they're democrat or republican leaders absolutely right yeah and that members of the committee's can work together and get things done and you know on smaller things I mean on smaller things we've gotten some stuff done we've gotten I mean I'm thinking of some of the health care things are done with sandy eleven oh you're a Mac rat in in Michigan you got one of the great bills mark new markets yes talk about that first yeah so I've got mean innovation this innovation and Opportunity Act is patterned after the new market tax credit which is about encouraging investment private investment in community against that in communities human capital human capital and communities in Paterson or in Columbus that are distressed yet as defined by the US Census Bureau and trying to to get more tired dollars into those community to try to revitalize those keys and give people opportunities communities and I think we're gonna get there I hope you're right I really do uh what are you gonna miss most people like you oh you know it's it's uh it's it's about I'm not gonna miss the circus but I'll miss the clowns how about you get that what I mean I'll accept the job as a clown I will miss the people here there despite the headlines in your constituency him and my constituents we had another elected official resigned in a there might be another one I resigned next week despite that you know we're reflection of

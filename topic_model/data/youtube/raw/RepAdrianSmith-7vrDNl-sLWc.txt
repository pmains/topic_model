thank the gentleman for yielding me time certainly I want to thank him for his diligence and his dedication as ranking member this is probably his last time managing a bill and I just want to thank my colleague for his his dedication and diligence I rise today in strong opposition to this bill I think one of the most unnecessarily divisive efforts in modern history it has been rushed to the floor with no notice no hearing no markup and certainly no opportunity to amend it we are only here as an extra as an excuse for Democrats last minute rush to weaponize private taxpayer information against their opponents much of the oversight of the presidential audit program Democrats claim to have been seeking could have been conducted without accessing or releasing anyone's confidential tax information the Inspector General and the joint committee on taxation could have provided an analysis of the start and completion dates of presidential audits without Democrats obtaining or releasing confidential tax information the JCT could have provided us an analysis of the efficacy of presidential audits without Democrats obtaining or releasing the private tax returns instead we are debating a bill which will never be considered in the senate or become law solely to paper over the bad decision that Democrats made only two nights ago let's defeat this bill today and start over in January with a bipartisan effort to ensure the presidential audit program is working as intended making sure the president and his family are following the law without rushing to cancel anyone's 6103 protections I yield back the gentleman

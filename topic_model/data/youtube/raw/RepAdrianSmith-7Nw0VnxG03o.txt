you um i know that president biden and the administration seem to be doing woefully little to address the fundamental challenges that americans are facing inflation is said to be over 8 percent food inflation over 10 percent i think a lot of americans would even say that it's worse than that at least that's what they feel and you know wages are up maybe five percent but that's overshadowed certainly by by inflation and in the context you know i think the president you know he he's bragging about the unemployment rate and yet the workforce participation rate would show that we've got some work to do and and that's certainly concerning and i'm proud of nebraska's lowest unemployment rate since it's been recorded across the country and but i i'm very concerned that the messages that we're hearing are that the policies that got us into this situation are are going to be continued uh that that is a huge concern that i have but let me more specifically say that uh i along with 50 other members including every republican on this committee sent a letter to you opposing the windfall taxes so-called windfall taxes on domestic energy production the response we received essentially said that we will implement this tax if congress enacts it but that is true but didn't take a position so just very very directly yes or no does president biden support the so-called windfall tax on domestic energy production our focus when it comes to energy production is to make sure that they're adequate incentives and high prices are such an incentive for american oil is that is that a yes or no in terms of this this proposed tax we have not taken a position um in support of of this proposal okay very briefly then in the interest of time a yes or no a response to this question as well uh at a re on a recent panel as cecilia rouse chairman or chair of the council economic advisors said and i quote most household balance sheets are strong and can provide some cushion for rising prices yes or no would you agree with that statement yes okay thank you and previously you had expressed that inflation was too low and you responded by repeating that inflation was too low and that you felt interest rates were also too low do you still think that low inflation we saw prior to the pandemic was a bad thing i think two percent is um which is the fed's long run average inflation target is an appropriate target and as we've seen in japan excessively low inflation can hobble the conduct of monetary policy and create deflationary pressures which are not healthy for an economy okay after the tax cuts and jobs act was enacted the u.s had wage growth of approximately 3.5 percent in inflation around 2 percent and as i said as i've said before we currently have 8 inflation and five percent wage growth yes or no would you believe that eight percent inflation with five percent wage growth is better for working families eight percent inflation is an unacceptable inflation rate in the united states and its president biden's number one objective to get that down there are many reasons for it and russia's war on ukraine is an important part of it we are by far not the only economy to face inflationary pressures like this the uk has inflation close to nine percent uh germany has i i understand that i understand that in in the interest of time i i just want to close by saying that the american people folks on main street folks in our districts i think would have a very different perspective on the economy than that which we see coming from the administration and i realize the president wants to be proud of his agenda but the fact of the matter is we've got a lot of work to do

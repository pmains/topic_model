Mr. Speaker, I rise today on World Refugee
Day to share the remarkable story of one of my younger constituents – 8-year-old Raul
Ortiz. Raul was born amidst the gang-driven violence
in Honduras. When he was five, Raul was kidnapped and held
for ransom by a crime cartel. Following his release, he and his mother later
fled to the safety and security offered by the United States. Raul and his mom rightly worry for their security
if they were forced to return to Honduras, and are seeking asylum in our country. Raul is visiting Washington today to share
a letter he wrote asking President Trump to remember and protect refugee children like
himself, which I will include for the record. Writing of what the United States means to
him, Raul writes “Here we are safe and have hope to see another tomorrow.” Mr. Speaker, we are a country that was founded
and built by immigrants and refugees, many fleeing oppression and violence. Raul’s story is our story. We cannot allow the door of opportunity and
safety to close on the next generation of Americans, like Raul, seeking refuge here.

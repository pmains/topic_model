madam Speaker as I travel across Michigan I constantly hear about the high cost of prescription drugs hardworking families are simply paying too much that's why we need to tackle this issue in a bipartisan way not try to score political points sadly HR 3 is a partisan heavy-handed approach that has no chance of becoming law let's be honest government doesn't negotiate they dictate this drug pricing scheme will ultimately hurt families stifle innovation and prevent prevent life-saving cures from becoming available to our friends our neighbors and families there's a better approach a plan that's patient focused and filled with bipartisan provisions that enjoy support in the Senate as well it's HR 19 the lower cost more cures Act this bill will strengthen transparency encourage medical breakthroughs and make medications that families rely on more affordable if the other side is serious about getting some of these I'm has expanded we should be voting on the lower cost more cures act this week and I yield back

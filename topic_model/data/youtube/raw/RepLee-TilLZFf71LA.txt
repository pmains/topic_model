the question is on the Lea amendment all those in favor say aye all those opposed say nay oh and they have been in the chair the eyes have it thank you miss lane further amendments applause in the room congresswoman barbara Lee of California on the Appropriations Committee she's been a voice in the wilderness trying to get Congress to vote on military force to debate military force to stop relying all these years later on the last time they did that in 2001 after 9/11 today after years who tried to get it done she got her amendment back to do just that it was approved in committee today tons of bipartisan support an apparent miracle spontaneous applause congresswoman barbara Lee joins us now congressman congratulations thank you so much for being here with us tonight thank you I'm really happy to be with you Rachel I can see that in your smile am i right that you even you were cops aside surprise after all these years of trying to do this all right just let me sleep this is really a big deal and I was cautiously optimistic and I'll tell you why I have been working day and night and talking with Republicans and Democrats at least for 10 years of how why we should repeal this resolution and I have this authorization excuse me and I have tried every which way through amendments and appropriations through amendments on the defense authorization bill through freestanding legislation where I think the last time we got about 140 votes on the floor somewhere around that and so we've been building I've been working I've been working very hard with my colleagues to try to get to this point and so this was a major victory I think today for the American people for our young men and women in uniform and for the country because Congress must stop being missing in action on matters of war and peace now am i right on the on the specifics of this that this would give if this passes it would give the Congress eight months a good long amount of time to come up with a new authorization for the use of military force something new to declare something new to declare that authorization so we're no longer relying on what happened back 16 years ago right right right so upon the signing of this legislation it would stay in effect for eight months to give us time to debate the pros and cons of a new authorization to use forth bring forth however many there would be debate the issues and then vote up or down on a new authorization and I just have to say that the 2001 authorization Rachel it was passed in three days with a couple of hours of debate I don't even think it was two hours of debate and so believe you me Congress can and should pass a new resolution within eight months because the American people deserve this it's our job we have been missing in action and I'm so pleased that we had bipartisan support to do this congresswoman barbara Lee of California on the Appropriations Committee a model and monument to perseverance will you come back as this goes through the process here we'd love to stay in touch with you through this I will Rachel because this is a major first step but we have a long way to go and hopefully the Republican leadership hears the voices of the people and the voices of their caucus and continues to help work with us to get this done I hear you tonight congresswoman barbara Lee thank you very much

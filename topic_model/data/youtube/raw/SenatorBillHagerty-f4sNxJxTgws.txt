only about 18 months now until november of 2022 and it's never too early to talk about elections our next guest met with former president trump at his mar-a-lago resort in florida last week to talk politics he says the former president is focused on the 2022 midterms and has not yet made a decision about running again in 2024. tennessee senator bill hagerty joins us now he's a member of the foreign relations committee and former u.s ambassador to japan senator good to talk to you um because i'm because i'm sitting in front of the white house as a backdrop and not the capitol building let's skip ahead to 2024. let us in a little bit behind the curtain here what was your conversation with the former president about running again you know the president is energized he's very engaged again he's very focused right now in the 2022 elections we talked about 2024 but he really pivoted back quickly to 2022 and what we need to do to regain the senate to retake the house and to position ourselves for a very strong 2024 whomever is heading the ticket for us so what's your sense about him in 2024 does he want to give it another shot there are some people who say he's probably toying with the idea wants to keep it out there but in the end likely won't end up running again i i don't know where he's going to land on this job but i can say i think he's taking it very seriously certainly i am and i think most of the republican leadership are taking it seriously we want to make certain that we retake the white house the policies that president trump put in place did so much to put our economy in great footing art laffer was just talking about this but the blue collar boom that president trump put in place has been an enormously successful effort and to see the biden administration come in and routinely go through the process of undoing policies that have been successful i think are going to underscore the fact that republican leadership is necessary now more than ever if you look what's happening at our border if you look at what's happening you know with our position relative to china iran everything that's happening right now is making us less competitive weaker as a nation we need to step up and stand strong and i think president trump's policies are coming fuller into focus for the average american and they realize that he had us on a path particularly after putting operation work speed in place he's put us on a path to recover from this pandemic faster than any other major economy on the subject of china if you look at the recent uh meeting between the u.s and chinese officials in alaska china is letting the u.s know that it's now an equal playing field they're they're on the same footing as the united states after giving deference to this nation for so long in terms of 2022 if we're going to play the short game here senator as opposed to the long game how how involved do you expect the president is going to get in choosing and backing candidates john i think the president can be very involved and very unifying to our party to make certain that we're putting the absolute best candidates on the field and that we're energizing republicans to get out and vote that's where the president can make a huge difference because he did so much to build our party look he got 74 million votes that's more than any republican candidate has ever attained he's got the ability to energize our party and get our turnout where it needs to be to retake the senate in 2022 and i hope the house as well here's a short list to some of the congressional candidates in the house and senate that he's backing so far marco rubio of florida he announced that one last week tim scott of south carolina rand paul jerry moran ron johnson john kennedy mike crapo mo brooks john boozman he's also weighing in on some gubernatorial races including backing his former press secretary sarah huckabee sanders in arkansas but he's also backing some primary challengers as well did you get the sense senator when you talked to him that people who crossed him or didn't give him the support that he needed he's going to try to take down in 2022. we weren't focused on that john what we were focused on is how to win in 2022 and having the president engaged in that i think is absolutely critical you know i'm the only person i believe i'm the only administration official that served in the trump administration that's in federal elective office right now and we've stayed in close contact he certainly very strongly favors the election integrity legislation that i put forward legislation that would require an audit of what happened in 2020 correct something that would that would certainly make certain that no more unconstitutional actions take place and that we would clean up the election process which we talked about which we talked about the last time you were i got a question for you here just to close this out the president is really angry still at mitch mcconnell and mike pence he let that be known in that speech at mar-a-lago on saturday night you decided not to challenge the electoral college results and in fact certified joe biden uh to be president how is it that he is angry at mitch mcconnell and mike pence but not you well president trump knows that i stepped up and tried to put a commission in place that would come back and take a very hard look at what happened in 2020. it would take a hard look at that election and really put it back to the states to fix the problem once and for all but i never intended for the congress to federalize the election process that needs to be left to state legislatures just as it's provided for in the constitution that's what my legislation does and i think that's why president trump likes it it would force an audit it would uncover those places where the constitution was violated and it would ensure that no federal funding goes to those states that violated the constitution until that situation is repaired well clearly you're still in good stead with him senator senator bill haggerty of tennessee thanks so much for being with us

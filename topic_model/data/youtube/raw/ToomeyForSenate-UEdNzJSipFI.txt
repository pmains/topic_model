thank you steve president obama kicking off his white house to main street jobs tour today in allentown pennsylvania what will he need to do to get people back to work joining us now two candidates for pennsylvania's senate seat former chairman of the club for growth pat toomey joins us from philadelphia and joining us from washington is democratic congressman joe sestak good morning gentlemen good morning gretchen good morning gretchen congressman is this a good thing for you in pennsylvania that president obama is coming there first oh sure absolutely anytime you can have the president united states come to your state it's a good thing i hope what he does is make sure everybody knows that the great recession this past quarter with three and a half percent gdp growth has ended is it still intense out there absolutely and where do i want as focused on small businesses in the last recession under george bush eighty percent of all jobs were created by small business so i hope he talks about tax incentives tax cuts for small businesses i hope he recognizes that in the past eight years under president bush the small business administration's budget was slashed forty percent let's get the small business administration's loans increased at affordable rates let's guarantee them up to 98 percent of 90 percent instead of 90 percent so there's a lot to be done congresswoman you're sounding like a republican with tax cuts pat toomey i'm kind of surprised to hear congressman sestak saying that because here's what president obama said yesterday productivity is up profits are up market's up but businesses are skittish to hire why do you think they're skittish to hire well there's a number of reasons first i'm delighted that the president's coming to allentown and coming to pennsylvania and i hope this marks a real shift in the focus of his administration to job growth because that should be item number one i'm glad to hear joe talk about some lowering the tax burden the problem is that so much of the agenda that joe is voting for and that president obama and nancy pelosi and harry reid are promoting raises taxes uh the health care bill that they have voted for and that's working its way through the senate imposes direct new taxes on workers this cap and trade legislation dramatically raises the cost of all energy use they're proposing tax increases on income on wages on capital on business this is no way to go now if this is a shift and they're going to come around and realize that we shouldn't impose these new costs we shouldn't impose these new taxes we've got to get spending under control because that's really driving ultimately it drives all these tax increases then we can make some real progress so i hope the president is open to what will really congressman is there do you know about a shift in the obama administration they're going to not they're going to stop the spending programs and listen to you well this is very interesting because pat who i have great respect for sounds almost like an apostate back in 2002 he actually let the pay as you go rules go out the window and he with his votes let the national debt increase from four and a half trillion dollars to almost 10 trillion dollars okay well let's keep it about what's happening today which is 10.2 unemployment rate absolutely without a question 10.2 if we had not done the economic stimulus bill and we had not done tarp we would have been at 12 unemployment so what we do want to do is do those tax incentives there's no way just a moment pat just a moment is but what we also have to do is recognize that we have 17 million excuse me 27 million americans who are underemployed or unemployed and so the state budgets this year have fallen nine percent in terms of revenues so we also want to probably infuse to the states an equivalent amount of money so that they don't lay off education uh people or people that they are having in their workforce just as we get the small businesses to get job growth going again all right it is about job growth more you cannot spend more hemorrhaging of jobs joe just goes right back to more spending that we can't afford i mean this government and and joe's votes have created a 1.4 trillion dollar deficit serial bailouts of failing companies that misallocate resources this chilling effect that is uh affecting potential employers and actual employers by the threat of higher taxes on wages this huge new energy cost this is a big part of the problem i i hope the president will get off this agenda and on to one that will really limit spending and the bailouts lower taxes and lower this deficit so that we can have private sector-led growth all right well no doubt this is going to be the whole topic of conversation as the two of you go head-to-head potentially for that senate seat in pennsylvania thank you both for joining me this morning thanks gretchen thanks pat thanks for having

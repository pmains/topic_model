chip joining me now fresh off that house built Republican congressman Roger Marshall of Kansas congressman I am confused about all this is I think a lot of other people are so I just walked me through is the Republicans do have a majority in the house right that's right mister I is they sure do okay sure I think we proved that tonight we do you do okay and I also I spent the last year covering Congress in the Senate where you can use a budget process called reconciliation and when they care about something they used reconciliation to get try to get ACA through couldn't get the votes got the corporate tax cut through could pass budget bills through the reconciliation process if they want to right I don't know that we can pass this particular bill through with directly silly ation I think that we need to fund the government long term right but but my point is that there are Republican majorities in both houses who when they really care about something like corporate tax cuts seem to get it together to manage to do to do without Democrats helping right there were no Democratic votes on the corporate tax cuts Republicans really cared about that issue why all of a sudden when it comes to this stuff Republicans are worried about the Democrats well miss race personal way I did have six Democrats vote with this tonight so that's a little bit of a celebration but I think we need to stop and celebrate what we've done tonight we funded governments we've helped kids out for six years and now I need my Senate partners to do the same thing there's been some Democrats to step forward as well why not why didn't you do chip a month ago we in the house side we did we actually passed chip back in October on the house side I can't always speak for what the Senate's doing or not doing but I think we need to hold the Senate accountable but we passed chip way back in October here at five years on the house side here's the way here's the way it looks to folks is that chip is being used as a bargaining tool that that it's viewed not as a good program in and of itself but it's being used by Republicans who could have passed it if they wanted to as a bargaining tool to get Democratic votes that's an interesting comment mister days I've done 70 town halls and you're the first person never suggest that I think it couldn't be further from the truth I think that's very disingenuous I think that we've always wanted a prioritize what we can do and and we want to prioritize our military and our kids and we do just that you just told me wait a second you just told me the house funded this and back in October right we did we find a chip back in October exactly so my understanding of the way the bills work is it passes the House passed the Senate goes the president so the Senate which is run by Republicans could have passed chip after you guys did right it would take sixty votes over in the Senate to pass there would have been 64 Chetwynd there I can't tell you that I said what I can't believe is anyone could vote against it in the Senate how can someone in the Senate vote against kids in the military this is going to be the the Schumer meltdown here the of Schumer shut down so so why can't the Senate make me kind of place my deal and get the job did you watch the president that day that he had that long meeting with everyone about immigration I saw a few of the replays over replays of it just bits and pieces he said I will sign whatever you bring me correct I don't remember that I think it's being taken out of context I I don't think I think that he said as long as it met certain parameters he was willing to make a deal so I think that's what he raised you support a bipartisan daca deal right I do as long as their sick border security in there I mean I'm in favor of fixing dog of it daca but it all starts with border security but there's one be back here in ten years doing the same thing but you gotta you've got a bipartisan dock a deal with border security by will heard and and and Congressman Aguilar I had them on last night you got a bipartisan doc a deal in the Senate there are majorities in both houses right now if you went to the floor in both houses you've got bipartisan majorities for a daca deal border security chip from the government why not do it I think I think with all due respect I think unless there's 18 million dollars of funding for securing the border you're not going to get that bill to the house side there's only 25 Republican sponsors of mr. Hurtz bill and it's a great start but I have to have 18 billion dollars of funding for border security for that bill to become realistic you just saying that you're willing to hold the chip recipients hostage or the dreamers hostage for the border security 18 billion dollars yeah I don't think anybody's a hostage here I think you can't look at each one of these issues and little silos I want to fix doctor but it all starts with border security we just fix chip so I don't see how you're putting those two together now because the whole point is what gets included and what doesn't right I mean you've been legislating for a while that's the whole game that's being played the party with the majority controls what gets included in what doesn't you'd agree with that right I think that's pretty close but I think as we work towards long-term solutions and we'd like to add my partisan solutions that would include ideas from both sides and amendments or process man you got bipartisan solutions there are bipartisan majorities for a deal with daca in both houses that is simply a fact and my question is why not just put those up for a vote yeah I don't think you have the votes yet to pass it in the bill yet that I think would pass but you know the great news is mr. Hayes's we're talking more about daca and immigration issues that I've ever seen just last night a bipartisan dinner i sat down with five Democrats so we're talking about this more than everybody think well I think we're way closer than then you're giving us credit for if you just give us a little time in a little bit of room we're going to get doc had done but it all starts with border security we don't be back here again in ten years doing the same thing again let me ask you one more thing he said you need 18 billion for border security yes sir I do so I I happen to cover the campaign I don't know how much you paid attention to it but but I was here every night and I watched the president speak a lot and he had a line I don't know if you recall it from the campaign he said that they were gonna build a wall and that Mexico would pay for it and it was something he repeated quite often he probably repeated it a thousand times so if Mexico is going to pay for the wall why do you need to appropriate a single cent from American taxpayers for border security I'm not really sure the president says some things he tweets some things I don't always agree with everything he tweets or says but you have to realize he's negotiating and I'm used to used to dealing with people so when he was saying those things I think he was negotiating he started off he wanted to build an entire wall I mean it was just what four years ago the gang of eight wanted to keep it appropriate forty five million dollars but he's always asking for is $18 to to secure the border but this is not that difficult the American issue American people elected Donald Trump president did they not they sure Donald Trump made one of the most signature policy promises of the whole campaign if you were going to say what are the top things Donald Trump stands for one of them was build the wall and it was so familiar that he would stop in the crowd would say Mexico is going to pay for it if you take seriously the people voted for him for that reason then shouldn't Mexico pay for the wall we don't have to even have this conversation about appropriating American taxpayer dollars for it I guess this entire conversation doesn't make sense I think we need to appropriate 18 billion dollars to secure the border I think the president's already kind of backed off a little bit again he's negotiating through the press many times he's with what if twelve hundred fourteen hundred miles of border wall now he's talked about maybe eight hundred dollars eight hundred million dollars so I think there's lots of ways to get this done maybe long term he'll figure a way out for Mexico to pay for it but in the meantime we have to appropriate money so we can get the job the American taxpayer should front the money because what the president promised can't happen I think you're you're taking everything a little bit too literally I would sure encourage you to pay more attention to what President Trump is doing and what is going to do all these words and all these tweaks I understand that okay congressman Roger Marshall thank you

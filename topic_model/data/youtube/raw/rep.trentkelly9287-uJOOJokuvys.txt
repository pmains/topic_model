all right if you're just joining us um I am joined with Congressman Trent Kelly and Congressman Jeff Duncan we've been talking uh the outlook for the midterms and getting into some of the issues and at the tail end of the last segment Congressman Kelly you were talking about crime crime is one of these issues where um it is just it's it's become a major problem um under the Biden Administration but also there's been a role of these increasingly liberal DA's and folks filling I'm air quoting for those who can't see prosecutorial functions letting criminals out into the community and creating problems for American families just trying to go out there and live their life in the best that they can so tell us a little bit about what you're going to be doing um in this right now and in this next Congress to address that issue yeah well first of all you know the Democrats are trying to turn the table on this they were the ones who had Portland in the Summer of Love where they took over a city and burned police stations and burned Federal buildings we've always been Pro policy so we're going to hire uh 200 000 new police officers to be out there on the street we need to make sure that we back our law enforcement our boys and girls in blue yeah how about the 87 000 IRS agents why don't we just put them on the border and get them out of the IRS absolutely 87 000 you IRS agents to come take our money uh but we're not going to raise taxes and then the other thing is these prosecutors and these policies of no bail listen when you murder someone there is no excuse for you being back out on the street with no bond and killing someone else they continue I mean it's New York is Portland it's all these democrat-run cities where they go Oh They'll be good people if you just let them out no they're going to continue to commit crimes and some people need to go away forever low-level crimes I'm okay with that but when you start talking about the people who are bad who are killing and hurting people we cannot allow prosecutors and judges to turn them free on the street again well that's exactly right in Memphis I mean we saw this in Memphis most recently a shooting spree I mean aren't these people killed and a kidnapping all this in one little short period and because they're not holding people accountable yeah and you have someone like Eliza Fletcher who goes out for a run um you know she's a teacher she's a mom just a loving member of the community and she's gone forever because someone was let out early on parole that should have never been left never let out Mandy we should never be scared to go to the grocery store or a convenience store they just had a killing in a convenience store in Tupelo we should never be scared or fear for our kids to go to places where we should go every day but Democratic policies and letting people out who are committing bad crimes has led to all this and we have got to turn the tide on that well at the same time they're going after the Second Amendment Trent to keep us from being over keeping their arms and defend ourselves because ultimately it comes down to yourself I mean when seconds count the police are just minutes away in many cases Republicans back the police but what we're seeing is a rising crime that's directly related to an open border we have hundreds of thousands if not millions of people that have entered our country illegally on the southern border during the byte Administration he just opened his arms and welcome them in well we know those numbers those apprehension rates we don't know who's in our country because of the ones that weren't apprehended that weren't caught and we know many of the people that are coming are from the Middle East they're from Asia they're from Africa they're not all the Hispanics that the Democrats want you to believe are coming here for Economic Opportunity some of them may have more nefarious goals in mind and we also know that the cartel is bringing huge amounts of fentanyl across fentanyl showing up in our in our schools now and the human trafficking Jeff human trafficking is uh has really increased under this Administration if you've got an open border that's what you're going to find and so Republicans are about securing our nation securing our border strengthening our military and backing our police we shouldn't defund the police we should defend the police at every turn make sure that we've got law enforcement the people that are First Responders in general that are running toward whatever is going on when we're fleeing it and that's important Trent's right is happening in blue cities the defund the police movement was bad Democrats are trying to back up on that Republicans stand for law enforcement and a secure country in a secure Nation it's so frustrating to see Democrats try to rewrite history they were the ones pushing the defund the police and now that American communities are feeling the consequences of it they they are trying to shift the blame and even allege that Republicans were a part of that campaign and of course they have their mainstream media allies that are willing to go along with them but it simply isn't true now on the border I saw some reports uh I'm wondering if you can confirm that Venezuela was letting out some of its prisoners to come across the border and you know so it's the same thing we saw in the 80s with Cuba when they released all their prisoners to come into Miami and we saw huge increases in crime in Southern Florida and drug trafficking it's the same thing Venezuela and other countries are they're opening their prisons and letting their prisoners come across into America like I said there's a lot of people that we don't apprehend at the border we don't know about that cross if drugs can cross you got to know that humans can and a lot of them have nefarious goals in mind we know that Iran Iranians revolutionary guard the kudz force tried to come across our border during the Obama Administration was single person to assassinate the Ambassador from Saudi Arabia don't you know that Iran and other Bad actors across the world are trying to send their agents across our Southern border knowing they can because it's open and they can get those people into our country so we have no idea who's in our country and it's really a bad recipe for something the worst to happen down the road yeah I think it's a Tinderbox situation and uh they're sending plenty of matches that could light that big fire now talking about the Border um secretary mayorkas um has well there's been some conversations about potentially impeaching him for dereliction of Duty um I would be in the camp of yeah let's bring them up I'm a co-sponsor of the impeachment resolution well there you go well tell us tell us a little bit more about that well he's failed the country I mean if you hear him and Kamala Harris talk they say we have a secure border every American knows we don't have a secure border they see it on the Nightly News people coming across our border and uh he has failed the nation you know article 4 section 4 guarantees every state that joins a union a republican form of government and will protect them against invasion you look up the definition of invasion although Wikipedia is trying to change it invasion is movement of a large number of people from one space into another and our nation is being evaded and now because of the Biden policies of moving migrants into all the states midnight flights that we saw every State's a border state now so every state has been invaded by this unfettered um Crossing of our Southern border we're a Sovereign Nation we should have Sovereign borders and they should be protected and uh and the government under mayor mayorkas and under Biden have failed these states the fact that that's controversial just straight up border security it it boggles my mind that is that is also foundational to this country being a country first and foremost so I'm glad you have sponsored that that it's a resolution but mainly we've always been a country of immigrants right but you can go see where your ancestors come from because they came through New York and and we can go look at the list of people who came and so there's nothing wrong with people coming here but we have to know who they are we've always done that and leave Obama and Biden have both said you know we don't care who you are just come here we're not gonna we're not even gonna keep a roll of who you are we need to know who's coming to America we want you to come but we want to know who you are and we want to be able to say no to those who shouldn't be here I think Trent agrees with me Mandy and that we should address immigration policy in this country it shouldn't be amnesty but we should allow we need skilled workers we need skilled energy people and we should allow legal immigration expanded visas for folks that want to come here and work legally right that's the difference between Republicans and Democrats is that we believe in legal immigration we don't like an open border illegal immigration and no record of who's coming where they're going where they're residing and creates a lot of different problems for this nation yeah that's an important distinction the legal versus the illegal the illegals that are coming across the border it's not their best and brightest those folks are going through the legal means and we can we can in the past as you said Congressman Kelly and can continue to benefit from that as a country um now you bring up something accountability that has been missing in this Administration could you talk a little bit about your uh your committee roles and who you hope to bring up so you can shine a light on some of these decisions being made in the bad news yeah we're already starting that but uh you know I don't deal with Judiciary and US share uh share share the FBI jurisdiction I only deal with a counter-intel side but we're calling these folks in and making sure that they're not spying inward now unfortunately most of these hearings will be in a classified environment but I can tell you Mike Turner who's going to be the chairman of Intel and we we're going to bring these folks in and we're going to talk to them we're going to hold them accountable for targeting Americans I mean just like the rate on Trump I mean that was that was totally political in nature arresting the guy who is protesting to barely pushed down someone yet they've got people blowing up places and and there's no so we're going to get to oversight on both the FBI and all those organizations that are spying on them and even today Nancy Pelosi the video that was released she said she wanted to punch Trump so I mean it's crazy it's crazy yeah Trent's right there will be some classified stuff but Jim Jordan and Jamie Comer found Judiciary and oversight and governmental reform we'll have public hearings on the absolutely yeah and the doj and we're gonna get the bottom of the Mar-A-Lago and hopefully Crossfire hurricane issues that were targeting Trump with the dossier a lot of that should be revealed for the American Sunshine is good I'm glad y'all are going to be in charge of that coming to the next Congress thank you for your time thank you for your service Congressman Kelly Congressman Duncan for listeners we've got to take a quick break system in

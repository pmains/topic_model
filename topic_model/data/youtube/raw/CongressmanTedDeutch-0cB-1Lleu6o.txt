great uh jason thanks thanks very much good morning everyone uh thanks for joining this press conference last spring as the world was shut down by the coronavirus pandemic there were predictions that the dramatic decline in pollution and emissions could lead to permanent changes that may just save our planet from climate change well of course we now know that that's uh that did not prove to be the case the international energy agency estimates that after carbon dioxide emissions dropped globally in 2020 emissions quickly rebounded and were two percent higher in december 2020 compared to december 2019 the pandemic may have temporarily interrupted the scale of global carbon emissions but it didn't create the kind of lasting change that we need now there are plenty of proposals in congress to address climate change and encourage more sustainable practices i support many of them but we need a robust plan to cut carbon emissions if we want to have any chance of really saving the planet the energy innovation and carbon dividend plan is a market-based solution that will achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and drive the transition to cleaner energy sources it uses an aggressive fee schedule starting at 15 per metric ton of co2 and increasing uh 10 per year that'll get us a 95 reduction in harmful air pollutants by 2030 which is particularly important for the communities have long suffered the downside of pollution disproportionately low-income households and communities of color there's growing momentum in the house this congress we have 28 original co-sponsors including the four co-leads who will hear from shortly compare that to last congress when we had only six original co-sponsors the house select committee on the climate crisis's 2020 report laid out the benefits of a carbon fee policy stating that quote until the market reflects the true cost of carbon pollution the us economy will remain biased toward fossil fuel combustion close quote there's also support for a carbon fee in the bind administration treasury secretary yellen told the senate finance committee that and i quote again we cannot solve the climate crisis without effective carbon pricing the president supports an enforcement mechanism that requires polluters to bear the full cost of the carbon pollution they are emitting close quote the private sector is catching up too just a few few weeks ago the american petroleum institute endorsed an economy-wide price on carbon the most impactful policy for emissions reductions but what makes our plan different is the dividend recently the washington post editorial board urged congress to implement a carbon tax use the revenue to fund infrastructure projects but as i wrote in the letter to the editor carbon tax on its own is regressive and would burden poor and middle-class families by increasing gas and utility costs our plan returns 100 of the net revenue back to the american people as a monthly dividend payment and by 2030 that would amount to 1470 per adult per year the dividend program is crucial to ensure the cost isn't simply passed down to hard-working americans in fact it ensures that families could cover any higher energy costs and still have funds left over to support themselves particularly as our country recovers from the pandemic economy as i said climate change is complex there's no single solution but this plan will curb carbon emissions it will reduce pollution and it will help drive the transition to cleaner energy alternatives i call on my colleagues to support this effective plan to curb rising emissions and to address a major contributor to climate change and with that i am honored to turn over to my friend representative scott peters you've represented peter yeah i'm trying to get my video on uh jason can we check on uh representative peter's video there we go oh okay there we go thanks uh thanks ted and thanks to you and to uh representatives shu and chris and the other leading supporters of this critical bill for participating in today's call and thanks to everyone who's joined us um at the outset i want us i want to knock down a false argument you sometimes hear that um people people say that a carbon price is not enough look nobody argues that a price on carbon is a silver bullet that solves the problem on its own but a price on carbon is indispensable and has to be considered a central component of our national strategy to combat climate change putting a price on carbon sets an immediate monetary incentive for all americans individuals and industries alike to reduce the use of fossil fuels and reduce carbon emissions we can't save the planet without making every single person an actor in this crusade and placing a price on carbon provides that incentive some worry that a carbon tax is regressive but as congressman deutsch explained this bill that we introduced today returns revenues to americans pockets while curbing the adverse impacts of burning carbon this is the most progressive way to offset the cost of a carbon tax and is a game changer to drive the energy markets towards cleaner energy sources those of us who represented the united states at the u.n climate change conference cop 25 in madrid in 2019 heard this over and over again markets need clear price signals to transition to a low carbon economy why is that because a price on carbon incentivizes producers and consumers of carbon intensive goods without any further government action to use less fossil fuels and to substitute lower carbon alternatives and we need to get our own house of order on carbon pricing if we are to presume to tell the rest of the world how to behave on climate policy the energy innovation and carbon dividend act boasts wide outside support and is one of our most feasible climate strategies conservatives like senator mitt romney and the republican-led climate leadership council have publicly recognized the merits of carbon tax and dividend policies and as ted mentioned within the last couple of weeks the american petroleum institute endorsed a carbon an economy-wide price on carbon with this new openness to considering a carbon tax among industry and republicans it's irresponsible to dismiss the carbon tax because of any presumed political difficulties is exactly the opposite the price on carbon is essential if we're adequately to fight the climate crisis and compete in a global economy this bill is poised to reduce emissions empower markets to transition to a low carbon economy and immediately work to slow carb climate change now is our chance to harness the growing support across the political spectrum at one of our best shots at saving the planet and the energy innovation and carbon dividend act could very well be the bridge that gets us there cost of inaction is too great for our planet for our national economy and for our standing as a world leader so we hope we act on this bill today thank you now i'll turn it over to my colleague from california congressman judy chu thank you so much and i'm so glad to be here to celebrate the reintroduction of the energy innovation and carbon dividend act of 2021 i've been proud to be a co-sponsor and advocate for this crucial legislation since representative deutsch first introduced it in 2018 and i want to thank him for his continued leadership on this issue the cost of emitting greenhouse gases both for our own health and the planets has always been high and we paid that price in higher rates of respiratory problems more frequent storms devastating wildfires soaring temperatures and rising seas but while we suffer more and more of the consequences those responsible do not the energy innovation and carbon dividend act would fix that by ensuring that polluters pay a rising cost for their emissions driving down greenhouse gas pollution and returning those proceeds to taxpayers every month this is a progressive solution that ensures workers and families come out ahead while making our economy cleaner i'm also pleased that this year's version of the legislation meets the goals set by the select committee on the climate crisis last year when they recommended that the u.s adopt a carbon pricing system it's designed to meet our economy-wide emissions reductions targets and it creates a level playing field for american companies competing internationally ensuring that low and moderate income households come out ahead and it protects the epa's ability to regulate emissions and protect the most vulnerable environmental justice communities this belo this bill alone will not defeat the climate crisis but it promises to be one of our most powerful tools at our disposal as we work to rapidly remake our economy and lead the world in reducing emissions and i especially want to thank the passionate and knowledgeable local advocates who've pushed this legislation from a simple idea to a leading proposal in congress and i'm particularly proud of my pasadena foothills chapter of the citizens climate lobby which has worked closely with me for years to advance this bill the opportunity before us today is historic as we finally have a president and congress working together to advance creative and bold solutions to the climate crisis where we are urgently making up for lost time and we need legislation that ramps up quickly and sets aggressive yet achievable goals the energy innovation and carbon dividend act does just that and i look forward to what working to get it across the finish line this congress and now i'd like to turn it over to congress member charlie crist great thank you judy and thanks to my friend and colleague and fellow floridian congressman ted deutch for introducing this and for your leadership on this important bill ted and a big thank you to everyone for joining us here today i think i speak for all floridians when i say that the climate crisis is at the forefront of our minds in the sunshine state we feel the effects of climate change each and every day we're seeing hotter temperature more flooding increasingly dangerous hurricane seasons as well as rising sea florida is literally ground for the climate crisis and we need to act now to protect our beautiful state and all coastal communities reducing our nation's carbon dependency is key to winning the fight against climate change that was clear to me nearly 15 years ago when i hosted florida's first national climate summit and sought to limit emissions as governor along with governor schwarzenegger of california and robert f kennedy jr but it's even more clear today continued inaction will be catastrophic to our environment our economy and the well-being of all americans that's why i'm proud to once again take this historic action by joining my colleagues on this call to reintroduce legislation that will tackle one of the biggest contributors to climate change the energy innovation and carbon dividend act is common sense legislation that puts a price on carbon emissions makes polluters pay and turns around and gives that money right back to the american people where it belongs allowing our country to take effective steps towards curbing carbon emissions and putting money into the pockets of floridians and americans is a win-win for everybody especially during a pandemic when so many americans have struggled to make ends meet without this legislation americans will continue to pay the price of the climate crisis including more severe storms and other natural disasters that will wreak havoc in the places we call home this is an opportunity for us to do right by our environment and be good stewards of the planet we have been blessed with thank you all please stay safe and god bless uh thank thank you charlie um and uh next it's my pleasure to introduce madeline parra from citizens climate lobby uh for some comments that she'd like to make great thank you and hi everybody i'm madeline parra president of citizens climate lobby and citizens climate lobby is a national grassroots climate organization with more than 180 000 supporters organized in over 450 u.s chapters first of course i want to thank the co-sponsors of the energy innovation and carbon dividend act who are here on this call as well as the 25 other co-sponsors who put this legislation forward we at citizens climate lobby are excited to see momentum building for this policy which we see as a critical step to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and stopping climate change we applaud these members of congress for meeting the moment and responding to their constituents during the last congress our volunteers held 2896 lobby meetings with congressional offices to ask for big bold climate solutions more than 1 000 of those were virtual as we continued our advocacy even during the pandemic today representative deutsch and his colleagues are showing how democracy should work they're being responsive to their constituents and confronting the big problem of climate change head-on since this bill's original introduction citizens climate lobby volunteers have been spreading the word about it and building support for it in communities across the country they've generated endorsements from 1003 local businesses 140 faith groups 135 local governments and 743 prominent individuals in their communities including the local elected officials church leaders business owners and more and that work continues we're eager to help advance this legislation by continuing to build even more support and momentum for it later this year we'll be back on capitol hill in person to encourage additional members of congress to step up and co-sponsor the legislation our volunteers are already reaching out in their communities with the good news of this bill's reintroduction and we'll continue to seek new endorsements it's exciting to do all of this work because the policy is such a meaningful one it will put america on the path to a clean energy economy in a way that protects regular americans through the transition so thank you again to the members here today and your colleagues for the courage and leadership that you've shown in introducing this important bill uh thank you madeline and and thanks to all of the grassroots activists from citizen climate citizens from the lobby around the country uh who have engaged on this issue from the beginning we're really grateful uh next it's my pleasure to introduce dr jessica morman from the evangelical environmental network uh dr morgan please well good morning again my name is dr jessica moorman senior director for science and policy at the evangelical environmental network we represent over 3 million pro-life christians who have taken action with us over the last five years calling for action on the climate and pollution crises at ian we are grounded and guided by scripture and informed by science in our mission to ensure every child has the hope and expectation of a stable climate and a healthy pollution-free world to grow and thrive in i want to thank representative deutsch for his continued leadership advancing market-based solutions and fiscally responsible solutions to the climate crisis we thank him and the other co-sponsors for introducing the energy innovation and carbon dividend act this is a solution that will deliver real results on reducing carbon pollution all without place all without placing undue burden on low income and working class families hit hard by the pandemic as evangelical christians we are called in scripture to be good stewards of god's creation to love our neighbors as ourselves and to serve the most vulnerable and overlooked in society in the 21st century fulfilling our christian witness and mission must include acting on human cause climate change that is fueling the extreme weather that we are already seeing devastate our families businesses and communities across america and to reduce the burden of fossil fuel pollution that prematurely takes the lives of hundreds of thousands of americans each year that includes our children both born and unborn caring for creation and acting on climate change truly is a matter of life and if we don't take the full into full account the full costs of carbon pollution we will continue to subsidize dirty energy with the health and lives of americans especially the most vulnerable that the bible specifically calls us to defend that is why at en we applaud representative deutsch and his co-sponsors for reintroducing this important bill we support this and other market-based carbon fee proposals that correct this critical market failure that finally take into account carbon pollution's detrimental costs to our health and the environment we're especially pleased with this bill because it's not only an effective plan for advancing a clean energy transition that will reduce carbon pollution to levels needed to avoid widespread dangerous climate change but most importantly because it protects and safeguards low income and middle class americans from price increases the poor and middle class should not shoulder the burden of creating a healthy and clean energy system in the u.s and creating the clean and healthy future that our children deserve and this and bill this bill ensures that they will not carry that cost we also applaud the bill for ensuring that american businesses stay competitive on the world stage by making sure the playing field is level by imposing border carbon adjustments on goods and materials imported from other nations that don't include have these similar market corrections for carbon pollution so we look forward to working with representative deutsch and the bill's sponsors as it goes through the legislative process and to make sure that proposals that put a price on carbon like the energy innovation and carbon dividend act are both a cost-effective solution to the climate and pollution crises that can catalyze the deployment of clean energy infrastructure and also give our children that bright and healthy future that they deserve thank you uh thank you dr mormon uh and uh thanks again uh madeline thanks to my colleagues representative peters representative chu and representative chris and just quickly before we turn it over uh before i turn it back to jason to uh to guide us through questions um i just wanted to take a moment i want to do this at the start but let me just take a moment now to acknowledge the uh the passing of our colleague elsie hastings um alcy was as all of us know was a fighter for so many things that he believed in and as charlie referenced um alcy understood the importance of a beautiful florida and the threat that climate change posed and uh and as we as we remember him for so many things let's remember him for his efforts to to fight climate change and to preserve the beauty that we have here in florida and uh and in our world um jason i will turn it back to you thank you our first question comes from brian dabbs in the national journal uh hi can you all hear me yes uh and so sorry to hear about uh representative hastings i always really enjoyed speaking with him and that's devastating news um but uh on a on this topic uh thank you very much for for hosting this um representative deutsch can you talk about why you chose to nix the clean air regulatory suspension um and do you think you can garner republican support or industry support for the legislation as is sure so on um on your second point the bill was originally drafted with a group of republicans that we consulted with with economists to ensure that the uh the price levels on carbon would be high enough to encourage a transition but not so high as it would stop economic growth as dr mormon pointed out uh we have been in discussions with several republicans about the legislation they haven't yet signed on as co-sponsors but we couldn't wait to reintroduce the bill the administration congress have been discussing climate change policy we believe that carbon fees have to be a part of those conversations so we'll continue talking to our republican colleagues we had republican co-sponsors in the past and i'm confident we will again as to uh the moratorium the bill you're you're right the bill no longer contains the provisions that put this regulatory moratorium on clean air act provisions um we had done that in the past and it was designed to protect businesses from double jeopardy of both carbon fees and regulations on carbon emissions but it had a backup that would permit the epa to step in if the emission reduction goals weren't being achieved we took that out now because of the changes that we've seen the business community has moved forward on this issue they've determined they can operate with uh with carbon fees with and with targeted regulations so many businesses already include the price of carbon in their uh internal numbers uh businesses have been adopting these fees as part of their future business plans so it's necessary for us to move forward so this is just a reflection i think of where we are um at this moment and i i don't know if any of my colleagues have comments on that as well jason our next question comes from josh diego with the washington examiner hi thanks for taking my question i am i'm wondering i know you said that you did cite you know janet yellen saying that she's for carbon price you know john kerry has mentioned that but you know gina mccarthy the white house climate advisor last week did a a call with the press and she made clear that president biden prefers a clean electricity standard that was included as part of his infrastructure proposal so my question for you is are you prepared to oppose the infrastructure package if as is it goes with the clean electricity standard as the main vehicle to reduce emissions uh over a carbon price is that i mean you know with your amount of co-sponsors you would have the ability to you know given the slim margins of democrats in the house to to stop this bill if you thought that a carbon price should be a part of it a lot of people actually think that carbon price is more of a natural fit for infrastructure and and you know easily done through reconciliation um well the reason that we're the reason we've reintroduced this the reason that we're having this this discussion now is to make sure that the a price on carbon is a part of these conversations i i familiar with the comments that you refer to i also know as as i referred in my earlier comments to uh senior officials in the administration who um who have acknowledged that a price on carbon is important here so we're at the at the early stages i think it's premature to talk about what uh what where we're ultimately going to go we believe strongly that this is that this needs to be a part of the plan to change behavior and and to help us make this take the significant steps that are necessary for us to dramatically reduce carbon emissions and i think this works well with the president's plans which again we look forward to to ongoing discussions to ensure that that we can continue to to have this as part of those of those discussions and ultimately we hope is part of the plan comment of course um i i am i'm also very conscious that president biden has been careful to say that we're at the early stages he welcomes our input and he expects the plan to change for my own part i've indicated that i can't imagine a climate policy portfolio that could be effective without including a price on carbon and i've told them that that's a priority for me personally what's that i told them i told my i told the administration that they asked what my priorities were this is this is um this is one that i named that i didn't see and i told them that that was a concern to me but would do sorry all right our next question comes from mitch perry with baynews9 mitch are you there sorry all right i'm sorry the question actually was already asked i was gonna ask congressman deutsch about getting gop support he has talked about working on that i know you had francis rooney from naples as a co-sponsor on this a couple of years ago how important is that for you to get that well obviously um given the the broad support for uh for a carbon fee throughout i mean throughout the country from environmental groups and and and religious groups and business leaders senior administration officials we wanted to move forward so that this would be a part of the conversation as i said before it doesn't preclude us from stopping the ongoing efforts to to bring uh republicans into this they they're hearing the same thing from citizens climate lobby they're hearing the same thing from dr mormont's groups they're hearing the same thing from environmental groups and from business leaders in their communities and across the country that this is an indispensable part of a serious effort to combat climate change so we're confident ultimately there will be republicans who step up to support this effort thank you our next question is from emily meredith from energy intelligence hi i was just wondering this is in line with the question on the um clean energy standard but if you could talk a little bit about you know in the clean future act there's a proposal for clean energy standard that's backed by a carbon fee um and i i understand that's different but if you could talk a little bit you know about precisely why you prefer the upfront carbon tax versus an energy standard backed by a carbon fee that would be really helpful well we i'll just i'll i'll offer just a word and then my colleagues want to jump in that the idea that the importance of of of the carbon fee is first certainty we don't know that the extent we don't know what the standards look like um we know from the research what the carbon fee what what impact the carbon fee will have the revenue that it will raise our ability to refund that revenue directly to american taxpayers and and how it will change behavior so there is a certainty here that um that that makes this particularly appealing but i'll i'm happy to refer to judy charlie scott if you have comments i'll just say um you know it there's not necessarily an inconsistency between the two a lot of it is in the details of how how you um you work them out california we in california we do have a carbon pricing system it's a cap and trade it's not a fee standard we think they go pretty well together so again we're at the early stages we're encouraged by the biden's um outreach for ideas this is one that's obviously very important to us and i think we can figure out a way to make it work jason yep our next question comes from antonio friends with the palm beach post thanks for taking the question so while this debate goes on um you do have a lot of grassroots effort to try to address cleaner energy in fact here in palm beach county there's yet another new solar co-op um that's uh signing up customers uh so does this at all directly or indirectly bolster any of these grassroots efforts making it more cost effective does it help them in any way well ultimately tell you if we uh if we put a price on carbon the i the idea is to ultimately change behavior uh it's going to make those sorts of of uh cleaner alternatives uh more appealing so um yes there will be a a direct a direct link between um what we're doing here and what also what customers want what consumers want which is to look for these opportunities to take their own actions to impact climate change through alternative forms of energy okay is there are there any other reporters that wish to ask a question nothing congressman deutsch i think we're ready to wrap up um great well i am i'm really grateful to my colleagues for joining and madeline dr morman we're we're grateful for your support of these efforts uh this is as as i said before this is uh just the the start of what is a really important and exciting conversation about a serious step that we can take to to reduce carbon emissions so that america can lead toward the protection of our planet and um and we'll look forward to continuing this with our other colleagues and and with so many of of uh so many other groups around the country uh any anyone else want to offer anything else before we close charlie i just want to thank you again for your leadership and and everything that you're doing uh and as well as our other colleagues on on the line um it's such an important issue you know we're dealing with a difficult situation in tampa bay right now with this piney point disaster and you know this falls into that category of doing what's right for the environment and protecting florida and america and preserving a bright future for for all americans and for our world so god bless you ted thank you so much uh thank you charlie and uh thanks scott thanks judy uh madeleine dr mormon and we'll see everyone soon thanks again thank you ted thanks

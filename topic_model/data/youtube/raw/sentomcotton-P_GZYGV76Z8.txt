Senator Tom Cotton author of the upcoming book Only the Strong with us now and Center welcome back good morning to you that last night yeah that Aisha was reporting there about the Wall Street Journal asking to delay the decision for another month the answer a resounding no do you know about this before I didn't know about it but I can believe it because the Democrats will do anything to try to keep gas from increasing before the election but remember it he didn't ask the Saudis not to cut production he only asked them to wait for a month until after the election because the official stated policy of Joe Biden on the campaign Trail and since he's been in office to do everything he can to hurt fossil fuel production here and around the world which is driving up Energy prices there's two simple reasons for what's happened uh with this OPEC decision and our relationship with Saudi Arabia and our dependency increasing dependency on foreign oil again one Joe Biden has waged a war on American oil production if we would just produce more here we wouldn't have to depend on anyone overseas but two Joe Biden and Barack Obama in the Democratic party have waged a campaign to ostracize and marginalize and alienate Saudi Arabia going back 13 years by coddling Iran and appeasing our mortal enemy you know Ronald Reagan in the 1980s was able to to enlist Saudi Arabia to keep oil prices low which devastated Soviet Russia's economy why can't Joe Biden do that with the Saudis to Putin's Russia it's because they've waged this campaign against our longtime friend Saudi Arabia in favor of our longtime adversary Iran that's exactly the kind of short-sighted foreign policy that I explain in Only the Strong so I've been reading only this wrong thank you for helping me get an early copy of it it's really interesting about how this is how history has played out and when you look back at some of the decisions that this Administration made like on the first day regarding energy and Keystone Pipeline in particular I'm reminded of this group of energy workers we talked to and I believe they were many of them I think were from Arkansas and they used to be able to go and they would travel they might work for six months on a project and come back all those all those jobs dried up and I happen to imagine that a lot of energy workers are just bewildered and demoralized today thinking how could it be that the answer to this is to punish the Saudis and regardless of the merits of that but not open up American oil for production and distribution here what are you hearing from actual like the people the workers who would actually do this kind of thing for us well that's exactly right Dana we had a lot of workers in Arkansas who are affected by Joe Biden's day one decisions to shut down the Keystone Pipeline and several other actions designed to hamstring American oil and gas production they lost their jobs now they're paying four dollars a gallon for gas electricity bill or heating bills are going to go up this winter because of Joe Biden's energy policies yet he's going hand in hand to dictatorships like Venezuela pleading with them to produce more oil at the same time that he's alienating long-time Partners in places like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates by continuing to cuddle and appease Iran and what is this latest this latest temper tantrum by the Democrats going to do it simply encourages the Iranians to shoot more missiles via their proxies at Saudi Arabia's oil production facilities or the Emirates oil production facilities or even attack tankers and shipping lanes in the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea by suggesting that Joe Biden will simply stand on the sideline if our partners in the Middle East are attacked by Iran and its proxies it's not only dangerous it's very bad for America American families budgets Senator thank you for your time good luck with the book Only the Strong Senator see you soon thank you America

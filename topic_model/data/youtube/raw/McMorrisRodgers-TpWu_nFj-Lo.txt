thank you madam chair and ranking member and the committee for your commitment to this project I want to thank dr. Fischer for travelling to represent man Grandstaff dr. Fischer thank you for your leadership your advocacy for the interest of veterans in eastern Washington I've heard a lot of positive about your leadership and appreciate you taking on this project dr. stone I want to thank you for appearing here today and your commitment at this critical time and the electronic health records modernization I want to pick up on some issues of staffing that I asked about a previous hearing I want to make sure that your commitment to quote flood man Grandstaff with resources to cushion the Cerner rollout is being carried out so first how many travel nurses do you have on site now and how many are you hoping to get ma'am we have 24 traveling nurses on site but since we've had a delay in go-live they will likely be packing up here pretty soon and we'll bring them back out in June that's the current plan and so that whole cycle will be repeated thank you how many physicians have you added either from the clinical resource hub or reassigned from other medical centers and how many do you hope to add I don't have that breakdown today but I'm happy to forward that to you we have hired over 50 of our 108 mitigation personnel and we anticipate to be 90 percent healthy with this delaying goal I've an added benefit of slowing this train down a bit so I just heard I was going to ask about the additional permanent staff that goal was a hundred and eight and you just said that's correct ma'am and you're at 50 we're at 50 54 and several have had an offer we're just waiting to onboard them but I'm told by June by our HR department we'll be at about 90 percent strength by the time we go live okay so the additional permanent staff that you need you believe that will be in place by July 2020 we anticipate 90 percent some of the physician positions are extremely difficult to recruit under any circumstances I'm optimistic as I was the last time I sat here but we will likely not reach 100% and we never really anticipated we'd all of those recruitments but over 90% as from my perspective is healthy okay given the delay of the initial rollout from March to July are we going to be able to keep all these employees some of whom are temporary when they're needed most the answer would be yes because they're permanent hires our hope is that once we reach steady state we might find an excess in which case we will allow them to @rit but in the short to medium term as long as we need them the permanent hires are permanent and we would treat them when they were ready to move or they underwent an adverse action hopefully that would not be the case okay thank you dr. or mr. case cited in his testimony a backlog of 21,000 155 requests for community care at the Medical Center yes I'm perhaps this doesn't surprise me I understand one of secretary Wilkie's reasons for delaying the Cerner go-live was that the functionality to process Community Care is not ready for primetime yet with the additional time and staff you have and will have how are you going to walk through this backlog and make Community Care available to the veterans who want it so just for clarification ma'am the backlog is now I think down around 17,000 that's not to say that the care has not been rendered we simply have not administrative Lee close those consults through a combination of overtime and compensation time as well as leveraging those travel nurses I am told by the end of April we will have completely resolved that backlog furthermore I've asked our vision for additional personnel in order to support the Office of Community care so that we don't reach that crossroads again I would say that in the last two years I've increased the personnel in the Office of Community Care by 48 percent this next bump will represent a substantial increase as well but the reality is we're purchasing more care and it takes more staff to support that care okay mr. Casey would you respond to just where you where you believe we are in the process the in reducing the backlog they're gonna train people to adopt to the new scheduling a community care that may be more complicated but it's also going to require there's going to be more demand as the anticipation of a mitigation okay mr. Fisher would you also address where we are with the new cookie you know that the issue of only having 31% of computers and 51% of new medical devices not being received yet my understanding is that all the computers have been distributed to my staff bio medical advice devices are continuing to be distributed as well I would defer to mr. Wyndham when the technical aspects of where precisely we are with biomedical devices I have a new computer it's in my bag and soda every single staff member have a new and improved with greater RAM and and we're good to go with respect to were computers okay my my time is expired I do have further questions that I'll submit for the record and appreciate all of your attention to getting this right and getting it done as soon as possible thanks thank you move

[Music] well we all continue to watch uh with a lot of concern as these events unfold obviously uh this war has not gone anyway uh near uh as putin had intended for it to go he thought this was to be a cakewalk and candidly i think a lot of nato and other parts of the world have been very surprised at the resistance that the ukrainians have been able to put up uh zielinski has done a great job of of rallying his folks and uh you know unfortunately we did not have the weapons in there that he needed to support the cause early enough ukrainians have held back the russians for four weeks now what new phase are we entering here i just think we're in a long and drawn out siege campaign and i think that the the more we can provide continue to provide the shoulder-fired missiles and and sophisticated surface-to-air missiles it will prevent putin from gaining air superiority over the country which i think has has really helped the ukrainian cause to this point because he doesn't have air superiority a lot of the soviet fighter the russian fighters are having to launch weapons from inside russian airspace into ukraine that's also why i'm not a fan of uh necessarily supplying them with migs um you know the polish migs not only are they not the the frontline capable fighters that the russians have so i think they'd be at a disadvantage but in many cases the weapons that the russian fighters are launching are not even being launched from ukrainian airspace the reason the russian fighters aren't coming into ukraine is because they're getting shot down by surface-to-air missiles so i think that's a more effective way for us to support them and congressman what do you make of china's implied support of russia throughout all this yeah china's in a very uh tricky situation here and i think you know we're watching this very carefully i don't think china wants to be considered uh partnered at the hip with russia on this they know how bad it looks on the world stage uh the chinese depend on a lot of things from other parts of the world we get a lot of our uh you know our cheap goods from china but they also get a lot of their food and other things necessary to to feed and clothe their society from from outside of their borders and the last thing that they want to do is become broad brush with russia as being bad actors so i think they're walking a delicate line and we're watching very closely the extent of real support they provide them you

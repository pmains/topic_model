we'll make this as painless as possible okay good that's a warning yeah got it all right so here's the deal we've got thirty four metric tons of weapons-grade plutonium at savannah river site that will be converted from weapons-grade material to commercial grade nuclear fuel we're taking swords to plowshares that's pretty good right 1700 warheads will be disposed of forever do you agree with that Miss Miller he did i do agree and we have an agreement with the Russians for they will do the they will dispose of thirty four metric tons that's right that's correct so this is a good thing it's been going on since the 90s now we've been studying since the 90s how to dispose of the plutonium and direct disposition would be a violation of agreement do you agree with that it would be a violation of the agreement yeah because you could reconstitute it we want to make sure that no one can ever use this stuff for weapons material again so we chose mocks disposition is that correct yes and we have an agreement with the Russians signed in 2010 or will say we will put the 34 tons through the Mach system to current in it turn it into commercial grade fuel is that correct yes okay and part of that machs plan was to build three facilities at savannah river site one for Peedi cf14 waste and the other the box is that correct that was the plan okay and because we're such good stewards the taxpayer dollars and we're so creative and y'all did a good job here I know yep we found a way to save two billion dollars but not building the PTB p DCF facilities that correct we hope it will be that much yeah so we think it would be two billion dollars we don't have to build a third facility now an environmental impact study was done when we're talking about the pp DCF facility and if you went down the vitrification route turning all this into glass that study said you'd have to bring in high-level ways from somewhere to make this work do you remember that I do not there is high-level wasted Savannah River already that's being vitrified as I know yeah well the study says you'd have to bring some in for Hanford to make this work and the study also said that the current vitrification facility could not process thirty four metric tons of plutonium you'd have to build a new facility and it would be in violation of the agreement with Russians so my state madam chairman years ago accepted thirty four metric tons of plutonium with the promised we would dispose of in a way to make the world safer create jobs in South Carolina and Georgia and at the end of the day not be stuck with this stuff so we're halfway through building the monks facility and I want to compliment the Obama administration you're the first people they were actually build anything we've been talking about it forever now we've got about a two billion dollar cost overrun is that correct oh no it's much larger than two billion dollars it's huge are you sure well the estimate a year ago was that the cost to come the full cost of construction would be about four billion dollars we are now entertaining a baseline change proposal from the contractor for nearly eight billion dollars oh my goodness is that right the last numbers we were given around six let's say is let's say it's a weird we're saying six yeah yeah but let's just let's let's just live on the edge here I think the contractor is hoping they can save money they're now talking on what they might do but that's there's no proposal to us for it right well we can we can pretty well assure you we can get this thing down to 66.2 I think and I want to save money but one thing I will not accept is breaking the agreement with the Russians and coming up with an alternative that is going to cost more and take longer can you think of any other way to do this that would keep this program on schedule other than mocks I cannot but i am not a technical person so i could okay i didn't begin to put yes ma'am and that's an honest answer i can tell you they've studied this since 1995 you can't do direct disposition vitrification is the only other alternative you'd have to build a new facility it costs a lot more than four billion so i think the goal here is to reduce the cost by talking to the contractor and I just talked to Dennis McDonough and I am willing to do that I think your concerns about cost overruns are correct but in the budget you have stopped out your construction and that is an absolutely non-starter for me and the program we've got to get this stuff off the market and we can't keep playing games for the people of South Carolina and Georgia so madam chairman what i will do is work with the NNSA of reducing costs to the program that we've committed to that we've signed up with Russians to get this thing get this stuff done and there is a possibility now I know my times up that the British have plutonium weapons-grade plutonium they don't know what to do with if we could ever get mocks up and running and we can we got to have a customer for the disposition maybe we could do something with a British where we could take their weapons grade plutonium get it off the market can never be used for bombs again and they could have pay for this thing so I'm definitely thinking outside the box I've just talked to the White House I've got to hold on Germany's the nominee he's a fine man be a great Secretary but this is an unacceptable alternative to stop this program in the middle when there is no other plan i am confident there is no the plan we can lower costs but we can't find a new way to do this in terms of cost and time witness so thank you for your time I look forward to keep working with you miss Miller thank you

thank you madam Speaker and I appreciate my friend from Utah and doing that and I'm glad we could keep this photograph up there here's how I got involved and engaged in this very personal actually the man who took this photograph David Young is a constituent and a friend of mine back from West Michigan he was actually part of a project that went out to try then to photograph all the remaining World War one survivors traveled to europe travel to australia and then had met frank buckles along the way and had gotten to know him very well i unfortunately was not able to meet him in person but attended his funeral at arlington where we where we said goodbye as a nation and i can tell you that it was his desire it was Frank's desire David's desire his family's desire my desire and I think now finally this body's desire to properly say thank you the other reason why this is very personal and very important to me as I get to talk about a man named bill Huizenga not me bill Huizenga but my grandfather bill Huizenga who happened to fight in World War one he was part of a group called the polar bears men who were chosen from Wisconsin Minnesota and Michigan because they figured they'd be used to the cold and they sent them all the way up around Norway to Archangel Archangel Russia to fight an undeclared portion of world war one in fact the grandpa grandpa bill was there after Armistice Day we're British Canadian and American troops remained well into the summer of that following year into that spring of the following year after armistice and it wasn't until much much later that we were actually even officially recognized as being part of that but i can tell you hang one of my prized possessions is my grandfather's old Doughboy helmet that hangs in our hands in our family's home and it's just a fitting timely thing that we finally say thank you we finally recognize this group of men who fought a terrible war who fought a war that so many had hoped would be the war to end all wars and unfortunately we know that is a the case but I'd like to commend our friends across the aisle the the gentlelady from from the district and the gentleman from Missouri for working on this and led by my friend from Texas mr. Poe to get this done this is an important statement for us and a fitting tribute to that generation and Frank we thank you for your service and for all those families and I yield back

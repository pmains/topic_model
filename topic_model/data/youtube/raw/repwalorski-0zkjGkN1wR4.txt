Thank You mr. Speaker I rise in support of HR 631 1 the increasing access to lower premium plans and expanding health savings accounts Act this important bill contains a two-year delay of the health insurance tax or hit like the medical device tax which the House voted yesterday to repeal the hit is yet another damaging tax from Obamacare it raises premiums for families for small businesses and seniors and the disabled enrolled in Medicare Advantage in fact the hit could raise annual premiums for the typical Medicare Advantage couple by $500 if it returns in 2020 I'm a proud original co-sponsor with representatives gnome cinema and Bera of HR 59 63 which delays the hit for two years and I'm thrilled this bill we're voting for today includes it I look forward to the day when we can finally repeal this tax that falls on the backs of seniors the disabled small businesses and hardworking families but until then I urge my colleagues to support delaying it and I yield back

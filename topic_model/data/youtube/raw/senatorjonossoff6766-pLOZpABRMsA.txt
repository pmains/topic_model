next week will be the first anniversary of the shooting death of brianna taylor a young woman who died when police officers in louisville kentucky entered her home with a battering ram executing a no knock search warrant connected to a narcotics investigation ms taylor was not the subject of that warrant there's obviously been deepening and grave concern about equal justice due process the extent of uh brutality harassment discrimination faced by black americans in the criminal justice system growing over the last year given incidents such as this one without commenting on the specifics of the late ms taylor's case is the fbi prioritizing investigations of cases involving color of law violations under 18 usc 242 and what resources have you instructed your field offices to commit to those investigations so as you say i can't discuss the taylor case specifically we have an ongoing federal investigation there but uh we are definitely trying to uh push forward on color of law cases we have we do that through our civil rights division within our criminal investigative division we are in addition to the investigations we're pursuing and we have quite quite a number around the country we're also trying to contribute by doing different forms of training and outreach to state and local police departments so they understand better kind of where the where the lines are and where we fit into it so that's that's a you know part of it as well uh we're also trying to contribute to uh to the situation by encouraging better reporting and we've had a lot of conversations this morning in other contexts about statistics and reporting and when it comes to use of force we are trying to build out a use of force database that involves use of force by police departments law enforcement agencies around the country it's voluntary we can't mandate all these local police departments provide the information but we are doing a lot to encourage them to submit their data and my pitch to them has been we're going to be talking about these issues uh no matter what and we should all want the conversations to be based on the actual facts and the actual data as opposed to what some random person thinks the facts or data are and so we've we're out now reached one of the thresholds where we can start doing some of the reporting related to this effort we need to get to a certain threshold statistically uh i think it's like 80 percent or something of police departments before the data is is considered statistically reliable but so investigations training and outreach more complete statistical reporting on use of force thank you director ray i know the committee is considering legislation to make that data more available to you from local agencies and will you provide to the committee and to my office an accounting of the fbi's investigations over the last two years colorful law violations title 18 usc 242 happy to see if we can provide you some more information on that okay look forward to that

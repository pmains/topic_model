I thank the gentleman from California for organizing this hour and I appreciate the eloquence of our colleague from New York both of whom have addressed the most important issue of the day in fact the last eight day says mr. Garamendi has articulated we find ourselves dealing with the issue du jour each day the goalpost move each day the American public sits in utter amazement and discussed with its elective representatives it is astounding to them to see the greatest nation in the world brought to its knees you know our forefathers were very prescient and certainly George Washington who Daniel Webster the senator from Massachusetts in this chamber well actually it would have been down the hall got up on the 100th anniversary of george washington's birth and talked about the president's admonitions amongst his keenest admonitions was about that of excessive party spirit now in Washington's day there weren't political parties as we know him wasn't Democrat a Republican was Federalists or anti federalists but he knew very well and was concerned deeply about what factions could do and he warned about the outside influence of party but what he was most concerned about is that what happens within a government if people in that very government or are at war with their own existence are working against the interest of the government and therefore the people and so we find ourselves this evening as members of the minority coming to this floor and asking for one simple from the majority and that is a vote now we understand that we have asked for votes on this floor we've asked for votes to put the country back to work as the gentleman from California has articulated on many occasions to come here and talk about making things in America and allowing a vote to put us back to work we've been denied that opportunity we've been denied the opportunity here to vote on nutrition and funding in making sure that important bills like the agriculture bill that the very poor amongst us at the very needy are fed we've been denied an opportunity to vote on immigration as you heard Charlie Rangel talk about so nobly earlier this evening and we've also most importantly been denied a vote here that is fundamental to our democracy the most fundamental thing and the most patriotic thing that we do in a society is vote and yet here because of the tyranny of the majority 200 plus Democrats are not allowed a vote more importantly the American people are not allowed a vote on the continuing of its government and as the gentleman from New York pointed out not only is it the continuation and shutdown of government but on the near horizon defaulting on the Full Faith and Credit of the American this is unconscionable but Washington was prescient when a few dangerously are at war with their own government who seek to bring that government down who seek to bring the government down through a shutdown and then by not paying the bills that this body and the other body have racked up the greatest nation on the face of the earth we need to be able to express the will of the people all we ask of the majority party is for a vote a simple vote as the gentleman from New York said on a continuing resolution unencumbered and does nothing more and at the levels that they have requested but put the nation back to work and then respond quickly to the need to pay our debts without being held hostage you are not holding Barack Obama hostage mr. speaker you are not holding the Democrats in Congress hostage mr. speaker you are holding the people of the United States hostage in the sake of fairness and being responsible bring the bill to the floor for a vote allow the minority the opportunity to the vote if

I want to begin by saying how much my heart aches for the family of George Floyd and for our country right now there is no place in our society for police brutality nor is there for the violence and destruction that we've seen in some cities but even as Americans are exercising their right to protest peacefully we see countless others being denied their right to gather at a church or synagogue to pray for peace and justice and understanding I think this is inexcusable at a time when our nation needs prayers for unity and healing I call on every mayor and governor right now who are still barring the faithful from gathering to reverse course immediately and open up our churches that's what this nation needs every single state needs to have access to their churches the corona virus pandemic has affected the whole world and there's no question its impact has been disproportionate in some populations for instance mr. Roy you released research last week and you just spoke about this that showed nursing home residents make up 0.6 percent of the US population but account for an incredible 42% of all coronavirus deaths those with underlying condition conditions such as diabetes hypertension obesity and asthma are also a higher risk for complications or even death from coronavirus and we know that African Americans are more likely to have many of these conditions so on this point in particular there's no simple solutions or instant fixes but we have to start somewhere such as exploring ways to improve social determinants of health the conditions in which someone's social and economic environment shapes their health I'm a proud co-sponsor of the bipartisan social determinants accelerator act which would help states and communities better leverage existing programs and authorities to improve the health and well-being of Medicaid participants it would also provide planning grants and technical assistance to help state local and tribal governments take innovative evidence-based approaches to coordinate services and improve outcomes economic opportunity plays a major role so I think Opportunity Zones that were created under the tax cuts and Jobs Act can help incentive public private investments in distressed communities but most immediately we need to continue to open reopen and reopen and defeat coronavirus safely reopening business doesn't just put money in people's pockets it boosts their wealth and their well-being joblessness is known to have negative effects on mental health and indeed many health experts have predicted that prolonging these lock downs could result in a wide range of problems such as increased suicide substance abuse mental health mr. Roy do you agree that the financial effects coupled with isolation due to these lock downs have affected physical and mental health of minority communities yes and mr. filarsky if I could emphasize one particular point which is social determinants of health we're talking about that a lot today the most important social determinants of health in terms of correlation with health outcomes other than income is educational attainment and what have we done we've shut down the schools even though children are at literally a one-in-a-million rate of death from kovat 19 now we obviously have to protect their parents and their grandparents and elderly teachers and we have to be careful about how we reopen schools and strategic but it can be done this is we're doing it in Florida we're doing it in Texas it's working we're doing it in Europe so reopening schools is absolutely essential and the longer schools are closed the worse racial disparities will become it will become in all sorts of dimensions yeah could you just elaborate on that a little bit doctor I totally agree is there anything else that you see in this wide spectrum of reinvigorating economies other than schools what else can you see that will just reinvigorate these communities well the two things I mentioned in my written statement I mentioned schools and the other one I'll mention is hourly workers right people who are on hourly wage hourly wage earners they're disproportionately low income disproportionately minority their hours their jobs have been cut by 50 to 70 percent it's far worse in lockdown states and localities and I find I cite some of that research in my written statement thank you very much and mr. Chairman I yield back thank you

stated purpose is to regulate and supervise the offering and provision of consumer financial products or services under the federal consumer financial laws however prior to its inception when it was still but an idea of one harvard academic the proposed bureau was already compared to an existing agency known as the consumer product safety commission or the cpsc as the original architect of the bureau elizabeth warren stated just as a consumer product safety commission protects buyers of goods and supports a competitive market we need the same for consumers of financial products a new regulatory regime and even a new regulatory body to protect consumers who use credit cards home mortgages car loans and a host of other products however the vision proposed was for an agency very different than the cpsc while the cpsc has three commissioners the bureau has a single director structure and while the cpsc is subject to the congressional appropriations process and the omb budget process which our witness today is very familiar with the bureau is not in the end the single director can disregard advice and manage as he or she wishes he has or she has little accountability to the administration and even less to congress his or her budget is secure as a result it should come as no surprise that the bureau has operated with less transparency and less concern for fiscal discipline than is appropriate for a steward of taxpayer funds the bureau need not listen to basic advice from the office of management and budget for example on may 31st of this year omb issued a con a controller alert related to conference spending by agencies over which the omb has jurisdiction given the waste and abuse at gsa gsa and irs conferences this was the least we could hope for however based on dodd-frank the bureau can simply ignore this controller alert as a result of this lack of accountability certain expenditures have been called into question such as the 55 million dollars that has been set aside for renovating the cfpb headquarters building just steps from the white house incidentally that number 55 million is more than the entire annual construction and acquisition budget for gsa for the totality of federal buildings the bureau has also refused to participate in the office of personnel management's employee viewpoint survey despite its auditor's specific recommendations that the bureau joined the opm survey which 98 percent of executive agencies participate in the bureau's instead decided to do its own by taking this action the bureau avoided being ranked alongside the other 98 percent of federal agencies that do participate nonetheless bureau's in-house employee survey revealed significant concerns regarding the management of the bureau staff the survey provided that only 35.6 percent of employees agree that the bureau takes steps to quote deal with a poor performer who cannot or will not improve end quote so only one third of the staff of the bureau believe that the bureau's staff is providing real employee accountability that is a major concern furthermore the bureau claims that it invests in world-class training for its employees however its own survey says that only 38.8 percent of employees agree that the training they received was sufficient that sounds like anything but world class last week a news story reported the bureau is losing senior staff faster than it can replace them the report goes on to say the bureau imposed management techniques which put an emphasis on ensuring all employees were considered equal stakeholders a former bureau official expressed concern that while it's good policy to get some people with no exposure you don't want them to drive policy decisions because they don't understand the risk or cost involved so thus those with little training and experience are seated alongside those with greater training experience and considered equals these weaknesses may reflect broader management problems last week the cfpb employees voted to join the national treasury employees union the same union that is noted for representing the irs employees as well when considering all this coupled with the total lack of accountability to the american people i'm deeply concerned that cfpb presents a substantial risk to the taxpayers and as the chief financial officer of the cfpb i welcome our witness today and look forward to his testimony

AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. WILLIAM TAYLOR IN KYIV. JOINING ME IS TIM KAINE IN  VIRGINIA. A MEMBER OF BOTH OF THE SENATE  ARMS SERVICES AND THE FOREIGN  RELATIONS COMMITTEE. SENATOR CANE AND THE REST OF THE SENATE WILL MEET VIA  VIDEOCONFERENCE WITH VOLODYMYR  ZELENSKYY. SENATOR KAINE, GOOD TO SEE YOU  THIS MORNING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY CONTINUES TO ASK FOR A NO-FLY ZONE OVER  UKRAINE AND I SPOKE WITH A  UKRAINIAN MEMBER WHO SAID NATO  KEEPS SAYING NO, AND ALL I HEAR  IS NOT YET. SOMEHOW HE'LL CONVINCE NATO  LEADERS INCLUDING PEOPLE LIKE  YOU IN THE UNITED STATES  GOVERNMENTHAT I NEED MORE THAN WHAT I'M GETTING, WHAT ARE YOU  EXPECTING AND HEAR AND WHAT CAN  THAT RESPONSE LOOK LIKE? >> HE WILL GET MORE THAN WHAT  HE'S GETTING RIGHT NOW. JUST AS AN EXAMPLE, THE U.S. HAS PROVIDED $3 BILLION OF MILITARY  AID TO UKRAINE SINCE 2014. A BILLION DOLLARS JUST IN THE  LAST YEAR AND IN CONGRESS WE ARE LIKELY TO APPROVE AN ADDITIONAL  5 TO 8 BILLION DOLLARS OF  MILITARY AID IN THE NEXT COUPLE  OF WEEKS AND THIS IS AID THAT'S  VERY, VERY CRITICAL TO THE  UKRAINIAN FORCES AS THEYATATTLE  SOVIET AIRCRAFT, RUSSIAN TANKS,  ET CETERA. WE'LL DO A LOT MORE. I'M EXPECTING THAT WHEN WE TALK  TO PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY AT 9:30,  HE'LL TALK ABOUT THE NO-FLY ZONE ISSUE AND HOW TO DO IT. WE'VE DONE NO-FLY ZONES BEFORE. WE TEND TO DO IT IN AREAS WHERE  THERE'S NOT CONTESTED AIRSPACE. THEY PROTECT HUMANITARIAN  EVACUATIONS AND THIS IS VERY  CONTESTED AIRSPACE. THE RUSSIAN AIR FORCE IS ONE OF  THE MOST POWERFUL IN THE WORLD  AND THERE'S PROBABLY NO WAY TO  DO OR ANNOUNCE A NO-FLY ZONE  WITHOUTTT INVOLVING DIRECT  COMBAT BETWEEN THE U.S. AND  IAN AIRCRAFT AND THAT CAN  ESCALATE IT TO A MUCH, MUCH  BROADER WAR WHICH WE ARE TRYING  TO AVOID. WE WANT TO END THIS WAR AND NOT  ESCALATE IT AND THAT'S WHY THE  COMBINATION OF SANCTIONS,  CANCELING THE PIPELINE, DELIVERY OF MILITARY ASSISTANCE, PUTTING  OUR TROOPS IN NATO COUNTRIES,  PRESSING PUTIN AS A WAR CRIMINAL BEFORE THE ICC. THAT'S WHAT WE'VE COME TOGETHER  ON WITH OUR ALLIES THUS FAR, BUT I KNOW MY COLLEAGUES AND I ARE  ANXIOUS TO MEET WITH PRESIDENT  ZELENSKYY THIS MORNING. >> SENATOR KAINE, YOU'VE BEEN  AROUND FOR A WHILE AND NOT LONG  ENOUGH TO HAVE FIRST-HAND  KNOWLEDGE AND BACK IN 197 AND  1990, RUSSIA WENT INTO  AFGHANISTAN TO PROP UP A  PRO-RUSSIAN REGIME THERE AND THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS FUNDED  THE USE OF STINGER MISSILES  WHICH IS TO GREAT EFFECT, THE  MUJAHADIN WOULD USE TO TAKE DOWN HELICOPTERS AND RUSSIANS  ULTIMATELY LEFT. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN  GIVING UKRAINIANS STINGER  MISSILES AND JAVELINS FOR THEM  TO FIGHT WITH U.S.-MADE WEAPONRY AGAINST RUGS VERSUS A NO-FLY  ZONE IN YOUR MIND? >> WELL, IT'S JUST REALLY THE  DIRECT INVOLVEMENT OF U.S.  TROOPS. YOU'RE RIGHT. THE AID THAT WE PROVIDED TO THE  MUJAHADIN ENABLED THEM TO KICK  EE SOVIET UNION OUT OF  AFGHANISTAN, VERY, VERY POWERFUL AND MUCH OF WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW WITH UKRAINE IS EXACTLY THE  SAME, AND IN FACT, I THINK  YOU'LL SEE, ALI, WHEN WE  APPROVED THIS NEXT PACKAGE WHICH I THINK WILL BE BETWEEN $5  BILLION AND $8 BILLION OF  MILITARY AID, THE MIXTURE OF  WHAT THE WEAPONS WILL BE, WE'RE  GOING TO DO THE MIXTU THAT IS  MOST POTENT IN HELPING THE  UKRAINIAN DEFENSE FORCE, BUT THE DIRECT INVOLVEMENT OF U.S.  TRPSPS -- WHEN PRESIDENT BIDEN  SORT OF SETS HIS OWN RED LINE,  HE SAID WE WILL NOT HAVE U.S.  TROOPS BATTLING RUSSIA. RUSSIA WOULD SORT OF LIKE TO  PAINT THIS AS THE U.S. AGAINST  RUSSIA AND SHIFT THE FOCUS AWAY  FROM ILLEGAL RUSSIAN INVASION OF A SOVEREIGN NATION. WE NEED TO KEEP THE EYES OF THE  WORLD ON RUSSIA AS THE SOLE  CAUSE OF THE WAR AND DO  EVERYTHING WE CAN TO UNDERCUT  VLADIMIR PUTIN EVEN AT HOME AS  YOU'RE SEEING RUNS ON BANKS AND  THE ATMs AND THE RUBLE IS  DEVALUING AND THE RUSSIAN STOCK  MARKET CLOSED AND WE'LL KEEP THE FOCUS ON ITS MISBEHAVIOR. I I DON'T THINK THAT'S IN  UKRAINE'S INTEREST OR IN OURS,  BUT I'M LOONG FORWARD TO THIS  VISIT WITH PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY  AND HEARING HIS PERSPECTIVE ON  THIS. >> SENATOR, ALWAYS GOOD TO TALK  TO YOU. THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US THIS MORNING AND WE'LL BE VERY  INTERESTED IN THE CONVERSATION  THAT YOU'VE HAD JUST MOMENTS  FROM NOW WITH

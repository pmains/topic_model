me now to talk more about the situation in ukraine is virginia senator tim kaine who sits on the armed services and foreign relations committee center it's a great pleasure to see you good to be back jose thank you so very much for being with us so the president spent about a third of his speech talking about ukraine and the invasion of russia to that country how did you see it um i thought that was very powerful and i wasn't sure that he was going to start with that but he did um and it uh it produced a lot of unity in that chamber you were seeing everybody on their feet praising ukrainians courage but also celebrating the fact that in this very tough time um alliances like nato have really proven their worth remember president trump would kind of cozy up to putin and trash nato well now we see putin for who he really is and putin has rejuvenated nato in a way that hadn't been the case in 30 years and so there was a a real i think understanding recently that america still has an important role to play in forging global coalitions against tyrants this is a very very difficult situation but the world is standing together and it's good to see my colleagues on both sides of the aisle standing together and uh it's uh interesting last night president biden joined much of the rest of the western world when he said there will be no more flights from russia is there more the united states should be doing you think well i think there there's always more so we need to do more humanitarian and military aid we're working on our appropriations bill as you know likely to be finished late next week and i think you're going to see a multi-billion dollar aid package probably split between humanitarian and military aid i've been pressing for a war crimes investigation against vladimir putin the icc announced that they are starting that investigation yesterday that's very positive we need to put more u.s assets and troops into our nato countries on the russian border so that they can feel assured that's happening including troops deployed from virginia so there is much more to be done but the good news is in the early phases of this the combination of the sanctions together with the cancellation of the nordstrom pipeline and actions by nations like switzerland i know that finland and sweden germany that's had this history of not sending weapons into conflict zones they are now unified and you see scenes in russia people making runs on banks and atms that tells you that there's more than just a token political opposition in russia russians are already feeling the the brunt of this russia plays such a significant part in the economies of western europe i mean let's think of schroeder the former uh uh leader of germany in gazprom i mean there's a lot of financial ties between indeed russia and and certainly europe and here in the united states is there something that can be done to try and cut those ties which have been very beneficial to a lot of people in western europe they have been and look when you see bp and and shell and others announcing that they are extracting themselves from joint ventures with russian firms that's hard to do i mean they are very entangled but they are extracting themselves and that can set a model for others we are considering other sanctions so there could be secondary sanctions you know maybe not on the direct financial institutions but those who are doing business with others who are doing business with russia but the important thing jose on any of these sanctions is they really work and we do them in tandem with our partners and that's what the bind administration has done well for months they have patiently gone to our partners in europe you know germany didn't want to cancel the pipeline they didn't want to um but he got them to agree that if there was an invasion they would have to and they and they stuck with that so we need to take these sanctioned steps in tandem with our allies they're stronger we're getting a lot of talk and you hear it i mean the legislator the ukraine legislators on today's show today talking about the need for a no-fly zone or for a dome over ukraine to protect civilian lives that are being taken and blood is being shed by the russians in ukraine as we speak what are the difficulties of that well it's you you your heart goes out i mean to see these scenes of the bloodshed and kiev and kharkiv in other cities your heart goes out to folks trying to do that in a contested airspace would put u.s troops at risk but that doesn't mean that this isn't a concept we should be considering perhaps what we do is we deliver heavy humanitarian aid into the western part of ukraine so that people fleeing violence in some parts of the country could find safe haven elsewhere so there's these these are items that are being kicked around by the administration by our military leaders i know they're presenting president biden with options things like that again would need to be done in tandem with allies for them to really work by the way senator just moments ago senator schumer met with president biden's supreme court nominee judge katanji brown jackson how do you see your nomination playing out um i'm very excited i have voted for her in the past for her to her district court position and her circuit court position i always on a supreme court wait till after i meet with the candidate and watch the judiciary committee hearing to make a final determination but i'll tell you something i really feel good about i went to law school and when i started there were no women on the supreme court and it seemed natural you know there there that wasn't a source of angst in my first year law school class in 1979 that how come there's only been nine men on the court we're gonna have four women on the supreme court um as much as there are other areas where we're not making the progress i wish we were we do need to step back and say wow what a what a powerful thing that in just the course of my legal career we've gone from zero out of nine to we'll have four out of nine women on uh members of the quarterback senator i want to talk to you about immigration something that is close to your heart and we've talked about this for years now the president talked immigration he blended in the border which is you know two different things do you think there's anything possible on immigration reform uh that could be legislatively speaking not just the build back better act all or nothing i i do jose and here's why look at how look at the labor market right now 3.9 unemployment and it's getting tighter and we're about to do the biggest infrastructure investment we've ever who's going to build it so i when when we start to get in tight labor market conditions to do infrastructure to do this manufacturing expansion like where's it going to come from so what we're doing in the senate right now is we're having conversations um that are not the the mat the comprehensive bill that we tried in 2013 but a little bit could we do tps reform because these half million plus current tps members are really important parts of the american economy could we do an agriculture workers bill and so you have pairs of senators kind of like working on pieces of these and i would say most of them connect with labor market issues and that and the tightness of the labor market actually gives us some opportunity to find some bipartisan equity this is important i've got to tell you i don't hear and i'm so glad you're here with us today because it's been so easy to say oh it's all in the parliamentarians hands yeah that's it but you know you all have a responsibility and you have the opportunity and we and we need to a lot of people think about immigration just as a security issue it's fundamentally a workforce issue it is it's an american issue absolutely and that that may thinking of it as a workforce issue in a tight labor market may be the thing that breaks the law just senator i can't thank you enough for being uh with us it's great to see always good thanks so much

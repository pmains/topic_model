let me say just a couple of things with regard to HR 5003 it would turn the clock back on years of progress and prevent children from eating healthy meals every day this Republican child nutrition bill would roll back critical evidence based nutrition standards made in the 2010 reauthorization bill which we were very actively involved with sadly but unsurprisingly it would also Denine eligible children access to the free or reduced price school meals program and it was slashed funding for summary electronic benefits transfer I just have to say as a young single mother on public assistance and food stamps I don't know what I would have done had my children not had school lunches this was a bridge over troubled waters for me and my children and I have to thank my government for that helping hand but today in 2016 this bill will roll back these programs which means more hungry kids in our schools and in our neighborhoods that's why several of us are sending a letter to the education and Workforce Committee outlining our deep concerns with the changes to our child nutrition programs I hope that everyone on our side of the aisle signs this important letter and I hope that the majority will read it carefully it lays out some of the basic basic problems in this bill and we want to make sure that everyone on the committee and this entire body understands the impact of what this will cause when we take away access to these meals we jeopardize children's health their educational attainment and really their future we know the children who have access to healthy meals are more likely to do well in school have decreased behavioral problems and come to class ready to learn that's what we should want for all of our children for the children growing up and pretty neighborhoods and who lack equal access to healthy meals these school meals really are a lifeline and we're not just talking about a few students the numbers are clear more than fifteen point three million children are living in food secure insecure households let me say that again more than 15 million kids are at risk of going to bed hungry every night in America in the richest and most powerful country in the world we also know that childhood hunger is far from color blind children of color are disproportionately affected by hunger every day for example in 2014 one in three african-american children and one in four Latino children they were food insecure and for children who lived in rural communities food and security is coupled with other barriers like lack of access to transportation to get to summer feeding sites more than seventeen percent of rural households as 3.3 million households are food insecure child hunger and the lack of nutritious food is a problem that affects every child in every zip code it's endemic in our country in rural urban and suburban schools every member of Congress has constituents who are hungry really this should be a priority for all of us I've seen the impact of food insecurity in my own community in Oakland California where one in four children at the Oakland Unified School District do they do not have access to affordable nutritious food these families are forced to make impossible choices to feed their children especially during the summer months when school is closed these families are making decisions every day between food and medicine food and rent our food and pay and electric bill Mr Speaker we need real solutions to these very real problems let me just mention my legislation happen 10 act HR 258 that would national strategy to cut poverty in half over the next decade that's more than 23 million Americans lifted out of poverty and into the middle class in just the next 10 years this bill that we're talking about tonight goes just the opposite way surely we can all recognize that ensuring healthy meals for American children that's the first step in this ongoing war on poverty it should not be a artisan issue feeding hungry kids that's a moral imperative so let's put our children first let's strengthen our child nutrition programs rather than cut them our children deserve the security of knowing where their next meal is coming from that's just basic it's a basic American value so thank you congressman Scott

mr. president is my great honor and pleasure to be joined on the floor today by my senior senator from Rhode Island the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee Senator Jack Reed we are here today on the Senate floor to speak about the perils that climate change poses to America's national security I'm going to frame my remarks around a fact and a proposition the fact as reported in the 2017 climate science report is that oceans of the world are absorbing more than nine zetas joules of heat energy each year and the proposition is one I think most of us agree with that America is and remains the world's indispensable nation exceptional and exemplary so let's unpack that fact a little bit more than nine zetas joules of heat energy going into the ocean every year well first what says zetas Joule as it jewel is a sextillion joules or 10 to the 21st power joules that is a lot of zeros more practically 9zo joules is around a dozen times humankind's total annual energy consumption more kinetically speaking the added heat in our oceans is equivalent to four Hiroshima sized nuclear bombs exploding in the oceans every second every second so every minute 240 or Oshima blasts in the ocean in the time of my remarks probably three thousand her Oshima explosions with the oceans capturing all of that heat energy so let's go back to that proposition that America is the world's indispensable and exemplary nation years ago Daniel Webster probably said it best bribing the work of our founders as having quote set the world an example his was not a unique vision of America from Jonathon Winthrop at the beginning to Ronald Reagan recently we've called ourselves a city on a hill set high for the world to witness from President Kennedy to President Obama inaugural addresses have noted that the glow of our ideals lights the world President Clinton argued that people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than the example of our power when Daniel Webster said that our founding fathers had set the world an example he went on to say this the last hopes of mankind therefore rests with us and if it should be proclaimed that our example had become an argument against the experiment Danelle meaning the death knell of popular Liberty would be sounded throughout the earth so how does that fact of nine Zetta joules and that proposition of America's role how do they relate to each other well first is the climate chaos that mankind will increasingly have to bear a recent study published by nature found 99.9999% confidence that earth is warming due to human activity I could give you any number of risks like global sea level rise or increasing wildfire and droughts or the unprecedented co2 concentrations in our atmosphere all of this affects human health human agriculture and the human economy and all of these risks also have national security consequences through the years America's national security experts could not have made it much plainer fifty-eight former military and national security leaders sent this letter this month to President Trump warning that and I'll quote them here climate change is real it is happening now it is driven by humans and it is accelerating end quote they went on to say that the administration's climate denial will quote erode our national security and they warned that the effects of climate change already quote being used by our adversaries as a weapon of war citing Isis's control of water during climate change exacerbated drought this letter urges President Trump to drop the politics and allow our national security and science agencies to do their jobs they're not alone the Pentagon's 2014 quadrennial defense review described climate change as a quote global threat multiplier warning that and I quote him again the pressure is caused by climate change will influence resource competition while placing additional burdens on economies societies and governance institutions around the world former Admiral Samuel Locklear is the head of our US Pacific Command warned in 2013 that climate change was the biggest long-term security threat in his area of operation noting the need for the military to organize for as he called it when the effects of climate change start to impact these massive populations if it goes bad he said you could have hundreds of thousands or millions of people displaced and then security will start to crumble pretty quickly and quote a recent survey of nearly three hundred active duty and veteran service members found that 77% quote considerate fairly or very likely that military bases in coastal or island regions will be damaged by flooding or severe storms as a result of climate change in response to a provision championed by Rhode Island Congressman Jim Langevin in the house and by Senator Reid in the Senate the last NDAA bill instructed the Department of Defense to provide a report examining the effects of climate change on the military of 79 DoD installations evaluated 53 currently experienced for current flooding 43 are experiencing drought conditions 36 are wildfires six are seeing desert off' ocation and one is dealing with thawing permafrost and that's what's happening now in 20 years the DoD predicts an additional seven installations will experience flooding five more will see drought conditions and seven will see wildfire risks and of course all of those risks will get worse this report failed to list the top ten most vulnerable ins to take in installations and ignored the Marine Corps but it nevertheless warrant and I quote the effects of a changing climate are a national security issue with potential impacts to Department of Defense missions operational plans and installations so the national security ties to climate change begin with our military a second point Henry Kissinger once told me that the great revolutions of the world have always come from what he called a confluence of resentments I have not forgotten that phrase when he used it a confluence of resentments well the poorest on the planet those who live closest to the land who lead subsistence lives will suffer most the brunt of the coming change and they will resent it it is human nature if you divide the world into three groups you can call one group the very poorest that will starve when for instance its fisheries collapse the middle group is distressed when fisheries collapse but has the resources to find alternative food sources and at the top the fish in our air-conditioned supermarket may cost a bit more and come from a different part of the ocean and we may drive home in our air-conditioned SUV with a slightly larger grocery bill but that will be it for us the first two groups will resent it when they feel that pain caused by the SUV crowd and if you turn that pain up high enough good luck defending with those injured people the parliamentary democracy and market capitalism that brought this on the injustice will amplify the resentments and my final point how does America fare as our exemplary nation through all of this well very badly democracy and capitalism are the hallmarks of our country and the failure of those institutions to address climate change will not be a good story worse than the failure is the reason for it the climate denial apparatus that has one unseemly influence in Congress now will surely lose the test of time the consequences of climate change are determined by laws of chemistry of physics of biology those laws can't be repealed or wished away propaganda can manipulate people and passions and politics but it has no effect on the immutable laws of nature so the fossil fuel industries denial apparatus will ultimately be exposed as a fraud and a scandal and history will lament and condemn it as one of the great American frauds and scandals history's judgment will come harshly and it will fall harshly on an American democracy that let itself be overborne by this apparatus James Madison in the Federalist Papers warned of and I'll quote him here moments in public affairs when the public can be misled by artful misrepresentations of interested men and by that of course he meant people with a conflict of interest and he went on to say that misled people may call for measures which they themselves will afterwards be the most ready to lament and condemn well we have certainly been misled by artful misrepresentations of the interested men of the fossil fuel industry it may be hard for us our world of air conditioning and SUVs and imported fresh fish to contemplate resentment and revolution but the harms to the oceans of nine Zetas joules of heat 4.5 Hiroshima explosions worth of heat per second that we are adding to the oceans those harms are on a collision course with our destiny as a city on a hill we urgently need to show the world that market capitalism and democracy don't fail when presented with big problems if we are to head off a confluence of resentments that we are now making inevitable mr. president with that I will yield to my distinguished senior senator senator Jack Reed mr. president senators drinking - thank you very much mr. president let me come in senator Whitehouse for his consistent efforts to illuminate and discuss the problem of Congress change which affects not just the United States but the the entire world it's a pleasure to join him and once again call attention to this urgent threat we know that climate change impacts our health our communities our economy and our infrastructure but today I would like to focus on how climate change is affecting our national security some of the points that Senator Whitehouse also made beginning with the 2008 national defense strategy the administration of President George W Bush stated that quote changes with existing and future resource environmental and climactic pressures may generate new security challenges these risks will require managing that divergent needs of massively increasing energy demand to maintain economic development and the need to tackle climate change with increasing frequency in recent years climate change has been commonly referred to as a threat multiplier simply put climate change can and will exacerbate conditions and region with already tenuous stability numerous intelligence assessments have reached the same conclusion climate change will have broad impacts for US national security interest over the next 30 years and beyond the National Intelligence Council has found that in their words rising sea levels flooding droughts higher temperatures and more frequent extreme weather events will increasingly threatened military capabilities and facilities on both us and foreign territory including military bases and training ranges furthermore the National Intelligence Council identified six key pathways threats to the stability of countries heightened social and political tensions adverse effects on food prices and availability increased reefs to human risk to human health negative impacts on investment and economic competitiveness and potential climate discontinuities and secondary surprises and former Secretary of Defense Jim mattis has stated to the center of the Services Committee where climate change contributes to regional instability the Department of Defense must be aware of any potential adverse impacts he also noted that climate change is impacting stability in areas of the world where our troops are operating today more recently the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joe Dunford was asked about climate change and an event held by Duke University's program in American grant strategy and he said when we look at it when I look at it climate change it's in the category of source of conflict around the world and things we have to respond to so it can be great devastation requiring humanitarian assistance slash disaster relief which the US military certainly conducts routinely in fact I can't think of a year since I've been on active duty that we haven't conducted at least one operation the Pacific along those lines due to extreme weather in the and then when you look at source of conflict shortages of water and those kinds of things those are all sources of conflict so it is very much something that we take into account in our planning as we anticipate when where and how we may be engaged in the future and what capabilities we should have the Department of Defense has already observed many negative impacts to readiness and resources due to extreme weather as a result of climate change the Congressional Budget Office has concluded costs associated with hurricane damage will increase more rapidly than the economy will grow thirty nine billion dollars annually by 2075 in 2017 the Government Accountability Office found that weather effects associated with climate change pose operational and budgetary risks to the Department of Defense the GAO also found that even without knowing precisely how or when the climate will change DoD knows it must build resilience into its policies programs and operations in a thoughtful and cost-effective way last year the Pentagon also submitted its screening level vulnerability assessment surveys to Congress it found that roughly half of all military installations and that respondents stated they had experienced adverse impacts from climate change damage from high winds flooding due to storm surge and non storm surge events extreme temperatures droughts and wildfires however that figure is likely much higher because the other half of military installations around the globe didn't even respond to the survey and oddly enough those military installations that said they had not experienced negative impacts from climate change we were very close to other installations which said they had clearly this is a broad problem for our military the department's most recent report on climate change was like and introductory primer and carried about as much value as a phone book it failed to provide many required elements such as the top 10 list of the most vulnerable installations from each military service instead the report focused on civilian installations important for mission assurance and found about two thirds of them are in their words vulnerable to current or future recurrent flooding and more than half are vulnerable a current or future drought and wildfires perhaps the most recent and high-profile impacts occurred this month when a particular type of storm in the Midwest called a bomb cyclone left at least one-third of Offutt Air Force Base underwater from flooding in just a few months ago hurricane Michael made a direct hit on Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida which is only shortly after the astonishing 1000 year event of hurricane Florence in North Carolina which caused severe damage at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in other words the amount of observed rain during Hurricane Florence had a 1 in 100 chance of occurring each year while initial reporting indicated at Tyndall that roughly 17 f-22s were destroyed or severely damaged after being left at the base during hurricane Michael fortunately the actual damage the aircraft turned out to be minimal however the fact that over a dozen advanced fighters costing roughly 130 million dollars per aircraft had to be abandoned in the first place is a fundamental flaw in readiness and aircraft maintenance despite the minimal damage to aircraft the projected cost to rebuild Tyndall is still roughly 4.1 billion dollars the underlying issue that must be addressed is that hangars and other facilities are not adequately designed and built to withstand an increased trend of heavy winds above 130 miles per hour or other extreme weather meanwhile the estimated cost to rebuild what was damaged at Camp Lejeune according to the Commandant of the Marine Corps is roughly 3.7 billion dollars fortunately camp lejeune several hangars survived and did not flood this is because they were appropriately designed in the first place these glaring examples of Offutt Air Force Base Tyndall Air Force Base and Camp Lejeune clearly demonstrate that we must plan for climate adaptation now we pay much much more in the future general nila the combat of the Marine Corps recently roped the sector the Navy saying that the Marine Corps in his words faces physical challenges without precedent given that again in his words hurricane Florence damages negatively impacting marine corps readiness to put some of that in context that commandant said the total recovery cost is 9 percent of our annual budget the building repair cost is 150 percent of our total annual building repair budgets and the building replacement cost is four years worth of non Guam MILCON and the con come and I closed the letter warning that the next hurricane season is only three months away beyond these most recent events climate change continues to cost DoD significant resources measured in taxpayer funding and negative impacts on readiness in 2017 the trio of hurricanes Maria Irma and Harvey cost to the department over 1.3 billion dollars in military construction and facilities sustainment restoration and modernization alone hurricane Harvey was the third five hundy R flood in the Houston area in the last three years we're getting five hundred year floods every three years in parts of the United States and it left four times more than the entire flow of the Mississippi River on the city of Houston Texas at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas there were 81 Black Flag training days and these are days where training is canceled due to heat that was in 2012 in 2016 226 Black Flag days the Marine Corps experience 478 heat related injuries in 2013 by comparison there was 688 in 2017 and 744 in 2016 in Alaska three locations of early warning radar infrastructure have been damaged and moved due to coastal erosion that was not expected to occur until 2030 in 2016 a 10,000 acre wildfire in California closed the south side of Vandenberg Air Force Base stalling the launch of Atlas 5 rockets wildfires also led to training range closures from multiple months in North Carolina South Carolina Idaho Florida and New Mexico last summer in Arizona a heat wave caused over 40 flights to be cancelled with clear implications for DoD aircraft ships and vehicles that must be able to continue to operate in extreme hot and cold temperatures yet current adaptation measures attempted by DoD have yet to be comprehensive or entirely successful in what could be the beginning of a startling trend the Air Force recently had to cancel a fiscal year 18 military construction project in Alaska due to touring primer forests under the existing facility causing significant settling with the facility foundation warming Arctic temperatures in Dooley Air Force Base in Greenland have caused extensive airfield pavement repairs at a cost of over 30 million dollars which is roughly the cost of one army combat training center rotation so instead of getting a brigade down to fort irwin for training exercises that they need we're have going to have to repave and repave bases that are exposed to some of these climate effects meanwhile melting ice caps continue to open up new st. sea lanes in the Arctic a topic that the presiding officer knows better than anyone else in this body increasing commercial traffic and prompting several countries including Russia to vie for influence and control of the region notably the current force structure of the Navy is not adequately postured to respond and operate in the Arctic and the GAO found recently that even the Navy admits significant limitations for operating surface ships in the Arctic protecting our national security requires tough decisions that are made through a careful evaluation of risk which as I have described must include the real risk posed by climate change I'm concerned by many actions coming by the current administration not only to downplay these risks but also to actively undermine the scientific consensus on climate change instead of heeding the warnings of scientists including those from the 13 federal agencies that worked on the National Climate Assessment the administration is working to create a climate security panel led by a noted climate denier to contradict these warnings now I will continue and I know others will continue fighting any effects to cast doubt on the fact that climate change is real and that it is human cost we need to be able to acknowledge these basic facts that we can quickly come together to work towards meaningful solutions again let me thank Senator Whitehouse for inviting me to join him today to highlight the impacts of climate change on national security the dangers of inaction are many and as a ranking member the Armed Service Committee I will be continuing to sound the alarm on this critical issue and mr. president I've tried to emphasize the effects of climate change on our training facilities on our bases here in the United States on our regions that are close by where we prepare our forces to send them overseas but if you look overseas in areas that are suffering drought in areas where agricultural land is diminishing in areas where farming used to be the mainstay the population now is disappearing and the population is unemployed if you could places like Pakistan that has significant environmental problems significant financial problems significant problems with terrorist organizations you could look in thousands of places around the globe those are real threats that are being accelerated by climate change that our military will have to adapt and just to so this is a multi-phased issue we have to take steps here at home to preserve our training base to make sure that our airfields can operate in all types of weather that we can have the Marine Corps facilities at Lejeune at a1 condition it's the major force generating position for the Marine Corps on the Atlantic coast we've got to be able to do that that's just part of the problem the other part of the problem is the potential for conflict overseas in many countries it's accelerating because they're losing their they're losing their their their quality of life their economic ability all these things as droughts as severe weather as hurricanes as storms there was used cyclonic activity just reported last week in parts of Africa that's causing disruption of families death a host of the problems that are causing not particularly stable governments become less stable and so this is an issue we must address I look forward to working with all my colleagues in order to provide the resources and the direction to do that and with that mr. president let me thank you and let me yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum

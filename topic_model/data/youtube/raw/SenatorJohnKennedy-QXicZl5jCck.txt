plenty of democrats are talking about court packing just not vice presidential nominee kamala harris at least not to the questions directly from our own peter ducey today as you saw on jackie heinrich's report so let's pick it up right there with a republican member of the senate judiciary committee john kennedy of louisiana senator welcome back good to see you thank you okay i want to read something from the washington post uh they're talking about the strategy that the vice president has for previously during the primaries we heard him talk about the fact that court packing would not be a great idea now he's sort of demurring saying i don't want to answer the question because it changes the subject and that's what the president wants me to do says some on biden's team have been aggravated by calls on the left to expand the court biden advisors are reluctant to get enmeshed in a fight that could alienate centrist voters rather than weighing in on such ideas biden stress less polarizing issues i mean this is a tough question senator do you think the potential voters out there deserve to know whether this vice president and the man who wants to be president supports court packing yes and and let me make two points here number one senator schumer who has also talked about court packing has been telling anyone who will listen that we should not fill this vacancy because it's an election year the the constitutional provisions on filling a supreme court vacancy are unaffected by the electoral calendar and i want to make it clear we're going forward and anyone who thinks senator schumer would not do the same thing if the shoe were on the other foot probably also believes jimmy hoffa died a natural death number two some not all but some of my democratic colleagues uh have have have threatened america they threatened us tucker carlson said it well last night they're saying if you don't do what we want we will hurt you if you don't do what we want we will hurt america we will destroy the united states supreme court as an institution by packing the court shame on them they ought to hide their head in a bag and that's just further demonstration of the fact that they don't understand the role of the united states supreme court they think justices are just politicians in robes they think justices have the right to rewrite the constitution every other thursday to advance a political or social agenda that they can't get by the voters and that's not why our founders set up the united states supreme court or any of our federal courts but doesn't the former vice president have an opportunity to clearly state that he's not with that section of his party i mean our chris wallace is going to ask tough questions next week and i would expect he's going to be pushed on whether he thinks she should get rid of the filibuster or pack the court or any of the other things that are being proposed at this point because a lot of folks on the left are saying listen this is fair you mentioned potentially destroying the supreme court as an american institution they say that's what you guys are doing right now uh well to answer your question shannon um yes vice president biden needs to answer that question he if he criticizes president trump's nominee for the supreme court as i suspect he will he needs to tell the american people who he will appoint now like it or not the supreme court vacancy has become maybe the most important issue in this presidential race and president trump has is shortly i'm told going to tell us where he stands i think vice president biden needs to do the same thing and and he needs to either support or condemn his colleagues who have threatened to destroy the us supreme court by by packing it by turning it into a bunch of politicians and robes sort of a mini congress if we don't do what they want and he needs to hit that one head on all right i would like you to respond to a tweet from cher the entertainer for decades well loved and known saying this our hope for new vet for care gone decency truth equality our hope for a new prosperity for all gone what's left lies deceit laws gone that displease the tyrant to many too many american i think she means 200 too many american values gone to enumerate maybe president kushner ivanka jr mitt hell awaits men who sell their souls uh sounds like a reference there to your colleague mitt romney the senator from utah's decision to go ahead with this vote how do you respond to people who that's the extreme version they see of what you're doing i mean there is a section of this country who views your actions that way i would respond by saying uh first i love cher's music uh number two i suspect many of the beautiful people in hollywood agree with her uh how brave they are they're not exactly a cross-section of the american people and uh i don't think many many americans pay much attention to what they say well i'm going to put you and share down for not singing from the same hymnal for now uh senator kennedy um we will watch as uh these hearings and that committee that you are on it's going to be a very important spotlight in the coming weeks uh we'll watch your schedule as that comes together senator kennedy thank you always for your time thank you

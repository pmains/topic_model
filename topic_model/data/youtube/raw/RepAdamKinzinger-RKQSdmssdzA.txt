joined now by republican congressman adam kin kenzinger of illinois he has previously suggested raising the age to 21 for when a person can purchase firearms like ar-15 style rifles congressman um is that something you think could actually happen in america raising the age 21 you know i hope so i think there's a lot of people that don't understand the gun laws from the perspective of this so in america you have to be 21 to buy a handgun and 18 in most states there's basically no federal minimum of 21 for long rifles so you can when the law was made you can understand long rifles didn't really weren't ar-15s at the time because they kept the age of 18. you have to be 21 we just federally raise the age of 21 to buy cigarettes by the way i think when you look at particularly this shooting the shooting before it there's this epidemic of young men between the age of 18 and 21 that are doing these kinds of things i think one of the easiest things we can do to begin to do something is to say you got to be 21 to buy a rifle in this country um you got to be 21 to buy cigarettes obviously we need universal background checks we need red flag laws with teeth these are things that we can do to have that discussion move forward but everybody just sits in their corner particularly in my party scared that if they say anything they're going to have to face the wrath of the nra and gun owners of america and that's what it is you think it's the power of the nra it's the power yes it's the power of how angry people get i mean let's put it kind of in line with why people don't speak out about trump because you know if you even stand up and say i agree with adam let's raise the age of 21. uh your base is going to go bananas because there's this belief and it's not entirely wrong but there's this belief among republicans that in the slippery slope idea if we do anything then it's gonna lead to a slippery slope where eventually nobody owns guns at all obviously nobody's intention is to take everybody's guns away but in that we are frozen to do anything and i say this to second amendment supporters like i am we have to be the ones putting forward solutions for responsible gun ownerships and the answer to defending the second amendment isn't that we need open carry in every state it isn't to take your ar-15 and to occupy the michigan state capitol because you're tough and you can it is to come up with things we can do to ensure that as many of these kinds of things that we can mitigate we do it's obviously a heart problem in this country too anderson but there are a number of things we can do on on the gun side that i think 90 of americans agree on i mean is there will any event like this actually sway members of congress though i i think i mean sadly yes it's probably going to ultimately take that but i think i'd say this to any member of congress or anybody who votes on any of this kind of stuff once you actually you're pent up you really want to say let's raise the age of 21 or let's have red flag laws but you're scared to death once you actually say it and you rip the band-aid off and you get all the angry texts you feel very liberated and so i want more and more republicans to feel strong and passionate about the fact that we've got to do something so is this going to be the the thing that i don't know i hope so um but unfortunately there's gonna be something because this is a daily occurrence and it makes me as as i'm sure everybody just just it's awful and i just wanna point out i mean you are an active duty serviceman you know about firearms you are a supporter of the second amendment i just want to make that clear correct that's right and look it's it's not about it's about saying how can we make this a responsible thing i'm a gun owner myself right but i i have a license to conceal carry some of these states are saying you know if you're above the age 18 you can carry an ar in public an ar-15 and the only thing difference is right now the muzzle's pointed at the ground so i'm not a threat in two feet i'm a threat that's the only difference this is insane there's a gun fetish in this country a fetish for guns look i believe in the right to keep and bear arms i don't believe we need to worship guns and there are too many people that do that congressman kinsey i appreciate your time tonight thank you god bless

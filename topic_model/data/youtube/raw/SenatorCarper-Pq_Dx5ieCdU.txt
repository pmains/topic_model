SENATOR FROM DELAWARE. MR. CARPER: MR. PRESIDENT, I RISE THIS AFTERNOON ALONG WITH SEVERAL OF OUR COLLEAGUES TO DISCUSS THE NEED TO END THE POLICY OF TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION, WHICH MILLIONS OF AMERICANS IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HAVE ENDURED OVER -- FOR OVER 200 YEARS AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS STILL ENDURE TODAY. THIS POLICY WAS WRONG IN 1776 WHEN 13 COLONIES TOOK ON THE MIGHTIEST NATION ON EARTH TO END IT. IT IS WRONG TODAY. AND WE SEEK TO END IT THROUGH THE ENACTMENT OF S. 51, THE WASHINGTON, D.C., ADMISSION ACT. IN JUST SIX DAYS OUR COUNTRY WILL OBSERVE MEMORIAL DAY, A HOLIDAY OFTEN OBSERVED TO MARK THE START OF SUMMER, CELEBRATE IT THE START OF SUMMER. BUT ON MEMORIAL DAY THIS YEAR, MANY OF US WILL PAUSE TO REMEMBER GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS IN OUR ARMED FORCES THAT HAVE LAID DOWN THEIR LIVES FORA COUNTRY. THIS DAY MEANS SOMETHING TO MY OWN FAMILY. MY OWN MATERNAL GRANDMOTHER WAS A GOLD STAR MOTHER. WITH THE DEATH OF JOHN McCAIN, I AM THE LAST VIETNAM VETERAN SESQUI IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. THE NAMES OF SOME 58,000 MEN AND WOMEN WITH WHOM JOHN AND I SERVED 0 BLASED ON A BLACK GRANITE WALL ON THE MALL, MIMES FROM WHERE WE ARE STANDING TODAY. THE NAMES INCLUDE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN FROM WASHINGTON, D.C., AS WELL. SINCE WORLD WAR I IN FACT OVER 5,000 AMERICANS FROM THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES IN SERVICE TO THE UNITED STATES. AND TODAY ROUGHLY 15,000 D.C. RESIDENTS ARE ON ACTIVE DUTY OR SERVING AS RESERVISTS OR MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL GUARD IN THEIR STATES. THAT'S 15,000 AMERICANS SERVING DUTIFULLY IN THE ARMY, NAVY, THE AIR FORCE, AND MARINES OR THE COAST GUARD. OUR NATION'S CAPITOL IS HOME TO MORE THAN JUST MONUMENTS AND MUSEUMS, MR. PRESIDENT. IT IS HOME TO AMERICANS WHO WORK, WHO START BUSINESSES AND WHO CONTRIBUTE TO AMERICA'S ECONOMY. JUST LIKE ALL 50 STATES REPRESENTED IN THIS BODY, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IS HOME TO VETERANS AND SERVICE MEMBERS WHO RISKED THEIR LIVES FOR OUR COUNTRY. EVEN TODAY. BUT YEAR AFTER YEAR THEY COME HOME TO FIND THAT THEY ARE STILL DENIED THE ABILITY TO HAVE A REAL SAY IN OUR NATION'S FUTURE. THESE HEROES ARE AMONG THE NEARLY 700,000 AMERICANS WHO CALL THE DISTRICT HOME, AND FOR GENERATIONS HAVE LIVED WITHOUT VOTING REPRESENTATION IN CONGRESS. THAT'S WHY I VIEW WASHINGTON, D.C.'S STATEHOOD NOT AS A REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRATIC ISSUE, NOT AS A POLITICAL ISSUE, BUT AS AN AMERICAN ISSUE, AS AN ISSUE OF BASIC FAIRNESS AND EQUALITY. HE RECALL WHYER THIS YEAR, THE SENIOR SENATOR FROM UTAH SOUGHT TO OVERTURN A LAW PASSED BY THE D.C. CITY COUNCIL RIGHT HERE ON THE SENATE FLOOR. AS U.S. SENATORS, NEITHER OF US SHOULD HAVE SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY TO INTERVENE IN A LOCAL MATTER LIKE THAT. BUT IN THE SENATE, WE HAVE POWER OVER THE BUDGET OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, A CITY THAT HAS A DOUBLE A-PLUS CREDIT RATING. DOUBLE A-PLUS. FROM AN OLD STATE TREASURY, THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. BETTER THAN MOST STATES, IN FACT, IF YOU CHECK. YOU -- WE ALSO HAVE CONFIRMATION POWER OVER THE DISTRICT'S JUDGES, WHICH HAS LED TO EXTENSIVE VACANCIES SOMETIMES FOR YEARS. THAT'S WRONG. I REMIND MY COLLEAGUES THAT THAT DAY THAT NO ONE IN THIS ROOM WAS ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, NOBODY IN THIS ROOM WAS ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. AND NO ONE HERE AS ABLE TO STAND UP AND REPRESENT THEIR INTERESTS. THIS SHOULD BE UNACCEPTABLE UNTIL A 21st CENTURY DEMOCRACY. -- IN A 21st CENTURY DEMOCRACY. HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THE TIDE IS STARTING TO TURN. I BELIEVE WE CAN FINALLY MAKE D.C. STATEHOOD A REALITY DURING THIS CONGRESS, THE 117th CONGRESS. WE HAVE A FEARLESS CHAMPION IN THE HOUSE, CONGRESSWOMAN ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON. WITH HER LEADERSHIP ALONG WITH THAT OF THE SPEAKER AND LEADER STENY HOYER, THE HOUSE PASSED THE D.C. STATEHOOD BILL LAST MONTH FOR THE SECOND TIME EVER. WE ALSO HAVE FOR THE FIRST TIME A PRESIDENT WHO FORMALLY SUPPORTS ENDING THIS MODERN-DATE POLICY OF TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION. AND IN THE SENATE WE HAVE A RECORD 45 COSPONSORS ON OUR BILL TO MAKE THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA A STATE, A NUMBER THAT REPRESENTS MEMBERS FROM RURAL AND URBAN AREAS ALIKE. THIS NUMBER HAS GROWN STEADILY SINCE MY FRIEND, OUR FORMER COLLEAGUE, JOE LIEBERMAN, A FIERCELY INDEPENDENT SENATOR LED THIS CHARGE IN THE SENATE BEFORE PASSING THE BATON TO ME IN 2013. I KNOW SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID THAT D.C. STATEHOOD IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. TO BE CLEAR, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HAS TAKEN THE SAME STEPS TOWARDS STATEHOOD THAT 37 OTHER STATES HAVE TAKEN, THE SAME STEPS, A PROCESS CLEARLY LAID OUT IN OUR CONSTITUTION. THIS CASE WAS MADE CLEARLY IN A LETTER TO CONGRESS JUST THIS WEEK FROM NEARLY 40 LEADING CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLARS TO WROTE THAT CONGRESS IS WELL WITHIN ITS RIGHTS TO GRANT STATEHOOD. ON A DIFFERENT HOLIDAY LATER THIS SUMMER, MR. PRESIDENT, WE'LL BE CELEBRATING JULY 4, TO REMEMBER THOSE WHO FOUGHT FOR OUR INDEPENDENCE. AND I'D REMIND MY COLLEAGUES AGAIN THAT THE FOUNDING FATHERS, THE SAME MEN WHO WROTE OUR CONSTITUTION, HAD A CRY DURING THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE CITIZENS OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA TODAY. THE REALITIES THAT THESE CITIZENS MAY THE MOST -- GET THIS. THE CITIZENS OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA PAY THE MOST IN PER CAPITA FEDERAL INCOME TAXES IN THE U.S., MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE, BUT THEY HAVE NO SAY IN HOW THOSE DOLLARS ARE SPENT. NONE. THE SECOND-CLASS STATISTIC US A MIS-COME TO AN END -- THE SECOND-CLASS STATUS MUST COME TO AN END. AND WE ARE THE ONES WHO CAN 0 DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. YOU CAN ALWAYS COUNT ON AMERICA TO DO THE RIGHT THING IN THE END, SAID CHURCHILL, AFTER THEY'VE TRIED EVERYTHING ELSE. IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO DO THE RIGHT THING. THE RIGHT THING TO DO NOW IS TO ENSURE THAT NEARLY 700,000 AMERICANS LIVING IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, SEVERING IN OUR MILITARY, VOTING -- SEVERING IN OUR MILITARY, VOTING -- SERVING IN OUR MILITARY, VOTING ACTUALLY -- HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE FOR THOSE IN THIS BODY AND IN IT THE HOUSE. WITH THE THAT I THANK YOU AND I YIELD THE FLOOR TO SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO I BELIEVE WILL BE JOINING US IN THIS CALL, INCLUDING THE SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY. MR. BOOKER: MR. PRESIDENT? THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY. MR. BOOKER: I AM HONORED TO JOIN IN THE COLLOQUY ON THIS URGENT ISSUE TO REALLY TALK ABOUT THE CENTRAL FUNCTION OF OUR DEMOCRACY, WHETHER THE IDEALS OF THIS NATION ARE REAL FOR EVERY AMERICAN. NOW, IF YOU CUT ME, I'M GOING TO BLEED JERSEY, BUT LET ME TELL YOU VERY PLAINLY, I'M PROUD TO HAVE GROWN UP IN JERSEY, BUT I'M ALSO PROUD TO HAVE BEEN BORN IN WASHINGTON, D.C. THIS IS WHERE MY PARENTS MET AFTER COLLEGE. THIS IS WHERE THEY FELL IN LOVE. THEIR FIRST DATE WAS AT THE JEFFERSON MEMORIAL IN THE PADDLEBOATS THERE IN THE REFLECTING POOL. THEY THERE REMEMBER TELLING ME JUST THE LOVE THEY HAD FOR EACH OTHER THAT WAS ALREADY DAWNING BUT ALSO THIS FIERCE ALLEGIANCE TO THIS INCREDIBLE COMMUNITY THAT IS WASHINGTON, D.C. MY MOM TALKED ABOUT THE ACTIVISM THAT WAS HERE. SHE WAS WORKING FOR THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AS A SPEECH PATHOLOGIST. AND SHE TALKED ABOUT THIS PATRIOTIC FEEL THAT SHE HAD, ESPECIALLY WHEN SHE WAS HELPING TO ORGANIZE THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON. THE WORDS ON THE JEFFERSON MEMORIAL WHERE MY PARENTS HAD THEIR FIRST DATE AT THE END OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, WE MUTUALLY PLEDGE OUR LIVES, OUR FORTUNES AND OUR SACRED HONOR. THAT'S WHAT WE ARE CALLED TO PLEDGE TO ONE ANOTHER. BUT FOR TOO LONG, THE PEOPLE OF THIS CITY HAVE NOT HAD THE HONOR, THE PRIVILEGES, THE EQUAL CITIZENSHIP RIGHTS THAT SO MANY OTHERS IN EVERY STATE IN OUR UNION, IN ALL PARTS OF OUR DEMOCRACY ENJOY. THESE ARE RIGHTS, AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID, THAT WASHINGTON, D.C. -- IN FACT DISPROPORTIONATE TO MANY OTHER STATES -- PEOPLE FROM THIS COMMUNITY HAVE BLED FOR AN DIED FOR. THIS CENTURY CITY IS AN EXTRAORDINARY PLACE, IT IS A COMMUNITY, IT OUTNUMBERS IN FACT IN POPULATION OTHER STATES, AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE IDEALS OF ONE PERSON, ONE VOTE, NO TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION, THAT ALL OF THESE ARE RIGHTS BEING DENIED FELLOW AMERICANS. WHERE IS THE HONOR IN THAT? VETERANS AND SERVICE MEMBERS LIVING HERE IN D.C. WHO DID INDEED FIGHT FOR US, PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE FOR US, BUT DO NOT HAVE EQUAL CITIZENSHIP RIGHTS. THE PEOPLE OF D.C. PAY BOTH LOCAL AND FEDERAL TAXES, THEY GO TO HELP THE PEOPLE IN RED STATES AND BLUE STATES, THEY ARE A CITY THAT PAYS MORE TAXES THAN THEY'RE NECESSARILY RECEIVING BACK, BUT WHEN THE PEOPLE OF D.C. NEED HELP, WHEN THEY NEED AN ADVOCATE WITH VOTING POWER, THEY DON'T HAVE ONE IN THIS BODY. OR IN THE ONE ACROSS THE HALL. THE OF REPRESENTATION REALLY HAS CONSEQUENCES, SERIOUS ONES. IT SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASES D.C.'S LEVERAGE INEST GOING LAWS PASSED AND -- IN GETTING LAWS PASSED. WE SAW THIS FIRSTHAND IN THE FIRST COVID-19 STIMULUS BILL. WASHINGTON, D.C., RECEIVED $725 MILLION LESS IN CRITICAL AID THAN OTHER LESS POPULOUS STATES. THAT WAS FUNDING NEEDED FOR WASHINGTON, D.C., FIRST RESPONDERS, FOR COVID-19 TESTS, AND OTHER IMPORTANT LIFESAVING SERVICES. THEY WERE TREATED AS SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS. HOW IS THIS FAIR? HOW IS THIS JUST? HOW IS THIS SACRED HONOR? AND HOW CAN THIS BE PARTISAN? THESE ARE SACROSANCT VALUES FOR THOSE OF US ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. THIS IS HOW OUR DEMOCRACY WAS INTENDED TO FUNCTION. THESE WERE SOME OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR. I'M HARD-PRESSED TO BELIEVE THAT MY COLLEAGUES ON EITHER SIDE OF THE AISLE DON'T RECOGNIZE THAT TO DENY THE PEOPLE OF WASHINGTON, D.C., REPRESENTATION IS CONTRARY TO THE VALUES THAT WE STATE REGULARLY ON THIS FLOOR. MAKING D.C. A STATE IS TRULY A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE. AND IT'S ALSO AN ISSUE OF RACIAL JUSTICE. D.C. IS A MAJORITY-MINORITY CITY AND THE PEOPLE OF THIS CITY DESERVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY THAT OTHER LESS POPULATED STATES HAVE TO MAKE THEIR VOICES HEARD IN CONGRESS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY URGENT AS WE ARE SEEING SO MANY STATES AROUND THE COUNTRY ENACT SWEEPING VOTING LAWS INTENDED TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR THE D.C. MAJORITY -- BLACK AND BROWN FOLKS -- TO EVEN VOTE. AS UNITED STATES SENATORS, WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION NOT JUST TO PASS LAWS BUT TO BE STEWARDS OF DEMOCRATIC IDEALS AND PRINCIPLES. WE TOOK AN OATH TO THAT. MAKING D.C. A STATE IS NOT JUST A MATTER OF CIVIL RIGHTS FOR D.C., IT'S ABOUT ALL OF US BECAUSE OUR DEMOCRACY WILL ONLY SURVIVE AS LONG AS ITS TRUE REPRESENTATION IS THAT OF ALL OF ITS PEOPLE, THAT TRULY WE KNOW IN THIS NATION, AS HAS BEEN SAID BY GREATER LEADERS BEFORE US, THAT INJUSTICE ANYWHERE IS A THREAT TO JUSTICE EVERYWHERE. THE PEOPLE OF D.C. HAVE MADE CLEAR WHAT THEY WANT. SAYING IT LOUDLY, THEY DESERVE FULL CITIZENSHIP RIGHTS. THEY DESERVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE. THEY DESERVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE REPRESENTATION. THEY WANT TO BE THE 51st STATE. THEY SHOULD BE THE 51st STATE. MY PARENTS LIVED MANY YEARS IN THIS CITY. AND I HEARD ABOUT D.C. STATEHOOD AS A LITTLE BOY GROWING UP IN NEW JERSEY. FOR THEM, IT WAS A MATTER OF DIGNITY AND RESPECT. IT WAS A MATTER OF VALUING THIS COMMUNITY. AND  -- AND THE RICHNESS OF ITS PEOPLE. TO THEM IT IS A SHORTFALL IN THE EVOLUTION OF OUR DEMOCRACY THAT THE PEOPLE OF THIS GREAT CITY SHOULD BE DENIED THE VERY IDEALS THAT ARE WRITTEN ON THE JEFFERSON MEMORIAL. I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO MOVE ON THIS AND TO GRANT THIS D.C. STATEHOOD AND TO AFFORD THEM THE SACRED HONOR THAT ALL AMERICANS DESERVE. I YIELD THE FLOOR. THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE SENATOR FROM VIRGINIA. MR. KAINE: MR. PRESIDENT, I'M THRILLED TO RISE AND JOIN MY COLLEAGUES IN PRESSING THE CASE FOR D.C. STATEHOOD. I WON'T BE LONG BECAUSE I WAS ON THE FLOOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO TALKING ABOUT THIS SAME MATTER, AND I REALLY TALKED ABOUT VIRGINIA, AND I TALKED ABOUT PATRICK HENRY. THE PHRASE NO TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION IS A PHRASE THAT WE LEARN COME UP IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. THE ROOT OF IT ISN'T REALLY AT THE BEGINNING OF SAY THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE OR DURING THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR. THAT PHRASE REALLY CAME ABOUT AS COLUMNIST RALLIED TO OPPOSE THE STAMP ACT. THE STAMP ACT WAS AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT IN 1765 THAT PUT A TAX ON PAPER GOODS, INCLUDING NEWSPAPERS AND PAMPHLETS AND PERIODICALS, THE ENGLISH CROWN WAS GETTING VERY, VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE REST OF NATURE OF AMERICANS PRESSING THEIR CASE FOR BEING TREATED EQUALLY AS -- AS LOYAL COLONISTS AND SUBJECTS OF THE CROWN, BUT THEY WERE NOT HAPPY WITH THE WAY THEY WERE BEING TREATED. AND THE STAMP ACT WAS NOT JUST AN AACT TO -- TO LEVY ATTACKS BUT TO SHUT DOWN DISCUSSIONS. PATRICK HENRY LED AN EFFORT IN THE VIRGINIA ASSEMBLY IN 1765 THAT BECAME TO BE KNOWN AS THE FOUR RESOLVES. HE PUT FIVE RESOLVES ON THE TABLE BUT FOUR PASSED AND THE CORE OF THE FOUR RESOLVES WAS TO PASS TAKESSATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION. NEVER TO HAVE HEARD PATRICK HENRY, ALTHOUGH I'VE HEARD GOOD PATRICK HENRY IMITATIONS, THE GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH ON THE VERGE OF THE UNITED STATES DECLARING INDEPENDENCE, HIS COURT ADVOCACY AS A RELATIVELY UNTRAINED LAWYER IN VIRGINIA ON BEHALF OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM SO THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT PART OF THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH OF ENGLAND COULD PRACTICE THEIR FAITH AS THEY CHOSE. MANY BELIEVED THAT HENRY'S ADVOCACY AGAINST THE STAMP ACT WAS HIS MOST POWERFUL OARORY. I READ EXCERPTS FROM THE RESOLVES FROM THREE WEEKS ONLINE, BUT NOW I WANT TO JUMP FROM PATRICK HENRY TO SOMEBODY ELSE AND THAT IS FREDERICK DOUGLASS. IF D.C. BECOMES A STATE, IT WILL BECOME A STATE NAMED IN HONOR OF THE BE ABOLITIONIST FREDERICK DOUGLASS. HE WAS ENSLAVED FOR THE FIRST 20 YEARS OF HIS LIFE AND FOLLOWING THE CIVIL WAR HE MOVED TO THE NATION'S CAPITOL TO BECOME SO MANY THINGS, DIPLOMAT, CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER, CONFIDANTE OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN AND GRANT AND OTHERS. IN HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY, HE WROTE, QUOTE, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IS THE ONE SPOT WHERE THERE IS NO GOVERNMENT FOR THE PEOPLE, OF THE PEOPLE, AND BY THE PEOPLE. ITS CITIZENS SUBMITTED TO RULERS TO WHOM THEY'VE HAD NO CHOICE IN SELECTING. THEY OBEY LAWS IN WHICH THEY HAD NO VOICE IN MAKING, PLENTY OF TAXATION, BUT NO REPRESENTATION. IN THE GREAT POLITICS OF THE COUNTRY, THEY CAN MARCH WITH NEITHER ARMY, NEITHER PARTY BUT ARE REGULATED TO THE POSITION OF NEUTERS, THAT IS PATRICK HENRY'S SPEECH EARLIER AGAINST THE STAMP ACT. THOSE WORDS ARE AS TRUE TODAY WHEN HE WROTE THEM AND THEY WERE AS TRUE WHEN HE WROTE THEM AS WHEN PATRICK HENRY DELIVERED THEM IN 1765. THE HISTORY OF MOST STATES COMING INTO THE UNION, THERE ARE SOME COMMON THEMES ANNUAL THE TWO COMMONALITIES, BUT THEN THERE'S ONE QUIRK THAT I WANT TO MENTION AS I CONCLUDE. THE TWO COMMONALITIES ARE THAT STATES COME INTO THE UNION WHEN THEY ACHIEVE SUFFICIENT POPULATION AND WHEN THEY HAVE A DEMONSTRATED DESIRE THAT IS NOT JUST TEMPORARY BUT ESSENTIALLY FIXED AND PERMANENT. IN THE MID-1800'S, CONGRESS WOULD SET A POPULATION DEADLINE, SAY FOR EXAMPLE IN THE NORTHWEST TERRITORIES, MICHIGAN WAS TOLD AS SOON AS YOU GET TO 60,000 RESIDENTS, WE WILL ENTERTAIN YOU IF YOU WANT TO BE A STATE BUT YOU HAVE TO DO A REFERENDUM. THERE IS NO MINIMUM NUMBER TO BECOME A STATE, BUT WE WOULD AGREE THAT D.C. WOULD PASS ANY MINIMUM BECAUSE D.C. IS LARGER THAN STATES THAT ARE PART OF THE UNION. WHATEVER CRITERIA YOU MIGHT SET YOU NEED TO BE A SUFFICIENT SIZE TO BE A STATE, D.C. HAS MET THAT. D.C. HAS DEMONSTRATED WHERE THE OVERWHELMING CERTAINTIMENT OF D.C., -- SENTIMENT OF D.C., AS YOU WOULD EXPECT, IS A PATRIOTIC SENTIMENT. WE WANT TO BE A STATE OF THE GREATEST COUNTRY ON EARTH. THOSE TWO CRITERIA HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT FOR STATES HAVING DEMONSTRATED THAT OR TERRITORIES OR POPULATIONS THAT HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT TO BECOME PART OF THE UNION AND HAVE THEIR STAR ADDED TO THE FLAG OF THIS COUNTRY. THERE HAVE BEEN CONTROVERSIES, THOUGH, BLUNTLY, WHEN STATES HAVE SIZABLE MINORITY POPULATIONS. THE QUEST OF HAWAII FOR STATEHOOD TOOK LONGER THAN IT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BECAUSE MANY MEMBERS OF THIS BODY STOOD ON THE FLOOR AND EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER HAWAII COULD BE A CULTURAL MATCH FOR THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OF THE PREDOMINANT A.P.I. AND INDIGENOUS POPULATION AND I'M SAD TO SAY THAT SOME OF THOSE WHO TOOK THE FLOOR AND RAISED THOSE QUESTIONS AN OBJECTIONS WERE FROM VIRGINIA. THE STATE OF NEW MEXICO HAD A PARTICULARLY ROCKY PATH TO BECOMING A STATE BECAUSE MEMBERS OF THIS BODY, INCLUDING FROM VIRGINIA, TOOK THE FLOOR AND RAISED THE QUESTION ABOUT THE SIZE, THE POPULATION, THE PERCENTAGE OF NEW MEXICO'S INDIGENOUS AND LATINO POPULATION. ABOUT 46% OF THE POPULATION OF D.C. IS AFRICAN AMERICAN. FOLKS WHO MANY MARCH IN THE FOOTSTEPS AND QUEST FOR THE SAME EQUALITY THAT FREDERICK FREDERIS WAS QUESTING FOR IN THE 1800'S. I HOPE THAT WE CAN SHOW THAT THE FAILURES OF THE PAST THAT LED STATEHOOD FOR NEW MEXICO AND HAWAII TO TAKE PERHAPS LONGER THAN SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE CASE, I HOPE WE WILL HAVE LEARNED SOMETHING FROM THAT AND CAN MOVE FINALLY TO GRANT THESE 700,000 PLUS RESIDENTS OF THIS WONDERFUL CITY IN OUR NATION'S CAPITAL THE ABILITY TO BE STATES. THE LAST THING I WILL A SAY IS THIS AND I SAID THIS ON THE FLOOR THREE MONTHS AGO. WE HAVEN'T ADDED A STATE, WE HAVEN'T ADDED A STAR TO OUR FLAG NOW FOR ABOUT 70 YEARS NOW. I DON'T THINK A FIXED NUMBER OF STARS ON THE FLAG SENDS A MESSAGE OF A GROWING, THRIVING NATION. I THINK IT MIGHT SEND THE MESSAGE OF A NATION THAT'S KIND OF FIXED. AND WHEN YOU'RE FIXED AND SET AND NOT GOING TO CHANGE, I BELIEVE THAT CAN ALMOST SEND A LITTLE BIT OF MESSAGE OF DECLINE. THROUGHOUT OUR NATION'S HISTORY THE ADDITION OF STARS TO THE FLAG HAS SENT THE MESSAGE OF AN AMERICAN WE'RE NOT DONE GROWING, WE'RE NOT DONE EXPANDING, WE'RE ON THE MOVE. HISTORY ISN'T DONE WITH US YET, AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVEN'T ADDED A STATE -- THIS HAS BEEN THE LONGEST PERIOD OF TIME IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES WHERE WE HAVEN'T ADDED A STAR TO THE FLAG AND I THINK DOING SO WOULD SUGGEST VERY POWERFULLY THAT THE BEST DAYS OF OUR NATION AREN'T BEHIND US, THEY ARE STILL AHEAD OF US. AND SO FOR THESE REASONS AND THOSE ARTICULATED BY MY COLLEAGUES, I STRONGLY SUPPORT THE EFFORT FOR D.C. IS IT STATEHOOD AND I YIELD THE FLOOR. A SENATOR: MR. PRESIDENT. THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE SENATOR FROM MARYLAND. MR. VAN HOLLEN: MR. PRESIDENT, I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE SENIOR SENATOR FROM DELAWARE FOR HIS LONG-TIME PERSISTENCE IN MAKING SURE THAT THIS CONGRESS ULTIMATELY DOES THE RIGHT THING AND MAKES THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA THE 51st STATE. I WANT TO THANK CONGRESSWOMAN ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON FOR HELPING THE PEOPLE OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA SO ABLY. SHE DESERVES A VOTE IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE 50 STATES. AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA DESERVES TWO SENATORS RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS, AND I WANT TO THANK PRESIDENT BIDEN FOR SAYING IF THIS SENATE WILL JUST GET THIS BILL TO HIS DESK, HE WILL SIGN THAT PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA ARE REPRESENTED AS EVERY OTHER CITIZEN IN THE 50 STATES IS CURRENTLY REPRESENTED. ALL OF US COME TO THIS FLOOR AND WE HEAR OUR COLLEAGUES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF DEMOCRACY OVERSEAS. WE CRITICIZE CHINA RIGHTLY WHEN IT BEGINS TO SNUFF OUT THE RIGHT TO VOTE. IN HONG KONG, WE CRITICIZE THE AUTHORITARIAN RULERS IN BELARUS WHEN THEY CLAMP DOWN ON FREEDOM. WE LOOK AROUND THE WORLD AND WE TRY TO ESTABLISH A STANDARD FOR STANDING UP FOR THE PRINCIPLE OF DEMOCRACY. WE'RE NOT ALWAYS CONSISTENT. WE'RE NOT ALWAYS CONSTANT IN THAT MESSAGE, BUT WE MAKE AN EFFORT TO DO THAT. WE NEED TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND MAKE THAT SAME EFFORT RIGHT HERE AT HOME. I HEAR SOL OF MY COLLEAGUES -- SO MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF DEMOCRACY AROUND THE WORLD, BUT WHEN IT COMES TO GRANTING THE PEOPLE OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA THE FULL RIGHTS TO DEMOCRACY, THE RIGHT TO VOTES IN THE SENATE AND A VOTE IN THE HOUSE HOUSE, THEY ARE NOT THERE. THE PEOPLE OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA ARE FED UP AND TIRED OF THE HYPOCRISY. THEY ARE EVEN MORE FED UP ABOUT WHAT MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE, THE SENATOR FROM VIRGINIA, WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT. THE FACT THAT THEY CONTRIBUTE IN EVERY WAY TO OUR COUNTRY BUT ARE DENIED THE RIGHT TO HAVE VOTING REPRESENTATION IN THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE. THE SENATOR FROM VIRGINIA SAID, AND OTHERS HAVE SAID, A FOUNDING PRINCIPLE OF OUR REVOLUTION WAS THE IDEA THAT NOBODY SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION. THE SENATOR FROM VIRGINIA TALKED ABOUT PATRICK HENRY, AND THERE ARE OTHERS THAT WE KNOW ESTABLISHED THAT PRINCIPLE, AND YET HERE IN THE NATION'S CAPITAL, THE PEOPLE OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA PAY HIGHER TAXES THAN THOSE IN 22 OTHER STATES AND YET THEY DON'T HAVE A VOTE IN THE HOUSE OR TWO SENATORS REPRESENT THEM. THEY ALSO HAD PEOPLE WHO SERVED IN EVERY ONE OF OUR WARS WHO SPILLED BLOOD FOR THIS COUNTRY, AND YET WHILE THEY HELPED TO PROTECT OUR DEMOCRACY FROM THREATS ABROAD, THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT HERE IN OUR DEMOCRACY TO CAST THOSE VOTES FOR VOTING REPRESENTATIVES IN THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE. MR. PRESIDENT, THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE. WE KNOW IT SHOULDN'T BE. WE KNOW THAT IF EVERY MEMBER PUT ON A BLINDFOLD AND JUST SAID THE PEOPLE OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA DESERVE A VOTE WITHOUT THINKING OF THE POLITICAL OUTCOME, THE PEOPLE OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA WOULD HAVE A STATE, AS OTHERS HAVE POINTED OUT, TWO STATES HAVE SMALLER POPULATIONS BUT THEY HAVE TWO SENATORS WHO CAN CAST VOTES HERE IN THIS CHAMBER. THE STATE OF WYOMING AND THE STATE OF VERMONT, BOTH SMALLER POPULATION-WISE THAN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, BUT THEY HAVE THOSE RIGHTS AND REPRESENTATIVES HERE IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. SO WE SHOULD MOVE FORWARD WITH THE STATE OF WASHINGTON, DOUGLASS COMMONWEALTH, AND TO HEAR OUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES OPPOSE THIS IDEA SINCE THEY DON'T WANT TO TAKE IT ON THE PRINCIPLE OF DEMOCRACY, WE'VE HEARD SOME ABSURD REASONS GIVEN FOR WHY THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA SHOULD NOT BE A STATE. HERE ARE A FEW, AND IF ANYBODY DOUBTS THAT REPUBLICAN MEMBERS IN THE HOUSE OR SENATOR HAVE SAID THESE THINGS, I'LL BE HAPPY TO SHOW IT TO YOU. WE'VE HEARD FROM MEMBERS OF CONGRESS THAT PEOPLE IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA DON'T DESERVE STATEHOOD BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE A LANDFILL. WE'VE HEARD THAT THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA SHOULDN'T BE GIVEN STATEHOOD BECAUSE IT NEEDS MORE CAR DEALERSHIPS. AT FIRST THEY SAID IT CAN'T BE A STATE BECAUSE IT HAS NO CAR DEALERSHIPS BUT NOW IT DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH OF THEM. OTHERS HAVE SAID, WELL, BECAUSE IT LACKS A MINING INDUSTRY, HOW COULD IT POSSIBLY BE A STATE? AND THEN MOST RECENTLY WE HEARD THAT IT WOULD BE UNFAIR -- UNFAIR TO GIVE THE PEOPLE OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA STATEHOOD BECAUSE THEIR REPRESENTATIVES WOULD HAVE AND YOU FAIR ADVANTAGE. THEY WOULD HAVE SPECIAL SUPERPOWERS BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE SO CLOSE TO THIS CAPITOL THAT THEY'D SOMEHOW BE ABLE TO GET AN UNFAIR LEG UP ON EVERYBODY ELSE HERE IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. THESE ARE REASONS THAT REPUBLICAN HOUSE MEMBERS AND GIVEN FOR DENYING THE PEOPLE OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA THE RIGHT TO STATEHOOD. WE ALL KNOW WHAT THEY ARE. IT'S JUST A WALL OF EXCUSES TRYING TO OBFUSCATE AND PREVENT US FROM GETTING TO THE MAIN ISSUE. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE PRINCIPLE OF DEMOCRACY, CHANGE THE SUBJECT. THE REAL CONCERN, AS WE KNOW, IS THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA WILL CAST VOTES FOR REPRESENTATIVES IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE THAT THEY THINK BEST REFLECT THEIR INTERESTS, AND THEY BELIEVE THAT IN THE CURRENT SITUATION, THOSE SEATS WILL GO TO DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS IN THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE. AND AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID, THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IS COMPRISED OF A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE OF COLOR, AND THE SENATOR FROM VIRGINIA TALKED ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THAT HAVING BEEN AN IMPEDIMENT TO THE ADMISSION OF SOME OTHER STATES IN THE PAST BEFORE THE COUNTRY DID THE RIGHT THING. MR. PRESIDENT, WE HAVE THE POWER TO DO THE RIGHT THING. I HAVE HERE A LETTER FROM 39 CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLARS AFFIRMING OUR AUTHORITY TO MAKE THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA THE 51st STATE. WE SHOULD DO IT. FREDERICK DOUGLASS ONCE NOTED THAT THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA WAS, QUOTE, ONE SPOT WHERE THERE IS NO GOVERNMENT FOR THE PEOPLE, OF THE PEOPLE, AND BY THE PEOPLE. HIS WORDS ARE A CALL FROM HISTORY, A CALL THAT DEMANDS THAT WE REFLECT ON THIS ACT OF SELECTIVE DISENFRANCHISEMENT THAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING FOR GENERATIONS AND WHICH IS STILL HAPPENING TO THIS DAY RIGHT OUTSIDE OF THIS BUILDING RIGHT NOW. LET US CHANGE THAT TODAY. LET US CHANGE THAT AND MAKE THIS THE 51st STATE AND NAME IT IN HONOR OF FREDERICK DOUGLASS. I YIELD THE FLOOR. MR. CARDIN: MR. PRESIDENT. THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE SENATOR FROM MARYLAND. MR. CARDIN: I FIRST WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE AND FRIEND, SENATOR CARPER, FOR LEADING THIS EFFORT ON S. 51, THE D.C. STATEHOOD ACT. IT'S LONG OVERDUE THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE AN INJUSTICE IN OUR COUNTRY AND GIVE THE CITIZENS OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA THEIR FULL REPRESENTATION RIGHTS BY STATEHOOD. I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE FOR A LONG TIME. WHEN I WAS SPEAKER OF THE MARYLAND GENERAL ASSEMBLY ALMOST 40 YEARS AGO, THE MARYLAND GENERAL ASSEMBLY TOOK ACTION TO GIVE FULL REPRESENTATION TO THE PEOPLE OF THE DISTRICT AND THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES. THAT WAS 40 YEARS AGO, AND WE'RE STILL WORKING ON THIS ISSUE. IT'S LONG OVERDUE THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE A SHORTCOMING IN OUR OWN SYSTEM FOR 700,000 RESIDENTS OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. I HAD THE HONORING OF CHAIRING THE U.S. HELSINKI COMMISSION. IT'S THE IMPLEMENTING ARM FOR THE HELSINKI FINAL ACT, THE ORGANIZATION FOR SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE. IT HAS MEMBERSHIP OF ALL THE COUNTRIES OF EUROPE AND THE FORMER SOVIET UNION, CENTRAL ASIA, CANADA, AND THE UNITED STATES. I MENTION THAT BECAUSE IN 1975, THOSE COUNTRIES ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT ON BASIC FUNDAMENTAL DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO HAVE REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT. THAT DOCUMENT ALSO GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY AND OBLIGATION TO QUESTION WHETHER MEMBER STATES ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE HELSINKI FINAL ACT, AND QUITE FRANKLY WE HAVE USED THAT OPPORTUNITY TO RAVISHES IN COUNTRIES, AND OUR PRESIDING OFFICER HAS BEEN VERY AGGRESSIVE IN HIS COMMENTS ABOUT RUSSIA. WE USE THAT TO BRING UP THAT RUSSIA VIOLATED THE COMMITMENTS OF THE HELSINKI FINAL ACT WHEN IT INVADED UKRAINE, TOOK OVER CRIMEA, AND STILL INTERFERING WITH THE SOVEREIGNTY OF UKRAINE. WE OFFERED OUR OBJECTIONS WHEN RUSSIA'S GOVERNMENT STEPS ON THE RIGHTS -- THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY. NAVALNY, THE OPPOSITION LEADER BEING IMPRISONED AND TORTURED. THAT'S A VIOLATION OF THE HELSINKI FINAL ACT. WE RAISED THOSE ISSUES. WE RAISED THOSE ISSUES ABOUT ANOTHER MEMBER STATE IN TURKEY WHEN THEY JAILED JOURNALISTS OR FAILED THE CIVIL SOCIETY AN STUDENT TO BE HEARD, VIOLATIONS OF THE HELSINKI FINAL ACT. BUT FOR US TO HAVE CREDIBILITY IN RAISING THESE ISSUES WITH OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE VIOLATING THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES, WE HAVE TO SELF-EVALUATE WHERE WE ARE. IF WE ARE GOING TO BE LEADERS, WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR OWN SHORTCOMINGS AND TAKE STEPS TO ELIMINATE THOSE SHORTCOMINGS. AND QUITE FRANKLY, MR. PRESIDENT, WE ARE AN OUTLIER WHEN IT COMES TO THE REPRESENTATION FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. WE HAVE VIOLATED THEIR BASIC RIGHTS. WE ARE THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHERE CITIZENS OF THEIR CAPITAL DO NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE FOR REPRESENTATIVES IN THE NATIONAL LEGISLATURE. THAT'S NOT A DISTINCTION THAT WE WANT TO HAVE. FOR THE 700,000 PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THE DISTRICT, THEY ARE BEING DENIED REPRESENTATION IN THEIR GOVERNMENT. AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT, IT'S LARGER THAN SOME OF OUR STATES. THOSE STATES THAT HAVE FEWER PEOPLE HAVE TWO UNITED STATES SENATORS, AND AS A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, THE PEOPLE OF THE DISTRICT SHOULD BE LIKEWISE TREATED. AND THIS IS NOT A MATTER OF POLITICS. THIS IS A MATTER OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. AMERICA'S STRENGTH IN OUR VALUES, WHO WE ARE AS A PEOPLE, OUR ABILITY TO LEAD GLOBALLY DEPENDS UPON US DOING THE RIGHT THING AT HOME. WE NEED TO GIVE THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA THAT STATUS. THE HOUSE HAS ALREADY DONE THIS. THEY HAVE PASSED H.R. 1 -- 51. THEY HAVE DONE THIS. THEY HAVE GIVEN THE BILL TO US. ALL WE NEED TO DO NOW IS TAKE IT UP AND PASS IT. SO LET US ACT NOW AT LONG LAST AND DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE DISTRICT AND DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE OF OUR NATION BY CORRECTING THIS VIOLATION THAT WE HAVE IN OUR SYSTEM. AND LET'S PASS S. 51 LED BY SENATOR CARPER, D.C. STATEHOOD, AND MAKE SURE THAT AMERICA CONTINUES TO LEAD IN DEMOCRATIC VALUES AROUND THE WORLD. WITH THAT, MR. P

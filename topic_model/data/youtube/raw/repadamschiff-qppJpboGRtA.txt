the committee's case here with me now exclusively is the man leading the next hearing intelligence committee chairman and member of the january 6 committee adam schiff thank you so much for joining me we do already know a lot about georgia including that phone call we just played what are you going to reveal new about georgia and also arizona you know like most the other hearings there will be a combination of things that are already in the public arena and a lot of new information and what i think is most significant is we will weave it together tell the public how one thing led to another one pressure campaign as we saw last week on the vice president to ignore the constitution put the vice president's life in danger and this week we'll hear about how a similar pressure campaign directed against state local elections officials put their lives in danger and similarly the president was told this scheme is essentially uh something that his own lawyers couldn't justify but yet he pressed on uprooted people's lives put their lives and our democracy very much at risk your hearing will include evidence about trump electors and battleground states who submitted fake electoral college ballots even though trump lost these states that we're talking about we have already heard that campaign officials trump campaign officials were involved in that do you have evidence that the former president himself was involved yes we'll show evidence of the president's involvement in this scheme we'll also again show evidence about what his own lawyers came to think about this scheme and we'll show courageous state officials who stood up and said they wouldn't go along with this plan to either call legislatures back into session or decertify the results for joe biden the system held because a lot of state and local elections officials upheld their oath their constitution a lot of the republicans as well as democrats just to be clear you said you have evidence that the then president was involved in putting a fake slate of electors out there do you do you have evidence that he directed it um you know i don't want to get ahead of our hearing we'll show during hearing what the president's role was in trying to get states to name alternate slates of electors how uh that scheme depended uh initially on hopes that the legislatures would reconvene and bless it will we see that he directed it and they pressed forward with it anyway will we will we see that he directed it um i don't want to get ahead of what we're showing during the hearing but we will show you uh what we know about his role in this your committee sent a letter to jenny thomas the wife of supreme court justice clarence thomas the letter went out on thursday asking for her testimony you obtained communication between jenny thomas and the lawyer plotting to overturn the election john eastman what questions do you have for her well we want to know what she knows what her involvement was in this plot to overturn the election she has said that she is willing to come in and testify voluntarily we're glad to hear that um really anyone with pertinent information uh we want to hear from and so we have a range of questions to ask her obviously i think the committee will be interested among other things whether this was discussed with justice thomas given that he was ruling on cases impacting whether we would get some of this information if you find the answer to that question is yes do you agree with some of your democratic colleagues like ilhan omar and alexandria ocasio-cortez that justice thomas should resign or perhaps should be impeached well i i think that at a minimum it suggests and i think we know enough to say this already that justice thomas to avoid even the appearance of impropriety should have nothing to do with any cases relating to january 6. uh particularly we're getting regarding our investigation um because you know we want our justices to uphold a standard that goes beyond what's lawful or unlawful to avoiding either the appearance of a conflict or impropriety congresswoman zoe lofgren told my colleague jake tapper this week that some information has been provided on a confidential basis from your committee to the justice department you know this i'm sure you're hearing this so many people watching your committee hearings are asking what is going to come of this is the justice department going to file criminal charges first question is why haven't you given everything over to the justice department that they are asking for and they say they need in order to potentially do that i don't think congress has ever done that and i've been participating now in several investigations uh where there have been parallel investigations done by the justice department congress never says hey just department uh other branch of government just come and go through our files we also don't say hey we want to go over and just rifle through your files um when the just department asks for things specifically hey you know we're looking at a case uh we're investigating this person can you give us what you have we work with them and we'll work with them here you know i do want to point out the justice department has the subpoena power too they can convene a grand jury they can bring in witnesses uh traditionally they don't wait for congress to do that work for the department uh so we're going to work with them we want them to be successful in bringing people to justice but i can't go into the private conversation have you seen evidence that the justice department has already opened an investigation into the former president um i you know just looking at the public record i have not seen for example uh grand juries convene in places where i would think they would be convened if they were looking at some of the conduct for example that judge carter in california wrote he believed that donald trump was engaged in multiple uh uh acts that violate the criminal laws you've been critical of the justice department for moving slowly if you've done so much work why not help them out well you know we certainly will help them uh we want them to particularize what they're asking for uh and it's our intention when we conclude our investigation to uh make public our our uh findings uh in great detail but we you know we have a job to do as well and we are doing that and we're doing this consistent with how um the our branch of government has operated and executive branches operated we've seen a lot of taped testimony from the hundreds even more of closed door testimony that you've done as a committee but why aren't you calling witnesses in a public way who might challenge the committee is that intentional because you don't want to deviate from the story line that you're trying to present to the public and of course potentially to the justice department no i mean we we are interviewing frankly anyone that has relevant evidence we're putting that relevant evidence before the public and we're doing it in a way that uh um is the most cohesive and that we can get across the zillion points to the public so like why not subpoena mike pence for example if he won't i know you asked him to testify voluntarily that didn't happen um you know we're not taking anything off the table in terms of witnesses who have not yet testified we would still i think like to have several high-profile people come before a committee but at the moment i can't disclose what private conversations may or may not be going on with with respect to certain individuals but there are still key people we have not interviewed that we would like to so mike pence is a possibility still uh you know certainly a possibility we're not excluding anyone or anything at this point mr chairman thank you so much and happy father's day thank you very much

um outfitting has joined us by webex i want to thank cinderellas for allowing him to slip ahead uh alex if you're there please go ahead thank thank you mr chairman appreciate the accommodation as i think all my colleagues can appreciate we have a his markup in a few minutes so i will submit most of my questions uh afterwards for the record but wanted the opportunity to raise at least one issue with mr regan today last week just last week scientists from noaa and princeton university published new research modeling the impacts of wildfire smoke in the west research found that westerners particularly residents of northern california my home state could see particle pollution from wildfires increased by more than 50 percent by the year 2050. so that's actually in the relative near term and potentially triple by the end of the century it also found that not only is climate change making wildfires more frequent and certainly more catastrophic but climate change drives other air conditions like air stagnation which further uh increases dirty air the state of california and the federal government in partnership have made a lot of progress to ensure that our communities can breathe clean air like working in partnership to cut air pollutants from vehicles but we have a lot more to do to mitigate against the harmful impacts of wildfire smoke uh which is why this study uh was so critical and shows that it's uh only getting worse so my question is this is administrator regan i was glad to see that in the fiscal year 23 budget re uh request includes 6.5 million dollars for a wildfire prevention and readiness program to identify to predict and communicate when and where smoke events are occurring i was hoping you can just spend a minute elaborating on what the epa's plans are for uh how to implement those dollars well thank you for the question and we know that uh the the public depends on us to provide trusted information about air quality conditions and the health impacts before during and after these fire and smoke events so we do the research to build the tools needed to understand those impacts on air quality but also water quality and health epa's air now website and mobile app received over 13 million page views in 2021 and so we're improving that map so that users can view in real time and learn about actions that they can take personal actions they can take to reduce their exposure uh you know we're also working on uh improving notification planning and when feasible advanced notice of smoke events so so our budget requests support the need for improved readiness by enhancing our wildfire data data and communication but also to enhance the technical capabilities uh that we desire to push that information out to those who need it the most we have so many parents so many mothers who when they drop their kids off at school during a wildfire event want to know if their children are safe at school can they go out for a jog during the day we want to be able to provide that data in real time so that families don't have to have their entire lives altered during and after these wildfire events as it relates to the smoke inhalation and impacts to to public health well thank you for your response look forward to uh following up with you on this topic and the others that we'll submit for the record thank you mr chair that

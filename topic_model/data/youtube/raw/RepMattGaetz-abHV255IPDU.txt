never watch this guy in television all were not telling the truth and you should not be true Harrison Matt Gaetz thank you for what you did for your country today you've ended with the Democratic whip not House Republicans like a machine Matt Gaetz welcome to hot takes this is congressman Matt gates let's talk about the news and let's specifically talk about judge Emmett Sullivan this is the judge in the Michael Flynn case who you're hearin has done just a spectacularly bizarre thing he has quite literally out sourced the prosecution of Michael Flynn to Democrat donors to legal partisans it's like judge Emmett Sullivan is crowdsourcing the prosecution of Michael Flynn it's I've never seen anything like it but let's go back and just get some context for why Michael Flynn is even in this mess in the first place so the Obama administration is going out the Trump administration is coming in and if you remember the Obama administration was really trying to do everything possible to provoke Russia at this time and I think one reason is that Donald Trump's election was a total shock to the political system that the media the Democrats and even some Republicans like couldn't accept that Donald Trump won the election so it had to be Russia it Russia had to be the reason that everybody got this so wrong that you know the media got it wrong the political industrial complex got it wrong so this is obviously creating great strain on the relationship Flynn has been selected to be the incoming national security adviser and so he has a discussion with the Russian ambassador to essentially preserve the status quo not to allow the outgoing administration to create an escalation that would then limit the options that President Trump and his team would have you know if you recall at that time North Korea is a situation where we need Russia's help Syria is a situation where we have to deconflict with Russia with what's going on on the border with Turkey there was Russian involvement and a need to have at least productive log and Flynn didn't want to see that eroded so he has this discussion now the Obama administration new bid Flynn had this discussion Jim Comey's FBI was aware of it and what the notes that we've only seen disclosed during Cova drivel to us is that those FBI agents went over there not to investigate Flynn for being a traitor to our country but to try to catch him in a gotcha moment to try to create circumstances that would require his resignation or his departure from the administration because he was somebody that Obama didn't like and we know that Obama was personally involved in that because Obama said so to trump that he didn't want to see Flynn carry to the next administration and so we know Obama was involved involved to the point of even having a discussion with Trump about it and and and that really raises you know raises the question how involved was Biden you know you see Biden in the unmasking documents and we'll get that to it into a moment but it really creates a creates a heck of a circumstance for Biden so Flynn has this discussion he gets set up they then threatened his son with prosecution Flynn takes a plea he then gets Sidney Powell as his attorney and she has just done a fantastic job laying out the case getting the research and she blows the whole thing open she exposes this as an insincere prosecution as an invalid plea deal and bill bars Department of Justice rightly decides that they want to drop the case so you've got the government wanting to drop the Flynn case and obviously Flynn would like to see the matter resolved but the judge is in house has now appointed retired federal judge Gleason to come in and argue positions submitted by I guess anyone who wants to come in and and trash Michael Flynn but this is not how we administer criminal law in this country you don't just crowdsource a prosecution of someone because your politics don't align with the fact they were innocent all along and judge Edmund Sullivan is also acted bizarrely toward Flynn calling him a traitor to the country and and frankly I think that that this is something that would not withstand appellate review if it yielded anything other than a total and complete dismissal of Michael Flynn so we'll keep an eye on judge Sullivan nothing like I've ever seen before and and hopefully we don't live in a society where we crowdsource prosecutions and allow mob rule to govern over the discovered facts that show how rotten this investigation was at the outset [Music] a little bit of news from the state of Florida Governor Ron de Santos announcing that professional sports will be able to take hold again in our state and those activities can start resuming with team activities training and workouts and I've got to say I think Governor De Santis has done a fantastic job during the coronavirus in following the data and not the hysteria and I know at the beginning when De Santis wasn't racing with other governors to be the first to close down and lock down every element of our economy that the national media piled on him and then they really hoped in a lot of ways and in their reporting that Florida was going to be the next New York that we were going to have all these explosions of cases and people were going to be dying in the hospitals with lakhs of ventilators and the reality is in the state of Florida we've had very low community transition relative to other states don't know if that's a function of our population density if it's a function of whether but the reality is it has been lower acuity lower transmission in Florida and so of course nobody wants to give DeSantis credit in the media they don't want to say okay well you know maybe he was tuned in and dialed into what the scientific information was showing us instead they're saying well Florida you know maybe that's just a place where you know the humidity or whatever results in in covin not having the same impact and so if that's the case hey you know you all come as we like to say in the south and I am hopeful that the renewal of professional sports will just help our American spirit a little bit more and I know that there are a lot of us eager to get back to those things because it restores a sense of normalcy and so great to see the governor do that I hope it works out he's got my full support and I suspect that we'll be seeing and learning about other openings in the state of Florida I'm hopeful that the governor will open vacation rentals soon in our state so that people can visit and enjoy Florida I suspect that the governor is layering visitor entry into the state so that we could continue to watch the data and he asked my support in that and also he has my encouragement to get our vacation rental industry going because it's such an important part of the economy in Northwest Florida and throughout our great state warm national news I want to talk about Biden's name specifically being on the unmasking sheet so ambassador Rick Rennell we talked about him on a few other episodes at the pod he is a real just active guy in the administration he doesn't wait around he just gets right on the task at hand and it has been just years since we have really made these initial allegations about the highest levels of the Obama administration being involved in the corruption and in the targeting of people that they didn't like for their politics or because they had been involved with winning campaigns and with with the time president elect Trump to see that Joe Biden himself is on the list of people requesting the unmasking of Michael Flynn really is revealing about the sense of revenge that I think permeated the top levels of that White House and the resentment here was my commentary on the Sean Hannity I don't know what's worse for Joe Biden being implicated in that potential setup or being so without his faculties that he can't remember the meetings he can't remember being there and I think that that also creates sort of a political Chinese finger trap for a Biden either he's going to claim he was the super involved vice president and wants credit for all the things he think US thinks America loved about the Obama administration but if he does that he has to own these scandals these setups and this attempt by the Obama administration to undermine our democracy bad news for Joe Biden ahead remember Michael Flynn was a registered Democrat and in some ways these Democrats like what they go after their own even more when they flip sides and see the light and so you wouldn't even you see all these folks clap or Brennan Biden the chief of staff to President Obama involved in this you know it wasn't a one-off you know it wasn't just you know some quirky little thing that went awry this was part of a broader plan to destabilize confidence in President Trump and it's why we've got to have investigations I mean I'm I really want to encourage my good friend Lindsey Graham to pick up that gavel on the Judiciary Committee to start calling in the witnesses everybody's name who was on that unmasking sheet should be giving public testimony as soon as possible regarding why it was that they were so deeply involved in a bogus counterintelligence investigation from the White House as they were supposed to be helping and transitioning toward president Trump not doing everything they can to undermine him that needs to happen in the Senate Lindsey Graham has the power to do it and I sure hope you would follow thing I want to talk about today we saw news breaking late last night that the FBI has seized the cell phone of Senator Richard burr I have been the leading Republican critic of Senator burr in the United States Congress it is disgusting to me that senator Burr was able to engage in a stock sell-off with facts continuing to develop that seemed to increasingly incriminate him you'll remember unlike other senators Burr put out a statement saying he himself directed these trades you'll remember that he said on Fox News that he on their online platform that there was nothing to worry about with the coronavirus that our country was prepared that it wouldn't create this great shock to the system and then I think the evidence that may really get him is the familial contact after the news broke from Pro Publica that Senator Byrd's brother-in-law also was liquidating stocks the same day senator Burr was it started to seem that there was something more coordinated so the FBI has seized senator Burris cell phone with search warrants here is a my first commentary I provided on Tucker Carlson tonight regarding Senator Burke Richard Burr is a disgrace he should be removed as the intelligence chairman immediately as a result of this conduct and as Republicans in the Trump era we have an obligation to say that we do not want corrupt to be associated with our tribe and Republicans need to start stepping up and speaking out because what Richard Byrd did in the Senate stock sell-off is not something that we want our brand associated with and I didn't let up there I was back on the Tucker soon thereafter and we continued to beat the drum social distancing is not going to be a sufficient penalty for senator burr in the United States Senate he needs to be removed as the intelligence chairman you think about the gang of eight the group of people who review the most select intelligence in the world that group now includes Adam Schiff Richard Burr and Nancy Pelosi three of the lowest integrity people in the entire United States Congress so I think leader McConnell needs to take action here and hey maybe in the next relief bill Americans can choose 1200 bucks or stock tips from Senator Burr and senator Feinstein you know I don't believe in guilt by accusation but if he did something wrong he should face the consequences we should put America and the American people first not our own interests as we engage in our public service and in our public acts so thanks so much for listening we'll be back tomorrow with another episode of how it takes the mancakes [Music] you

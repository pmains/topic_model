deeper is Florida congresswoman Kat camek thank you so much for being with us today we always appreciate it hey glad to be with you thank you you know it's unbelievable we're seeing these videos here of record numbers cat and you know we know that Christmas is around the corner there's children here there's a humanitarian part to all of this still title 42 put in place by Trump was supposed to help with the coveted surge as we know as well what do you make of what what appears to be no plan in place to deal with what could be a potentially huge surge well to be honest I don't think that the bite Administration has ever had a plan other than to have an open border policy and as you hit on this is a humanitarian crisis this is a public health crisis this is a national security crisis and we are seeing now in in a couple of days title 42 which was truly the last remaining tool in the toolbox that our border patrol agents had to uphold some semblance of a law it's going to go away so what you're going to see is not 8 000 a day Crossing along the nine sectors along the Southwest border you're going to see 18 000 a day you think that the systems are being pushed to the Maxwell well just hold on because it's about to get 10 times worse what we need more than is to secure the Border enforce the laws on the books and give the resources to our border patrol agents so they know that we have their backs and they can do the job they signed up for and you know we have my orcas in El Paso today there's been calls for his impeachment but you know we've had a reaction like from Senator cornyn saying he hasn't really given it a thought is there still hope that when the republican-controlled uh GOP comes into office in January congresswoman that there could be a move to get uh impeachment started for my orcas absolutely listen I was dressed in El Paso a few weeks ago and since Alejandro mallorcas is there boots on the ground today I hope he goes and sees the 12 miles of border that is completely wide open a single age on the line and if he doesn't see that if he doesn't go to that area I need him to ask answer why why is it acceptable that there are stretches for miles and miles and miles where not a single agent is on the line instead they're back processing and babysitting that's unacceptable and to your question about impeachment the process that we need to go through to do this right and to actually get it done requires an investigation up front so Kevin McCarthy he has pledged that we will begin the investigation immediately at which point we will then be able to drop the impeachment papers and go forward without that investigation we cannot get the impeachment through the house and the Senate so we have to go through the process I know that there's a lot of uh people out there who say let's impeach right away way and trust me I want to more than anybody that said we need to show to the American people in as clear of day that this man has been negligent and he has been a risk to National Security so we have to go through the process and I'm excited for that uh yeah there is a process of course um and I think a lot of people along the border are looking forward to that playing out and hopefully to help them I do want to since you spoke of Kevin McCarthy some challenges to his leadership as we just kind of talked about that 218 he wants to get to Andy Biggs is still vying as well has not pulled out there what are your thoughts on speaker McCarthy our greatest weapon against this liberal Progressive agenda is unity and so while we are having some really tough family discussions I'm encouraged I think we're seeing a process change here in Washington DC critical rules that have been needed to be modified for a long time to give more voices to conservative bases within the Republican party I have no doubt that come January 3rd Kevin McCarthy will have the votes and I do believe that he will be speaker come January 3rd and finally congresswoman you know Bona pivot a little bit to a story that's been capturing our attention Sam Brinton the non-binary Biden Administration first accused of taking a bag in Minnesota from a woman when he had not checked any luggage now charged in connection uh in Las Vegas with a similar crime again a bag that he has now seen on video holding again these are just allegations but he's no longer with the Department of energy they made so much about his higher checking a lot of boxes here what do you make of now his departure and the Silence from the administration on these alleged crime times absolutely insane that this person was hired and then granted a security clearance in the first place clearly they're more interested in a political woke agenda of checking boxes than actually people being qualified to do the job anyone who is parading around stealing uh luggage and create committing crimes certainly should not have a security clearance so this termination was long overdue and I wish we could get back to the point of hiring the best damn person for the job rather than checking a box that fits some political agenda yeah it seems like they're pretty good at checking boxes and maybe not so much checking CVS all the time congresswoman Kat kamek as always great to have you in thanks so much for your time today thank you so much have a good one you too

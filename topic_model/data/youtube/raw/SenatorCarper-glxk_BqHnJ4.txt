president the senior senator from Delaware president senator my colleague from Delhi are close friends and we ride a train same train together a lot of days come and go into the Delaware and I like to think we think alike and share a lot of the same same values and it was interesting that listening to his remarks about about Vernon Alston that actually reflect on track fairly closely with what I'm prepared to say but there's some differences and but I'm happy to be you with him and I think it's great that there were here and and I think we're also speaking for John Carney who's our congressmen and and who would if he could speak on his floor he would join us today as as well but mr. president I also want to join the senator Coons and you who sit in this chair almost every time I speak on the floor I don't know how this works out put good to see you and these new in these new pages that have joined us this this week manual you'll never have a chance to to meet who was a Capitol policeman for all gosh almost 20 years and Senator Coons has talked about and I'm going to say a few words about him and then we'll probably head to the train head for home and but let me just say a few things about Vernon Jay Austin if I Kahn jr. his dad's also have were in jail and who is Senator Coons has had passed away the age of 44 and we did have a big snowstorm allow a lot of snow had a couple feet here we had almost that much in parts of Delaware and when Vernon died he was it actually just finished helping a neighbor they got from the snowstorm and that sort of epitomized his life is always interested in helping other people not asking for much of anything in return but setting a good example frankly for each and every one of us but in life in a death Vernon epitomized the best of our country selfless men and women who put their lives on the line to protect and serve for this Capitol Complex and those of us who live and work in his part nation the US Capitol Police are some of America's finest men and women in uniform I say this is a former naval flight officer retired Navy captain we have wonderful men and women who serve us and the all the folks that come from all over the world to visit this place throughout the year but each day these officers performed perhaps the most important jobs here on the hill not just protecting those of us were privileged to work here either as members of the center members of the House our staffs but also for the millions of visitors folks should travel here from not just the 50 states but but a lot of places around around this this world of ours whether these officers are patrolling the grounds to prevent or to detect mischief investigating suspicious activity or responding to an emergency their mission is the same and their mission is to protect one of our country's principal symbols of democracy our unit in the United States Capitol the mission is not one that comes without sacrifice just 17 years ago I remember this to the day in 1998 two of our Capitol Police officers not far from the sound of my voice were gunned down in the line of duty when a gunman opened fire trying to force his way into the Capitol Vernon in his service with the US Army Reserve with the National Guard and with the Capitol Police Force Vernon consistently exhibited unwavering courage devotion to duty and above all honor in the way he lived his life and how we remember him Vernon reminds each of us just how good we can be in ought to be Vernon Austin was born in 1971 to his mom Barbara Austin and Vernon Austin senior a not in this country is born in Vincenzo which is a town in Italy for his dad died Vernon senior station in the US Air Force Vernon spent the first ten years of his life in Italy before his father was transferred to Dover Air Force Base in dover delaware there Vernon attended a grade school on the air force base later graduated from Dover High School schools that I've been privileged to be to any number of times he went on though to attend Howard University here in Washington DC to graduated from here about 20 years ago in 1995 Verner was still a student at Howard University when he answered the call of duty following the footsteps of his dad Vernon senior and his grandfather David Austin who had been a US Army World War two veteran in 1991 Vernon joined the this is the son who this is the deceased he joined the US Army Reserve he served as an army reservist until nineteen ninety-four mr. president after graduating from college in 1995 Vernon joined the District of Columbia's Army National Guard he served as a member of the army national guard for another 10 years I'm sure our presiding officers spends time with his guard troops in his home state that we do too evident army guard and air guard in Delaware very proud of hundred thousands of men and women who serve our country 300 or I think I'd know when Afghanistan we're welcoming some some folks home this this weekend but here's what Winston Churchill used to say about people who serve in the guard or reserve he said and have their own day jobs and he got Winston Churchill said they are twice a citizen think about that twice the citizen I know a lot of people who are in the army guard who needs to be the army and a lot of folks in the air guard in Delaware he's been the Air Force and they had their day jobs and they serve our state in our nation through the guard they are two times a citizen and you know what so was running so is running he began his service of the Capitol Police Force 20 years ago and for those 20 years he protected he served the Capitol Complex in its community including folks like us here senators our staffs these pages are sitting here at the the dice today members of our families our staffs members of their families millions of folks who who visit our capital throughout each year Vernon's positive energy which senator Coons is alluded to his attitude made a lasting impression with his Capitol Police colleagues in the latter part of his skull career recently most recently vernon were stationed at the capitol power plant where its provides steam and chilled water that's used to heat and cool buildings across the Capitol Complex I mean there at that plant there was his responsibility to check visitors and staff at the door and work to keep that facility safe and secure every day 24 hours a day seven days a week throughout of the year according to his colleagues you always found time to ask others well how are you doing how are you doing and he possessed the all too rare quality of being a patient listener my dad they used to say to my sister and me that God gave us two ears one mouth we should use them in that proportion listen a lot more than we talked and I was admire good listeners and Verne was one of those one of his fellow officers described Rican as a Vernon as a beacon a beacon of what well a beacon of positivity a positive force and no matter the mission and early morning for presidential inauguration or a late night where the state of the union address at the other end of the Capitol Vernon always wore a smile on his face in 2008 while Vernon was on the job in patrolling the Capitol gowns he ran into a woman that he'd actually run into before named a coral Davis and despite attending Howard University at the same time Vernon Nicole never really knew each other but talked to Nicole early this week who also makes the commute from Magnolia Delaware just south of Dover here four years to serve not in the Capitol Police but to serve our country in another capacity here in our nation's capital and she told me the the love story or an abbreviated version of it that when they were at Howard University roughly the same point in time Vernon would see her from afar and would would admire her never really maybe summoned the courage if you're willing temerity to go up to her and and say here's why I'm who you but he admired her from afar and sort of wish that he to get to know her and many years later while he was on patrol I think at the first corner first and independence guess who comes walking along that same woman that he had admired from afar all those years ago and they struck up a conversation hit it off and end up going out on a date together and the rest is history six months later they were married I know some people who had married that that that quickly and I'm one of them and Vernon and Nicole looked know what they're looking for and they were looking for each other and they found each other and have a wonderful family a wonderful family that they have raised and they became aboard the spirit of washington later they became a husband and wife after they got married they moved in this case to delaware and as I said magnolia magnolia people in magnolia their claim to fame is Magnolia Delaware a little town is the center of the universe and the they're probably other places to think through the center the university but the Austin family lived in the McNelly the center of the universe for a number of years Nicole and as Senator Coons have said not only had Vernon get up and drive to work every day but started to call and they didn't carpool many days they each drove separately and they love Delaware do you want to live in Delaware but they wanted to work here and to serve our nation different roles Nicole served and worked for a number of years at the sosoni in the National Zoo while Vernon was keeping things safe here in our capital together they have a five children five kids Brittany a sophomore at Delaware State University of the homeless or nets in Dover Yas mean a senior at Polytech high school the home of the Panthers just south of Dover Brandon a sophomore at Paul public charter school here in DC and Israel and Braden who both in preschool in closing not quite a closing but I'm close to close mr. president but I want to share a story that we heard from I Vernon's mom the other day and it deals with the time when he was in the the fourth grade Bernie's principal told his parents that he was a great example to his peers to other students pencil said that their son would come to learn about Vernon's the principal said that he knew he would come to learn about Vernon's accomplishments and achievements in the newspapers years down the road think of that I don't know what my principles were thinking about me when I was in the fourth or fifth or sixth grade but I don't think any of them ever thought I'd end up here and that they'd be reading about me in the newspaper or watching me on television but his principal knew when burner was not even ten years old that he was a guy who's on his way to being somebody that they could be enormously his parents could be enormously proud of and I think it's clear through the outpouring of love and the accounts are so manys after ruins untimely passing that you know his principal was right and if he's out there listening somewhere and his teachers are out there listening somewhere i want to thank them for helping to along with her myrna's parents raised there just a remarkable remarkable young man today I rise to commemorate Vernon to celebrate his life with Senator Coons by my side and along on behalf of Congressman John Carney are at large congressman from Delaware we want to offer to Brandon's family particularly to the coal their children friends and family officers who are our support and our deepest sympathy on your tragic loss and really on the lawsuit of us all here considered Vernon and those with whom we serve as part of our of our family I have to ask my staff to see if they could just find a couple people who serve in a Capitol Police you might have something to say about about Vernon and and I want to just quote them and maybe close out my remarks with with their with their words these are the words of Officer Scott McBain Scott McBain and here's what he said about vernulsya Vern Olson was an outstanding human being to know Vern was to love him officer mcvane goes on to say I was privileged to work with Vern for three years at the traffic one checkpoint of the house of vision on the house side he treated everyone he met with patients with good humor and remarkable kindness great talker who told very funny stories he also had the rare quality all too rare quality of being a sympathetic and a patient listener we heard that before didn't we smart positive always supportive people would stop by all day to see one and share their stories with him a warm and septum sympathetic friend to so many Vernon will be greatly missed by all who knew him thank you Scott McBain officer of the Capitol Police for sharing goes the memories of Vernon Austin and I have one more here from another capital police officer who knew and work with with Vernon and this officer's name is Michael Woodward Michael Woodward and Michael let's have these words about Vernon Austin all the people I've had the honor to work with Vernon Austin was by far the most positive warm friendly and outgoing person I have ever met I would you stop there how many people you suppose there are neural who saved those words about us we happened to be senators or staff for our family those are wonderful words someone to say about us that we were the most positive were warm we're friendly not going for in someone ever met what a compliment burn and goes on to say Vern was always wanted to greet you with a smile and ask how you and your family we're doing didn't matter what was going on if we were coming in early for the inauguration or staying late for the state of the union he always always had a smile on his face I never heard him speak of negative word or raise his voice he treated everyone as a close friend and again was a positive force and a beacon of positivity his passing leaves a hole that cannot be filled Tedder coons closed with a little scripture from the test one I think was Galatians if i'm not mistaken and I I think I try to like paraphrase maybe we'll something from from from Luke and from book of James people may not believe what we say they will believe what we do people may not believe what we say they will believe what we do and we lead by example and in our lives it can't be do as I say but really do as I do and he burnin throughout his life was a great example not just the people who with whom he worked on the police force here not just with all of us who came in contact with him throughout the day a week but some of these millions of people who may be their only lasting impression of our country that they really took home with him wherever they came from around the world was this wonderful capital police officer who took the time to talk with them to listen to them to be patient and to be helpful and to be friendly there's a great lesson for all of us in that a great lesson for all of us and for that Vernon we thank you God bless you and mr. president I note the absence of a quorum clerk should call the rule mr. Alexander

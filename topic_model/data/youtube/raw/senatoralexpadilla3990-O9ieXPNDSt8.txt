stuff in uh senator clinton's absence i'm presiding for the time being and we'll proceed with my questions before recognizing the next member uh and let me just begin by uh thanking senator coons for holding this hearing on platform transparency and to all the witnesses for exceptionally detailed testimony you know transparency has been a key piece of the debate over the responsibilities of technology companies and the impact their services have on our democracy and the welfare of our loved ones and our neighbors now as one of the few senators with an engineering background i believe that policy making is at its best when we're also armed with research and data and to that end i support the calls for to enhance platform transparency to better serve the public users of these services the company themselves and lawmakers we have an important opportunity for real productive and effective policy making and before i jump into my first name and question i also want to note that i have the honor of representing the state of california home to more innovators and executives and investors in technology than any other state in the nation also home to more consumers of technology and users of platforms than any other state in the nation and of course more employees in the sector than any state in the nation and so my first three questions a little rapid fire mr silverman what state are you from california professor personally what state are you from california professor keller what state are you from california no disrespect to the other witnesses just wanted to drive home the point california plays a huge role in this discussion and in the problem solving as well from all angles now advocates are routinely highlighting the failure of technology companies to moderate content in non-english languages as francis hogan testified at a previous hearing 87 of all spending combating misinformation on facebook is spent on english language content but only nine percent of facebook users are english speakers that's important data other platforms likely have similar disparities but they haven't publicly disclosed uh similar information and i certainly would love to see that data professor keller in your testimony you shared that the eu's digital services digital service act requires public transparency reporting around the number of content moderators platforms employ and what their linguistic expertise is do you think similar transparency reporting should be considered in the united states so i i agree with you that the language issue is incredibly important and i think one of the most uh important disclosures from my former client francis haugen um you know what was that not only in um languages that don't have as many speakers is the content moderation not as good but also they don't build machine learning systems that are as good as a result so the problem is is just compounded um i do think that attention to additional languages is incredibly important i mean unfortunately it's part of what makes uh measures of things like prevalence so expensive because it means that you're deploying people in many languages who need many cultural you know context to try to extrapolate how much content exists across the platform but but yes i am in favor of reporting and just briefly is there any other types of information or data that would be helpful in addressing this or other disparities that concern you well one of the most important things is to see the actual content that platforms took down or left up or demoted you know if researchers can't see that then the platforms are grading their own homework the researchers can't see if there's a pattern of bias or if they're making mistakes or whatever this collides with the privacy issues that i identified in in my testimony for platforms like like facebook but certainly for publicly shared content you know where the the person who posted it hasn't tried to take it down having an opportunity for third parties to look at what's actually going on in multiple languages you know for multiple cultural contexts is really important let alone liability which further speaks to the complexity of uh the policy here now on a separate note when legislating on technology related issues i think it's important to have raises in the full committee previously important to not enable or incent politically ambitious government officials with legal authorities who may use our efforts to undermine the ability of platforms to limit the spread of hate speech and election disinformation just as two examples question for professor keller again in your testimony you sat at the texas attorney general's ongoing dispute with twitter as an example of states trying to influence online speech so as congress considers regulating the conduct of tech companies with respect to transparency and competition what should we know about the battle over online speech regulation and what's taking place in the states yeah so i think it's really important to appreciate the rash of cases out there litigation and uh state laws some of which have passed that have the goal of compelling platforms to carry content that the platforms don't want to uh that violates the platform's rules and this includes you know white nationalists saying that they have a right to post white nationalist content on twitter you know and there have been over 70 of these cases uh the laws that were passed in texas and florida both create these obligations to carry content that violates the platform's rules and i'm sympathetic in a way like these are the public forums of today i understand why people are very concerned about being excluded if they are being excluded but uh creating a mechanism for government actors to effectively strong-arm platforms about their policies which i think is what is going on with the texas a g investigation uh is is quite dangerous and i think this is something to worry about with um some competition bills pending that are otherwise i think really good ideas these are i'm sorry that senator klobuchar isn't here to um to hear me talk about her bill um but you know they 95 are about saying platforms shouldn't self-preference and promote their own properties over their competitors and then both her bill and the senator blumenthal's bill and he's not here either both have just a couple of sentences that permit a different category of lawsuit a lawsuit that's breitbart saying they should be treated like the wall street journal for example uh and i think it's a very serious change in the law if that comes into effect thank you speaking of texas senator cruz

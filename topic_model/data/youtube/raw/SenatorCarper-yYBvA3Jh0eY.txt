good morning one and all the hearing will come to order where you want to welcome all of our witnesses thank you for joining us today for your preparation and your willingness to respond to our questions today's joint we don't get to do this every day I'm delighted to be here with with our friend Senator Tom Udall and we're going to have this joint hearing today to review the impacts of air pollution on children's health in the United States of America our senators will have roughly five minutes for their opening statements I'll then recognize our panel of witnesses and we'll ask you to use about five minutes for your opening statements to your entire statements will be made part of the record so you could summarize and try to keep within that time constraint that would be good and after the panel's the statements will have maybe two rounds of questions well reminder today is the temperatures approach 100 degrees here in our nation's capital that summer is here and that means kids I don't know today kids outside swimming look there's a swimming pool around they'll be there but playing baseball and eating barbecue on the patio may be inside in the air conditioning but in many parts of our country summer also means smog and exposure to deadly air pollution summer smog season also known as the ozone season is a powerful reminder of how important it is to have clean air to breathe small causing air pollution from dirty power plants from automobiles and other sources is linked to serious health problems like asthma like strokes like heart attacks and even early deaths smog is especially dangerous as we know for our children parents who have watched their kids with asthma sufferer on high ozone days know this better than anyone and some of them are here today unfortunately smog is not all we have to be concerned about when it comes to our children's health millions of our kids ride a bus to school playing a playground or live in a community that exposes them to high levels of ozone to particle pollution or air toxics all of which can severely impact children's health fact nearly all air pollution is more dangerous to our children than to their parents for three primary reasons one the immune systems of children are still developing and two they breathe in more air in proportion to their body size than their parents and three they're more likely to be outside for longer periods of time during the summer exposing them to more air pollution as a parent myself of two boys now grown I've spent a lot of time worrying about our own children's health as a u.s. senator I also worry about every child's health that's why I've worked hard with my colleagues Democrat and Republican alike to make sure that all of our children have clean air to breathe add it's free of all types of air pollution and we've made remarkable progress in cleaning up our air especially in some parts of a country but if truth be told we still have a long way to go in many other parts of America more than seven million American children have asthma including nearly 28,000 in Delaware childhood asthma rates are still rising in fact in Delaware alone each of our three counties received a failing grade for the American Lung Association for the number of high pollution days they have experienced and for me that's more than just disappointing that's it's almost heartbreaking I'm not too old to remember one of the great things about being a kid especially in summer was getting to run and play outside in fact I still love to run distances with my oldest son 22 years old and even though he runs me into the ground few things are better than that but kids with asthma get left behind on poor air quality days and frequently they have to give up fun as well as healthy exercise they often have to restrict their most basic daily activities moreover those kids have may have to miss school their parents may have to miss work and all the while health care costs in America already the highest in the world continue to rise those costs add up to two trillions of dollars lost every year in this country that's not millions that's not billions that's trillions with atty the Environmental Protection Agency is not considering what i think are sensible rules to reduce smog causing pollution as well as particle pollution mercury pollution and other harmful air toxics for example recent air toxic regulation for utilities would limit emissions of known toxics that affect the development a child's brain or nervous system or infect the way a child's body develops these rules can give us all cleaner air while reducing those pollutants that will help prevent a wide variety of health serious health threats to our children and in the end we standard chief better health care results for less money that's right better healthcare results for less money it is my hope that today's witnesses will provide us with new information in insights on water federal government is doing well and maybe what we're not doing so well so that we can enhance the quality of our nation's air and protect the health and welfare every systems especially our nation's children five minutes on the money all right center you don't match that

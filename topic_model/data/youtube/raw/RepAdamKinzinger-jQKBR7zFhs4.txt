now republican congressman from illinois adam kinzinger sir good to have you here uh back on the show as always so you heard about a unity agenda and there was a lot of focus we'll get into ukraine in a moment but for americans talking about gas prices talking about uh inflation what did you hear last night and how hopeful did you walk out of it this is just a speech um but did you have a reason for hope in this last night well look i mean i i've been doing this now 12 years this would be what my i guess 12th state of the union and uh but you know look at it and say sure i mean i think it's important for the president to have recognized what people are feeling out there uh to put voice to the fact that inflation is a real concern a real fear and of course with what we're seeing both in the lead up to this and with you know the current instability over to overseas gas prices is a huge problem i'm not sure look he's not going to convince any republicans he probably you know some of the folks kind of in the middle shook their head and said yeah i think he needed he did what he needed to do and i think you know whether the prescription is what people agree with or not you know you recognize the problem and as a leader i think that's kind of the first step a gop response from iowa governor uh reynolds she essentially said the the president and democrats uh taking us back to the 70s and 80s with the inflation with violent crime um and it's all democrats and biden's fault um you you don't subscribe to that i assume or how much of do of the blame how much do you agree essentially with that statement that shape look this is a time where americans need to come together and uh recognize yeah you're not going to agree with everything the president says that doesn't mean he's intentionally destroying america it also doesn't mean anybody in politics is intentionally destroying america so i thought you know all in all probably i think the governor and the response did a good job i don't agree with everything she said either i just could i want to get to a point maybe i'm being too overly optimistic or naive where we can all just you know have our little partisan hits sometimes but i actually want to solve problems for america because i think americans are sick of the left right constant back and forth and not solving anything you have to say tj and i are sitting here nodding our heads because it is optimistic to hear you talk about unity and talk about reaching across the aisle and not necessarily just siding with a party so it's refreshing to hear you talk i wanted to speak a little bit to ukraine and what president biden said last night uh specifically about restricting that airspace joining the eu joining canada what is that going to do in this fight in your opinion this is huge i mean look i think we're going to we're going to hear the story of how all this happened behind the scenes the fact that europe has kind of stepped up and taken the lead and you know i think the united states will have pushed that and kind of caused that to happen i don't think he could have had a better outcome when germany who was hesitant to take on russia is basically all in when you have sweden all in and of course closing the airspace prevents whether it's air travel from you know commercial whether it's the oligarchs traveling uh you know they with their almost billion dollar yachts this is putting a lot of pressure on vladimir putin of course sadly it's going to put pressure on the russian people but that's unfortunately necessary because the russian war machine which seems to be far more inept than we initially thought but still a lot of people they can throughout this problem are just being butchers in ukraine and taking a country for the sole purpose of just wanting to expand your land well congressman before we let you go the last time you were here with roebuck and i we had to wrap up quickly because any moment your wife could be going into labor and now you're back here and the little one i think i guess is about a month old i have it right christian is the name i just want to say congratulations my man thank you thank you it's great it's a it's a whole new chapter and i love it so far oh well that's the first time we got a real smile out of you the whole interview man we should have started with that but no congressman always good to have you always good to uh you answer our call so we appreciate you and congrats again y'all too thank you have a good one

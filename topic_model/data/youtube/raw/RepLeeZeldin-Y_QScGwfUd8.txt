well thank you mr chairman i appreciate the subcommittee's consideration of my legislation today sadly we have seen terrorist attacks in europe over the last three years which have killed hundreds of people and were largely carried out by european nationals some of the perpetrators of these attacks traveled to train and fight in syria and return to europe through greece and turkey although some of the attackers were already known to local authorities they were able to move across borders without detection and in some cases use fraudulent passports given the high number of foreign fighters returning from isis strongholds in syria iraq and elsewhere there is a recognized need for improved border security and information sharing between governments the lack of united states government-wide risk-based approach increases the odds that systematic security gaps abroad may persist and that united states response efforts will not be maximized in order to close these gaps failure to effectively coordinate capacity building activities also results in greater risk of overlap waste and unnecessary duplication between the united states and international programs to help solve this program problem i introduced hr 1196 the counterterrorism screening and assistance act of 2017. this effort is very similar to h.r 4314 from 114th congress which passed the house by a 371-2 vote on march 21 2016. h.r 1196 mandates a report card which will assess foreign government's respective border security efforts my bill would also require the president to submit a plan in congress which would catalog ongoing initiatives and programs with the goal of enhancing the partner country capacities of interdicting terrorist activities and foreign fighter travel the plan will also identify areas for improvement and steps that will be taken to address any concerns h.r 1196 would also require the department of state and department of homeland security to accelerate the delivery of certain border security systems prioritizing delivery to countries of greatest concern and risk for foreign fighter or terrorist travel when possible the u.s will attempt to collect reimbursement for transferred equipment and all equipment transfers will comply with existing regulations related to the export of sensitive technologies the department of state and department of homeland security would also be required to submit an annual report to congress detailing how countries are meeting the minimum border security standards established within the act the report will assess partner country efforts over the previous 12 months and identify areas for improvement further the bill would put in place a monitoring system that would screen for infectious diseases to contain and prevent any potential outbreaks which will help quarantine viruses by authorizing the secretary of homeland security to provide the necessary equipment and supplies to mitigate the risk or threat of infectious diseases such as zika finally h.r 1196 would allow the secretary of state in consultation with the secretary of homeland security to suspend all non-humanitarian non-trade related foreign assistance to any country deemed not to meet the minimum border security standards set forth in the bill senators marco rubio and chris coons have introduced a companion bill in the senate which is senate bill 942 i look forward to working with my colleagues in the house and our friends in the senate to pass and send this bill to the president i again i'd like to thank you chairman and the ranking member for your hard work and efforts in considering this legislation today and i yield back

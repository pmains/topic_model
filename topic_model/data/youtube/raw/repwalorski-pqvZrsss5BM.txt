Mr Speaker I rise today alongside my colleagues to speak out against the radical and dangerous policies being pursued by Democratic leadership and state legislators across the country in New York a new law legalizes what amounts to infanticide allowing abortions up to and even after birth for almost any reason and ends the safeguards that protect babies born alive after an abortion attempt in Virginia a similar bill is under consideration that could lead to babies being denied life-saving medical care as governor Ralph Northam put it quote the infant would be kept comfortable and then a discussion would ensue close quote I think this is sickening that's why my colleagues and I have called for the House vote on HR 962 the born alive abortion survivors Protection Act a common-sense bill to require that medical care just medical care be provided to children who survived a failed abortion sadly Democratic leadership in the House is standing in the way refusing even to allow an up-or-down vote on this issue this is not a partisan issue simply what's right what's right we've got to stand together against this radical in a humane agenda we must act to protect the rights of all infants I like to thank my colleagues for joining me this evening to stand up for the most vulnerable among us we stand together to defend the sanctity of life to speak out against a radical anti life agenda that would effectively legalize infanticide I have long fought to defend the unborn but I'm shocked that I now have to defend the right to life of newborn infants these precious children are imperiled their rights are under attack their lives are under attack and this house has a responsibility to act tonight the American people heard our call to action it's time to vote on the born alive abortion survivors Protection Act will the leadership of this house listen or will the Democratic majority to continue to allow this march toward legalized infanticide if we don't send a strong message that every baby has been endowed by its creator the nail the bull writes that we are not defending the fundamental principles of the Constitution if we don't protect these children from harm we're abandoning the basic truth of our humanity I want to thank my colleagues for standing with me here tonight I urge the support of the House bill HR 962 the born alive abortion survivors protect an act and to stand against infanticide and Mr Speaker I yield back the balance of my time

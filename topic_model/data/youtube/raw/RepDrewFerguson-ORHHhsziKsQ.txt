last word strike the last word Mr chairman um I want to First say that you know I I'm extremely grateful that we're that we're doing this I made mention of that earlier but what we've seen happen across our country with with mental health with the Mental Health crisis it's it's devastating and it's devastating across every socio-economic group across every age there's not a demographic or a community that hasn't been touched by this and I think in many regards particularly with our younger population both our teenagers and our youth they've really been challenged in so many ways through the pandemic and they tend to be more fragile at this point than maybe their their predecessors have been and so I'm thankful that we're that we're focused on this I'm grateful for the work that the Congress has done in a very bipartisan basis but one of the things that I want to particularly talk about is is HR 8910 Behavioral Health integration awareness act and been very proud to work with Jason Smith and Brad Schneider to introduce this bill and it it really aims to address a problem that's at the heart of this country's Mental Health crisis and behavioral intervention Behavioral Health and integration awareness act would require the secretary to reach out and effectively communicate with the Physicians and other Health Care Professionals who accept Medicare in order to inform and raise awareness of Behavioral Health integration services that are available to the patients the goal of this bill is to increase the uptake we've done a lot of work around the country on this but we still need patients and Physicians using the services and this is going to increase and I think if we're wise we will look further down the road in in additional legislation because we are going to need not only an uptake of of services that we have now but we're going to need an increase in the number of providers and I know that we have talked about that this committee and there have been some steps taken in other legislation to increase this but not only do we need utilization increase utilization but we're going to need a significant number of providers going forward we're going to need to understand that this is going to have a lasting impact on health care but anything that we can do for early intervention early uptake early treatment I think is is going to be important so we think that this this bill is an important tool in addressing the Mental Health crisis and again encourage everyone to support the chairman will yield back ladies and gentlemen let me recognize that

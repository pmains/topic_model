personally a test from uh being with uh chairman engel in that meeting in munich with president vucic and having many other conversations with the chairman and his team over the course of not just last few months while he's been chair but years it's a very personal and in a very positive way laser-like focus on this issue and i just want to i want to thank the the chairman and and his team for making such a dedicated effort with a ton of follow-through it's one thing to you have a meeting with a constituent or someone in our country they share a personal story and you know maybe you forget about it in the weeks or the months that that follow but i think it's an important message and as i know that president vucic and his team pay attention to today's hearing they're watching it's it's an important message that they receive that on both sides of the aisle this issue isn't going away and if it's the 20th anniversary of what happened to the petite brothers and we're still here having this conversation and they might have thought 5 or 10 15 years ago that fast forward to 2019 that we would just stop talking about it if you look around this entire room there's no seats there there are plenty more people who would be filling these seats if we if we had them and that should also send a a powerful message to president vucic and his team because they have goals for their country and i believe and i agree with what mr bachichi said that and what ms goodman said that justice absolutely must be part of any of those talks for a future relationship for a serbian relationship with the united states it requires justice for the victims this is my third term serving in this committee and i've heard a lot of personal stories on different topics for different and different nations around the world i have to say that nothing was as emotional and and gut wrenching as listening to your story miss goodman and your strength to be able to be here and to share that story with congress and with the american people is a testament to to your strength of character and there's a lot of respect for you just to be here and be able to share those reflections with us and i think it really highlights for all of my colleagues as they read through house concurrent resolution 32 as they talk to their teams about what that text means what the the message means that hopefully if they're if they weren't in this room to hear it to replay the witness testimony uh from mr bettichi and miss goodman especially and sign on uh we need every member of the house foreign affairs committee to sign onto house concurrent resolution 32. we need every member of congress to be supportive of house concurrent resolution 32 and to send a powerful message beyond today to president vucic and his team that all of their goals for what they want with their neighbors what they want with a wider region with united states it all requires and and well at the demand and the assistance of the united states must include justice in december 2018 the department of state designated goron radosa lege who it was under section 1731c due to his involvement in these war crimes i am grateful that this designation was made by the state department gory's name has been referenced in other meetings that have taken place with colleagues and he is known to be a suspect in the murder of the petiti brothers and when chairman engel and i sat with president vucic in munich it was explained that there hasn't been enough evidence in order to bring a prosecution but the family wants their day in court based off the evidence that exists the united states feels comfortable to make this designation back in december of 2018. we've heard it acknowledged through people who have met with president buchick in other settings including mr bettichi was in the room when he heard it out of president view chick's mouth and others acknowledging that gory is a suspect so what does that mean whatever evidence you have now 20 years later it's time for a trial it's time for a day in court this issue is not going to go away and for the sake of u.s serbian relations and for serbian relations with their counterparts in their region for everything that they seek that justice is what this committee hopefully will continue to demand and once again thank you to chairman engel because i know that as president vucic watches today he knows that on both sides of the aisle that we won't let this issue go and that is the key justice is the key and that's what united states must continue to demand and i yield back thank you mr zeldin

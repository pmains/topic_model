TO 3.9% OF PEOPLE MAKING MORE  THAN $10 MILLION BY 2019. A LOT OF ENFORCEMENT NOT  HAPPENING. THANKS SO MUCH.  >>> JOINING US NOW TO DISCUSS,  MIKE JOHNSON OF LOUISIANA. HE'S ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. LET'S START WITH THE DEBATE  AMONG HOUSE REPUBLICANS TODAY  ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT DEALS KEVIN  McCARTHY MADE TO BECOME SPEAKER. IS THERE GOING TO BE SOME SORT  OF LIST OF THE CONCESSIONS  McCARTHY MADE TO HIS CRITICS TO  WIN THE GAVEL IT SEEMS LIKE IN  THE NAME OF THE TRANSPARENCY YOU AND YOUR FELLOW MEMBERS ARE  TALKING ABOUT? >> WE HAD OUR FIRST BIG MEETING  THIS MORNING AND THERE WAS VERY  POSITIVE VIBES AROUND. WE'RE WORKING OFF THE SAME SHEET OF MUSIC. IT WAS CLARIFIED THAT THERE IS  NO MAGICAL ADDENDUM TO THE RULES THAT WE ALL AGREED TO. THERE ARE LOTS OF DISCUSSIONS,  BUT EVERYTHING AND ALL THE NEW  IDEAS HAVE TO GO THROUGH REGULAR PROCESS. THAT'S ONE OF YOUR GREAT REFORMS THAT WE ENACTED. IT HAS TO GO THROUGH THE  AMENDMENT DEBATE BEFORE IT GETS  TO FLOOR. LOTS OF DISCUSSIONS AND IDEAS  FROM ACROSS THE CONFERENCE. BUT I THINK IT WILL BE  CONSIDERED BY EVERYBODY.  >> McCARTHY MADE DEALS WITH CHIP ROY AND OTHERS. I'M NOT SAYING THERE WAS  ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE DEALS. I'M NOT SAYING THAT WHAT HE  AGREED TO WAS BAD. BUT IT DOES SEEM TO ME THAT THE  PUBLIC WOULD BE WELL SERVED JUST TO BE PRESENTED WITH THAT LIST  OF PROMISES.  >> LOOK, WHAT KEVIN AGREED TO -- AND I'VE TALKED TO CHIP ROY AND  OTHER WHO IS ARE NEGOTIATING. THEY ALL AGREE, THEY'RE ALL ON  THE SAME PAGE THAT THE SAME  THING WAS DONE AND SAID. WHAT KEVIN HAS COMMITTED TO IS  AN OPEN LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. WE'RE GOING TO RUN THIS LIKE THE FOUNDERS INTENDED. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ACTUAL  DEBATES, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE  DISCUSSIONS ABOUT POLICY AND  LEGISLATION AND IT'S GOING TO BE LIMITED TO SINGLE SUBJECTS SO  YOU CAN'T HAVE THESE MASSIVE  OMNIBUS BILLS THAT ARE THOUSANDS OF PAGES LONG. THIS IS GOING TO BE THE WAY WE  WERE TAUGHT IN OUR OLD CIVICS  CLASSES. I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE  GOING TO APPRECIATE IT.  >> IT INCLUDES THE HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS TO APPROVE A THIRD OF THE MEMBERS, THERE'S A BASELINE OF  SPENDING BEING AT 2022 LEVELS  GOING FORWARD. I'M NOT SAYING THERE'S ANYTHING  WRONG WITH ANY OF THIS, WHY NOT  WRITE IT DOWN AND LET THE PUBLIC SEE IT? >> IT WILL BE WRITTEN DOWN AT  THE APPROPRIATE TIME WHEN WE  BRING FORWARD BILLS TO  ACCOMPLISH ANY OF OUR  OBJECTIVES. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THAT. EVERYBODY WILL SEE IT. IT WILL BE VERY CLEAR, VERY  TRANSPARENT AND WE'RE EXCITE  ABOUT THAT PROCESS AND GETTING  GOING ON IT. WITH REGARD TO THE COMMITTEES,  KEVIN SAID THIS MORNING IN THE  MEETING AND EVERYONE NODDED IN  AGREEMENT THAT WE WANT TO HAVE  AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE EQUAL  REPRESENTATION OF OUR REPUBLICAN VIEWPOINTS ON ALL OF THESE  COMMITTEES AND RULES IS AN  IMPORTANT ONE. THAT'S THE COMMITTEE THAT  DECIDES WHICH LEGISLATION  ACTUALLY GETS TO THE FLOOR AND  IN WHAT ORDER. SO I THINK EVERYBODY THINKS THAT THESE ARE VERY POSITIVE THINGS. I'M NOT SURE I HAVE ANY  COLLEAGUES TODAY MURMURING ABOUT THIS. I THINK THEY'RE EXCITED ABOUT  WHERE WE'RE HEADED. THERE WERE HIGH FIVES AND  CHEERING IN THE ROOM THIS  MORNING AND WE'RE EXCITED TO  DELIVER FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. >> THERE'S HOUSE REPUBLICANS WHO WANT TO KNOW WHAT THOSE DEALS  ARE ON. LET'S MOVE ON. YOU SUPPORTED THE HOUSE BILL WE  JUST DISCUSSED. IT WOULD RESCIND BILLIONS OF  DOLLARS TO THE IRS. YOU TWEETED, YOU WILL VOTE TO  STOP THE 87,000 IRS AGENTS FROM  GOING AFTER FAMILIES. THAT'S NOT TRUE. IT WOULD BE EMPLOYEES, NOT  AGENTS. THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE  SAYS THAT YOUR BILL TO GET RID  OF THOSE IRS EMPLOYEES IS GOING  TO ADD TO THE DEFICIT. >> ONLY IN THE BIZARRO WORLD OF  WASHINGTON WOULD YOU GET AN  ESTIMATE THAT NOT SPENDING THE  MONEY IS GOING TO ADD TO --  >> BECAUSE OF ENFORCEMENT MORE  PEOPLE WHO ARE AVOIDING PAYING  THEIR TAXES. ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO, IF YOU MADE MORE THAN $10 MILLION A YEAR,  ONE OUT OF FIVE PEOPLE LIKE THAT WOULD BE AUDITED. NOW IT'S DOWN TO 3.6%. THE WEALTHY PEOPLE ARE GETTING  AWAY WITH NOT PAYING THEIR  TAXES. CORPORATIONS TOO. >> THE INTENT OF HIRING ALL OF  THESE NEW AGENTS WOULD HAVE THE  EFFECT OF GOING AFTER  HARD-WORKING FAMILIES AND SMALL  BUSINESSES. THAT IS NOT A REPUBLICAN TALKING POINT. THAT COMES FROM THE JOINT  COMMITTEE OF TAXATION. THEY'VE EVALUATED THIS AND THEY  KNOW IT WILL BE THE LOW-HANGING  FRUIT THAT THE IRS WILL GO AFTER FRUIT. THAT'S THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND THOSE WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO  BE ENTREPRENEURS AND JOB  CREATORS, THEY'RE THE  RISK-TAKERS IN OUR ECONOMY WHO  PROVIDE JOBS FOR MORE PEOPLE. THEY DON'T NEED SCRUTINY. WHAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WANTS  IS AN IRS THAT WORKS FOR  HARD-WORKING FAMILIES, NOT  AGAINST THEM. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS WAS GOING  TO BE ABOUT AND THAT'S WHY WE  FULFILLED OUR COMMITMENT TO  REPEAL THAT FUNDING ON THE VERY  FIRST DAY. I'M GLAD WE DID AND I THINK IF  YOU POLL THIS ACROSS THE  COUNTRY, I THINK MOST OF AMERICA AGREES WITH US.  >> ARE YOU SAYING 87,000 AGENTS  ARE COMING AT YOU, OR IS IT,  IT'S FUNDING FOR THE IRS, AND  THEY WOULD BE FOCUSED ONGOING  AFTER INDIVIDUALS WHO DON'T PAY  THEIR TAXES, MAINLY WEALTHY  PEOPLE AND CORPORATIONS. I THINK YOU WOULD PROBABLY GET  TWO DIFFERENT ANSWERS.  >> MAYBE, WHEN THE JOINT  COMMITTEE ON TAXATION PUBLISHES  SOMETHING, IT'S GIVEN A LOT OF  WEIGHT. THEY'RE NONPARTISAN. THIS IS NOT REPUBLICAN TALKING  POINTS. THIS IS WHAT THE EVALUATION AND  THE ANALYSIS OF THE WHITE  HOUSE'S PROPOSAL AND LEGISLATION LAST YEAR, WHAT IT WOULD  ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH. WE DISAGREE WITH THAT. WE HAVE A DIFFERENT AGENDA.  >> I QUOTED THE CBO.  >> THE CBO DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF CREDIBILITY RIGHT NOW. THEIR ANALYSIS IS WILDLY  INACCURATE IN A LOT OF WAYS AND  THEY DON'T ALWAYS DO APPROPRIATE ANALYSIS. LOOK, I THINK THERE'S GOING TO  BE SOME REFORMS IN THAT ARENA AS WELL AS WE GO FORWARD. WHEN THEY COME OUT WITH AN  ESTIMATE ON CAPITOL HILL RIGHT  NOW, THERE'S LOTS OF EYE-ROLLING TYPICALLY. THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM WE  HAVE WITH TRANSPARENCY AND DOING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE'S BUSINESS  IN THE WAY IT SHOULD BE DONE. WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK  TO REFORM THESE PROCESSES TO  MAKE WASHINGTON WORK FOR THE  PEOPLE AGAIN. LOOK, THIS IS COMMONSENSE IDEAS  THAT WILL YIELD TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY.  >> WHY NOT BE HONEST ABOUT WHAT  THE BILL WOULD DO.  >> I AM HONEST. >> YOU SAID 87,000 IRS AGENTS. THAT'S NOT WHAT IT IS.  >> THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IT IS. THAT IS THE TREASURY'S OWN  PUBLISHED REPORT IN 2021 THAT  THEY SAID, AS YOU NOTED, OVER A  TEN-YEAR PERIOD. THEY WANTED TO ADD 86,000 --  >> EMPLOYEES. NOT AGENTS.  >> JAKE, YOU KNOW WHAT ALL OF  THOSE POSITIONS ARE GOING TO BE? HAVE YOU SEEN THE ANALYSIS? >> YOU'RE SAYING EVERY ONE OF  THE 86,000-PLUS IS GOING TO BE  AN IRS AGENT? >> I'M NOT SAYING THAT. I'M SAYING A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THOSE WILL BE AGENTS. THAT'S A LARGE -- VERY IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF THE IRS. THAT'S NOT HYPERBOLE. THAT'S WHAT'S ON PAPER.  >> DO YOU THINK THERE'S A  PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY OF  WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS AND  COMPANIES NOT PAYING THEIR FAIR  SHARE IN TAXES.  >> THAT'S BEEN A PROBLEM, OF  COURSE, BUT IT'S -- WE'RE NOT  PREVENTING THAT. THE IRS HAS AN IMPORTANT JOB TO  GO AFTER TAX CREATES,  ABSOLUTELY, AND WE SUPPORT THAT. WE WANT THESE THINGS TO BE DONE  PROPERLY. WHAT THIS PROVISION WOULD HAVE  HAD THE EFFECT OF DOING IS  MAKING LIFE HARDER FOR MIDDLE  CLASS WORKING FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES, FULL STOP, THAT'S  WHAT THE NONPARTISAN ANALYSIS  EVALUATED AND THAT'S WHY IT'S A  TOP AGENDA ITEM.  >> INSTEAD OF JUST REMOVING THE  FUNDING, WHY NOT SAY YOU CAN USE THE FUNDING BUT YOU CAN ONLY GO  AFTER INDIVIDUALS WHO MAKE OVER  $5 MILLION A YEAR? >> WE'RE OPEN TO A PROPER  ANALYSIS AND A PROPER  INSTRUCTIONS FROM CONGRESS ON  THE USE OF THOSE FUNDS AND MAYBE THAT WOULD BE A WORTHWHILE  EXERCISE. BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT HAPPENED  WITH THE LEGISLATION THAT PASSED LAST YEAR AND THAT'S WHY WE HAD  TO UNFUND IT AND REPEAL IT  EFFECTIVELY. I WISH WE HAD SOME DEMOCRATS WHO FOLLOWED COMMONSENSE AND WENT  ALONG WITH US ON IT. >> BUT THERE'S NO EFFORT TO  ACTUALLY MAKE THIS BIPARTISAN  BECAUSE EVEN IF IT PASSES THE  HOUSE, IT'S NOT GOING TO GET  THROUGH THE SENATE AND PRESIDENT BIDEN SAID HE'S GOING TO VETO  IT. IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO MAKE  SURE THAT NOBODY -- I'M JUST  GOING TO MAKE UP A NUMBER NOW. AT LEAST SAY $2 MILLION. NO ONE WHO MAKES UNDER  $2 MILLION A YEAR IS TOUCHED BY  THIS, WHY NOT WORK ON SOMETHING  WITH SENATE DEMOCRATS THAT CAN  BE LAW.  >> JOHN QUINCY ADAMS SAID, DUTY  IS OURS, RESULTS ARE GOD'S. I CAN'T CONTROL WHAT HAPPENS IN  THE SENATE OR THE WHITE HOUSE. BUT WE'RE GOING TO DO THE JOB  THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SENT US HERE TODAY. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO

as a parent I'm a little strict about certain family traditions my dad is so old-fashioned like growing up the whole family has to be together for family dinner and church on Sunday every Sunday you taught all our children try and always do what's right do what's right stand up for what you believe that's my dad I've tried to work that way in government to do what's right even when I had to go against my own party it's how he lives and I love him I'm Tom Suozzi and of course I approve this message

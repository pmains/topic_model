of the Committee on Homeland Security the gentleman from Texas is recognized for four minutes your speaker the resolution before us here today in my judgment is dangerous and should be defeated four months Congress and the American people have demanded a strategy from this administration to defeat and destroy Isis a barbaric and growing terrorist empire that threatens not only the people of Iraq and Syria but also the United States today the Secretary of Defense testified that quote Isis is a threat to the homeland because of its a valid intentions to strike and recruit in this country Isis must will be dealt a lasting defeat in the quote but this president does not have a strategy to accomplish this we continue to fight the terrorists with one hand tied behind our back and the only thing worse would be to disengage completely which is exactly what this resolution would do I recently led a bipartisan delegation to the Middle East where I visited Iraq ground zero in the fight against Isis a week before Ramadi was overtaken by Isis and I spoke with Prime Minister Abadi and unfortunately the current strategy strategy in my opinion relies too heavily on the Shia militia as a proxy of Iran to defeat Isis we now have over 3,000 American servicemembers there to advise and assist the Iraqi national military but the president has restricted our ability to take the fight to the enemy because he's more committed to his campaign pledge to end the wars in the Middle East than he is to ending Isis the president has in fact made the situation more dangerous his failure to negotiate his status of forces agreement and the complete failure of Prime Minister Maliki together and effectively created the vacuum that Isis now fills in Syria the civil war continues to rage there to Isis has filled the void the llamas fanatics for more than 100 countries have traveled overseas to fight with groups like Isis and al-qaeda thousands of these jihadist carry Western passports and can exploit security ads to return to the west and the homeland where they plot attacks against the United States meanwhile Ron is actively engaged in both Iraq and Syria embedding Shia fighters and the Sunni communities in Iraq and doing asad's bidding in Syria Prime Minister Netanyahu recently told our delegation that Iran and Isis are competing for the crown of militant Islam this resolution would ensure that Iran and Isis will continue to dominate in the region while thousands of innocent civilians suffer and die just ask the Yazidi Christians in Iraq if they support leaving security in the hands of Isis in the Iranians thousands of Yazidis would have been killed last summer if it weren't for US airstrikes to repel an Isis advancement against them nothing could be more irresponsible or damaging to our interest let me say this in response to those who say this is a vote to urge an AUMF vote I personally support a strong aumf and authorization but one to defeat in destroy Isis we melt the white house council he presented a very different AUMF that would restrict further the president's current abilities to destroy and defeat Isis I cannot support that and this resolution with all due respect is the wrong way to accomplish the goal of defeating Isis through a strong authorized use of military force with that Mr Speaker I yield back the gentleman from Texas yields the gentleman from California reserves the chair recognizes the gentleman from New York yeah I now yield two minutes to my New York friend and colleague mr.

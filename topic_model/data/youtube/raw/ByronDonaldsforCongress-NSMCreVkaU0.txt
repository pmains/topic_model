in america today we're dealing with a political culture war we have groups like black lives matter and antifa who are fomenting anger and resentment in this political culture war we have groups that are actively using it to damage businesses to burn our cities to attack police to set up chasses or chops whatever you want to call it here's what i support i support law and order we cannot have a society of free people a society the greatest one man's ever known a place where anybody in life whether they're from brooklyn new york like me or growing up in any part of southwest florida can literally change their socioeconomic stripes in life if we don't have a society built upon rules and law and order i don't support anarchy and i never will i don't support defunding our police because our police are the ones that defend our society and they defend our neighborhoods and i definitely without a doubt do not support this canceled culture you don't strip down history you learn from history even the bad parts you see as an elected official what you have to know what you have to learn is that you cannot side with the mob you have to protect rights you have to protect property at all times even when it's not popular you always will have that commitment from me i will stand on the side of law and order i will stand on the side of our constitution and i will stand on your side of a civil society

Republican congresswoman Kat kamik of Florida like I said to Peter Ducey couple things we want to get to first of all your reaction when you found out that the FBI was actually not allowed to go in you want to talk about hypocrisy in a double set of Standards we are seeing classified documents found at the residence whether it's personal or business to me it really doesn't matter because again it's just another example of that double set of standards that the bidens are being held to versus say president Trump but then of course the Penn Center which is funded by the Chinese Communist party you had classified documents found there from a time when as vice president he didn't have the authority to declassify documents it it again points to the fact that if you or I or any everyday American were to do this we would be in handcuffs by now but why is the commander-in-chief set to set to a completely different set of Standards it's disgusting and it's hurting The credibility of the office and of our nation how can our enemies or our allies depend on what we say if we continually have a moving Target it's what's got to change here's yeah I'm a little bit more concerned less about what what they would say about us and what they would do if they knew that they could be the person and not just Kearney standing next to him as he's got code word docs classified docs walking around the place with that now look he does have secret service but you and I could read that plane as day but we're not the enemy yeah that's the thing I mean we have a situation where there's a total disregard for National Security with this Administration you can point to The Botch withdrawal from Afghanistan you can point to the Border crisis that has been playing out where we have over a hundred people who have been apprehended that are on the international terrorist watch list God knows how many of them were godaways that are now somewhere within our country now you look at the handling of classified documents it points to a bigger issue Harris they have no regard for the rule of law and they have no regard for our national security and I think this is where you're going to see a very aggressive Republican house coming after them to hold them accountable because everyday Americans we're sick and tired of this double set of Standards we need consequences we need that oversight and we need to get our country back on track and it starts with the basics National Security but if you have an Administration that has no regard for it you've got to start with the house and making sure that the investigations are happening and the people being held accountable and there are actual consequences you know this is unfolding before our eyes I said that off the top of the hour I mean it is a drip drip of Epic Proportions I've been asking about what happens when a vice president takes papers from a sitting president because that's what happened with Biden and former president Obama what would Obama or his team have to say about it we haven't heard from the former president this though Obama's ethics Chief didn't hold back when it comes to the president's this one Biden's mishandling of classified documents here's a quote for the screen the negligence exhibited in the mishandling of Records especially those stored in his garage is appalling the White House was not at all forthcoming with the public about their Discovery and more than one location um when it comes to the apparent lack of concern for National Security another example a former secret service agent says Biden's Regular Joe image was his only concern as VP it's pretty unbelievable I imagine though we're going to hear from the former president or somebody representing him sooner or later he was the only person who could declassify those absolutely and and that I think is something that the mainstream media except for of course Fox they have glossed over Biden had no authority to declassify let alone take these documents and now as we've been finding this deep black dark hole where we are finding all kinds of Nefarious war and funding sources we're finding people who had access to these documents uh ties to Hunter Biden it's all really painting a picture like I said they're more concerned with the Optics and the brand than they are National Security yeah that's pretty concerning considering that you have the commander-in-chief with access to the nuclear codes what in the heck are we as Americans supposed to count on if not what is coming out of the White House and I think it's pretty clear we can't count on them and that's why I think you're going to see for the next two years a real refocus coming out of the House of Representatives on National Security I think that's why we're going to see the Senate flip and ultimately Americans are going to say you know what we're sick and tired of this so-called every every man Joe Biden Persona that he's tried to to take on you know he seems more concerned with what ice cream flavor he's picking then securing our borders you know that's what people are concerned about and they're not addressing the national security or the economic implications of what they're doing he may not want to be accountable to us the American people but his former President helped him mightily in the in the end and it will be interesting to see was Obama complicit and knew about those papers or did he know nothing about it and what will he do next I do think it's an important part of the story and so is what you're talking about everybody being held accountable all right we'll move Biden's document Scandal is pretty bad it could get worse we don't know this next story is beyond horrific and you mentioned it congresswoman the administration's open border policy allowing gangs and cartels to move freely between Mexico and now deep into the United States police are saying they believe cartel members killed this young mother and her baby Alyssa Perez was just 16 years old her son Nicholas 10 months old a monster shot them both in the head also killed the baby's grandmother and great-grandmother a total of six people in that home murdered in what police are calling a cartel style execution the slaughter happened in the small Central California town of Goshen near Fresno Police are still searching for The Killers and pointing directly to the fact that it looks like a cartel would do this sort of thing well where are the cartels coming from the border yeah you know Harris uh you and I have talked about this at length before it's pretty wild to think that the cartels control 40 percent of Mexico as we know it not just territory but critical parts of their government and infrastructure so if you have an entity that is controlling 40 percent of your country well you have a real problem on your hand and we know that the cartel subcontract out some of the more nefarious aspects of their work to gangs here in the United States I've heard the horror stories I met a 15 year old girl who had a two-year-old daughter and she had been recruited through Facebook through targeted advertisements paid the cartels half of the money through Facebook and WhatsApp and then was told that she would have to quote unquote work it off for the remainder of the money when I said what happens if you don't work it off which of course we all know what that means she said I've been told that there could be problems well we know what those problems are that's when you see these horrific murders these assaults these young people that are being recruited and basically trafficked across the United States now these are horrific happening and it is all as a result of the open border policies by Joe Biden

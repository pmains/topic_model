we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we hold we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw welcome back guys this is um sort of an emergency session because i want to bring light to a really important issue and the issue is special immigrant visas for our interpreters that are still stuck in afghanistan iraq everywhere we've been and i i don't think like if you've been in the military you understand this issue very well but most people have not been in the military and and don't know uh why this is important and um first i'm going to tell tell you why it's really really personal for me um when i was blown up in 2012 the reason i was blown up was because one of our interpreters uh was blown up in front of me and he's the one who stepped on the ied uh an ied that was maybe a little bit bigger than normal um for what we were used to a lot of times these things just kind of take off a leg or two um this one absolutely destroyed him every every limb was gone right away he survived for a little while longer he later died in the hospital his name was rachman and he was a patriot i mean he he he would tell us that he would you know his dream was to maybe come back to the united states one day and and go through buds and become a navy seal and he worked his ass off he he was running to a call because that's what these guys did they they go they have to you know sometimes you know seals or wherever whoever's out there we kind of change what missions we go on but the interpreters have to be on everything and they always have to be in the front because we always need them in every single aspect of the mission so they just never get a break and um and this guy in particular is you know some are better than others this guy in particular was really dedicated and he was blown up right in front of me and i was blinded by that blast and i could hear him i could hear him after that blast people think that when you get blown up it's like the movies and you're screaming you know and uh that's not how it is nobody screams after they've been blown up they've grown it's like a deep it's a deep deep pain because you don't have the energy to scream it's it's it's true pain it's true pain manifested into sound that's what it sounds like and it's it's something you'll never forget um that's rachman that guy should be a us citizen um all of the interpreters who were with us should be here in this country and they should not be left behind because of a hasty pull out so that's what we're going to talk about today so i have two um two heroes like that with us today abdul sami and matula azizi thank you guys both for being with us thank you my pleasure so i'm just going to call you sammy and matt just for the for the sake of conversation um tell us let's uh matt let's start with you um you guys are some of the lucky ones so you have gone through the siv process you're you're here we're in my dc office right now um but let's just let's just go through some history about just one at a time maybe you guys can both kind of talk together like don't feel like it's um you know there's a conversation but tell tell the audience where you guys came from how you ended up here yeah um i started my journey as an interpreter translator in 2007 and back then it like the spatial immigration visa was for 50 people a year and then i applied and i i went through all this process and i got my approval and i was waiting for my siv since 2009 i got everything approved and i was waiting for just to get the visa from 2009 until 2013. so when did you start working for as an interpreter 2 november 2007. okay gotcha and what we're at back in back in kabul back there was kemp eggers yeah back in a couple and since then i was i was doing a lot of like training and we were going to um a lot of missions and training the afghan national army like all stuff like that and then finally i i got the visa and i i like the the whole process was very long and very frustrating and like every day since they the u.s troops pulled out slow so our life was really in danger and like every day was a nightmare and like we were living in a really scary environment every every time we were like let's just see who's chasing you and who's coming after you like that was like a nightmare alive for me are you from kabul i'm from colorado so you so you were you living on base or were you living out in town so you would come to work on base so that's you're more vulnerable because of that yes i was commuting to work every day like going to work at seven in the morning and come home at 5 30 6 00. they figure out where you live well yeah like in 2012 yes like even i received a multiple calls from annual numbers and i gave it to the commander like a navy commander that i used to work for and i told him like this number has threatened me and all that and then he took it to his chain of command and then and i think they found out who that was but they did not tell me they said okay we're gonna take care of this yeah yeah and sammy what about you what's your history thank you for the opportunity i started working with the us armed forces back in 2004 and uh it was like initially i'm from iraq afghanistan in the west and i came in 2004 to start working with the u.s forces and campaggers in kabul but it was like we were based in kabul but we were a lot of times we we had to go to the missions down in different provinces that we had to go in 2007 i was able to get my visa to come to the united states after i came here after like after a year or so i started working with defense language institute teaching language to the u.s u.s forces especially commanding officers and there wasn't i was working with general miller general scott miller who is currently nato commander in afghanistan and i saw that he became this special operation commander in afghanistan back in 2010 and there was a need that they could use my services so i felt that it was my responsibility that i had to go back with him so i went back to afghanistan with you know miller i have i've done each single bfcs or battlefield circulation that they've done have i've i go i went with on each one each mission that they attended and sometimes what uh there were lots of good general officers like general baldwick and uh general miller came back to us uh but general christopher chaos replaced him he kept me there for another year uh then i came back to us because i was called back to come to work for general miller and special operation joint task force brag then i was redeployed like it was voluntarily going back to afghanistan because i was feeling it is my responsibility i had that uh that power in me that i could contribute more more to the u.s to my fellow u.s citizens or i went back to afghanistan with general miller again from 2013 to 2014 worked with different general officers as i said we have gone to different uh different missions i've seen a lot of people that they died in front of me yeah and it was definitely when i came back for a long time i had ptsd what is like we are trying to hide that we don't we do not want to be leveled at somebody someone who has pdsd while some people they they might think that soonly that the people with the uniform they might get you ptsd but while it comes to the us desired or local linguist they also they are going through the same pain that any other service member are going so basically each minute that we were staying each minute we were feeling that anytime we can be beheaded anytime we can be uh taliban can uh can arrest us and kill us were you in similar situ are you from kabul also no similar situation where you're kind of were you living on base there or when i was local i was when i was a local linguist no i to do the commute going back and forth to home but even back in 2006 and seven i received several trading calls and i when people did front stones and rocks in my house i had to replace like a couple times i had to move from one location to the other location to ensure that i'm kind of hiding and i was alternating my way that normally my commute to work so basically i was trying to hide and see play hide and seek with with the ones that they were after me but it was one of the lucky ones that i was able to get the visa for me took me almost like uh almost a year and a half to get the visa how many people do you guys know um i'm sure you're in contact with maybe other interpreters you know who never got a visa or or maybe it was too late by the time they did is that a lot a lot there are so many languages that i do remember the summit they started from 2002 three they still haven't received their visa they worked there and we we fear that as soon as u.s forces live and withdraw from afghanistan they're going to be number one target then the other problem is that uh most of the time like i was listening to radio other day and i saw president ghani said that please do not give do not issue with us to afghan linguist to come to the united doesn't see st really going on he doesn't feel he can't he can't protect you yeah you know yeah i if i if i was if i was there i could have asked him that uh are you going to are you willing to leave your family members once you just use leaves afghanistan you're living and in the palace there are tens of thousands of people that they are securing your family but you cannot see the pain that the afghan linguist and afghan contractors are going through you do have the possibility that you can come to us or any other country you want because uh you used to live in u.s not those people not those poor people as soon as uh u.s forces leave they don't have any option didn't then and as you know that uh linguists are the one number one target for the for the taliban and insurgents because they as you know that they know if they kill you they kill it an interpreter they are going to be uh disabling the entire team so it's going to be difficult sometimes it was difficult to find linguist and i have seen a lot of linguists that they were working next to me and they died they were killed in in action or killed because they were targeted no they were targeted really specifically targeted yeah i have like one of my friends uh cousin he was working in kandahar then he was moved to mazar to balk province and he he like he was on a mission that he was targeted and he was killed and as you know that like for a while uh it was like an easy target if you had civilian clue they would kill you first because they know that there's a language so that's why they have to change and for that uniform to to ensure that they can blend in and they do not know who is the language yeah that makes sense um what do you guys think here's a more general question i mean what's in the future for afghanistan now if we're pulling out in september unfortunately what i see right now it's i do not see any future right now the problem is that uh as soon as uh we can see all those uh all the big problems that as soon as u.s uh announced that they are going to withdraw from afghanistan you can see that usq afghan government they lost a lot of uh territories that they were under their control and they already know taliban controlled areas i've never been able to figure out why the taliban are so much more ferocious of fighters than like the guys we're training i just can't like it just we beat our heads against the wall constantly it's like we have so many more we have tens of thousands of afghan national army that we've trained but they just um but i don't know there's a different cult it's almost like a different warrior culture um and i i you know all these years it's it's it's difficult to understand so i i i too am pessimistic about their ability to hold territory yeah the problem is that what we can see right now they do not have anybody to back them like even afghan forces they have they are right now in a dilemma they can't fight dirty either exactly which is a big you know i'll grant them that because i'll never forget when we're like hey we need you guys to go do this mission and they're like no and then they're like they're like no you come with us and we're like we're not going to be here forever you got you guys go do it and they're like would you go there in these humvees that we have and then we're like nope good point so i get it um they don't have the backup and you know again the taliban fights dirty i mean they're laying i the ied threat really it's such a game changer for guerilla warfare unfortunately right now as you can see this like a number of their traits are like number of the attacks that they're doing is smash increasing and as you as we can look at the look the local media you can see that day by day like the local provinces even the provinces centers and district centers they're falling under taliban i was i was watching uh the news the local news from afghanistan the other day and i saw that they were pretty close to even capture a cherry car which is like literally 20 or 30 miles away from the capital from the uh from afghanistan capital from kabul so as you can see it's it's getting so serious that i do not think that anybody can hold and from the other side there is another problem that a lot of people that they are doing the movement yeah that's good from one way that they're at least standing in front of taliban but as you can see that there is a lot of local animosity that people they do not like each other and right now most of them they do have guns for any reason you can be killed because you're not liked by someone and everybody pretty much has guns and you're the victim right now it's so factionalized too because i mean from an american perspective you're like why wouldn't people everybody has guns so like why wouldn't you rise up against the taliban like they're oppressive they're awful they they stone your women to death they they're terrible but but you don't see that and and there's and it's complicated reasoning as to why one thing about afghanistan is it like is a religious country so they believe sometimes people believe that they're right but most of the people think that they're wrong and that's why right now most of the people they're like yeah we will stand against them and we will fight them like if they're trying to come over and take over our area we will stand and we and we will fight them no matter what we will help an afghan national army and we will stand against them and fight them and while they're in in afghanistan there are a lot of religion people that they think that oh yeah they are right and yet americans should go away and this is our country and all that but they those are the people that they did not go to any school and they do not like the only place that they go is mosque and then that's it in and but most of those people that they went to mosque they they're not educated they just follow one word from the elder of the village or whatever the elder of the village stated they think that oh that this is very true and he's right no matter like what if he tells that the sky is green they all say yeah oh the sky is green let's just follow his word they cannot they don't have that mentality to just go um and look outside and see that if this guy is really green or not so it becomes easy to for taliban to especially take over the rural areas um absolutely those are the areas that they just go like after and then they like hey we are right in like okay because of the religious again religious is more important for most part in afghanistan and mata actually has pointed a really really important uh like important subject the big problem we have two problems in afghanistan one is literacy that lot like almost 90 percent or 95 percent of the people in the rural area areas they are uneducated the second problem is their economy uh they are young they do not have a job and the only thing that they the only education that they have is just going to the mosque is reading just reading off after of the book that's all they do not know the meaning of holy quran they do not know what does it really mean why they are reading and they do not exist and that's why that and from the other side they see that there is a uh there is an opportunity for them to to make some money and and most of them like almost i can say probably more than 90 of those people that they are fighting on that alongside with the two over the taliban troops they are the ones that uh they have been brainwashed because uh right now i've got all the mosque them we call it mambars and man by means like where the priest is standing and talking those those members have been used against uh against democracy and they are being used to uh they have monetized that uh and we have a common enemy pakistan so yes pakistan is not unfortunately it turns to become like a territory that uh it is pretty clear everybody knows what's happening why they are training and then they are sending those troops to afghanistan and they are saying that anybody who work for the us government in any capacity whether contractor linguist or anything they are they are infidel that's what they call and they that's why it's an easy target target for the taliban members they do not know what is what's happening they all know that if i kill this person i'll go to jannah well that's completely wrong like almost few years ago one of the taliban member was captured and i saw it on news local news it was they asked him can you can you say the statement of faith which without that you cannot even become muslim he did not know that and if you're asking what's the meaning there is no way that they would know what's the meaning of statement of faith so what can you expect from somebody who does not even know how to recite this statement of it so the only thing that they their brainwash they get money and their job is just like killing machine they go just kill and uh we as linguists and contractors we are we are an easy target and they will think that we are we are the key to jenna because they can kill if they kill us they are going directly to jannah yeah on my 13 calls that i was receiving they were keep calling me that i'm spying and i'm a spy and also i'm envelo infidel i they told me that you convert you are converted now to an infidel and we will get you and i recorded their voice and i gave it to my um the commander that i used to work for and they took those whole um audio record and to his chain of command are you guys still in touch with a lot of people a lot of interpreters contractors now uh how are they feeling about it it's it's been a while you guys were there a while ago it's quite difficult to be uh connected right now at uh because we do not like we do not have much contact with them but was what i can see on the news definitely those people need to be helped urgently need and they need help and if for any reason if they are being they stayed behind i can assure you that almost 90 95 of these people they might lose their life it is very important for those people to come you bring up something we were talking about the future of afghanistan people don't realize that the cities kabul and kandahar are very much i wouldn't call them like u.s cities by any stretch but they're but as far as you know developing countries go they look like a normal city uh i'll never every time we were leaving through kandahar remember there's a giant casino that we would pass on our left and it's like i don't think i don't think here in america people realize that that degree in kabul is much more developed as a city so it's just totally different worlds like this modern city and then you go into the rural areas and it feels biblical it feels like the biblical ages it really is that ex that extreme i really i don't know how else to describe it um and uh so you can see how these these toxic ideas from the taliban can take root and be very effective and it's which answers my questions like why don't people rebel and like that's kind of what i'm getting at it's not it's not that simple no the the problem as uh matt was pointing earlier it's uh it's about the wrong beliefs of people they think that they are on the right side and they they think that it's just everything that they are doing is like legally justified in islam while that what most of what they are doing even according to islam is completely forbidden like killing of a one human like innocent one you one innocent human being is equal to killing of all humanities and it says in holy quran saving of an innocent human being is equal to saving of all humanities they do not know they do not know what really holy quran says so that's a big problem that they're completely uneducated they just listen to what the mallas and the people that they are like their leaders they were just listening to them that's all here's a big question for you because you know you're you're uh hanging out with generals a lot so you're you're the one translating the grand strategy quite often so you're you see it um was this avoidable right this this this situation where we we've basically and i i'll never forget a a a a brief we got from some experts on afghanistan before the deployment in 2012 and they basically said you you can control the the cities you can that's that's defensible but you can never nobody in history has ever controlled the rural areas of afghanistan that probably seems right it seems right now so was this always inevitable this outcome uh actually why was there a better thing what could we have done better i think we could have done much better the problem is that uh the big problem is as i said it's literacy if we were able to target it from day one we were targeting the members master the mosque and we try to ensure that those people that they are in those members or mosques they are the ones that they are not infected i would say it's like coveting fiction i would say that like taliban or terrorism whatever so if we were able to control those members then there was would have not been any problem and as you know that it's we can we can just say that uh uh talibans are we we if we just can call it taliban or like fishes and if you take the word then the people are like water so if you take the water away from the fishes they will die so it's that's that important that we should have invested more in education we should have invested more in our intelligence sources down in the ground to ensure that we should have uh like us and afghan government should have better control over all those mosques if they had it they would definitely would have a much different outcome right now and right now we probably would have not seen this this much problem but right now it's like uh we call it the genes out of the wall the bottle is difficult to control everything and that's hard in general i mean you know how does a u.s military control the education system in a foreign country i mean that's that's i think we say it's certainly a conversation that happened right it's the winning the hearts and minds and all that but it's it's practically speaking extremely difficult um almost an exercise in futility but but you're right i mean that would have changed the game i mean i suppose there could have been more of an effort when we had hundreds of thousands of people there we were doing everything else like spending billions of dollars yeah we were building schools but it's like what's being taught in those schools um and look we got a we got tens of thousands of of girls educated um in the end is it enough you know it's like because it's like you're trying to plug a dam with a with there's just your thumb and um it's uh that's difficult i mean it gets to the question of nation building can you really build a democracy in another country and i think the answer is no i mean the the american people certainly would answer no um i've always said look the answer is sometimes yes in a place but not afghanistan i think it's like uh from a point we can say it was a little like too much too fast i would call it so like us government probably try like i'm not blaming you as government because it's like there's different cultures so i think uh we try like u.s government try to teach you or bring democracy like very fast to the country i think if they were working like a little bit more moderate like if they had like a little bit different approach to that i think that would have like different uh outcome it's afghanistan is a very strange country it's like very very difficult to control as you said uh but now here we are so yeah it's amazing that it's even one country i mean uh like what's do you guys speak all the different language victoria pashtu were you guys translated for all of it yeah i i'm already i'm i'm taught i speak derry and i speak by as well yeah so i mean there's all these um there's all these different factions tribes languages you know i mean iraq is pretty factionalized but at least they speak the same language for the most part i guess the kurds kind of have their own thing going but afghanistan's like a whole different whole different monster i mean do people don't even but can you go into these rural areas do they even identify as afghan like in a nationalistic sense at all or is it it's tribe it's one hundred percent tribe hundred percent yeah exactly as you're right yeah they do have like their black coat of honors like uh like for example persons they have their code of honors as it like there are i think seven coats of honors that if you stay in their village then you can be safeguarded so they have like code of honors as you can see it's like everything is like all tribal so we should like that was the big problem that nothing has changed and uh unfortunately generation by generation like same same ideology was passed from one generation to the other generation and it's kind of difficult to change that so let's uh just and what's your message to the the state department um like it's a mix it's complicated on these siv issues but fundamentally state department just has to prioritize this and um you know we have to tell them how important it is so last word so what i think is that uh the estate department will have two choices either to to raise the left the life of like that 18 20 000 people that have supported u.s forces and then consequently it will have like a bad impact on the u.s missions in future or they have the options to somehow expedite the visa process for these people that they have we have been waiting for years and right now their life is uh truly in danger if they don't get their visa they don't they don't have any option to migrate to any other country because you know that iran will not let them go to migrate to iran because uh they they work for the u.s government and the other option that they have pakistan pakistan as you know that invest it's more dangerous to go to pakistan so they do not have any other option right now so the only option is just help them to get their visa or find somehow bring them over try to expedite the process for those people i would highly recommend to just give them their visas just save their lives or either way they if they don't get their visas and once they use troops pulled out i'm pretty sure they they're going to lose their life and also not their life probably life of their families as well because like for me i was it was not only me my brothers too like they were they were calling me and they were telling me like i'm spying and my brothers are spying for the used troops because uh we were all working for uh used troops and they they were like yeah we will come and get you like it wasn't only me they said we will come and get you and they know me and my brothers we were working for the youth troops so yeah i would highly recommend that they should issue their visas uh before they use um the troops and it's really important for for the afghan interpreters to get out of there because they're not going to survive it would be an atrocity it'd be an atrocity and you know for for the policy side what we're trying to do is is is establish at least a because what they won't do is just grant the visas right off the bat we're hoping to do is um establish a third location that we can send everybody um and then let the process play out there and um that's why we're doing this podcast that's why we had you guys on um look if you're if you're at home listening ask your representatives to um to make a big stink about this it's bipartisan there's a bipartisan effort going on to deal with this this administration is just not they they they did not prioritize they did not think ahead before announcing it and so it's taken a lot of pressure from congress to get them to move and um the state department really needs to uh to lead the lead the way um more so than they have been so thank you both for coming on appreciate it thanks for having us

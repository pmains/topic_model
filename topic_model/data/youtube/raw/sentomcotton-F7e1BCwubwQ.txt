all right Senator Tom Cotton the author of Only the Strong has campaigned for Herschel Walker and he joins us right now this day after Thanksgiving Senator good morning to you hey Steve it's good to be on with you happy thanks hope everyone had a Happy Thanksgiving so far so good uh we have plenty of leftovers today uh so Senator what does it say to you that President Obama who's a big star in the Democratic party is invited but Joe Biden man maybe not well I think it's uh notable reminder that Joe Biden's policies remain very unpopular across the country and especially in places like Georgia where families are struggling to make ends meet probably going to have to trim their sales for their Christmas gift-giving budget uh worried about crime in their streets and our Southern border Barack Obama Remains the most popular and powerful figure within the Democratic party in some way Joe Biden remains his understudy and is running his third term so it's not surprising the Democrats are deploying President Obama I would rather have on our side Governor Brian Kemp the most popular and successful elected leader in Georgia and I know Governor Kemp is rolling up his sleeves to help elect Herschel Walker because this is about more than just control the senate for the next couple years it's about who's going to represent Georgians in the United States Senate for the next six years yeah yeah Senator how do you think this race is going to play out because Herschel Walker underperformed in the general election Brian Kemp got 200 000 more votes than him so how does he make up that ground so I believe that Herschel is going to win anybody who wants to help can go to his website and pitch in one way or another at Tim herschel.com I think having Brian Kemp on the campaign Trail having him on television advocating directly to voters rehearsal helping get out the vote is going to help her she'll get across the finish line and that third party the libertarian as well I think you'll see some votes going to Herschel Walker no doubt it'll be a tough hard-fought race most races in Georgia have been recently but I believe Herschel will help we'll get across the finish line so Senator what is the pitch to voters because they just had an election obviously Brian Kemp was able to get the Republicans and independents to Rally behind them he almost doubled his support with black men what is going to be that final pitch for voters is there a new message since this is a runoff or are you guys double Downing uh on you guys's message on the ground in Georgia well as Governor Kemp has explained this is about who's going to represent Georgia and their interest and their aspirations in the United States and it's not just about what the Democrats focus on which is power and control but who's going to help deliver the results in Washington that Governor Kemp has delivered for Georgians for the last four years helping bring down costs imposing more fiscal discipline in Washington helping address the crime wave and try to try to secure our Southern border those are the issues Georgians care about as opposed to what Barack Obama is going there for which is try to secure Democratic power for two more years absolutely and of course they're going to start voting very shortly Senator thank you very much uh Happy Thanksgiving merry Christmas happy holidays I think I've covered all the bases thank you all thank you senator

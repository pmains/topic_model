um i grew up in a family restaurant business and that's where i was working up until uh i came to congress in 2019 um for those of you who have worked in restaurants uh every day is a all hands on deck kind of day and um there's a lot that can go wrong on any given day and no one really could have anticipated what transpired over the last year no one was ready for that had the financial cushion necessary to weather that storm and it was tough for a lot of our business owners and workers and that's why the relief that has been authorized on a bipartisan basis over the last 14 months has really risen to the moment to help provide that lifeline that's necessary but as i said i think we have to continue to be talking about the relief that's available and how we can provide additional support moving forward

thank you very much mr. chairman of the subcommittee for your courtesy and and for members of the subcommittee I think the three panels combined are very good witnesses on behalf of meritorious pieces of legislation that we will be considering in a amending and I look forward to having the opportunity to contribute to that effort I do because of a potential conflict would like to speak on HR 2470 mr. hardier testified earlier as a co-sponsor of HR 2471 important piece of water legislation that provides additional tools and our water toolbox to provide solutions to sustain California's water resources we are going to have a very good witness on the third panel a person who I've worked with over the years MS Thea G Hansen general manager of del portillo Water District she and I've worked on previous projects before a very innovative reuse project that now is an implementation that ultimately will provide 58,000 acre feet of reuse of water the project that she and the exchange contractors with another very good general manager Chris White too works on behalf they exchange contractors talks about the innovation that we have in California with our water districts so working in partnership with one another both on local state and federal projects and the Canyon project the portrayed Canyon project is such a off-site reservoir that would benefit from the passage of HR 2471 I am supporting this piece of legislation it creates a water infrastructure fund potentially these funds could go to a lot of projects like the Canyon project it supports water storage Kanyon project is not only an infrastructure project but it's a water storage facility that has no opposition that I am aware of it provides a hundred million dollars for storage funding it provides a monetary prize as congressman Artur said for innovative water technology we are at the cutting edge some of the most innovative water technology and and efficiencies have been practiced for decades because water is so so valuable and because of the drought conditions and people talk about the Israelis and I've been to Israel and they do incredible things but I started an exchange 20 years ago between the Israelis and Fresno State and many of our water districts implement 95 percent drip irrigation and more to conserve this very valuable water but this monetary prize can be helpful it provides reclamation for infrastructure and finance innovation funding it provides reauthorization for rural water supply for our clean drinking water we have sadly hundreds and thousands of people in the valley alone that live in communities that don't benefit from clean drinking water standards and we can we can fix that the state's come up with significant funding for that purpose this funding in this area will complement the state funding to improve drinking water for citizens not only in California but throughout the country and also invest an additional water recycling and reuse just like the project that del Puerto did with the cities of Turlock and Modesto these kinds of reuse projects are more and more being implemented on the local level because it works and it makes sense and it would also provide in California we've got probably one of the most historical and difficult pieces of state legislation that was implemented two years ago called the sustainable groundwater management Act otherwise known as Sigma this is a very important piece of legislation we're trying to manage balancing the overdraft that is taking place in our groundwater basins it's not easy the state law would require our Oh districts by the year 2040 to come in balance you know it's the old adage a you know if you go to a bank and you make withdrawals and you don't make any deposits you could only do that for so long and we understand the critical need of the overdraft of our communities this legislation if passed have become mental aw would provide another tool for our water districts to come in to imply us with this historical law in California so there are many many good reasons to support HR 2470 Thea Hansen will make a strong statement on behalf of the legislation and all the good things she and the other water managers are doing in the San Joaquin Valley I thank the chairman for allowing me to go out of order and to recognize this witness and I look forward to working with the subcommittee on this and other important pieces of legislation I think

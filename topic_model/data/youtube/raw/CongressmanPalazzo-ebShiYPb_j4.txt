mr palazzo thank you madam chair and ranking member for holding this here and secretary marcus thank you for taking the time to speak to us today as you may know my district lines the mississippi gulf coast and has two ports of entry where cbp agents are stationed we have two u.s coast guard small boat stations and we got what i believe to be two of the greatest ship builders in america right in my backyard one building the national security cutter and the other building the first polar security cutter in over 50 years and so i would like to extend an open invitation for you to visit the mississippi gulf coast at any time i'd like to be a part of your trip the last time you testified before the subcommittee i had just returned from a trip to the southwest border with several members of the border security caucus i'm appalled by the fact it has been a year since you sat before us last and the only change regarding the situation at the southwest border is that the situation has got much worse this administration's lacks policies and opening the borders not just allow immigration to occur it has opened the floodgates for nefarious activity and burden the ds agencies that have the responsibility to respond this just isn't affecting the border but it's also affecting local and state law enforcement all across america not just border states the cbp agents i spoke with while visiting the border begged us to fight for the continuation of title 42 because their facilities and their staffing levels cannot handle the massive influx that would occur if they were reversed how can this administration literally file lawsuits to keep cdc coved 19 protocols inflicted on american people and planes in public transportation but alternatively want to drop the coved 19 protocol for non-citizens immigrants under title 42 at the border congressman uh thank you first of all for your kind invitation to visit your jurisdiction and i um i uh will accept that invitation and look forward to joining you there and i um i cannot overstate the importance of the national security cutters and um our appreciation for this committee's support for the polar security cutter which is of such vital importance especially as our arctic strategy becomes more important uh with other nations aggressions in that area um congressman as i said at the very outset title 42 is an authority as a that centers for disease control and prevention exercises it is their authority exclusively and not ours our job is to implement plans uh according to whether or not that authority continues to be exercised uh in their in their decision making let me be clear that we are mandating vaccines for individuals whom we encounter at the southern border we are building our vaccination capacity and those individuals who are not vaccinated are subject to detention if they are not already subject to detention for independent law enforcement means individuals who cross our border are placed in immigration enforcement proceedings they make claims for relief under our law if they do so and those claims succeed then they have established a legal basis to remain if those claims do not succeed then they are expeditiously removed from our country the well-resourced cartels gang members human traffickers and drug smugglers will exploit this crisis to further endanger american citizens a group of 130 plus members of congress wrote to you calling on you to immediately take all legal and necessary actions at your disposal of which there are many to secure the southern border rectify the dangerous policies this administration has put in motion over the past year and bring your agency into compliance with the laws passed by the united states congress how much has it cost the department of homeland security to cancel pause or otherwise halt construction of physical barriers along the southern border authorized and appropriated by law congressman let me let me say a few things in response to your question because we are implementing the laws that congress has passed and we are doing so effectively focusing on the greatest public safety national security and border security threats we are exercising prosecutorial discretion a long established and long held best practice we are doing so effectively to have the greatest law enforcement impact number one number two you mentioned the cartels the transnational criminal organizations we have intensified our efforts uh to attack them and have done so in unprecedented ways and i welcome the chance to provide details with respect to how we are doing so not only is the department of homeland security but in collaboration with other federal agencies and state and local law enforcement agencies the wall projects the majority of them rest in the jurisdiction of the army corps of engineer those that we ourselves control i believe that the cost of discontinuing them is approximately 72 million dollars and i will follow up with you to ensure the accuracy of my statement uh this morning thank you congress yeah thank you please do i yield back

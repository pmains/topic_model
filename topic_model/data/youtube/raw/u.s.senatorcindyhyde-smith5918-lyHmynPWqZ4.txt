thank you senator crafto you know this time last year we tried to tell the biden administration not to pour trillions of dollars into this economy the basic fundamentals of economics have to work a high schooler taking an economics class could figure this out but the white house can't this is unbelievable inflation of 40 years when i was in high school i worked at a grocery store when i was 15 years old and i worked there for five years on and off part-time through school i noticed every item i knew how much it cost gallon of milk was a dollar fifty nine you just about name an item so i'm very conscious of the price of groceries when i was in my grocery store at home they were taking the prices down i said what are you doing they said they're going up so fast we're having to constantly keep somebody out here to change the pricing out folks this is real let me translate this into real life mississippi is a huge timber state we have millions of acres of timber we call ourselves a wood basket to harvest this timber you have to get it to a sawmill the log trucks that haul this timber to the sawmills they're tractor trailer rigs 18 wheelers they have to fill those tanks up every day with fuel so they can continue on these tanks hold about 120 to 150 gallons of fuel in the tank and by the way they only get like six to seven miles per gallon when they're loaded every morning the loggers in mississippi have to fuel those tanks up 120 gallons and it's almost four dollars a gallon do the math on that mississippians are hurting this country is hurting because the inflation that we're looking at even with the grocery prices there 12 up that doesn't say a whole lot do you think 12 is really not that much trust me it is as i used to check out groceries and i'd get to the subtotal and i'd add the taxes and then i'd get to the total and the lady would look at me and she'd say we'd have to put something back because we had to match what was in her purse so we put back some items so she could afford it i can't imagine what that is today i can't imagine what that is when they come in and they realize i cannot afford this our families have to eat so it is real it is hurting families and the president trul still tries to spin it as the economy is doing good mississippians aren't buying that it is not doing good in mississippi or anywhere else in the country and i wish the president would have heeded the warnings of the economist and he needs to do that now because we're hurting it is real these are real stories and we can do better than this and the american people certainly deserve better than this thank you

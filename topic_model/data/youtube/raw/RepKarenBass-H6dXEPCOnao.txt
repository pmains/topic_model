House Democratic leaders are facing a delicate balancing act now that the Mullen report is public they need to charge ahead with their many investigations into President Trump with some quickly using it to push for impeachment yet at the same time they need to promote issues like health care criminal justice and middle-class economic prosperity with their eyes toward 2020 joining me now is congresswoman Karen bass Democrat of California she is a member of the Judiciary Committee and the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus congresswoman bass the committee Judiciary Committee of in which your member of has issued subpoenas if the Attorney General fights those subpoenas both for his own appearance and for a unredacted view of the entire Mullah report and supporting evidence will your committee aggressively fight to make sure that those subpoenas are honored oh absolutely we most certainly will and so it might wind up that we go to court but we're going to do everything we can because we need all of the information we need the unredacted report we need the underlying evidence and then it's not just judiciary you know there's the Intelligence Committee there's the Government Reform Committee there's financial services so although this nightmare has gone on for two years and it seems like it's just lasted for so long as you said a few minutes ago we've only received the report 48 hours ago so we really we've achieved a milestone and getting the report but we actually have a long way to go now we've heard from some of the presidential candidates senator Elizabeth Warren say it's time for impeachment as you said report has only been released the redacted report 48 hours ago has the Congressional Black Caucus and others you chair the caucus quite effectively had they taken a on impeachment because there's some concern that we need to also deal with the issues going into 2020 like health care criminal justice reform what is the early feeling that you're getting from some of your colleagues well it's definitely people have different views but let me just say in regard to the Senators suggestion I think it would be very very helpful if the senator could identify some actual senators that would be interested in the second part of impeachment because you know that we impeach in the house but you also know that he would have to be tried and convicted in the Senate and so what we need is senators that would be willing to go along with that in terms of the Congressional Black Caucus we do have members of the caucus who have been very outspoken about impeachment where 55 members strong so you have a lot of different perspectives but I think that in in total we really have a long way to go in this process and so the next step in the process in addition to issuing subpoenas is a number of hearings that need to happen you know we have Barr we need Muller we need McCann we have a number of hearings that need to happen along the way when we look at this clearly they're those of us that have our views on president Trump including yours truly but we're also looking at the presidency we're looking at the office of the chief executive of this country leader of the free world and we're hearing people saying he had knowledge that I lied and did nothing about it lied to the special counsel that he told a the White House Counsel to get rid of a special counsel of the fire him in some way I mean are we seeing the erosion of the standard of the presidency of the United States oh I think he has had really horrible influence and impact on the institution of the presidency and we have to remember it's not just in the United States it's the way the entire world looks at us now we've always been seen as the rock of the planet you know everything has always stayed and consistent in the United States and now people look at us and say well I'm not so sure it just shows the importance of the election in 2020 that we have the right person elected so that we can essentially repair the presidency as an institution it has been damaged when you look at that and you say the right person or to run in 2020 in many ways what we're looking at is whoever the Democratic candidate or opposition candidate is assuming his president Trump they're not only talking about removing an incumbent they're talking about restoring a certain level to the presidency if in fact it is the feeling of most American voters that the presidency has in many ways been harmed well the presidency has been harmed and then the Republican Party in my opinion has been seized by a group of extremists and so not just do we need the presidency back until the Republicans get their party back we need the Senate and we need the house we have to maintain full control and as you mentioned a few minutes ago we have a lot of things on our agenda the health healthcare reform criminal justice reform the education system voting rights we have a long agenda and I'm proud to say that in the first hundred days of Democrats being in charge of the house in spite of everything that we're doing we have been passing a proactive agenda as well now with that agenda and and certainly we've laid it out here tonight and you know I've dedicated my life to a lot of those issues I do when we look at the this agenda and we look at the overall problem with this investigation we're talking about whether an adversary to the United States interfered with an election with voting so in many ways as much as you push the agenda you have to protect the voters in order to have them be able to elect the people to handle that agenda so they're really not separate I think was austan a lot of dependency is we are talking about an enemy of the country yes clearly this report says interfered with the election and then I think what's even sadder is is that the Republicans really don't seem to be concerned about it at all if they were we would have been able to pass resources to make sure that our elections were strong but Rev you're an organizer and you know and we proved it in the November election even with interference even with voter suppression if we organize if we mobilize we turnout and we win we flip the house 40 seats over 300 state seats so all is not lost the fact of the matter is that a lot of people are saying but all this disarray will turn voters off I think whether it's Republican or Democrat it should turn them on to save the sanctity of voting in this country and those that would uphold what this country should be standing for I agree and I think that's exactly what happened in November and I think it's incumbent upon all of us to make sure that we sustain the level of activity the level of activism that we saw a few months ago we have to keep that up because one of the possible outcomes of this whole situation right now we know we have a president who essentially has no regard for the rule of law and so if things are dragged out for months and months and months and go through the courts there's a possibility that we will run right into the election next year so we have to learn how to walk and chew gum at the same time all right thank you very much congresswoman Karen bass

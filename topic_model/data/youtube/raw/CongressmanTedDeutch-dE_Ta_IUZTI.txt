not with this now is Democratic congressman Ted Deutsch whose district includes parkland congressman thank you for being with us and I want to know what what make you have been somebody who has been vocal on the issue of gun violence on the issue of gun laws gun debate this has now happened in your backyard what makes you think this time is going to be any different in Congress well first of all it has to be I can't the only the only other alternative is to is to just simply give up and concede that that those who put the profits of gun corporations over the lives of in this case teenagers win and we can't allow that to happen but I'll tell you I'll tell you why I'm topping it different this time this isn't this isn't the usual the usual bunch of politicians coming on though I'm glad to be with you talking about what needs to be done you and everyone else here in continent parkland has heard from the kids of Marjory Stoneman Douglas and the passion and that that they have for effecting change is real they are not prepared to simply let this they demand action I saw on Facebook the other day someone posted 17-7 tragically 17 lives were lost but beware of those who live they are going to change the world that's what's different this time and I believe it in my core on that I want to play you a little bit from a young man that I believe you met that you've met over the last 24 hours a young student at the school David hog here's what he had to say and then I want to talk to you about it let's play it the state that this country has been allowed to come to through the work through politicians honestly just saying yeah thoughts and prayers go out to people and we're gonna propose all of these ideas we don't need ideas we need action we need action from our elected officials and we need action from the Civic public because without that this is going to happen again so he is one of those fired up students that you're talking about these students that want to affect change congressman and I understand he actually came up to you and asked you to do something well I saw David again this morning and and just a few weeks ago David interviewed me at at Douglass High School for their student television station where we had a chance to talk about this issue among others he's incredible and and at the same time he is typical of the kind of student that that attends Douglass that and the kind of passion that we've seen the funerals are starting today and we grieve and our heart aches for the families who lost loved ones and but these kids who survived they want something to happen be able to demand that something happen and these cameras may may leave they're not going to give up they're gonna keep fighting to make sure that that we do act but in the current political climate to get anything done for Congress to do anything we see Republicans control both chambers of Congress Republicans control the White House there will have to be some sort of Republican buy-in on any kind of measure so have you had those conversations well cross the aisle have you reached out to to talk through what Congress might be able to do moving forward I look let's there are there are lots of issues to address I introduced bipartisan legislation just a couple weeks ago call the Safe Schools Act to try to prevent the kinds of atrocities that happen here to get the resources that schools need this is by its bipartisan there are Republicans who are co-sponsoring it we should pass that the moment we go back to DC there are there's bipartisan support that bump stocks the sole purpose of which is to turn a semi-automatic rifle into a fully automatic killing machine should not be legal why are we leaving that up to the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms why aren't we passing a law to outload outlaw those right now they're Republicans who support that it takes a little bit of courage just a tiny bit of courage from the leadership of the House and Senate to allow these to go forward it takes a little bit of courage to break the stranglehold that that that the gun companies have on Washington you talked a little bit at the top of our of our discussion here about the the sort of alluding to the NRA alluding to the gun lobby and the money that some candidates some politicians have taken from this lobby do you truly believe that there are those across the aisle who care more about profits than people there is a question about this kind of discourse and whether that's actually helpful or harmful to this broader discussion I write I don't I don't question I don't question my colleagues motives and I don't think it's helpful to suggest that any of my colleagues are are interested in seeing something like this happened in their communities they aren't of course they aren't and the outpouring of support from my colleagues shows that but they shouldn't have to endure what we're enduring here in parkland in order for them to want to actually show their care by taking action I I don't want this to be about whether someone accepts campaign donations or doesn't accept campaign donations I want this to be about how we save kids lives that's that's gun laws it's addressing mental health it's addressing school safety all of it put it all on the table and let's sit down and come up with some solutions congressman Ted Deutsch thank you for being with us our thoughts are with

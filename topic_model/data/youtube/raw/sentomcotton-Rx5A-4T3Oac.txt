join us now Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas and his new book published yesterday is called only the strong reversing the less plot to sabotage American power we'll see what he really thinks in a second Senator thank you for joining us it's good to have you I saw the latest RCP Senate poll it has 54 Republicans at this point 46 Democrats that's a big change in the last month uh yeah I mean I think the American people about to deliver a very resounding verdict against Joe Biden and the Democrats ideological agenda they're struggling to feed their families to fill up their gas tanks to afford their rent and their utility bills they're worried about their safety on their streets and their kids to parks with the drugs and the crimes the homelessness we have and they know the Democrats don't have any answers for this and the fact that Democrats are behind a lot of these problems I think you're going to see a very large victory for Republicans next week the the house similar numbers or oh sure sure you know when I got into New York a couple nights ago uh to launch my new book Only the Strong I turned on the Nightly News and uh it was wall-to-wall commercials for uh house districts in New York and Connecticut and New Jersey that Joe Biden won by 15 or 20 points you think New Hampshire you think it hasn't yeah I think uh don Bolick is going to beat Maggie Hassan look Maggie has been a rubber stamp for Joe Biden just like all these Democratic senators have been um she at any point like Joe manchin has on occasion like Kirsten Cinema has on occasion could have put her foot down the same way Rafael Warnock could have or Mark Kelly or Catherine Cortez masto but in the end they just always went along with the Democrats ideological agenda yeah we want to talk about uh the book in in the you know what your basic points are but can we just talk about the latest news and that was the the windfall profits initiative you need 60 Senators wouldn't you to do that it was it a serious proposal or no it's not a serious proposal it's just Joe Biden trying to salvage uh uh a little bit before the election because the American people so worried about gas prices but I write about this and Only the Strong and the plot to sabotage American power so much of the progressive left is ambivalent about America certainly about our history and therefore they're openly hostile the sources of our power to include American Energy which literally Powers our economy you know when your lights go off you say the power is out and Joe Biden promised openly in the 2020 campaign to eliminate fossil fuel production in America and this windfall profits tax may just be the latest gimmick but there's a reason why production is so strained in America while you're paying 3.50 cents four dollars a gallon for your gas five and six dollars a gallon on the west coast it's because the progressive left is wage and ideological campaign against fossil fuel production in America so these these gas prices and energy prices are not an accident this is what the left wants but it's not what the American how much of that is a function and and I by the way I don't disagree with you that clearly the Biden administration's policy has been to end fossil fuels as quickly as possible I don't think he was planning to end it tomorrow but if he could he probably would have um the question is how much of this is a function of uh what's happening in Ukraine what's happening in Europe what you think is flowing over here what you think in terms of I'm not arguing for a profits windfall tax but you look at some of the profits that these oil companies are making look at what the refiners are doing there's a there's a lot of component parts to this most of it as a result a bad policy choices by liberal Democrats sure what happens in global markets or what happens in Ukraine has some effect but Democrats have been waging this war on American energy for a long time remember Barack Obama said that he wanted to bankrupt coal companies and that if he could pass his energy plans your electricity bills would necessarily go up you talk about profits of oil companies well the simplest way to get oil companies profits down is get the price of oil down the way to do that is produce more oil or refineries the reason that we have a challenge with refineries is we haven't built new refineries in a long time you have refineries say again are you an advocate of cleantech at all and how do you actually get to that do there's no transition even needed no we're not going to transition away from oil and gas and coal and nuclear power which would be a bigger part of the mix I mean ever uh no we can never get entirely off those sources of energy not certainly not in our lifetime look wind and solar can provide some supplement to our grid but they're never going to replace oil and gas and coal and nuclear power which provide reliable stable affordable base load of power I mean a lot of times the sun doesn't shine or at night time or the wind doesn't blow or snow covers your solar panels I mean I thought a good a good kind of a parody almost of the Progressive left's Energy policy that I write about in Only the Strong was a couple months ago when California one week passed a law mandating that gasoline-powered Vehicles be eliminated and then the next week they said don't power don't charge your electric vehicles between the hours of four and nine o'clock I mean most of these Progressive strains on the grid yeah I mean these people can change a light bulb or a tire much less redesign and entire electrical grid I saw you know I I didn't look at the source and I didn't confirm but but I saw that you need 60 000 miles on an electric vehicle you need to get the 60 000 before your carbon is less than you would have had on on again yeah once you get to 60 and above that then then it's lower but debating whether do you believe in climate change I think he does what did I just not talk I want to say one thing about that Andrew do you want to start something all I said was if it takes 60 000 miles to get to where you're benefiting the carbon footprint just know that that you need 65 077 the first sixty Thousand Miles that gas powered vehicle is just as clean or cleaner the climate is always changing and the best evidence suggests that it's been warming up some of the last 200 to 250 years which is to say during the period in which human human productivity and quality of life has increased exponentially and the reason it has is the development of coal and turbines in the 18th century oil and gas in the 19th century the nuclear power in the 20th century but continued production of fossil fuels here in America where we produce it much more cleanly they do anywhere else in the world and the Innovation and the productivity growth we get from that is the best way to address any challenges from a climate changing climate that's what I write about in Only the Strong look I mean quality of life and living standards for our Founders and Jesus's disciples were not all that different and the reason they weren't all that different is because energy sources hadn't changed it's only in the last 200 years that you've had normal working citizens be able to enjoy the benefits of widely shared prosperity and it's literally because American energy powers our economic growth do you uh let's just switch gears completely the on um the election season starts Wednesday a week from today doesn't it feels to me like we're in the middle of an election season next the next one oh already the next one for I'm talking about for 2024. some people are saying uh a a they're predicting a trump Biden rematch do you think that's possible well let's wait until Wednesday to talk about the next election not wait till next year wait just wait till Wednesday at least I'll say this anybody anybody who wants to who's the leader of the who's the leader of the Republican party right now anybody who wants to run for the presidency should get a copy of Only the Strong to learn how to restore it so you know who is Donald Trump still the leader when you're in the opposition when you don't have the White House and especially when you don't have the Congress you kind of have a lot of voices uh blooming um when you get into a presidential election season and a party develops its nominee then that person becomes the leader and the spokesman of the party are you surprised that he I think there was an appeal from other Republicans to to not declare if you're going to do it again in 2024 I'm talking about uh former president Trump wait till after the midterms do you think he actually listened in in and waited for the good of the party that I'm not saying it's uncharacteristic but normally he would do something that he thought would well in my conversations with the former president I know that he's very committed to when back majorities in the house and the Senate he's been focused I know I know he's on well I'm sure he wants to win back the White House as well for the party but I know that he wants to win back the house and the Senate because he sees the damage so you'd support him if he was if he became the eventual nominee you'd support him again even after everything that happened I'll support the Republican nominee in 2024. Senator since you are on the select committee on intelligence just want to ask you about some breaking news the New York Times reported this morning suggesting that Russian officials not these are Russian military leaders not including Putin have been discussing the use of nuclear weapons I think these are tactical nuclear weapons Putin wasn't even involved in the conversations and you just wonder how much to worry about this is is this more than just Putin's Bluster at this point so I mean we always need to be mindful about our nuclear adversaries Russia and China in particular as we work throughout the Cold War um thus far we haven't seen any evidence of Russia use moving its tactical nuclear weapons smaller uh nuclear weapons that can fit on something as small as an artillery shell or a mortar round for what have you not InterContinental missiles but it's something we need to be mindful of at the same time as I explained Only the Strong we also can't be scared into submission about it just like we weren't during the Cold War the way to deter aggression whether it's the conventional aggression of tanks and artillery and aircraft that you see in Ukraine or nuclear aggression is to be strong and resilient you must talk about immigration in that I was watching last night I saw JD Vance on Brett Barrett at a town hall with JD Vance and Tim Ryan and all JD Vans talked about he just parroted exactly what you want to do with immigration what's what's your plan how do you want to fix illegal and how do you want to fix legal well first off we have a an emergency at our Southern border we've had five million illegal aliens crossed since Joe Biden came into office that's the source of almost all drugs in America today it really doesn't come from other countries anymore it almost all comes from Mexico last year we had over a hundred thousand drug deaths in this country almost twice as many people died in the entire Vietnam War so it really is an emergency so we have to secure our border we we have to crack down on fentanyl Tropicals traffickers in particular here in America I would suggest we need to to take the fight to the cartels themselves I write and only strong that that you should ask your organization what would you call what would you designated a terrorist organization just let me ask you this what would you do if Al Qaeda or Isis set up shop in Monterey or Juarez or Tijuana and was responsible for killing a hundred thousand Americans a year you know there there is a precedent for this you know it's well known that American special forces were present when El Chapo was captured a few years ago and they were present when Pablo Escobar was killed in the 1990s we overthrew an entire government in Panama under the first President Bush because of drug trafficking we need to be much more aggressive with what we do against their structures it's illegal you don't think it's illegal immigration as well so I've long enough to be a mayor Thomas that we need to remake our legal immigration system right now almost all the green cards we give out are almost by like accident or luck or chance either through chain migration for extended family members or for the Diversity Lottery or what have you only about 1 in 14 do we give out because of the skills one brings to this country so I've got legislation that would change our system to something more like what Canada and Australia have is it possible it ever passes um I think right now until we address the emergency and the crisis at the border it's hard to address any other facet of immigration Senator I wanted to ask you just about the polarization in the country we talk about social media when we walked on we were talking about Twitter and what's going on there but not just what's happening on social media but how it's manifesting itself in reality uh the attack on Paul Pelosi uh obviously was intended for Nancy Pelosi um the way uh certain sides of this have reacted I think you probably saw Kerry Lake effectively making fun of uh Paul Pelosi sort of putting this whole thing in light as opposed to taking it as seriously as I think you'd want I'm sure that the other side would say you know look look at uh went after Kavanaugh on The View they said well he didn't even have a gun you know they they discounted right so but what's going on and and what do you think of this well I mean I first off um I'm very sorry about what happened to Paul Pelosi and I wish him a full and rapid recovery um political violence is serious violence is serious um if you look at Paul Pelosi's assailant first off he shouldn't have been in the country he was an illegal alien at overstayed his Visa San Francisco is a sanctuary City second he's clearly a deranged lunatic from everything we know we shouldn't have been out on the streets um but everyone should be able to walk the street safely not just the speakers husband not just a Supreme Court Justice these men and women outside your window should be able to get on subway without worrying about being shoved in front of a subway train or Park their car in the streets of New York without having to worry about being carjacked what we need to do is crack down on crime and get tougher about it not just here in New York or San Francisco but all across the country I guess we can wrap in a Twitter conversation with a big Tech conversation with a China conference we put it all all together is that in in the book uh as well I talk a lot especially what do we need for Content what do we need for Content moderation should there be content moderation is it all covered by the well I think Elon said last week you know right after he closed on the deal that it's not going to become a total free-for-all he's not going to allow you know incendiary speech that's um going to lead that's inciting violence will you pay eight dollars for an account I haven't given it any thought yet and and do you think the government should uh well you pay eight dollars for an account we were talking about it actually I might then we were talking about could you expense it I don't know could you expensive back to the taxpayers as a marketing vehicle for or not a marketing vehicle but a sort of communication vehicle the same way I I assume your office would expense the telephone the 90s 96 a year Andrew this is the question no but then you do it for the whole staff no I know he's got a budget everyone's got a budget we're all trying to figure out what works what doesn't well I think I'll leave that up there's a separate issue which is if it's a Town Square you made this point earlier which is if you got to pay to be part of the Town Square it's not a Town Square well so the latest sort of institution at that point well I think the eight dollars just for your coveted blue check mark it's not a matter of being a part of the Town Square you get you get a louder amplification if you pay um so I mean I think it's a I wish Elon all the best in success at Twitter uh and being able to turn it into one would be a genuine you know Viewpoint neutral forum for people to have debates because it's clear right now that Twitter especially some of the information we've seen coming out about their collusion with uh left-wing officials at the Department of Homeland Security are designed to suppress information that the administration doesn't want out there that's not what a town square is that's not what genuine Free Speech should be so a lot of sell and make a lot of Teslas in China they do it'd be better how can Elon Musk be as tough on it I mean that that's a nice way of putting it how how can you be tough or how do we know he's not even nicer to China be better to make a lot more of those here in America or at least in North America or friendly Nations but that's true of almost every sector of our economy you think China's all over big Tech in terms of their their interests so big Tech has a complicated relationship with China because in many cases China has kicked them out some companies like apple are still deeply intertwined with China some companies are largely banned from China China's tentacles reach throughout our economy and really our society I speak at Great length but not only the strong about the China Lobby and it's not just big multinationals who have outsourced production there you know it's movie studios who want to get access to their markets which is why there aren't Chinese villains and movie movies anymore it's University presidents who depend on full Freight tuition paying Chinese NBA guys can't talk about I don't think we should have Tick Tock now you don't think Tick Tock should be should exist I mean obvious obviously it's under the thumb of the Chinese Communist it can be used in ways to harm Americans especially Young Americans who don't know any better I think parents in this country deserve protection for their kids from harms that that may be lasting their entire life um I was going to ask you about antitrust and sort of regulatory uh the regulatory scheme in this country do you think there's enough or the right type of competition just yesterday uh Simon Schuster that transaction and the book publishing business was blocked but I'm curious sort of how you see uh what this Administration is doing how you would do it so I haven't gotten things it does seem to be some bipartisan agreement by the way some people think that big Tech is too big I haven't gotten deeply into the Simon Schuster question a lot of that is a fact-based question about what's going to be good for consumers or things like the Kroger Albertsons uh merger right whether or not uh it's gonna you know they were trying to protect authors in that case but what does worry me is the prospect of trying to use antitrust for something other than promoting consumer welfare welfare and the health of the markets there's some in Congress especially in the Democratic party uh who are agitating that the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission should use anti-thrust laws again to kind of regulate viewpoints and content and that's not the point of our antitrust laws are you going to run for president in 2024 well we've got an election five days six days away uh so I'll focus on that election it helps to be tall in the past that has helped to be tall you say you're six five right well as I said earlier anybody who wants to run for President should pick up a copy of Only the Strong so I can understand uh Senator cotton thanks and good to have you it's been a while haven't been in studio we're back bigger and better than ever there's a book uh Only the Strong Senator Tom Cotton thanks thank you thanks for having me

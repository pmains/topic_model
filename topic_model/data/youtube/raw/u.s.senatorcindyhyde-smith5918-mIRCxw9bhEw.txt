the president appeared on 60 Minutes where he discussed several challenges currently facing our nation only according to him our nation is doing swell indeed the president seemed to paint a Rosy picture of little to no inflation and suggested we should be relieved by the new inflation numbers when asked what he could do better and faster to help Americans get some relief at the grocery store checkout line he claimed inflation was hardly at all up hardly at all say that to parents paying 40 percent more for a dozen eggs just to feed their children breakfast say that to workers who are watching their savings dwindle month after month because their paychecks can't keep up with these prices say that to the Americans who are just barely getting by in this economy President Biden you may not have to visit the grocery store or pay electricity bill but my constituents do time and time again the president and his allies in Congress have proved he is out of touch with American priorities and in denial about real suffering and fears for the American people they are right to question whether they can still afford the leadership they're getting out of the White House and democrat-led Congress

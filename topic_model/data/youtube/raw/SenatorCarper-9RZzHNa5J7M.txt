and uh we uh in the eight or nine years that i've been here i've never seen a struggle as much as we have on on the issue of of health care and part of the reason why it's just it's enormously uh complex and it's it's confusing and people are following the debate uh if you listen to folks on the political left mostly in our party uh what we hear is uh you know no public option no medicare buy-in uh we're not doing enough to make health care affordable and what we hear from the right mostly on the other side of the the aisle is this is government run this is government funded this is a government uh takeover and so you have the the two extremes out here kind of taking shots at one another and those of us in the middle are sort of collateral damage or road kill but at the the end of the day a lot of times when when you find the neither the left nor the right is entirely pleased with uh with the outcome sometimes that suggests that the the outcome isn't isn't all that uh all that bad um i'm not saying this is a perfect balance but uh it's not a bad balance and for those uh on especially in our party who feel like we should have done more uh i'm sure that in 1965 when lyndon johnson signed into law medicare uh legislation that that there was probably some who who maybe thought who didn't vote for it and i'm told it was mostly democrats that voted for not so much are republican friends but i i'm not sure how many democrats who voted for medicare at the time said you know this doesn't do enough uh for our senior scissors like it doesn't um provide for hospice care it doesn't provide for home health care it doesn't provide for disability benefits for those who are under the age of 65 there's no prescription drug program there's nothing for outpatient surgery none of those things when the original uh medicare legislation over the time they've been added and the medicare legislation the medicare law has i think been improved to make it a better a better uh program now we we face a day when the medicare program is literally running out of money and one of the less told secrets in the legislation is before us is the medicare trust fund which is whose life has been down to about seven or eight years i understand thanks to the reforms that are in this legislation actually pretty much double that's not good enough but uh we're gonna stretch uh by about 100 percent the the useful remaining life on the medicare program another fact is sort of lost in the uh and all the debate in the the tumult is what uh what this does with respect to our budget deficits and i'm told by not us not democrats or by republicans but by the neutral congressional budget office which is neither democrat nor republican non-partisan that the legislation if we adopt it in its current form will reduce deficits over the next 10 years by about 130 billion dollars and by as much as maybe one trillion 1.3 trillion dollars in the second 10 years beyond that in terms of what uh what's going to happen in the cost of premiums we're told by again by the nonpartisan congressional budget office that rather than spiking uh premiums we're actually going to see people get somewhat better coverage for frankly uh not more money in terms of of of of their premiums and in terms for those of us who just love the health insurance that we have we're just delighted with the coverage and the the amount that we we we pay for it i would just remind all of us a couple things one we spend more money by far than any nation on earth for health care about one and a half times more than the next closest country we don't get better results in many cases we get worse results we've got about 14 000 people that woke up with health care coverage this morning they'll wake up tomorrow morning they won't have it they'll have lost it over 40 million people in this country have no health care coverage at all and finally we've got big companies like gm and chrysler that have gone bankrupt and because they can't compete with foreign competitors because of the price of our health care and a lot of smaller companies as as well and the idea of doing uh doing nothing is that to my mind not a very smart thing to do we gotta do a number of things to really accomplish three goals number one reign in the growth of health care costs this idea of two and three times rate of inflation growth in health care costs is not sustainable and frankly if we don't rein in the growth of health care costs neither will be sustainable the coverage that we extend to people who don't have it today and the third thing that we try to work on in this legislation to the extent that we can but a lot of interesting things are going in the private sector very interesting things going on in the private sector regarding uh how to how to uh instill personal responsibility in employees and how to get the better transparency and and better cost through the healthcare delivery system that that are going to be a part of this as well but we got to figure out a way to provide better outcomes and there's a lot of good examples for for doing that for the folks in this country who are just totally confused by all this the people that are scared that we're doing something really foolish and it's going to be a disaster for for for our country uh let me just say that when the the ads all that all the negative ads sort of are stopped being funded uh when folks have actually had a chance to drill down and understand some of the things that i've talked about here today and a lot of the aspects of the bill that really will improve outcomes that really will reign in the growth of costs that really will enable us to extend coverage i think they're going to be pleasantly surprised and in closing uh i i'm a guy who came here always believing we ought to work democrats and republicans should work together i know our chairman tried mightily in the finance committee to to do that and i commend him and others for for for the for the reference when we come back we can't have another you know 12 months of this or 12 years of this i mean this our country is in trouble if this is the way we're going to be doing business in in the future our country's in trouble and my hope is we'll get this done we'll get it behind us and the president will improve the bill and conference and the president will will provide for uh for us a signature and then we'll go back to work implementing this and just like medicare just like medicare the key isn't just to stop the key is to make it better and to build on this as a foundation and uh we uh in the eight or nine years that i've been here i've never seen a struggle as much as we have on on the issue of of health care and part of the reason why it's just it's enormously complex and it's just confusing and people are following the debate if you listen to folks on the political left mostly in our party what we hear is uh you know no public

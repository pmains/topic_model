it's in the Congress joining us tonight South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and South Carolina congressman trey Gowdy we begin with mr. Gowdy who has been named chairman of the Select Committee on Benghazi and we are now hearing media reports that he has gotten death threats since that announcement has been made thank you for being here with us tonight sir let me first get you to respond to that I know that's a sensitive matter I assume you're being protected but the unfortunate nature of where this investigation has already gone well Megan first of all thank you for saying that I was a prosecutor for 16 years this is not my first death threat I'm always happy when it doesn't come from my wife and this one did not so I'm going to be fine and it's not going to keep me from doing my job good man let's talk about Hillary Clinton she comes out tonight and suggests that people like you I assume are choosing not to be satisfied that that's your choice and the rest of us will have to live with it your thoughts on that well you can add to that the family members of the four murdered Americans because they still have unanswered questions and and and I would just ask Secretary Clinton with all due respect can you explain what we were still in Benghazi after everyone else had pulled out and after the British ambassador was almost assassinated and our compound was attacked twice there are three separate categories of questions each with sub units within then that have not been answered I realize it's been 20 months but what time is no barometer of thoroughness but my daughter took Latin for three years she still can't speak it so the time does not mean something is thorough when we get through with this Select Committee those questions will be will be answered for the family and miss Clinton will have another chance to come and talk to us I know that you have said you intend to subpoena her that you want her to appear before your committee however and I say this respectfully the last time she before appeared before Congress what we had was a series of speeches from the lawmakers without that many probing questions and I hear that from my viewers often when we look back on those hearings what would be different this time well what will be different is I'm not necessarily committing to a hearing I'm committing to getting the answers and it may be in the form of a deposition which as you know megan is a very good attorney which you were that is that is the route that is most conducive with eliciting the truth is not five minutes of pounding your chest in a committee room it's a deposition can she get out of that well if she can get out of a subpoena she can get out of it but but I'm I don't send invitations to cocktail parties we're going to send subpoenas and we're going to expect her to comply and if you don't comply she'll suffer the same panoply consequences that any of your viewers who don't comply with the subpoena will suffer Nancy Pelosi has come out and called for a real and equal voice for Democrats on the select committee although she still had ginger bets on whether they're going to participate at all they may choose to just make it look like a Republican witch hunt and not participate the inside betters in Washington are saying they're going to participate right now it would be seven Republicans five Democrats she says they want equal subpoena power they want an equal voice they wanted to be 5050 will you grant that no ma'am as the president famously likes to say elections have consequences and consequences of the last US House races that we are in the majority and I hasten add when she was in the majority and she had a chance to to constitute a select committee she certainly did not constitute it equally nor any of the Senate committees equally constituted so I'm sure if I were in the minority I'd be asking voice she's asking for two she's not going to get it I hope that she will put five members of her committee of her conference lady there are some very bright minds on the other side of the aisle and our goal is to get at the truth and they could help us do that and I hope that they'll come trey Gowdy thank you for being here sir yes ma'am thank you another lingering question will we ever get to see the email involving top White House staffers discussing their quote media strategy concerning a fox news report in the days after Benghazi apparently the Obama administration believes this is quote sensitive material and releasing it would have a chilling effect on their quote Frank deliberations South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham is a Republican and member of the Senate Armed Services and judiciary committee sir thank you very much for being here tonight and so this is a Fox News memo seven page email chain in reference to a fox news level Ben reference to a fox news report on said tember 27th 2012 that reported that the Intel community knew within 24 hours that Benghazi was a terror attack this appears to have caused major waves at the White House and they won't share with the public their discussions why should they well I think it's relevant to the investigation but they'll have a chance to go to court and say this document should not be disclosed and we'll leave it up to a judge Richard Nixon tried that he used executive privilege but I don't think you'd have a chilling effect I think it would turn up the heat on their obvious effort in my view to try to spend the story away from a coordinated terrorist attack of an unsecured facility six weeks before an election into a protest caused by video they had nothing to do with but here's what I would like to see I would like Leon Panetta and Hillary Clinton to testify at the same time I'd like to know why the Secretary of Defense knew about security requests being made to add security to Benghazi in the Secretary of State not this facility had been attacked twice in April and June we were the last Western symbol in Benghazi people it was a death trap so there's so much yet to be learned and in terms of secretary Clinton's role in all of this why was Susan Rice chosen to talk about Benghazi when she had absolutely no responsibility how r Benghazi said before I don't like to do the sunday shows that she wanted to win a lot well then don't become present in the United States then don't ask to be present in the United States if you don't like going on national television talk about four Dead Americans who were killed by terrorists don't even went for office that Senator Reid has already said despite your request that there will be no Select Committee in the Senate there will be no cooperation that that's a house only thing well we've had one committee in the Senate issue a report about Benghazi the Intel committee they did a pretty good job but they said they didn't have jurisdiction over the state department officials and they thought the attack had been prevented I'm trying to get Harry Reid to let us look at all three agencies department defense department state Intel at the same time here's my advice to my Democratic friends if you're seen as trying to cover up getting to the truth of Benghazi and you think that everything that has been known and this is just a witch hunt you do so at your peril if we're over playing our hand we do so at our peril so to Senator Reid can you please tell me why Susan Rice said on 16 sep tember the consulate was strongly significantly and substantially secured when she was asked about the level of security when nothing had been further from the truth can you tell me why this email was withheld for 19 months showing a coordinated effort to mold her testimony to get it away from a terrorist attack I'll give Senator Reid a list of 10 questions and maybe he can answer these questions because I can't senator Graham thank you for being

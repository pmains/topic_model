17 times we have asked Democratic leadership to bring down a completely American freedom based bill a baby that survives an abortion should be eligible to have life-saving emergency service and continue to live just 48 hours ago my niece just brought into this world a brand-new baby five pounds ten ounces she's tiny but she's fearfully and wonderfully made her little toes and her little fingers and she bursts forth with life to pursue the American dream and I would ask my fellow Americans to call every single representative that represents them that believes infanticide is okay call every representative and encourage them if they believe in our born alive bill and ask them to get on this bill this is not a partisan issue it's not a partisan bill we're fighting for our fellow Americans we're fighting for babies that are surviving abortions I can't even believe we're having a conversation in this country but we'll be here again in order to continue asking Democratic leadership but I would ask the Democratic leadership again today what in the world are you afraid of let us vote this bill

we find ourselves in a situation not just America but the world and in those serious economic spiral downward spiral that we've seen in my lifetime I've been around for a few years the stimulus package is designed to do maybe two or three things number one is to create jobs to put people to work not just make work jobs but but the kind of jobs that will meet a broad public purpose in large part to make us more competitive as a nation i call them long-term investments whether it's investing in our color our infrastructure our transportation systems roads highways bridges on our rail systems and water and wastewater treatment in ports and waterways modernizing our housing kind of weather proofing if you will our housing so we lower our energy bills or heat building that sort of thing so that's that's one of the things we want to do a second thing is to what we were trying to reduce the other threat that we have with foreclosures we had several million people whose homes have been foreclosed on we have several million more who are in jeopardy especially people lose their jobs of losing their homes walking away from the homes and ending up in foreclosure there's actually a number of good proposals included in the stimulus package that are designed to encourage people enable people to stay in their homes and also to encourage people begin buying homes again what we have here is the potential for a one-two punch the first the first of the one-two punch is a stimulus package not perfect but more good I think a good deal more good than bad the second part is the proposals from the new Treasury secretary is what we should do with the second half of the seven hundred billion dollars the idea create jobs and hopefully your jobs that serve a good public purpose not just make work job good job to serve a good public purpose number two we want to make the us more competitive these are long-term investments make us more competitive against other nations around the world and the third piece is to to help make sure that people who are in danger of having their homes foreclosed on that they don't to stabilize the housing market in to encourage folks we're thinking about buying a house to get in there take advantage of these low interest rates take advantage of a fifteen thousand dollar tax credit for home buyer and get in there and buy it buy a home that sets that what we're trying to do and it's a I think an agenda worth doing

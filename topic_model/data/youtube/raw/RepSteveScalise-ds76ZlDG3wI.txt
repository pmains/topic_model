all right joining me now florida congressman byron donalds and house minority whip steve scalise congressman scalise um this shiny objects game of the democrats focusing on january 6th and ferman are focusing on aoc spat with marjory taylor green this is as people can't find gasoline in major american uh cities and suburbs all across the eastern seaboard how is this making any sense yeah laura what you're seeing right here with the biden administration is is a group of people that are weighing over their heads i mean a look at all around the world it's on fire you've got israel under attack tonight you've got lines at the gas pump it's like the 70s jimmy carter probably wouldn't want to be compared to this administration inflation's through the roof look at lumber prices probably 400 percent up many schools are still closed where kids can't even get an education and joe biden siding with the teachers unions instead of children in america millions of whom may never recover from what he's doing to them on every front we're seeing disaster and crisis at the border after crisis and this president you know it's like he shows up for about two hours he can't answer any questions and then he goes away and they just hope that they can throw shiny objects to distract the american people but people are getting fed up they're seeing this they're very concerned about this direction the socialist move by pelosi and biden congressman donald pelosi did make a pitch for this so-called infrastructure bill of biden's watch the country needs a strong infrastructure package it's an issue of clean air it's an issue of quality of life for people to have them out of their cars with more mass transit and the rest congressman she has the gall to say that she wants people quote out of their cars as so many americans are now suffering because of this gas shortage and their plans for perhaps future gas shortages i'm not listening to nancy pelosi she was busy getting her hair done while salons were shut down in the state of california but let's be very clear americans want a couple things they just want to get back to work they want their schools reopened they want the economy restored they don't want this green policy agenda they don't want these liberal crazy policies which have frankly opened up our southern border have created the gas lines like the leader has talked about like the whip has talked about excuse me don't want to give your promotion quite yet because but you're going to get it soon but let's be very clear their policies are a disaster and they have to own it that's why they want to distract us with all this other stuff that doesn't matter to the american people congressman scalise joe biden wants the best of both worlds right he wants to take credit for operation warp speed and for the economy that was recovering under the last quarter when trump urged everybody to reopen so he wants to take credit for that but he doesn't want to take any responsibility for what's happening with this inflation so he was in full spin mode today watch we've gone from stagnation to an economy that's growing faster than it has in nearly 40 years we've gone from an anemic job creation to a record for job creation all of this is a product of prompt action to roll out the vaccine and boost our economy congressman uh we are on the verge of an inflationary spiral if they keep using stimulus when no stimulus is needed clearly yeah we're seeing a deficit of reality in the biden administration i mean if you look on the vaccine front when joe biden took the oath of office there were three vaccines two already approved one about to be approved that's now allowed over 200 vaccinations to be put in the arms of americans joe biden's talking about giving away not just the vaccine but the entire technology the mrna technology to china for free you talk about intellectual property theft from china joe biden's going to give it to china he inherited the hottest economy we've ever seen he's talking about raising taxes right now that would kill middle-class jobs and oh by the way laura today there's over 8 million job openings and joe biden is paying people borrowing from our kids to pay people not to work that's probably the biggest reason why you have to wait in line to get anything from a refrigerator to a new car now before we go cnn's manu raju tweeted something earlier today saying speaker pelosi told him no she isn't changing the rule requiring masks on the house floor no pelosi said are they all vaccinated quick response from both of you should mass go on the floor of the house and uh she apparently wants your medical records should have been gone monsters most of the members either been vaccinated or they have antibodies there's a dumb rule to have all right congressman scalise what about you look she let joe biden take his mask off at the state of the union address and she wants everybody else to keep the mask on just return to sandy look at states like florida who are actually doing things right they actually have a very much lower death rate from covert than states not like new york who shut everything down and are keeping kids locked out of school and they're losing a generation right now as well as every small business i don't mean to interrupt but you're missing the point i'm sorry what she wants to do is shame any member of congress who made a personal decision not to get the vaccine for whatever reason that's what that's about it's not she just doesn't think she's going to get coveted or any of you are going to get coveted it's a shaming device so she's trying to shame anyone and perhaps she wants to control the house she wants to keep the public out of the people's house by the way too the american people are done with all of these shut-ins they want to see their government in action they want to see their government working for them which has not happened in the last six months all right congressman thank you so much great to see both of you

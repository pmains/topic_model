all right now not bad Wisconsin Congressman Scott Fitzgerald reaffirmed the gop's commitment to America pledging support to police and Public Safety the congressman wrote quote Republicans are ready to make America safe again by giving police departments of resources they need to recruit additional officers by cracking down on Rogue prosecutors who favor criminals over victims joining us now Congressman Scott Fitzgerald Congressman great to have you with us uh your your reaction to to what we were just just sharing we've been trying to get the word out uh specifically as a member of the Judiciary Committee that early on we had members continually driving home the point that the Democrats absolutely were making a pitch to defund police departments Nationwide and what we saw kind of over the last year and a half specifically in that committee was an erosion of that that messaging because they started to feel the heat I mean the Democrats knew that they were on the wrong page that they were following the members that are referred to as the squad kind of off the cliff and and as we sit here uh less than a week away from the elections uh it's a completed mission that that was a huge mistake and that politically it's been just dire for them and uh you know so now we have this last minute pitch oh I'm all for funding law enforcement well it's it's politics that at its worst is is what it is yeah and you're op-ed you mentioned the case of Daryl Brooks who was just convicted for the Waukesha Christmas parade Massacre um how how do you plan to pretend somebody like Brooks uh keeps somebody like that from committing crimes like this again what do you think can be done or what do you think people are looking for in a case like that well it it's uh it's the worst example that we've probably seen in Wisconsin of a repeat offender that is continually shuffled through the system and then a district attorney that still has not been accountable held accountable for uh simply a thousand dollars in in bail that resulted in this very very dangerous individual being out there on the streets and uh and committing this heinous crime which uh you know the city of Waukesha and the surrounding area is still dealing with now but it you either have to put an incentive at the local level or or some type of deterrent that's going to hold these DA's accountable and make sure that that they're not releasing these very dangerous people it's been happening in Wisconsin for some time Congressman now the Democrats are sort of changing their tune right before uh the midterm elections regarding defunding the police do you anticipate that after the midterms they're just going to go back to the policies that we've been used to them doing the soft on crime policies well I do because it's systemic right it's part of their overall messaging about releasing criminals back into society listen we nobody knows that recidivism uh exists better than anybody in Wisconsin we've had this issue for many years listen if you release somebody back out on the street that reads at a third grade level uh and has not been rehabilitated as no skills no ability they're going to reoffend and we've seen it again and again and again but that's the system that the Democrats have been protecting here in my state and Nationwide

Thank You mr. chairman I appreciate that mr. speaker I'd like to thank the Oversight and Government Reform Committee especially my friend chairman Chaffetz and my my friend mr. Walberg here from Michigan as well as ranking member Cummings for bringing this bipartisan bicameral bill to the floor to save taxpayer dollars and create jobs up in here like most of us do from our constituents why can't Congress work together and get something done and eliminate wasteful spending and create jobs well we've got it folks here we go with the federal vehicle repair cost savings act I teamed up with Senator Gary Peters also of Michigan and we're going to save literally millions of taxpayer dollars by reducing spending on federal vehicle maintenance and create good manufacturing jobs our common-sense bill calls on federal agencies to use reentry manufactured components to repair and maintain the federal vehicle fleet when using those parts with lower costs achieve higher safety standards and maintain quality and performance remand your parts remanufactured parts are less expensive than brand new parts and have been returned in the same as new condition I know this from firsthand experience owning a small sand and gravel operation where we oftentimes use remanufactured parts on our own trucks the component may be an engine and maybe a transmission it may be a drivetrain may be a rear end or an alternator each of those repairs presents an opportunity to be more fiscally responsible with taxpayer dollars in 2013 GAO report founded that the found that the federal government owns a fleet of approximately five hundred and eighty eight thousand vehicles the cost of maintaining that fleet is ballooned to nearly a billion dollars and while it's clear there needs to be a fleet of vehicles have access to reliable motor pool it's important that these vehicles be maintained efficiently and effectively to ensure that those tax dollars are precious tax dollars are using the most effective way possible in addition to eliminating wasteful spending this legislation serves as an important boost to good-paying jobs and remanufacturing suppliers according to the motor equipment and manufacturers association remanufacturing of motor vehicle parts is responsible for over 30,000 full-time jobs across the United States for example in my district Valley truck parts headquartered in why employees 250 Michigan Ian's in kentwood North American Michigan North American fuel systems remanufacturing employs more than 150 people these companies among so many others across Michigan and so many other states demonstrate how remanufacturing supports good-paying middle-class jobs and in those states like Michigan in Ohio and North Carolina and Pennsylvania and so many others and it's going to play an expanded role I believe in making this federal government even more efficient I encourage my colleagues to join us in this effort to save millions of taxpayer dollars support good jobs and make

Casta fathers yes i rise to support the Denham amendment and to reject the King Amendment clearly I could see where we get regional differences but as I said you know those of us who believe in federalism understand that well States may take certain actions that we may agree or disagree with if we do really believe in federalism then we must respect and recognize States to do what they think is the best public policy in their areas within the confines and the constraints of our Constitution obviously so I think the Denham amendment attempts to address some of the issues that have been raised here and this is not a new issue we debated this issue in the in 2014 reauthorization of the farm bill and I suspect as long as representative King and I and congressman Denham are here will continue to debate this issue for better or worse but the fact is is that we do want to promote commerce interstate commerce I don't think we've seen a limitation of those areas whether we're talking about in the poultry industry or whether we're talking about other related agriculture industries limited for their ability to participate in the California markets as a result of the laws that the state legislature enacted I might also add this was not implemented by the state legislature of the governor many of our states have initiative and referendum systems and this was an initiative hooded by the voters of California so the the fact is is that you have measures that qualify on the ballot whether in your state or our state and the voters vote on it and they decide that that's the policy they want to pursue this is obviously in direct contradiction to allowing the voters in those states to determine their their what they think is the best public policy I did not support the initiative if it declare about it but nonetheless it passed and the California poultry industry is is is dealing with it and so I support the Denham amendment and and again as I did four years ago opposed the King amendment and I hope that we'll get a chance to vote on this yes all types not just California but every other state you'll be careful who's in the majority here because different things can happen depending on who who's who's trying to propose these in different states when you find things that you don't like to manipulate the Constitution for your benefit can create big problems with lawsuits across the country now this was litigated in federal court prop 2 was litigated in federal court and it was upheld it was upheld it was found that the law isn't unconstitutional because applies evenly to in-state and out-of-state producers but over a hundred because this is so broad and so new and was never heard over a hundred and eighty diverse stakeholders have come out and firm opposition to the King Amendment including Freedom Works the National Conference of State Legislators Humane Society Fraternal Order of Police National Farmers Union and Environmental Working Group - just a name a few reclaiming my time before it expires a question to to my colleague I was under the assumption this was the same language was four years ago so you're telling me that it goes even more extreme and covers impacts for States is that correct yes so it would be even the impact would be further in far reach beyond California far reaching beyond California and beyond egg and poultry industries compact every industry well for all of those good reasons again I support the Denham amendment and oppose the King amendment and I hope our colleagues could get a chance to vote on a voice vote I mean on a roll call vote

Thank You mr. Speaker I rise today on behalf of the constituents of New York's 25th district to voice my strong opposition to a senseless an entirely avoidable government shutdown that would hurt my community and millions of people across the country what's particularly alarming is that this looming shutdown has been triggered over a potential border wall that is not only ill-conceived but would squander our limited resources and failed to address the most pressing challenges facing our nation in my district what we want instead is to take a unified approach to ensuring quality affordable health care protecting Social Security and Medicare creating more good-paying job opportunities and addressing the gun violence epidemic that is devastating our communities over the coming days I implore all parties to come together in a spirit of bipartisanship and cooperation to focus on what's more important to the American people and avoid a needless government shutdown that would impair those priorities Thank You mr. speaker what purposes gentle

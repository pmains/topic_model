curity committee visited the border last week down on El Paso and sir thank you for coming back here senator and good morning morning to you here is some of the recommendations on screen now establish three or five processing centers of the border shelter the families Flores fixed that goes back about twenty years that roll back regulations for the rules on how long you can detain an unaccompanied migrant child rocketdock it allows asylum seekers access to hearing or decision within 20 or 30 days asylum claims must be made at the port of entry put that all in English based on your understanding would that be effective it would well we need is we need a consequence for people come entering this country illegally or we're gonna continue to see an increase the number of people attempting to do it I was down the border Monday night and yesterday and what we are seeing and what we're witnessing that's what people need to understand is the human traffickers are using our law enforcement our board law enforcement officers is is just part of their process of funneling people into the into the United States for long term residency and so we need to do only about 15% of those people claiming asylum x-ray ivalice island claims so we need to rapidly determine who has a valid asylum claim we probably use a higher standard so we more accurately assess who has a valid asylum claim and then those that don't have a Valis Island claim we need to remove them so there's a consequence if we start doing that just like Michael Chertoff did with the Brazilians in 2005 you will see a dramatic reduction in the people trying to get in this country illegally but people need to understand the human traffickers are making hundreds of millions of dollars they're using our Customs and Border Patrol agents this part of their processing and as a result they are being pulled off the line from their border security of law enforcement operations in El Paso Secretary has 28 on the border they limit generally have to because the other 26 are dealing with the unaccompanied children and family units senator the smugglers are beating us at our own system and they have been for some time no they they are they are utilizing us and we they are putting hundreds of millions dollars in their pockets you know the people just turn themselves in they're completely relaxed they have no fear because they realize there are only a couple days away from being processed and being sent to all corners of America since daca and this is what really sparked it doesn't apply these people but it sparked it since daca was instituted back in 2012 we're approaching about 900,000 unaccompanied children but primarily people in family units having been led into this country and they're staying long-term nobody really knows where they went we have no real accounting of where these people are and the numbers are growing we hear the urgency from you senator we hear the urgency from the president he tweeted this today on border security Democrats and Congress must return from their vacations and change the immigration laws or the on the border despite the great job being done by border patrol will only get worse big sections of wall now being built so what sense are you getting as to the direction this battle is going to go and the willingness of your colleagues on the other side of the aisle to come around on this issue well we held two great hearings in our in our committee at the last couple weeks and really laid out the reality so I had Democrats Andrews coming up to me afterwards saying you're right let's let's get sit down what we need to fix this problem I know Senator Durbin was down in El Paso taking this talking to the exact same people I was asking the right questions and getting the right answer and the right answer is again we need a very rapid accurate initial determination is a Saval a silent claimant or not if not those individuals need to be removed and we need to keep them in custody because if we don't keep those people in custody we are only able to remove about 7% of those that we don't keep the custody so it has to be right there at the border we have to muster our resources we have to give our law enforcement people the resources they need to achieve the achievable goal here which is reduce the flow of people to complete taking advantage of our system and line the pockets of these human traffickers senator another topic here you just signed a letter with senators Lindsey Graham and Chuck Grassley you're trying to get answers on Hillary Clinton's email server we are three and four years down the line from this what do you think you're gonna find well again I think the American people need an accounting of what was happening within the FBI our intelligence community the department justice Valley as it relates to the Hillary Clinton email scandal where they basically let her off the hook then that same group of FBI officials pretty well transferred into the whole Russian probe and we needed an accounting of exactly what happened there and so what we're trying to determine on the Clinton email scandal is why didn't they fully review all the thumb drives or you know the computers what exactly happened there and exactly what kind of bias did they then really apply to the the whole Trump of campaign Russian influence investigation as well so the American people deserve the answers on this I'll be interested to see whether the the Moller probe address us at all but I think a William Barra has stated very publicly that he intends to get to the bottom of this and if there's a predicate for an investigation the Justice Department will undertake one and I completely agree the fact what we need is a grand jury probably in panel to force people to actually tell the truth senator thank you for your time

mr. president someday a hundred years from now a family will camp on a Mesa in Utah or a hillside in North Carolina or a canyon in New Mexico or they'll hike the rocky coasts of man they'll play on a ball field in Kansas and it will be because of the work that we're going to do this week in this Congress they won't know king or dames or Alexandra Portman or Warner mansion or Gardner or all the others that are going to support our efforts our names will be long forgotten but what we do will be benefiting this country for generations there are very few things we can do in our work here that are permanent bills can be repealed programs can be amended times change and all can change with it but what we are talking about this week in the great American outdoors Act is making a gift to our fellow Americans setting aside special places setting aside opportunities for outdoors and recreation is a sacred trust and it's one that goes back to the beginning of this country as I say there's very little that we can do that's permanent but this is one of those things it's the right thing to do but it also makes sense from the economy's point of view in all of our states Acadia National Park in Maine generates more than 300 million dollars a year in economic activity in the surrounding communities our new Katahdin woods and waters National Monument is already generating economic activity in the area where it is located a visit to Maine to see the Seacoast and the forest at those two sites would be rewarding for any family and what we're doing today will enable families to continue to make these kinds of journeys the next generation and the next and the next that family will see a sunrise on the coast of Maine a sunset on a Mesa in Arizona they won't know who it was but they will know what we did in Maine there's a wonderful mountain Mount Katahdin the highest point in the state and it was proposed to be set aside for the people of Maine by the governor named Percival Baxter in the 20s one of my predecessors the legislature of Maine said no we don't have to do that we shouldn't really do that who's going to pay for the roads we're gonna take property out of the tax base what about the trees there were all kinds of reasons for not doing it so it didn't happen it didn't happen while Percival Baxter was governor but he dedicated the rest of his life to making it happen individually privately he purchased fall parcels of land to assemble what is now Baxter State Park one of the gems in this country that contains at its center Mount Katahdin he did this it's one of the greatest acts of private philanthropy in the history of the United States it was the legacy of a lifetime few of us will have an opportunity to do what Baxter did but we have that opportunity now where does the money come from it comes from the people in the sense of revenues from the use of federal lands for mineral extraction this is an idea that was brought forth in 1965 when the Land and Water Conservation Fund was created and the idea was we're using the public's resources and assets and therefore the money that flows from that should go back to the people and should go back in to conservation it's a beautifully symmetrical idea the problem is that the fund that was created in nineteen sixty-five has been systematically looted by the Congress's in successive years there have only been two years since then that has been fully funded with the funds that are available today this week we're going to correct that historic error and make a commitment not only to the people of the United States today but to people that we don't even know the children and grandchildren great-grandchildren of today's citizens the other thing that this bill will do is begin to fund the backlog of maintenance at our national parks bureau of public lands and other public lands across the country this sounds pretty boring pretty mundane and some of my friends are going to say well you can't do this we're gonna raise a budget point of order because this is money that again it coming from excess funds in the in the generation of minerals oil and gas but they're going to say no no that we can't do that mr. president what we're doing here is paying a debt deferred maintenance is a debt when I was governor I used to go to New York to kiss the ring of the rating agencies and hope and beg that they would give us a high bond rating so that our interest cost for our state debt would be low and at one point I was making a presentation about how prudent Maine was we didn't have much debt we paid it off in ten years and and we really need this high bond rating and one of the analysts stopped me and he said governor don't forget if you're not fixing your infrastructure if you're not maintaining your infrastructure that's debt just as sure as if you borrow money from the bank and it's debt that's going to have to be paid and it's going to have to be paid in the future which means it's going to cost more I had never thought of it that way before but that's what we're doing here and that's why what we're doing here is eminently fiscally responsible because we're paying off and we're preserving these wonderful incredible places for people to visit and enjoy and believe me after this spring people really want to get outdoors in Maine for example Acadia National Park has more than three and a half million visitors a year that's that's a big number it's a really big number when you realize it's more than twice the population of our whole state comes to visit this one small beautiful incredible spot on the coast of Maine on Mount Desert Island so what we're talking about today is making is paying a debt and making a contribution to the well-being of the American people for generations to come when Baxter completed the acquisition of Katahdin and the area that is now Baxter State Park he had an amazing quote that I think applies to what we're talking about today he said man is born to die his works are short-lived buildings crumble monuments decay and wealth vanishes but Katahdin in all its glory will forever be the mountain of the people of man areas across our country in all their glory will forever be part of the legacy for the people of America Thank You mr. president I yield the floor

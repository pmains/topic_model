it's morning a very intriguing possible meeting between the Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz and Democrats on the House Oversight and Judiciary Committee's Horowitz has been investigating he's been investigating what went on during the 2016 election both in the Hillary Clinton email investigation in the early stages of the Russian investigation cNN has learned that FBI director Christopher Rea hinted to staff in a memo that the investigation played a role in deputy director Andrew McCabe's sudden departure joining me now is congressman Ted Deutsch he's a Democrat from Florida who is on the House Judiciary Committee greeings congressman thanks so much for being with us we there's a little bit of confusion about whether in fact Democrats will or will not meet with the Inspector General today is this meeting going to happen well there is going to be a meeting with the inspector general because the Inspector General wanted to have it when he learned that the first meeting was Republican only meeting but John that just shouldn't be surprising because it's consistent with the way this entire effort has gone on the part of Republicans in the house to distract and attack our institutions and sow discord that's what we've seen and yesterday John there's this this new approach where this they've decided that they're going to selectively release intelligence that's the kind of thing that the Russians do and here it came on the same day that we decided not the president decided not to impose sanctions on Russia and in the midst of an investigation into Russia's attack on our elections it's very very troubling all right you said a whole lot right there all at once let's right let's try to piece it together just a little bit first on the meeting with the Inspector General Christopher ray the FBI director and I don't believe you're accounting the FBI director in that part is in bucket that you just included right there the FBI director hinted to his staff that the inspector general's report may be a reason why he may have applied pressure to have Andy McCabe leave do you have any information about what's in that report do you have any information that McCabe may have acted in a way that was improper during the investigations in 2016 no I don't I don't have any information and and certainly we're looking forward to having the meeting with the Inspector General it's an important meeting to have we've spent however the entire day-to-day if you think about the distraction here we've spent this entire day talking about the decision of the Republicans on the Intel committee to selectively release this classified information when we were talking about the fact that the president the United States ordered the Special Counsel to be fired back in June I think that my Republican colleagues ought to be worried about that we should all be worried about that and the potential constitutional crisis that it could lead to we did talk about the fact that the president our reporting isn't saying he wanted the special counsel fired it did not happen the special counsel was not fired so the crisis you're talking about did not happen and he says now he has no intention of firing this special prosecutor I understand your argument though on the memo have you read the Republican memo I haven't even read the memo the Republicans authorized members last night to be able to review it but we've all been talking about the memo we know that this is the selectively the decision to selectively disclose classified information a democratic analysis and that is okay so if they say the democratic analysis if a deal will reach where they said hey let's release the democratic analysis at the same time would you be okay with that I I think that what we ought to do and and this is what's so troubling about this John is we ought to pay heed to law enforcement and the FBI and when the Department of Justice expresses grave concern and the FBI asks for the ability to review this memo because their fear of of possibly releasing sources and methods I'm not under snow explanation about the rush to disclose this other than an attempt to distract and and for purely partisan political gain the Republicans on that committee should be worried first and foremost about protecting the investigation into Russia's attack on America and instead their focus is to protect the president with the supporting Russian BOTS to go ahead and publicize it a couple things number one Christopher Rea the FBI director ultimately did look at the memo he has looked at the memo the Democratic chair of the intelligence media Adam Schiff says that Christopher a them wanted to talk to the whole committee that was not permitted according to Adam Schiff and I just also want to make clear the scenario that I offered the Democratic Democratic memo booths at the same time apparently isn't happening the Republicans don't want that to come out but just to make the Republican case here they say you know sure they care about the Russia investigation but in their view this memo raises questions about whether that investigation was fair at the beginning well let's take a take a moment when you when you suggest that perhaps this investigation isn't fair is it are they alleging that it's unfair that the highest levels of the Trump campaign and Trump's former national security adviser have all been either indicted or of taking guilty pleas or is that unfair are they suggesting it's unfair to have uncovered this meeting at Trump Tower between the president's son Jared Kushner and and agents of the Russian military please that the real issue here is not to call into question the fairness it's to look at the facts and to protect the special counsel so that he can continue and follow this through to wherever it takes him Congress we have some breaking news here we have speaker Ryan weighing in now on all of this and I'm gonna read you from our reporting that's Justin from Danny Bash jhf Tapper Jim Acosta and Phil Mattingly speaker Ryan was meeting with reporters he is in favor of the public the release of the Nunez memo I don't think that's new is because without Ryan support from the beginning this would never be public but he's telling House Republicans there needs to be a separation between the allegations in the memo and then the Special Counsel investigation in itself he goes I think because all of the loose political rhetoric floating around here we need to make sure that we explained that there's a separation between these things and then asked if he was delivering that message to his conference some of whom have pointed to the memo as a reason to disband the probe altogether Ryan answered yes he's saying release it but separate it from trying to discredit the special counsels investigation is that possible I don't know Charlie I don't know what the speaker said that over the past week or so I don't know if the speaker commented on the president's efforts to fire Mahler but instead of trying to please the conspiracy theorists who have suggested among other things that there is a coup d'etat being waged from within the Justice Department into what the Speaker of the House should do is to stand up and say it is imperative that we protect this investigation that we allow the Special Counsel to continue to do his work until the end until we have all of that all of the facts and he should remind his members and the American people that really what this is about is ultimately the Russian attack on our elections and demanding accountability it doesn't sound like from that quote that he did any of those things it is not in the version of the reporting we have and he also said there's no need to wait for the Democrats to release their version of the memo congressman Ted George I do want to note that tonight for the State of the Union you are bringing with you Christine Levinson the wife of Bob Levinson who has been a hostage in Iran since 11 years ago and I know you're working in bipartisan form to try to get him released so we all appreciate your efforts there John John thanks and and at this moment when there's so much partisanship when an American is being held we all have to come together that's why Christine is coming tonight to remind us that that he's still missing when he's not home it's something that we should all feel personally but thank you congressman not

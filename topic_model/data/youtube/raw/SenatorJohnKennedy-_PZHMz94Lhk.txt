trying very hard to project itself as a responsible and very very forthcoming nation that they are trying very hard to talk about how they're taking and helping the world in terms of covert 19 and vaccines and they're trying very hard look certain things you don't have to explain to the people of the world they see the results is china really actually trying to get to the bottom of this one thing we did discuss they are not but let's see what republican senator from louisiana john kennedy said senator do you think china is going to allow this second investigation from the keystone cops that were unable to get access the first time around not not under the current approach brian uh with respect to the origin of the of the coronal virus here's what i heard president biden do today i heard him politely ask the world health organization in china to get to the bottom of it pretty pleased with sugar on top and that's the typical washington way keep trying what uh doesn't work and when it doesn't work again do it some more he's going to have to change his approach let's start with the world health organization its president is dr tedros adhanam gabriele seuss from ethiopia dr tedros hums the chinese national anthem in the shower uh he loves president xi jinping like the devil loves sin if president chi told dr kedros to join the taliban he would say where's the line the only way to get him to do his job is for president biden to sit him down and say look dr tedros the american people pay your salary the american taxpayer puts up 900 million dollars every two years we're your biggest financial contributor uh either do your job or we're going to withhold the money and if that offends you i will help you pack with respect to china uh the people of china are good people but dr chi or president xi uh who runs china is a gangster uh he's right out of goodfellas if you turn the other cheek to president chi he'll just stab you in the neck now he will on occasion do the right thing but only when constantly supervised and cornered like a rat so to get him to cooperate here's what president biden's going to have to do he's going to have to enlist the support of the uk uh canada australia maybe new zealand india japan south korea in the european union and together we're going to have to go to chi publicly and not ask demand and we may have to impose sanctions and in my opinion president biden's approach to be nice about it right is uh at best um immeasurably naive and at worst it's just bottom of the barrel dumb in my opinion and what i am excited about and intrigued about is the world seems to understand that the wuhan virus origins which we were being told does not add up and dr uh redfield who was a former cdc director sat down with dr siegel this week and he said this about what he's noticing about politics that's not just in china but is here and it's in science listen i would expect that from politicians i would expect that from governments i would never expect that for the scientific community and yet what we witnessed was the scientific community went on heavy to try to stop any open debate about the origin of this virus he couldn't get into china to see for himself the military whitewashed the lab and the wet market he had big questions no one would listen americans weren't listening to american who happens to be the cdc director speaking to the president now he's free to speak and you can feel the frustration come through the screen senator the rest of the world wants answers too how do we unite this world effectively tomorrow against china because they seem to have compromised so much of the western world by this thing called money and trade well we first we've got to ask and we've got to ask more forcefully no disrespect than president biden did the g7 put out some sort of um cream of wheat statement it was it was a total wimp fest uh that's not that president xi and the who are not going to be uh intimidated by that look look what you allow us will continue and weakness invites the wolves and we've got to be more firm that doesn't mean that all the countries that say they will work with us will do it because a lot of them are scared of china and we may have to go it alone and president biden may decide you know look to me it's just not worth it i won't i want china to cooperate on on the green new deal or something but but uh he's not going to get it on the under the approach that he's taking right now i have confidence that congress can unite on this because we see one enemy and it is china more than even russia senator kennedy thanks for your instant analysis tonight appreciate it thank you

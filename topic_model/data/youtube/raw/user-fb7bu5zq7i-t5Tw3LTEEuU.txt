nature of a substitute which makes the following changes to HR 3114 is introduced it replaces of 2021 width of 2022 in the title it extends the coverage period by one year until January 27 2024 and adjust the dates to reflect the passage of time since the bill was introduced I introduced this bill along with chairman Scott in May of 2021 to ensure that Maritime workers receive a work-related presumption under the Long Shore in Harbor workers compensation act if they contract covid-19 or are required to quarantine during this once in a century pandemic Maritime workers have been on the front lines among the nation's essential workers Maritime workers working elbow to Elbow load and unload ships and barges toil and shipyards and work deep inside the compartments and holds of ships with co-workers to perform repairs and maintenance their work is at the heart of our critical Supply chains and our defense infrastructure since they work on and around navigatable Waters of the United States they are covered by the federal Longshore and harbors workers compensation act instead of state workers compensation laws this bill creates a conclusive presumption that Maritime workers contracted covid-19 is a work-related illness if their duties require contact with co-workers the public or others as part of the job and who are diagnosed with covid-19 within an established time frame following exposure to the extent that the employee experiences in unreimbursed loss the Longshore act provides payment of medical benefits lost wages or survivor benefits Longshore workers often work in pairs side by side the same is true for those workers who load and unload bulk break bulk and grain cargo from ships and barges workers handling brake ball break bulk cargo often spend hours in holds of vessels and in trucks as they transfer cargo this work is physically demanding often requiring multiple workers to handle loose cargo which places workers at a heightened risk of covid of exposure to covet 19. states have taken the lead in adjusting this evidentiary requirement for workers to establish causation for covid-19 under their State's workers compensation laws because it isn't because it is nearly impossible for claimant to prove the precise mode of exposure to the virus 18 states have adopted presumptions that apply to the range of essential workers which allows them to establish causation without having to overcome the insurmountable burdens of proof for work-related relatedness that normally apply Congress applied this principle to over 2 million federal civil civilian employees covered under the federal employees compensation act by enacting covid-19 protections as part of the as part of the American Rescue plan act it is time we follow suit for our Maritime workers as well under that presumption established for the federal workers the Department of Labor have a stat have accepted 80 86 percent of covid claims in contrast out of 1093 Longshore covid claims submitted between April 20th and October 2021 employers paid or settled seven percent of claims while disputing the remaining 93 of claims as Greg Reagan president of the AFL-CIO Transportation trades Department put it for the many who have been infected by covid-19 on the job receiving workers compensation benefits has been difficult if not impossible this bill reimburses the employers or their insurers for the cost of claims covered by this legislation provided employers have abided by basic safety standards needed to keep their workers safe similar legislation providing covid-19 presumptions for maritime workers passed in the house three times in the past two years including in May 2020 and in September 2020 in the two Heroes acts and in the 117th Congress this Committee reported and the house passed a similar provision in the American Rescue plan Act unfortunately that provision was removed by the Senate under the rules for reconciliation legislation finally I would like to thank the United steelworkers the International longshoremen's Association the international Longshore and Warehouse Union and the metal trades and transportation trades Department in the AFL-CIO for their tireless work to ensure that all Maritime workers receive the protection they need and deserve I urge my colleagues to vote Yes on this ANS and yes on the underlying bill and I yield back the balance of my time

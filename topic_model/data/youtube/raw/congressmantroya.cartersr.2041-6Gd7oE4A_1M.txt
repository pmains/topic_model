. MR. CARTER: MR. SPEAKER, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MY GREAT HOME STATE OF LOUISIANA IS WHERE THE LAWS ORIGINATED. THESE LAWS MANDATED THAT BLACK WOMEN OF LOUISIANA COVER THEIR BEAUTIFUL HAIR, MAKING IT ILLEGAL TO EXPOSE OUR HAIR. IMAGINE THAT. ALL AMERICANS SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO WEAR THEIR HAIR THAT NATURALLY GROWS OUT OF THEIR HEADS WITHOUT FEAR. WE AS MEMBERS OF CONGRESS MUST ACT TO BAN ANY DISCRIMINATION AGAINST NATURAL HAIR. WHETHER IT'S LOCKS, CURLS, BRAIDS OR TWISTS, BLACK AMERICANS HAVE HAD THE RIGHT TO EXIST AS THEIR AUTHENTIC SELFS AND WEAR THEIR NATURAL HAIR WITH PRIDE. THE CROWN ACT WOULD GIVE AND DEFEND THE RIGHT, BY PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF HAIR TEXTURE OR HAIR STYLE IN EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND SEVERAL OTHER IMPORTANT SPHERES. THIS LEGISLATION HAS BEEN HEAVILY VETTED AND HAS ALREADY BEEN PASSED IN SEVERAL STATES. I AM PROUD TO HAVE AUTHORED AND ADVANCED THE CROWN ACT AS A MEMBER OF THE LOUISIANA STATE SENATE. BUT NOT COMPLETE THE PROCESS BEFORE I WAS ELECTED TO CONGRESS. SO THIS IS PARTICULARLY SPECIAL FOR ME. FOR THE PEOPLE OF LOUISIANA AND FOR PEOPLE ACROSS THE NATION, FEDERAL ACTION IS NEEDED. STUDIES SHOW THAT SOME 80% OF BLACK WOMEN FEEL THEY HAVE TO CHANGE THEIR HAIR STYLES TO SIMPLY FIT IN TO THE WORKPLACE. THAT NATURAL HAIR IS SOMEHOW UNPROFESSIONAL. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. I AM CALLING ON THIS CHAMBER TO DO THE RIGHT THING. THAT ALL ELECTED OFFICIALS STAND UP AND DO WHAT IS RIGHT BY THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA. THIS INCLUDES THOSE WHO MAY NOT LIVE IN YOUR DISTRICT, AND THOSE WHO HAVE DIFFERENT LIFE EXPERIENCES. FOR THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF OUR COUNTRY'S EXISTENCE, RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IN ITS VARIOUS FORMS HAVE BEEN LEGAL. TODAY WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. TO MOVE THIS NATION FORWARD. TODAY THE HOUSE WILL VOTE TO MAKE DISCRIMINATION BASED ON HAIR STYLES A THING OF THE PAST AND MAKE OUR WORKPLACES MORE INCLUSIVE AND TRULY FREE FOR PEOPLE T

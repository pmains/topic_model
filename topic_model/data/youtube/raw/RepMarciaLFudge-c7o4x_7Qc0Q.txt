videos back ms fudge you're recognized for five minutes thank you very much mr. chairman mr. chairman as we consider the improving child nutrition and education act of 2016 we must not lose sight of the fact that investing in child nutrition programs is an investment in our nation's future providing children with access to nutritious foods throughout their school years will produce healthier kids and better learners with one in five American children experiencing food insecurity we cannot afford to take a step backward this bill does nothing to move us forward it fails to make meaningful investments in improving access to school and summer meals and contradicts everything we have heard in hearings and elsewhere about the need for improved access to nutritious meals especially during the summer months when we talk about summer meals we must keep in mind that current summer programs reach only a fraction of the children they are designed to assist in Ohio alone only nine percent of students receive summer meals leaving more than 600,000 eligible children without access to meals they would otherwise receive during the school year we must make a meaningful investment in summer meals and summer EBT ensuring we reach as many children as possible of equal concern is the increase of the community eligibility provision threshold the change would increase the burden on high poverty schools or providing no additional resources to school administrators another unfunded mandate so often complained about by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle this will result in eligible children losing access to free or reduced-price meals the numerous calls from advocacy groups for us to reconsider the harmful programmatic changes in this bill should serve as a call to action we must make meaningful investments in feeding programs that have been proven successful in school kitchen equipment in food service workers and in our children's health schools and organizations such as food banks Boys and Girls Clubs farm to school programs and many others have proven that with the proper investment we can make a significant impact on eradicating hunger in America America's children deserve better and we must do better with that mr. Chairman I yield back the remainder of my time gentlelady yields back

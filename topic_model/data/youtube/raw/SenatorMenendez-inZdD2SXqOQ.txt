this hearing will come to order uh as we sit here putin's forces continue to fire missiles at innocent ukrainians his generals continue to bombard cities and his soldiers are committing war crimes and still brave ukrainians are fighting back proving time and again that putin gravely miscalculated the resolve of the ukrainian people he also grossly miscalculated how the rest of the world would respond to his brutal unprovoked aggression the united states the overwhelming majority of europe and indeed of the entire free world are now more united in support of not just ukraine but of our collective resolve to support democracies the rule of law and defend against brazen authoritarian aggression indeed the very values that drove the foundation of the north atlantic treaty organization in the first place perhaps more than ever it is crystal clear that nato plays a vital role not only the security of the united states but as a bulwark protecting peace and democracy and i feel confident when i say both the ranking member and i believe carefully considering new candidates for nato expansion is one of the most important responsibilities this committee has so today we will learn more about finland and sweden's candidacies for nato membership these are two steadfast nato and u.s allies with strong durable military institutions and democratic institutions they have every reason to participate in collective defense against russian aggression and nato has every reason to embrace and welcome them into the alliance without delay in many ways finland and sweden are ideal candidates for nato membership nato is a defensive military alliance designed to preserve in part by holding members to high democratic governance and economic transparency standards indeed further to that point democratic processes in both countries have shown that the finnish and swedish people themselves are strongly supportive of joining nato so while nato has not yet formally prepared the session protocols for finland and sweden we expect it will very soon there is tremendous urgency in a strong case for inviting these countries expansion of nato requires unanimous agreement by all nato member states of course and with time of the essence the 11th hour concerns by turkey standing in the way of this process only serve putin's interests in the meantime and as members prepare to meet next week in madrid it is imperative that we press ahead with our own approval process which is why we are having this hearing today this may very well be one of the most important decisions this committee and the senate makes in the decade and beyond as it relates to foreign policy finland and sweden are well positioned to integrate into nato both have large technologically advanced and growing militaries they have long partnered with nato and have contributed to nato-led operations in the balkans afghanistan and iraq since russia's unprovoked invasion of ukraine they have strengthened their relations with nato even further engaging in regular dialogue and consultations exchanging information and coordinating training and exercises in fact given geography and history finland and sweden have long equipped their militaries and prepared their societies for the prospect of russian aggression their participation in nato would actively contribute to burden sharing with the united states and the whole military alliance belonging to nato is not just a measurement of military capability we were established as a club of democracies that abide by a certain set of principles all u.s administrations have used certain criteria for assessing candidates for nato membership a functioning democratic political system based on a market economy fair treatment of minority populations a commitment to resolve conflicts peacefully and ability and willingness to make military contributions to nato operations and a commitment to democratic civil military relations so i would like our witnesses to address how finland and sweden fulfill these criteria the required information the departments have already provided give me great confidence but i believe it's important to address them in an open setting we thank sweden and finland for their partnership and support look forward to welcoming you into nato with that i welcome assistant secretary of state for european affairs karen dunford and assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs celeste wallender and finally it's my great pleasure to welcome ambassadors karina awful starter from sweden and mike mikko hal tala is that the right pronunciation all right uh from finland here today for these hearing we appreciate both ambassadors being here with us probably the first outside guests that we have had so couldn't think of better guests to have for a better cause and a better moment

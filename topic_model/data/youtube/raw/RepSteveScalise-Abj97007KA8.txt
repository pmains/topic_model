i'm here at the border wall between mexico and the state of texas here in america this is a piece of unfinished wall if you can see this wall was being constructed under president trump and the day president biden took office he issued an order to stop construction of this wall this is unfinished wall this is a construction zone that was just abandoned taxpayers all across america are still paying the contractor not to build this wall not to protect america's border that is now so porous that we just left a detention facility in donna texas where they're at over 1 000 capacity above what they're supposed to be at a facility that was designed for maybe 300 people is holding about 4 000 people right now that came across the border because they stopped construction of this wall this is a national disgrace a border patrol agent was recently severely injured because he was chasing an illegal illegal crosser through the construction zone and got flipped off of his vehicle and now is severely injured because of this remnant of the border wall that president biden stopped construction of this is one example of how president biden's devastating policies are creating a crisis at our border a national disgrace and a humanitarian crisis that's causing the human trafficking and the drug cartels are the biggest beneficiary mexican drug cartels are making millions of dollars a week off of this national disgrace created by president biden

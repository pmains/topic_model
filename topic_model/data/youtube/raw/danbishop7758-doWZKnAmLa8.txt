to you i'm congressman dan bishop and i had an event in charlotte with some people this morning got one over in union county after i speak to you all for a minute but there's nothing more important to what y'all are doing today and this is amazing what i'm seeing out here two thursdays ago before three o'clock the morning a husband and wife awoke to the sound of a car wreck in the street outside and look it out the father saw the car and a man breaking into his car and he shouted at him to stop this brazen burglar comes through the window with a crowbar in hand that bashes the wind in and the terrorized family called the dad 911 the gun and moved to the front porch to protect his family he knew that the console of that car being burglarized contained another gun and he saw the burglar retrieve it they exchanged fire and the father retreated into his home to take cover because the confrontation had become more than even that prepared father could happen so it became the responsibility of ryan hendricks the eight year veteran of the henderson county sheriff's department arrived with two other deputies at 2 54 am they spotted the suspect in the burglarized pickup truck of another neighbor and they commanded him to surrender at first the suspect appeared to comply then suddenly raised a weapon in fire the first shot struck deputy hendricks in the face before his fellow officers returned fire and shot the gunman dead investigation revealed that the government was a career criminal wanted by south carolina probation with the rest in four states that was thursday before last the next day deputy hendrix bryant phillip hendricks 35 marine corps vet was secured to clear grain dead and the organs he donated were harvested to save four lives ryan's six-year-old son and nine-year-old daughter will live with only those fragmentary memories of their father that an unprepared juvenile mind can retain ryan's fiancee will not have that october wedding that they planned what y'all hear about today is that the murder of ryan hendricks is not an isolated story 193 law enforcement officers have died in the line of duty in 2020 86 it's the deadliest of the past 10 years and i thank this deputy for letting me use his pa system and y'all for listening but nothing i can say can enable the sacrifices of those laws nor the many others injured or even of the thousands of law enforcement officers who serve every day to make civil existence possible in this nation that we love those sacrifices that service they speak for themselves but i'm here today with you to speak about a fast-growing cancer in our civic spirit and activism that exploits the wounds of our national sciences born of racial injustice in our history an activism that draws explicitly on marxism and attacks the core foundations of our society including and foremost among the consensus of support for law enforcement a consensus that abides in every nation that's capable of surviving i can call out this destructive activism and you can be here to demonstrate against it it manifests itself in riots and looting and arson destruction injuries and killings in city after city in our country i'm introduced into congress a bill called the no riot act to criminalize injuries not only to federal but also state and local law enforcement officers injured in the course of interstate rioting but i can't return to law enforcement officers the protection they deserve if the leadership of this country is divided on the institution of police indeed the people are divided so i'm honored by what you're here today to do and i'm honored to be among you and i call on all of us to speak for this nation in about 48 days make clear that every leader on your ballot from the president of the united states to members of congress to the governor to mayors must back the blue if we do not if we do not then god have mercy on us because the criminals and thoughts like the ones who took ryan edward's life assuredly will not spare mine or yours or those of your lovers this country that we live in is exceptional the foundational ideas have never been agreed upon the recognition that every human every person is special every person has rights among them were like liberty and the right to pursue happiness our nation is a story of refining those rights in practice so that everyone gets a fair shake that everyone's life is protected and respected but elemental to that what we cannot do without are those like the gentleman sitting right here beside me through service and who sacrifice we all understand and so do the majority of americans most americans know that ryan hendricks is a hero and so are all of those who serve in blue most americans know that we cannot do without most americans know that those who make an argument for fundamental change in this country and that respect warmly build animosity against the people who serve every day to protect our lives and property most americans know that they're the highest caliber of americans and they deserve our respect and support i've five [Applause]

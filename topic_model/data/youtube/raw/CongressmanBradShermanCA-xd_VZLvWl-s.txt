>>> OUR NEXT GUEST IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THAT, JOINING ME NOW  DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN FROM  CALIFORNIA, BRAD SHERMAN WHO  SPENT SOME QUALITY TIME ON THE  FLOOR, THAT WAS YOU SHOUTING  BACK -- WAS IT YOU? >> WELL, HE INTERRUPTED MY  SPEECH AS DID QUITE A NUMBER OF  OTHER REPUBLICANS DID. THEY HAVE TO BE WILLING TO  DEBATE THE ISSUE AND VOTE ON A  BILL. OUR FIRST RESPONDERS HAVE SHOWN  INCREDIBLE COURAGE, THE COURAGE  IS CALLED UPON US IS QUITE A BIT LESS BUT WE ARE CALLED UPON TO  VOTE ON BILLS AND LET OUR  CONSTITUENTS LET THEM KNOW WHERE WE STAND.  >> CONGRESSMAN THEY CALLED IT A  STUNT, A WASTE OF TAXPAYER  MONEY. HERE'S PAUL RYAN IN RESPONSE TO  YOU TODAY.  >> THIS BILL COULDN'T EVEN GET  50 VOTES IN THE UNITED STATES  SENATE, LET ALONE 60. WHY IS THAT? WHY IS THAT THIS BILL FAILED ON  BIPARTISAN BASIS IN COMMITTEE  AND THIS BILL FAILED ON A  BIPARTISAN BASIS IN THE SENATE,  BECAUSE IN THIS COUNTRY, WE DO  NOT TAKE AWAY PEOPLE'S  CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS WITHOUT  DUE PROCESS.  >> ALL RIGHT, HE'S SAYING IT  FAILED MISERABY IN COMMITTEE  AND THAT'S WHY THE VOTE DIDN'T  HAPPEN, YOUR RESPONSE.  >> HE BRINGS UP LOTS OF BILLS  THAT AREN'T GOING ANYWHERE. WE BRINGS UP BILLS THAT HE KNOWS WILL DIE IN THE SENATE. THIS IS A CASE WHERE THE BILL  COULD HAVE IMPROVED ON THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE BECAUSE WE DO NEED  TO PROTECT PEOPLE'S CIVIL  LIBERTIES. IF YOU'RE ON THE LIST YOU NEED A SYSTEM TO GET OFF THE LIST. YOU HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT  TO TRAVEL AND OF COURSE WE HAVE  A SECOND AMENDMENT. WE COULD HAVE PASSED A BETTER  BILL IF RYAN SIMPLY BROUGHT THE  BILL UP AND ALLOWED US TO  IMPROVE IT.  >> THERE WERE A BUNCH OF OPTIONS EARLIER THIS WEEK. LET ME ASK YOU, THOUGH, IF GUN  CONTROL IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT  ISSUE ESPECIALLY TO DEMOCRATS,  WHY DIDN'T THEY PASS IT WHEN YOU CONTROLLED ALL THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT? >> LOOK, NOT EVERY DEMOCRAT IS  WILLING TO VOTE FOR COMMONSENSE  GUN -- GUN CONTROL OR GUN LIMIT  TAKES --  >> A MJORITY ARE --  >> THE DEMOCRATS WERE IN CHARGE. AT LEAST 78% OF DEMOCRATS  AMONGST THE AMERICAN PUBLIC ARE  AS WELL. WHEN YOU HAD CONTROL FROM 2009  TO 2011, ET CETERA, IN THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE AND THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY, WHY WASN'T THIS  AN IMPORTANT ISSUE --  >> THE WORD CONTROL IS PART OF  YOUR QUESTION, WE NEVER HAD  TOTAL CONTROL. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE VOTES, WE  TRIED, NOW WE NEED TO ELECT A  CONGRESS IN NOVEMBER THAT WILL  BE OVERWHELMING IN FAVOR OF  COMMONSENSE WHEN IT COMES TO GUN SAFETY AND I THINK WE'LL DO  THAT. BUT, IF YOU HAVE A SITUATION  WHERE VIRTUALLY EVERY REPUBLICAN IS VOTING NO AND A FEW DEMOCRATS ARE VOTING NO THEN THE BILL  ISN'T GOING TO PASS.  >> TALK TO ME, CONGRESSMAN,  ABOUT HOW THIS REALLY CHANGED  THE WAY IN WHICH WE LEARNED  ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON LAST  NIGHT, BECAUSE YOU WERE  PERISCOING THIS THROUGHOUT. YOU FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR  THE AMERICAN PUBLIC TO SEE WHAT  WAS GOING ON.  >> ABSOLUTELY. BUT WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN  DOING LAST NIGHT AND LAST WEEK  IS DEBATING COMMONSENSE GUN LAWS AND WE SHOULD DEBATED NOT BY  BEING TELEVISED ON PERISCOPE BY  THE HIGH-QUALITY REGULAR C-SPAN  CAMERAS. THE MICROPHONES SHOULD HAVE  WORKED. WE SHOULD HAVE VOTED. THAT'S THE WAY CONGRESS IS  SUPPOSED TO WORK. RYAN WON'T LET CONGRESS WORK. WE WON'T LET US VOTE ON A BILL. >> HE DISAGREES WITH YOU  WHOLEHEARTEDLY, HE THOUGHT IT  WAS A STUNT. ALL RIGHT, APPRECIATE YOU BEING  ON THE "REAL STORY." >>> ANOTHER BIG STORY, GUNMAN  OPENS FIRE INSIDE A MOVIE  THEATER IN GERMANY. POLICE RESPONDED QUICKLY,  KILLING THE GUNMAN. THE SHOOTER DID NOT HURT ANYONE  IN THE PROCESS.

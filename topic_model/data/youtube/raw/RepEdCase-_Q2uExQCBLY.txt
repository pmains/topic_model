committee will recognize congressman ed cates that's case from hawaii who will probably remind us that his district is surrounded by the largest saline lake in the world thank you mr chair among other things i was prepared to remind you of a fair number of things however today um apropos of your comment uh ms trujillo i do want to remind this subcommittee of the indigenous peoples of our country whose origins lie in hawaii the native hawaiians i have read of course this resolution i support this resolution but it makes no mention of of native hawaiians native hawaiians are the indigenous peoples of our country recognized as such over 150 federal statutes over the years 100 years plus of statutory action explicit recognition of a special trust relationship with native hawaiians um native hawaiians lack meaningful infrastructure along with uh every other indigenous uh peoples uh throughout our country american indians alaska natives are our brothers and sisters and i'm grateful to this committee and to this subcommittee for recognizing that uh fact over a long a long period of time um however in all honesty i am i'm concerned uh that there is no uh apparent recognition of native one in this resolution and i've discussed this with uh with the principal introducer of this this resolution and appreciate his willingness to to incorporate that concern but i do want to ask you uh whether you also recognize that native hawaiians as indigenous peoples of our country are also entitled to access to reliable and clean drinking water um as an essential you know human need and critical component and that the administration understands that that obligation is also one that is owed to all native peoples of our country not just american indians alaska natives so first of all can i ask you to comment on that thank you representative case i would absolutely agree that then the citizens of alaska are all entitled to those basic needs as well and i support any efforts to try to expand the authorities or or modify the resolution that makes that clear okay well there's an old saying in my other profession of of of being a lawyer and that is when you get the answer you want you you stop at that point so by the way you said citizens of alaska and i think you meant hawaii i think you meant native hawaiians who who by the way do not only live in the state of hawaii uh they they uh are residents of our of all throughout our country and have the same the same needs throughout our country so appreciate your answer and uh look forward to working with you on forgive me for that oversight and i do i was going to acknowledge that i have the great privilege of working with several folks from the usgs uh science centers in hawaii and and i'm very impressed with all of the capabilities that they have undertaken there thank you so much we look forward to working with you along across a broad range of of issues having to do with native hawaiians in hawaii but i appreciate your response and i yield back mr chair thank you thank you congressman case

hello I'm Adam Smith I'm the congressman who represents the ninth district of the state of Washington and I'm pleased to have the opportunity to give the Democratic message for this week I know a lot of people paid close attention to the government shutdown that happened last week and are wondering what it was all about why did it happen and there's really a very simple explanation the Republicans who controlled the house the Senate in the White House are refusing to govern on the critical issues that face our country and what they were trying to do last week and ultimately did do was pass yet another short-term stopgap spending bill that is not funding the government there are so many issues that are not being addressed by this Congress and what Democrats were trying to do was basically to force the Republicans to do their job they won the election they control the house they control the Senate they controlled the White House it's time to govern but they're not doing it they're not passing a budget to begin with I'm the ranking member in the House Armed Services Committee and I've been privileged to work with the men and women who serve in our military and we could not be better served they make us proud every day but the Congress right now the republican-controlled Congress is not serving our military because now passing a defense budget a short-term spending bill is not a budget the leaders of the Pentagon do not know from one week to the next how much money they're going to have to spend that makes it impossible to plan and impossible to put us in a position to adequately meet the national security needs of this country and it's not just the Defense Department it's the entire budget our infrastructure we have a crumbling infrastructure in this country estimated to have a six hundred billion dollar backfill but again the Republicans will not pass a transportation budget in a short-term spending bill what they've passed now four times since the end of the fiscal year in September is not a budget they're not funding infrastructure they're not funding research they're not funding education we are stumbling forward one month at a time and it goes beyond the budget we have had horrible hurricanes last year hit Texas Florida Puerto Rico in the US Virgin Islands they have not passed the disaster relief that these areas desperately need again simply kicking the can down the road and a of course docker and we've heard a lot about it the young people who came into this country didn't make the choice to come into this country the only country they've ever really known is the United States of America and our government a couple years ago gave them legal status in this country about 800,000 young people and then six months ago President Trump simply took it away now at the time he said he hoped Congress would pass legislation to deal with this but the Republican Congress again has refused to do it and again that's part of what was trying to be forced last week to force them to give us about if a vote came up on daca on protection for these dreamers for these young people it would pass overwhelmingly in the house in the Senate but the Republicans refused to even give us a boat the only thing that the Republicans have done since they took over Congress in the White House last year is pass a massive tax cut for the wealthiest among us and for corporations two groups of people that have had more than enough benefits in the last couple of decades that tax cut even comes at the expense in some cases of middle-class people what Democrats want is we want an economy that builds from the middle out that working people in the middle class can benefit from now you see in all the signs that our economy is booming unfortunately about 90 to 95 percent of that benefit is going to about five or ten percent of the country we need to pass a budget to fix health care to deal with disaster relief to deal with all of these issues if we're going to actually take care of the middle class and the working people of this country and that is what the Republicans have refused to do now we growl EE we found out last week that even when Democrats said look we're not going to vote for another short-term spending bill that continues to put us down this path of uncertainty that doesn't fund our priorities that doesn't pass the bills that we need to pass that doesn't govern our country the way it's supposed to even when faced with that the Republicans said we don't care where we're still not going to do it we're not gonna pass a budget we're not going to pass disaster relief we're not gonna fix daca we're not going to fix it infrastructure we're not going to fix our health care plan so we hope that that will change this latest stopgap goes to February 8th well see what happens then but the problem we have in this country right now is the Republicans who controlled the House the Senate and the White House flat-out refused to govern they refuse to fix our health care system they refuse to pass a budget they refuse to take care of disaster relief it is time we hold them accountable and we can't do it alone in Congress so I ask you the American people to stand up tell the Republicans to govern we don't need more short-term spending bills we need a budget and we need a Congress in a White House that actually governs and leads this country

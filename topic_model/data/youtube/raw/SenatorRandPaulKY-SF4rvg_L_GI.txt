let's go to Senator Rand Paul on this of course he's quite a physical Hawk when it comes to such matters and that generally gets the ire of even some of his party so it's a good time to ask him about this latest stimulus push what do you think Senator are you for more stimulus oh we have no money Neil there's no rainy day fund there's no savings accounts not like we go over to the Federal Reserve open the safe we find oh we have all this money we can give to people the 3 trillion we've already sent to people because of this government mandated depression it has been borrowed where are they going to get another trillion dollars they're going to borrow it and so I think it's a really really rotten thing to do what you have to do is look at the source the source of the economic depression is the government and the government shutdown of the economy the government and particularly the governors need to get out of the way let the economy open up and let individuals assess their risk and act accordingly so when there's talk about extending unemployment benefits which are very generous on on the federal level or what some of your Republican colleagues have come up with and had said it to get people to go back to work you're against both well if you pay people not to work they won't work if you pay people more not to work than to get for working normally they won't work it's called institutional unemployment so right now the institutional unemployment if you make less than about fifty thousand dollars a year you've got no business working why work if the government will give you a great a free fifty thousand dollars if the Democrats get their way and unemployment goes on from months and months and months if not years what will happen is nobody will work for less than 50 000 in this country because you can get that for not working the Republicans idea only slightly less stupid the Republicans are going to give you a bonus to go back to work where are they getting the money they're going to borrow it from you they're going to borrow it from your kids they're going to borrow it from China it's a ridiculous notion that we just keep passing out money let's get rid of the root cause of this depression sometimes we don't know exactly the cause of an oppression and this one we do know the cause the government the government shut the economy down the government needs to get the hell out of the way and let us all go back to work and let each and every one of us assess the risk and make decisions accordingly you know Senator you're also a doctor and and many school districts and municipalities including some big ones Los Angeles and San Diego and Atlanta are among those saying we're going to delay the school year because we don't like this Viking cases we're seeing we think it's risky so we're going to put it off how do you feel about that but you know the teachers union in California also said they won't go back to work until we defund the police and have Medicare for all so we have to put this into a bit of perspective but what I would say is the media have been scaring people to death the mortality for children 0 to 18 is one in a million or less the mortality between 18 years of age and 45 is about 10 in a hundred thousand so we need to assess those risks and make decisions the the countries that have opened schools 22 countries have opened schools in Europe and they're doing just fine they haven't had a surge the other interesting thing is when you do contact contact tracing in China the Netherlands Britain and in Iceland what you find is kids not only rarely get this rarely die from it but they rarely transmit it they're just not good transmitters and in general people who are asymptomatic are not good transmitters so the daycare stayed open in New York throughout this for doctors kids nurses kids hospital janitors kids anybody that was Associated fireman police that the daycare stayed open and guess what very little coronavirus and very few staff members about one percent of Staff members were infected and mostly staff members if they're in a reasonable age group are at very very low risk of succumbing to this disease well you know actually that puts you kind of on the same page as Dr fauci I know you too had your disagreement so he is for opening schools in person but he did say this about it's an answer to a question about whether he's being slighted by the White House he said you can trust respected medical authorities I believe I'm one of them so you can trust me but you need to stick to the data the science medical authorities will have a track record of telling the truth the public can get Nick's messages and get confused what do you think of that well look I think Dr fauci is well intentioned I don't think he's a bad person I think he wants what's best for the country but his perspective is that of someone who's always worked for the government and never worked outside of government so there's a Dr Scott Atlas who's a professor at Stanford uh as part of the Hoover Institute was a much different I think much more reason perspective so what we do is we listen to a lot of these people but ultimately if we're going to live in a free country none of these people should get to make a decision for us for us individually each individual should assess the risks and make their choices frankly if you're 18 years old the rules should be or the advice should be much different than if you're 80 years old and if you're in a nursing home and you're 85 years old and so it isn't one size fits all we can't say oh everybody needs to stay at home because someone at the nursing home might get sick no let's try to be careful and protect those in the nursing home but let's open the economy open the schools there's a possibility we don't know this yet but there's a possibility this great spike in infections that we're seeing throughout the South that it may well be enhancing immunity and it may well be that they reach what I think New York has already reached a point at which the disease will begin to burn itself out interestingly no one's saying this but it may not be herd immunity of 60 percent it may be a break point for the disease that's much less than that and they're mathematicians who look at this and they say that the models of herd immunity are based on random behavior and random vaccines vaccination when you get hurt immunity from the disease it's not randomly distributed and you have some who are very social and some who are less social but the bottom line is historically diseases and viruses have burned out at 25 percent immunity when you look back at our past no one knows what the future holds but I tend to be optimistic that we might get to 20 25 immunity and the disease may be uh we may be well over to over maybe able to overcome the disease at that point very quickly we'll be talking to the mayor of Miami you know it's Miami Beach that has already put out a Proviso no short-term rentals here fearing that the thing is it's worsening it's different from Miami I grant you but do you think that is an overreaction I think we don't know until we see the death rate uh I think that uh infection rate and testing are complicated whether things are going up or down I do believe they are going up and people are infected even in my town here Bowling Green and Kentucky we we meet people every day who are infected and to a person they're all getting better uh they're getting mild disease and getting better so if they're if this is a mild disease in Miami don't shut it down if you have a an increase in your death rate and it's significant maybe you should but so far Florida's doing way better than New York you wouldn't know that if you watch CNN but Florida is doing way better than New York New York had a disaster a public policy disaster Public Health disaster in their nursing homes due to Democrat Governor Cuomo's decisions Florida is doing a lot better but you won't get that from the media that has become so biased and cannot report any of this objectively it's a disaster Senator Rand Paul thank you very much I believe the Senate was referring to Total cases total hospitalizations total debts

who's who's then going to be responsible for this breakdown at our southern border which was created by president biden which he could fix today i've urged president biden to go down to the border and see this for himself to see how inhumane he's treating kids in violation of his own cdc guidance which dr fouche yesterday verified that's if you reach the child abuse and neglect laws of the state of texas where this facility is this is a violation of the child abuse and neglect laws at the president biden run facility and again president trump went and negotiated with mexico went negotiated with those northern triangle countries to resolve the surge this could be resolved as well and you don't need to reinvent the wheel because there was a method for how to resolve it legally using the legal system that america has sure i would agree it needs reforms not an amnesty reform where you send a magnet not only across south and central america but around the world that america's borders are open because that's the message today as the gentleman knows there are at least six people on the terrace watch list that have come across america's southern border and i'm not talking about from south and central american countries from middle eastern countries from eastern european countries those are just the ones we know of that we've caught and the biden administration won't share that data with the media the bodne administration won't even let the press into this facility which is a national disgrace i could imagine what the press would have said if the trump administration was housing kids in a 33-person facility there's over 400 crammed into a 33-person cell in the middle of a pandemic and again dr fauci said this violates every protocol there is when we're trying to get our economy reopened other countries have to control covet too but in america we're trying to control it but here's where the double standard hypocrisy is driving people nuts if any american citizen ran their business in america like this they'd be shut down by the federal government today but yet people can come here illegally and the biden administration is running this facility in violation of those very same guidances and you know what happens to them they were given a free airplane ticket put on an airplane possibly with covid and sent into some interior country of america and we don't even know where they're going the dividing administration won't share that we've asked for a meeting by the way our leadership team leader mccarthy myself have asked for a meeting with president biden to talk about this crisis and he refuses to meet with us about it just ignoring a problem will not make it go away if we're going to find a solution to this and again i listed a number of bills including some that are bipartisan that would start solving this problem but president biden doesn't even want to go down he put vice president harris in charge of this mess and she won't even go down to the border maybe because she doesn't want to be associated with president biden's debacle but she was put in charge of it she is the vice president united states she has a responsibility to go down there she should have gone down there weeks ago but she still hasn't been and maybe if they saw that if they looked into the eyes of these young kids one of the first girls we ran into might have been a 10 year old girl in one of these cells and she was crying and we asked her why are you crying and she said i don't want to be here she's an orphan the gentleman talked about orphans all of these kids there are no parents with them they don't want to be here many were crying because they're jammed into these cells for 20 hours a day at least 15 percent with covet six inches apart not six feet apart that's what the biden administration is doing right now president trump fixed this problem and again if president biden just doesn't like president trump call it his own name we don't care the template if he doesn't want to do what actually worked then do something else that works but just doing this it's not only a national disgrace dr fauci and dr wilinski yesterday said it's a violation of the cdc protocols that every american taxpayer has to follow and they don't exempting themselves from a problem but making everybody else comply with it is no way to instill confidence in the american people and i hope the president goes down there i hope the president resolves this issue he should meet with us he said he wanted to unify the country he said he wanted to work with everybody it's time he start following through on those promises and i would yield

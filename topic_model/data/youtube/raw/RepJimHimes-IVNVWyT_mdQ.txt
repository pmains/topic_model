speaker's announced policy of January 6 2015 the gentleman from Connecticut mr. Himes is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader Thank You mr. speaker I appreciate the time I come to the floor today on this fifth anniversary of dodd-frank to reflect a little bit on a signal piece of legislation that to this day remains controversial dodd-frank of course was a response to the worst economic meltdown that we have seen in this country since the Great Depression of the 1930s and I want to reflect back on what led to the need for dodd-frank the impact that that Great Recession as we have come to call it had on Americans and American families all over this country and then think a little bit about what dodd-frank has and has not done in the five years since its passage it remains a controversial piece of legislation all you have to do is look at the steady stream of press releases from the majority party on financial services i have a few here dodd-frank has enshrined too-big-to-fail into law Obama claimed dodd-frank would lift the economy it has done the opposite despite the fact that we learned today of course we've got one of the lowest jobless rates in a very very long time financial crisis was caused by Washington's dumb regulations that would come as a surprise to pretty much anybody with economic know how who saw the long chain of malfeasance and irresponsibility in the mortgage market that actually led to the crisis dodd-frank is setting the stage for the next crisis dodd-frank act leaves America less stable less prosperous less free truly extravagant claims so let's back up a little bit and remember January of 2009 that happens to be the month that I was given the privilege of serving in this chamber and it come it came out curr a quarter the last quarter of two thousand eight in which the United States economy actually shrank at an eight percent rate on an annualized basis the economy was very literally melting down the stock market was half of what it is today businesses were closing Americans saw literally trillions of dollars of value let's talk for a second about what value means value means that retirement fund that you were relying on in order to retire it means the money that you had set aside in a brokerage count to educate your children it means those savings that you had accumulated over many many years of foregoing that vacation or scrimping on the budget those things all of that for many Americans wiped out or cut in half devastation and by the way in January of 2009 I remember this though the bailout had passed this house what was known as the tarp the Troubled Asset release program and though that had been put into place by the United States Congress and seemed to have stabilized the market at least temporarily we worried day in and day out as to whether this let's face it obnoxious measure I don't think there's anybody who thinks than a free market system there should be bailouts this obnoxious politically toxic measure which nonetheless reasserted some stability in the financial services sector nobody really knew if it was enough I remember wondering whether we might not see a bankruptcy in a money center bank a moment perhaps in which ATMs wouldn't have money in them this was January of 2009 most importantly there's a lot of big words asset values this that and the other thing money center banks this meant devastation for millions of Americans who lost their jobs for families who weren't going to be able to send their kids to school who were going to have to postpone retirement unemployment going into double-digit meaning that and I spoke to somebody one of my constituents yesterday who has an Ivy League degree who found himself working as a clerk at Home Depot surrounded by other people with lots of education who were fortunate to have that job back in 2009-2010 because the economy had been demonstrated by a financial services industry and yes by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and insufficient regulation and irresponsibility on the part of some of the regulator's had devastated the economy and left the American second people holding the bag so what happened we went to work we went to work in 2009 and 2010 we passed the dodd-frank act the dodd-frank act is a complicated big thing but it addressed every stage of that chain of irresponsibility and malfeasance starting with the selling of toxic and explosive mortgages to families that brokers and others knew couldn't possibly repay those mortgages to the bundling of those toxic mortgages into complicated securities which frankly you needed a PhD to understand to the fact that some of the credit rating agencies then put investment grade triple-a ratings on these toxic securities to the fact that derivatives were then written on these securities derivatives that were largely unregulated as the result of an act of this Congress a long line of malfeasance and irresponsibility of insufficient regulation and of regulation insufficiently enforced of terrible market practice and of course in the middle of 2008 the chickens came home to roost and the economy was devastated and the American people almost without exception suffered and we saw the Troubled Asset Relief Program the bailout passed imagine how shocking that is to the American people I've lost my job I've lost my home and there is a bailout of these institutions that I don't know a whole lot about but I suspect correctly we're at the heart of this crisis no wonder we had political upheaval in this country after that happened so every step in that chain from toxic mortgages to securities that nobody understood to credit rating agencies doing an awful job in evaluating those securities to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac acting irresponsibly to regulators being asleep to switch Dodd Frank addressed every element of that set of problems which combined to devastate the American economy and to hurt American families did it do it perfectly of course it didn't do it perfectly we were legislating under conditions of great fear of heightened emotions and at the end of the day we are mortals addressing very very complicated issues but it was a good faith effort to address what had clearly caused this problem this notion that the Republicans are peddling that it was caused by Washington's dumb regulations is beyond insane because dodd-frank looked at what actually caused the problems of 2008 and addressed them so what happened we were told that dodd-frank would be a job killer this was back in 2010 when anything that the then Democratic Congress did was going to be a job killer the Affordable Care Act which as it turns out has provided health insurance to 16 million Americans that was going to be a job killer dodd-frank was going to be a job killer everything was going to be a job killer when we turned the lights on in this room it was a job killer you don't hear that much anymore because since those fantastic descriptions of job-killing legislation we have added almost 13 million jobs to the economy the unemployment rate today is as low as it was before the meltdown of 2008 the stock market has doubled since then business confidence is up business investment is up our capital markets are healthy so this idea that it was going to be job-killing was just flat-out wrong certainly compared to the crisis which was the true job killer the other accusation that was made of course was that dodd-frank was going to crush credit markets that the sources of financing that a family needs to buy a home or to send a child to college the sources of financing that give rise to startup companies companies like Google which didn't exist 25 years ago venture capital the stock market that of course gives equity to our businesses to grow and expand and employment those we're going away because of dodd-frank the criticisms levelled and the predictions made about the credit markets were apocalyptic so let's take a look at what actually happened I assembled a little bit of the data here just to show what has happened in the credit markets we all love venture capital that iconic image of the entrepreneurs in the garage developing a product that grows into a multi-billion dollar corporation that provides an electronic device that changes our lives that makes our lives better venture capital here's the line venture capital at the start of dodd-frank and today that is a line running up and to the right let's look at total consumer credit consumer credit you want to buy a car you want to buy a television set consumer credit we all use it start of dodd-frank five years ago today a dramatic increase in consumer credit stock market the stock market of course is where established companies go to raise money and where we put money hoping it will grow what's happened there a near doubling of the stock market robust commercial and industrial loans what if you're a business and you don't want to raise money in the stock market you want to borrow money commercial and industrial loans every one of these lines which capture most of the financing mechanisms and how healthy they are running at the point in time when dodd-frank was started to today running strongly upwards so all of those criticisms that it was going to crush the credit markets completely rebutted by pretty much anything that is happening in the credit markets today let's just spend a minute mr. speaker on what was actually in dodd-frank because this is pretty complicated stuff what was actually in dodd-frank were a couple of important ideas that we should have something called a consumer finance Protection Bureau that says to credit card companies no you can't switch the order of a purchase to make it look like somebody over drew an account or spend too much money so that you can charge a $25 fee that said to mortgage brokers no you can't put somebody into an inappropriately risky or high-cost mortgage just because you make more money for doing so Mr Speaker we have standards in our country you can't buy a toaster that will burn down your house you can't buy a car that will explode when you turn on the ignition that happens because we have minimum safety standards if you can't buy a toaster that will burn down your house why should you be allowed to be sold a mortgage that very clearly will cause you to lose your house that's what the consumer finance Protection Bureau does and it's returned literally millions and millions of dollars to the American public as a result of its telling those cheats those people who would prey on the financial naivete of the American people that you can't do that anymore and if you do it we're going to shut you down and you're going to give the money back that's what the consumer finance Protection Bureau is doing today second important thing that dodd-frank did was to say for the first time that maybe we ought to regulate this derivatives market now derivatives are a fairly complicated financial instrument most Americans don't use derivatives directly don't necessarily know what they do they are essentially bet and that's okay if you want to bet that oil prices are going to go up or down because you use oil you ought to be able to take that bet to hedge your risk that's okay but in the early 2000s the derivatives market had become very literally nothing but a betting game for people who simply wanted to roll the dice on the mortgage market or on the direction of a corporate credit or on the stock market you could take any bet people would lend your money you could place that bet and off you went and that's of course what brought down what was otherwise an iconic American insurance company AIG this was truly a storied insurance company that got into the derivatives business and touched off the crisis and shockingly by law the derivatives market even though it's more complicated and large sure then the stock market by law was not regulated when you wanted to buy or sell a derivative you picked up the phone you called your broker and you did the deal and nobody necessarily knew about it that obviously doesn't happen in the stock market you go through a broker the trade gets registered the SEC looks over the shoulder of the market to make sure it operates in safe and sound fashion by law the derivatives market was unregulated and untranslated french said that does not make sense and said if you're going to trade derivatives you're going to do it over an exchange the way we trade stocks if you're going to trade derivatives particularly risky ones you're going to put up capital against the bet you're taking so that if you lose you can pay it off that's what happened with AIG they took a whole lot of very big bets that they had no ability to pay off when they lost and of course who lent them the money to take those bets banks and brokerages who when they found out that the bet they thought they won there was no money coming to him that's when we got into real trouble at places like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers so we said crazy though it may sound that a market is complicated and as large as the derivatives market ought to be subject to the same transparency and regulation that the stock market has been subject to since the 1930s that's what dodd-frank did and finally in dodd-frank did a lot but this is another really big thing dodd-frank said we ought to actually have a mortgage market that is a little friendlier to the American people because for most Americans the savings that they have is in their homes for generations until 2008 generally home prices had gone up and let's face it the middle class works pretty hard not making a lot of extra money and so the growth in the value of their home was the way you amassed a nest egg to retire to buy that vacation cabin whatever it was you aspired to do and yet by 2008 this had become yet another dangerous casino it was true at the time though it's not true anymore that a broker could sell a mortgage to a family that was a lot more expensive and a lot riskier than it needed to be because that broker could get paid more in commission for selling that more complicated more risky mortgage than that broker would get paid for selling a plain-vanilla mortgage those days are gone those days are gone and that's a very very good thing for the American people remember homes are where people most people have their savings that's what dodd-frank was my friends on the Republican side who had these incredible statements like the financial crisis was caused by Washington's dumb regulations failed to see that dodd-frank was actually a proportionate and targeted response to a truly devastating financial crisis that had real impact on an awful lot of families and I'm sorry about that the reason I'm sorry about that is because dodd-frank of course is not perfect there are clearly issues around some things like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which dodd-frank was silent on today the vast majority of American mortgages are still explicitly back stopped by the federal government because we didn't reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac shame on both parties for that by the way we had a lot to do when the Democrats were running the show we didn't get to that point and in the many years since the Republicans have been controlling this chamber they have not taken that up we should take that up I'm very proud to be along with Congressman Delaney and Congressman Carney a sponsor of legislation which would do just that there is still difficulty for Americans who should probably qualify for a mortgage in getting that mortgage it's possible that the dodd-frank swung the pendulum a little far in the mortgage market and we ought to look at be very very careful about because remember at the core of the crisis of 2008 were mortgages that an awful lot of people shouldn't have been in an over commitment on the part of public policy and others to make every American a homeowner to make it cheap to have outrageously complicated mortgage so that that could happen so carefully we should we ought to look at what's happening in the mortgage market today there are more technical issues there is questions there are questions about whether there is enough liquidity in the mechanisms particularly bonds that companies use to finance themselves there are fair questions about whether we have adequately dealt with the question of too big to fail dodd-frank certainly put profound strictures on large institutions it gave the government unprecedented authority to look into the so-called too big to fail institutions and say sorry you've got to shrink down you've got to get out of this business it put additional capital in fact just this week the federal reserve announced the additional capital that large institutions will be required to set aside but it's a fair debate as to whether or not we have truly dealt with the question of too big to fail and this is the rub as long as the discussion we have about dodd-frank is a near religious discussion with my friends in the Republican Party making statements like dodd-frank should be repealed dodd-frank act leaves America less stable less prosperous and less free and yes frankly as long as the Democrats don't open the door to the notion that we may not have gotten it perfectly right in on each one of its pages we won't be able to come together to do something which is essential in any piece of legislation but particularly in financial regulation which is to adapt and allow the regulatory structure to change to reflect changing conditions there are very few markets as adaptive that change more rapidly that innovate for good and frill as rapidly as the financial services market as a result we need a regulatory apparatus that adapts along with the market that looks for new threats that realizes that the regulation of 40 years ago actually doesn't make a lot of sense today and yet this near religious conflict that we have with the Republican saying you ought to do away with the whole darn thing they say that of course they've never actually brought legislation forward to repeal dodd-frank which should cause you to ask mr. speaker how serious they are about truly repealing it but as long as that's the conversation repeal or don't change a word of this legislation we give up the opportunity to make it better and to make it change with the underlying conditions that it seeks to regulate that's where we need to go we need to acknowledge that dodd-frank has done some very very good things that it has addressed some catastrophic problems that it took on behavior that is embarrassing to contemplate looked back five ten years but that maybe we didn't get it one hundred percent right and start that conversation we should do that to make sure that American families are never put in the position they were put in back in 09 we should do that because the truth is that the financial services industry is crucial to prosperity in this country if you want to buy a house educate a child by a car invest in a company start a company grow a company you have to have access to capital and one of the competitive advantages of this country is our incredibly liquid and efficient capital markets it's a big part of why we are as prosperous as we are today but if we can't acknowledge that the regulatory structure has to adapt and change we risk either putting Americans at risk one more time or damaging these incredible capital markets that are truly a national competitive advantage of the United States one of the reasons we are the center of innovation on the planet I think Mr Speaker we can get that balance right I think we just need to take the temperature down approach this from the standpoint of what makes sense acknowledge that we all have good ideas and move forward so that we remain innovative we keep our competitive advantages but we never ever allow the American people to suffer the way they did starting in two thousand eight so looking back over five years i think dodd-frank was a tremendous accomplishment it really addressed a cataclysmic problem but it doesn't stop there and I urge my colleagues to recognize that we've taken a very big step in the right direction but the next step demands on us be it demands us to be constructive and remember that we can find a balance between innovation and liquid and strong capital markets and the protection

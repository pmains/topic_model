well a top Republican senator is now questioning conflicting information from the FBI and Homeland Security about the Boston terror attack suspects here's Senator Lindsey Graham asking Secretary Janet Napolitano to clarify which agencies were aware of Tamerlan tsarnaev s six-month trip to Russia watch this you said I think the senator grassley that the older brother the suspect who was killed when he left to go back to Russia in 2012 the system picked up his departure but did not pick up him coming back is that correct going on that's my understanding and i can give you the detail in a classified setting but i think the salient fact there senator is that the FBI text alert on him at that point was more than a year old and had expired at the point I'm trying to make is after having talked to the FBI they told me they had no knowledge of him leaving her coming back the name was misspelled so I would like to talk to you more about this case hmm Wow Senator Lindsey Graham is on the Senate Judiciary Committee and we are very glad to have you with us this morning senator welcome thank you that that's disturbing yeah well you know three days ago the FBI called me at home because last Sunday I suggested maybe we drop the ball on this guy we got noticed from a foreign government the Russians that this guy's become radicalized may be joining unspecified groups to commit terrorist acts within our country the FBI interviewed in him in 2011 they interviewed his family they apparently did a pretty good job they contacted the russians in october two thousand eleven saying do you have any more they say the Russians never responded ask him how could he go to russian you not know it they tell me that the name was misspelled they didn't go into the system now Secretary Napolitano says wait a minute we knew about it so how could Homeland Security know about him leaving the country and the FBI and I'd you know 11 years after 911 where we're going here yeah I mean we now have a director of national intelligence james clapper and and the whole reason for this structure that we have is to connect the dots I mean connect the dots was one of the main phrases that we heard so much after September 11th and you have just very clearly pointed out some dots that were not connected and it's not just about pointing fingers it's about figuring out what's going on with our system so it doesn't happen again right I'm totally respectful of FBI they're very brave all of our law enforcement military intelligence people deserve our respect but we also have to understand what works and what doesn't look at Benghazi look at the story we told the American people after the attack that absolutely had no bearing on the facts and here's another question when the bomb went off didn't the FBI say to themselves do we have any suspects in the Boston area right that we previously interviewed that may fit this profile and when we got a photo of the older brother how could our system not pick up the fact that he had already been in the system so there's a lot to answer here senator grant do we know that it didn't because that was one of my big questions this morning we don't do we know mate perhaps it did perhaps facial recognition at maybe at the FBI the second they saw that that photograph and before it was released to us maybe they were already on to him do we know well why would you put his photo out saying do you know no I don't I don't buy that I mean when they were asked by CBS and Fox the FBI after the attack have you ever had any contact with either one of the brothers they said no it was only after the mother's interview where she talked about the FBI following the older son did did they tell us that they had him in the system something's not right here I don't want to be judgmental but I want to make sure that we're safe yeah between Benghazi and Boston we're going backward in national security this administration is letting letting its guard down and it is beginning to show is that what it is you know it is it a different mood in this in this administration because I go back to the Patriot laws and five searches and all the things that should it be able to be able to kick in in a situation like this if the Russian government has alerted us to someone shouldn't we be able to you know watch their cell phones watch their computer activity shouldn't all that be going on if you google terrorists you're going to find the older brother on the web youtube videos of him declaring war on us and we're Christian nation were infidels how could the FBI after the interview in 2011 not pick up the traffic where this guy's visiting radical websites this administration has a hard time embracing we're at war with radical Islam he should be nationally security interrogated you know he's got a lawyer he deserves all the protections of a citizen in federal court he can't be tried by military commission because the citizens are excluded but he's a prime candidate for enemy combatant status and contrary to what some people say American citizens have been held as enemy combatants for decades in this country when they sided with the enemy this idea of interviewing him through a lawyer makes no sense thank you so much more to talk about we hope you'll come back thank you I will thank you

right now is Connecticut Democratic congressman jim heintz and Pia Carusone executive director for Americans for Responsible solutions and a former aide to congresswoman Gabby Giffords it is nice to have you both your congressman I want to start with you describe for us what the mood has been in Connecticut as we approach this one year mark what it means for not just the families but the overall community of Sandy Hook elementary school of Newtown sure well obviously for those of us that were particularly close to Newtown this one year anniversary is a heartbreaking reminder of an inconceivable day a year ago and of course many of us know the families who once again are gonna have to revisit what they went through a year ago and for people like like Pia and and me it's a frustrating thing it's a frustrating thing that we haven't been able to go to those families not just those families but to other victims the you know 30,000 Americans that have died since then as a result of gun violence and say you know we made real and meaningful progress towards making for a safe stay for United States right here in the United States Senate where I'm standing right now you know universal background checks the idea that if you're going to exercise your second Amendment rights we're gonna make sure you're not violent or a terrorist but that couldn't get through the federal government something supported by ninety percent of Americans it's a source of real frustration it seems there are a lot of Commons things where people are missing out on P I know your organization has just put out a new powerful PSA in honor of the Newtown victims as someone who runs a gun reform gun safety type of group your relationship with Congressman Gabby Giffords helped inspire that for you but for Americans and for people that are using the example of Gabby difference or the Aurora movie Massacre or Newtown if these major moments in our nation's history on a catalyst to move the needle what is well that's the question everyone's been asking but we feel very optimistic to tell you the truth that mean we're disappointed that that Congress wasn't able to address this this year but we're very hopeful i think the trim the national trends in this country show that americans want their elected officials to address the growing problem of gun violence they want some to be able to listen to them that and Americans are saying we can own guns and we can be for responsible gun safety measures they're not mutually exclusive mark and Gaby own guns and here we are advocating for stronger laws let me make a great point there they are gun-rights supporters and they have been very vocal about that you would think that someone that's gone through something as horrific as they have gone through and come out the other side of it might have a different interpretation of what our constitutional right means on that front congressman as you know Colorado is joining Connecticut is several other safe they quickly passed stronger and smarter gun control laws since Newtown the State the Department of Public Safety says it's new background checks law prevented 72 criminals from buying a gun oh why can't even a modest measure on that front seemed to pass through Congress sir well I think I think it's really important that we talk about gun safety in a way that allows us to have conversations with people that if what if if it becomes an emotionally over heated discussion about somebody taking away your constitutional rights pretty soon you get to a place where you can't find common ground the fact of the matter is and part of the reason so frustrating is that there is huge common ground around certain common sensical things you know we talked about checking everybody to make sure that they're not violent or a terrorist or a criminal prior to buying a weapon this of course is supported by the vast majority of Americans things like saying hey you know what I admire and support and will fight for your second Amendment right but that probably doesn't include the right to have a weapon which is really designed for the military to kill an awful lot of people very quickly if you have the specific conversation in a rational and an open way now you get a reasonable dialogue going unfortunately here in Washington DC there are people who succeed by making sure that that rational conversation never happens that it's all about taking away a god-given constitutional right and of course that's that's it that's not a helpful conversation for anybody in this country I want to say thanks to both of your Congressman Jim Heintz that Connecticut PA kind of song former aide the congresswoman Gabby Giffords

and uh we appreciate your time you're always trying to make it a point to stop by the show and thank you thank you for that um can we turn on the congressman's microphone here baymax thank you we uh the story here of this charles edwards guy the inspector general homeland security who was cozying up to the very people that he was supposed to be keeping an eye on this is uh in napolitano's uh administration jay johnson puts him on what is he on administrative leave right now yeah i mean this is the inspector general is the kind of internal watchdog right for the department of homeland security allegations have come out that instead of being an objective independent investigator he was actually sort of cozying up to the officials that he was actually investigating himself so shocking this is a serious misconduct allegation something that my committee will be holding oversight hearings on to get to the bottom of what happened and if these allegations are true not only should he be put on leave he should be fired and possibly prosecuted for we seem to have a hard time getting people fired or having people fired in in this administration i mean in my view there's a lot of people that ought to have been fired yeah but uh yeah that was a shock it's kind of like the you know the it's like the fox guard the hen house he's supposed to be the watchdog so this is it's a serious allegation we're going to get to the bottom of it let's talk a little bit about uh oil and gas and right now you and i were talking about this off the air and i think most people in houston are probably aware of this um there is an embargo we're not allowed to export um crude and natural gas correct yeah it's in certain parts of the world you know what's happening you hear a lot about ukraine and russia the baltic states i think mr putin is a bit of a power grab to return to the old empire the russian empire right um and and uh he sees that you know weakness invites aggression and i think he sees this president's weak and it's an invitation to move in and expand and so the the one power that he has over this region is energy he can strangle ukraine the baltic states they all uh rely on the energy coming from russia so if we could lift that band the crude oil bien uh in the the natural gas van not only would that create a lot of jobs in texas we have the eagle for shale but it would also be a great national security foreign policy play on the part of the united states so i have a bill i've introduced it'll go to the foreign affairs committee to lift this embargo let this ban so that we can you know hopefully help ukraine help the baltic states become really independent uh from russia and at the same time it would help texas and our economy here as well so to me it's it's a no-brainer i'm sure the administration will find some reason to oppose it sure but it makes good policy from my perspective and and i would agree and i think that a lot of people are curious as to why i think this was back in the 70s when we were going through uh our uh issues with uh with oil that when this was implemented and you're right it is about time that we did something about this and uh you know i i'm amazed at the president's stance obviously we could go on and on about that but here's my my final question on it if your bill passed let's say it you know passes swiftly would that have any effect on the uh the conflict that's currently taking place do you think that would give us more leverage well you know i think it would because again the strength that russia has over this region is they strangle their energy and and so we can help them with loan guarantees but that money eventually just goes back to russia which you know that's that's a bad policy i think you know to to expand our exports of natural gas and crude oil to the region not only helps the united states but it helps that part of the world it helps them be more independent uh from russia's grip that they have over them um so to me that it's a win-win i think putting truths here and all that i think it's it's probably a little late for that i do think again weakness invites aggression reagan talked about peace through strength right this president is viewed as weak throughout the world and mr putin is testing the lines with him and i think it's a very dangerous world right now because of this president congressman i'd love to sit here and chat with you all morning long i appreciate your time as always thank you for what you do as chairman of the homeland uh security and we sure appreciate the hard work and the way you represent texas thank you a great job hey thanks matt it is our pleasure texas congressman mike mccall joining us here this morning stopping by uh speaking of michaels

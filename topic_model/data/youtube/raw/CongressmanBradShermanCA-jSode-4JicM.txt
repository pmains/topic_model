ago we spoke with congressman brad Sherman he actually saw the two threatening emails the Democrat from the San Fernando Valley is on a House Subcommittee on terrorism here's what he had to say the email to Los Angeles the author claims that he will be joined by 32 accomplices and I thought that was not terribly credible because i can't imagine that you could have 33 jihadists working together and the federal government wouldn't even hear any chatter or raise its threat level but the email that went to New York the author claimed that he had a hundred and thirty-eight accomplices 138 quote comrades and so that had well less way less credibility New York City was pretty quick to determine that this was a hoax they said it was pretty obvious as this was a hoax Commissioner Bratton there in New York City saying that there was an overreaction do you think we may have overreacted in this instance well there were there was the key difference i just described it's one thing to see a claim of 32 accomplices it's another thing to see a claim of 138 accomplices second we in Los Angeles have just lived through San Bernardino and that obviously has a bigger effect on people's decision-making and a bigger effect on what might actually be happening Larry heard it that was his big the difference was number of in the LA email 32 jihadi accomplices were mentioned but in the New York email 138 accomplices and that's crazy so they determined that otherwise they're identical sorry

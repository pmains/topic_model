raised on farming true and my father grandfather great-grandfather were all southern Minnesota farmers livestock and grain farmers and so I have a deep appreciation of Hill an understanding of Agriculture the people had talked with in Washington I've already asked them they deficit you probably don't get this request too often but I want to be on the Agriculture Committee because it's very critical to southern Minnesota and our way of life agriculture is a national security issue sustaining Agriculture's that work where would we be today that we have import our food the way we import our oil and other products we'd be in trouble we'd be paying more we'd have less quality would be relying on nations in many cases that we don't get along too well with sustaining agriculture is critical to our economic opportunities in this world district yes in Rochester the Mayo Clinic they're doing pretty good some of the other cities like Mankato they're doing pretty good but the rural areas are struggling and when I was talking about before like what people are talking about a lot of our farmers and agribusinesses have been a recession for many years going back to the middle of the Obama administration we need to get rid of these regulations that are hamstringing agriculture driving up costs we need to have a tax code that makes more sense than they're working on it and the right direction with some technical Corrections need to be made Obamacare as I said that farm test is the biggest issue of Agriculture because when farmers aren't making money you ask them to spend 25 grand on premiums that are so ridiculous that the deductibles are high and the insurance is worthless they don't know that doesn't work and also in energy we have to have an energy policy that keeps prices low so that's my background in agriculture mine and my reasons for why I want to run for Congress Missouri's

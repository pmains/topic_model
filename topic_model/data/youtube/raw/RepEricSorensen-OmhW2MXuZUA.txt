representative Eric Sorensen how does that feel all right to hear that right um it's different but um but I'm the same person that people have gotten to know and trust over the years so in fact I ran into a lady in the airport she said do I have to call you Mr Sorensen now and I said absolutely not we've had a relationship before and she was just a viewer right I said call me Eric yeah exactly when did it hit you though was it election night was it when you saw the plaque at your office or dropped the Box off what when did it sort of like really land um I think it's it was the first time that I walked into the Chamber of the House of Representatives um it was when I learned that there have only been 12 000 people who have ever been able to call themselves Americans of all of the people only 12 000 people have been able to work in the Capitol Building there have been ten thousand members of the House of Representatives in only 2 000 senators and that my community has trusted me to be one yeah that must be an overwhelming feeling as well it is because there's still a lot to learn right it's it's a new job so it's making sure that we have the team in place not only in Washington to work on the legislation uh but that we have the team in place here in the Quad Cities to make sure that we're meeting the needs of the constituents as people make the phone call and say hey I need help on my social security or I need help with the VA or I need help with Medicare that we're able to help them we were talking before our interview started just about how it is a news job there's a lot to learn is it is it a fire hose of information coming at you because I imagine you prepare for the job but do you really know everything that you need to know and and everything that you don't know essentially what's really interesting for me the process of being the candidate was the toughest part because not only did I need the coach but I needed the teacher I needed the coach to help me understand what we're doing and then the teacher to say the why but I'll tell you the most interesting thing or one of the most interesting things about going to Congress is the fact that the House of Representatives is a really really cool place because this is the place where people all over the country elect their particular Representatives so you know we've got doctors we've got pediatricians we've got bookkeepers we've got a woman who's an auto mechanic in southern Washington we have a meteorologist so they're people from all different walks of life all socioeconomic backgrounds and all geographies I'll put in one place and all learning the same thing together and that's pretty remarkable let's talk a little bit about swearing in day right um I don't necessarily want to ask you this question well Dave yeah I guess so um from a Democrat versus Republican perspective but from a brand new person in Congress who probably had an idea of what to expect and then it went a little bit differently um you're watching that what are you seeing what are you kind of thinking to yourself and and what are you doing kind of in the background there one of the things that I did during this process this almost week-long process of of getting a speaker of the house my perspective being someone who is new I went and talked with the people that had been there for a long time to be able to ask you know Congressman steny Hoyer you know what does this mean to you um you've worked here for a long time you know I kind of played the role as the reporter asking the questions and it was that this was completely on our Orthodox but also another thing is you know I wanted to know on the other side of the aisle what people were thinking about what was going on and one of the great things in the in the month-long time that I've been in Congress I've gotten to get to know people from the other side of the aisle the moderate Republicans that want to get stuff done and and all they wanted to do in that week was to get the speaker so that we can get the Committees to get to work when you're having those conversations um I think folks are going to think that maybe there is this divide um and that it can be very contentious and I imagine it can be but is there also a lot of working together maybe in the background that you've experienced so far right I think we saw a little bit of that so after the 117th Congress ended and the 118th began C-SPAN was allowed to show the different camera angles and you actually got to see on the floor of the house some of the conversations that happened that we would never have known about that congresswoman ocasio-cortez and Matt Gates do have conversations just because it's a democratic cloakroom does not mean that a republican can't come in there and be welcomed and that we do have friendships with people on the other side of the aisle I think that's one of the things that people don't understand but also that's one of the things that makes me optimistic in a time where you know we've got this divide did government right it seems like we're doing this I think it gives us an opportunity to work together and maybe that's the best thing that we need let's talk about your committee appointments right um how was that process and sort of raising your hand and saying Hey I want to be part of these and and what's your voice going to be in those committees uh well first things first my voice in the Committees are be are going to be to make sure you know Congress holds the keys you know the purse strings we've got to make sure that we've got an advocate in Washington that is going to bring the funds back home and that's first and foremost we've got to make sure that we're resilient going forward and then to select two committees that are going to have the direct impact on the people who live here so number one my background as a meteorologist needed to be to be on science space science and technology to be able to sit at the table as we do the research to find the solutions to the problems that we have today and then to be able to bring those back home so when we talk about sustainability it's not just sustainability in an environment it's sustainability for jobs it's sustainability for agriculture so going into the agriculture committee you know the fact that you know John Deere is located right here there was a reason why John Deere moved to the headquarters of his company from Grand detour to Moline in 1848. it was because we've got the power to get it done here and so being a part of the agriculture committee we've got a farm bill coming up we've got to make sure that the things that are in the farm bill are going to affect us positively right here at home yeah I wanted to ask you about that I mean that's just a huge piece of legislation we could spend a whole day talking about it and still probably not completely understand it um but Are there specific things that you're going to be looking for in that bill that really are going to affect not only Illinois but the Midwest in general first and foremost for me and this is what I hear from Farmers when I talk with them too I think number one is in order to make a decision on the farm bill we've got to have farmers at the table and that's exactly what we're going to do we'll have Farmers from all over from Central Illinois northern Illinois and Western Illinois um but what I hear from our family Farmers especially is we need to make sure that our crop insurance program is resilient we're seeing too many of these extreme events that happen whether it's the duration thank goodness that the derecho as it moved through Eastern Iowa and Western Illinois and that happened after the Harvest thank goodness but we're seeing downbursts we're seeing tornadoes we're seeing flood and and drought and these are affecting our family Farmers we need to make sure that the solutions are brought back home and that crop insurance is there but also my focus for Farmers has always been to make sure that we give our Farmers what they need to survive it's harder and harder today to be able to grow on the same plot of land that so many family Farmers have had for generations and what I want to be able to do is find out whatever the solution is bring that solution home so that our family farmers can go to bed tonight and sleep well knowing that their kids their grandkids and their kids are going to be able to be right there on that land all right last question for you your time in Congress your term in Congress will go by very quickly right I can only imagine at the end of this term folks are going to have to judge whether you have done your job well how do they measure success I think that's a really great question and one of the I think maybe it's a it's a double-edged sword the fact that Congress the term lasts just two years because certainly by the time we get to through two years I may be just hitting my stride but that's proving to the people of Western Illinois that I'm deserving of the position I I go back and I look a lot at what did Lane Evans do in Western Illinois to earn the trust of the people so many times over he was trustworthy he got things done he stood up for our veterans and so looking at the people that have come by before me you know whether that is representative Shilling whether that is congresswoman Bustos I stand on the shoulders of the people that have come before me and I hope to be able to exceed the expectations that the people sent me to do representative Sorensen thank you for taking time this week

we can talk about the fisheries and some of those people and and how things were affected you know I guess we can't really have that conversation without really thinking about Coastal restoration something that we've really been working hard and fighting hard for many many years tell us a little bit about what's been decided for the support there well you're exactly right that you can't just go build levees anywhere you everywhere you have to look at the role that the coastal wetlands play they're complementary and function we recently had a Bill signed into law that's going to provide about 80 to 120 million dollars a year for Coastal restoration projects in the state of Louisiana and look in in southern lefusion Terrebonne this area has been some of the biggest beneficiaries these Investments whether it's along the fouchon beach camanada Elmer's Island area or uh going over to Whiskey Island we've made some massive investments in fact that uh project at fuchsia Beach over to Elmer's is the largest coastal restoration project in Louisiana history Whiskey Island restoration is the largest bear Island restaurant operation project in Louisiana history so a lot we were talking hundreds of millions of dollars being invested and really excited about being able to have that complement the levees and other flood protection projects we're building yeah and look those barriers make such a huge difference when we do deal with some of these stars but I don't think people realize how it limits uh those flood waters coming in and then how that is complementary to magansa to the gulf protecting us but those Coastal restoration makes a huge difference and just the difference in looking at hurricanes Ida versus Ian you know and and how that you know those those open Waters that just can really make a huge difference as we still think and pray for our friends over in in Florida and what they're dealing with no you're exactly right those Barrier Island serve as the first line of defense they help to break that wave energy and as you said when you have you know miles and miles of open water that just unimpeded then those hurricanes just get stronger the winds get stronger and anything you can do whether it's a coastal forest or Barrow Island to Dune all those things help to break the wave energy and help to break the storm surge you don't want that straight up against the leather absolutely not

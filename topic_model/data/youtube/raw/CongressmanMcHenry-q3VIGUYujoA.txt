this is the oversight and investigation subcommittee on the financial services committee we are pleased to announce begin a hearing entitled who is too big to fail does title two of the dodd-frank act in trying taxpayer-funded bailouts we have a distinguished panel uh three are currently here one is uh enroute and the chair uh without objection the chair is authorized to declare a recess of the subcommittee at any time and the chair would like to announce that the intention is to to adjourn this subcommittee by noon today we have one witness who has to depart by 11 45 and so um and that witness is professor skeel okay who obviously has to catch a flight out so with that i recognize myself for five minutes for the purposes of an opening statement two and a half years ago when dodd-frank was signed into law president obama declared that too big to fail had ended today there seems to be much debate as to whether that is true across the ideological spectrum elected officials members of the media federal reserve presidents and even the chairman of the federal reserve have acknowledged that this problem still persists just this past week chairman bernanke in his speech the federal reserve bank of chicago said quote i think that too big to fail is a very big issue and we will not have completed the goals of financial regulatory excuse me regulatory reform unless we have adequately addressed this issue the administration's attorney general eric holder highlighted the problem from the perspective of prosecuting federal crime testifying in front of the senate he said quote i am concerned the size of some of these institutions becomes so large that it does become difficult for us to prosecute them when we are hit with indications that if you do prosecute it will have a negative impact on the national economy perhaps even the world economy end quote the fact is that dodd-frank did not end too big to fail but instead enshrined it title ii of dodd-frank which created the orderly liquidation authority made government guarantees for systemically important financial institutions explicit the orderly liquidation authority is less than orderly liquidity is provided by the government but it does have enormous authorities within it and it is this explicit guarantee that not only provides an unfair advantage to the biggest and most powerful companies in institutions but in doing so has the potential to seriously distort our marketplace however relatively little has been done uh in terms of the halls of congress and policy makers here in regard to the actual process that takes place within the orderly liquidation authority or ola the competitive advantages that ola provides to large troubled institutions are real and whether these advantages will be applied to save large troubled financial institutions while harming otherwise healthy competitors remains to be seen as well ola imposes a bank restructuring process in lieu of bankruptcy that is intended to allow troubled financial institutions to continue operating while undergoing recapitalization the general idea is that the parent company suffers equity and debt write-downs while the operating subsidiary remains solvent and proceeds with business as usual the fdic calls this the single point of entry process while this process provides attractive benefits such as avoiding a loss of franchise value that often results from a run on a failed bank the benefits of continuity come with an extraordinary great price and a price to the taxpayers and to those who bank with other institutions potentially as well protecting the franchise value requires a bailout while the government provides liquidity to a bridge holding company while exempting it from taxes and potentially exempting it from capital requirements or other regulatory requirements the cost of these subsidies is ultimately backed by attacks on banks and thereby attacks on those that utilize banking services which as we know is clearly passed on to customers in my district and across the country the fdic and treasury their discretion to provide these advantages as paired with the political value of saving a systemically important institution when faced with a failed institution an open wallet from the treasury backed by a bank tax what do we expect the regulators to do to advantage these corporations these new entities or disadvantage them well that's what these are the questions that we have today as reflected in the continued lower cost of borrowing available to to systemically important financial institutions these uh this bailout perpetuates too big to fail and the moral hazard associated with it i recognize that our witnesses have a variety of opinions on this matter and we look forward to their talking through this process to policymakers here so that we can more deeply understand the orderly liquidation authority what that bridge holding company looks like and the terms under which they will operate potentially operate and what the letter the law actually says so i look forward to your testimony i look forward to members questions and getting to a deeper understanding of the orderly liquidation authority within dodd-frank with that i'd now recognize the ranking member uh mr green for five minutes

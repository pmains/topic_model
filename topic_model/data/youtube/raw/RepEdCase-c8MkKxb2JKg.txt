let me start by clearly stating the connection between the overall measures goals of this measure and the provisions within the jurisdiction of natural resources first international trade and commerce includes a plethora of natural resources and that trade in commerce should forward our overall goals and it should be international rules based number two supply chains are just as critical in natural resources trade as any other good in service number three the us has led the world in environmental labor and human rights standards and we cannot allow countries who violate those standards in the extraction exploitation and export of natural resources to benefit economically to the derogation of our standards number four we need to lead in the protection and perpetuation of our natural resources and through our own commercial and trade practices incentivize similar protections on those who do not prioritize our international resources and five natural resources no really no man-made boundaries um the oceans the air the flora and fauna it's all one big world and interconnected in this context and with respect to this measure and china specifically the state department reports that china is one of the worst offenders of any country in the world in key natural resources protections greenhouse gases marine debris illegal unregulated and unreported or iu fishing wildlife

well thank you thank you for being here today as we all know the american people are struggling they're suffering under joe biden and the democrats inflation and why do we have this it's because last march they decided they needed to spend an awful lot of taxpayer money in our economy and we said hey this is going to raise costs for everybody and it has so you fast forward to where we are now the democrats are at it again trying to raise taxes and increase government spending at a time of high inflation and a time of recession a 40-year high of inflation and a lot of that we know is related to energy which is what we're here to talk about today the specific impacts of what the democrats are going to try to do and it's going to raise energy costs for the american families joe biden's trying to take a little victory lap now saying that the price at the pump isn't as sky high as it was earlier so much of inflation is related to energy and what we know is the price of gas today at the pump is still two dollars a gallon more than it was when joe biden took office so there has been a bit of a decrease in demand because people can't afford to drive at five dollars a gallon for gasoline if they've had to change the way they live they drive they work all of those things have had to be changed and what we hear from folks that look at this is that the average family has spent over fifteen hundred dollars in the past year for energy higher than they had the year before all as a result of the policies of joe biden and this administration people know what they want they want energy that is affordable available and reliable we know that the country is already looking at the fact that we may face blackouts as the summer progresses the experts have said about two-thirds of the country is going to be subject to blackouts but that doesn't seem to stop the democrats who want to raise taxes on american energy as well as in energy that we import from overseas they actually have in this bill a fee on every barrel of oil that is imported billions in dollars of increased taxes which will be going to the pain at the pump and remember this is joe biden who just a year ago at the glasgow climate summit in scotland went and asked vladimir putin to produce more russian oil and send to the united states went to iran from oil venezuela from oil and just went hat in hand to saudi arabia saying send us more that will all be taxed at a higher rate imp taxing every barrel more than ever before oh and they've indexed it to inflation so at a time when we have 9.1 percent inflation joe biden and the democrats want to put a tax that's growing at the rate of inflation which is going to make inflation worse that's what these folks are up to so the pain at the pump is going to get worse and it's not just on the cost of energy to drive your car it's also the energy to heat your home energy that powers our country energy for electricity so joe joe manchin has agreed to something that the folks in west virginia and in wyoming said joe manchin what the heck are you thinking it has to do with coal and that's how we have this here coal associations on the manchur schumer bill this is from the west virginia coal association joe manchin's home state why support why support anything chuck schumer joe biden nancy pelosi or john kerry went for coal that's what the people of west virginia are asking their senator joe manchin why why why it is incomprehensible they say why any minor would support the mansion schumer legislation so that's the impact of folks at home the joe manchin apparently is not paying attention to at all so what's the money going to be used for well there's the climate slush funds there's the sorts of things that joe biden ought to be familiar with because when he was president when he was vice president there was a thing called solyndra wasted government money many of these projects and they're going to be loaded into this bill as well under the grand title of one big climate slush fund and then there's all these subsidies for electric vehicles and for rich people for electric vehicles you can make up to three hundred thousand dollars a year for a family full subsidy electric vehicles costing eighty thousand dollars seventy five hundred dollars subsidy i mean that's what we're looking at here at a time when the families of this country are hurting inflation is eating into people's paychecks people are very concerned about their future and even if wages are going up a little they're falling further and further behind the families of america are each month as joe biden's been president because costs have gone up so high the democrats are going to make it worse if they're able to pass this reckless tax and spending bill

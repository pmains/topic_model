thank you very much mr. chairman I think it's important that these two subcommittees meet together this morning this hearing that deals with the review of the implementation of the federal farm and disaster program is fitting and appropriate given the challenges that we're facing today in farm country and for all of the members that are participating I thank you I also want to note that it was important that chairman Peterson clarify the history and the record as it relates to these activities that were most recently involved with the continuing resolution that we need to pass this week and that we need to obviously have a budget because frankly it's irresponsible to shut down government I've always felt it's irresponsible and past actions by previous congresses to do just that for political agendas is inappropriate period and and and certainly I think the president learned that lesson the hard way last year at least I hope he did the history of the CCC which as the chairman Peterson pointed out is is really not known by the majority of members of Congress until this last week is important to note because frankly we should not be politicizing this it's not the part of this committee I I my sense is it really came from the Senate as well but we have to deal with it so what we're dealing with today is to talk about where the safety net is where's the safety net for farmers and ranchers and dairy people across this country and as this chairman of the Subcommittee on livestock I'm very interested in overseeing that the new dairy margin coverage program that we worked so hard on and the reauthorization of the last farm bill and the administration's market facilitation program is properly implemented and that's why we have the secretary here today in part the dairy margin coverage signup for 2019 was set to end tomorrow now I think it's important that we give dairy men and women every opportunity to sign up for this program we'll be asking the secretary where we are in terms of that signup and whether or not your numbers kind of coincide with the numbers that I've heard I hope there can be a little bit of flexibility with that deadline tomorrow this year given that we have a brand new program and but at the same time I know you get the challenge because we get the sign up for the 2020 program so I am sympathetic to the challenge that the department is facing in that instance but if and toughen dairy country across the the land we know the large fluctuations in and and the amount of dairies that have gone bankrupt and and have been sold in every region of America and we certainly have lost our fair share in California I know during men and women that have been there for generations that now find themselves having to sell the dairy and it's tough and it has economic Ram of cases and the communities where those dairies have been nationwide though the program I think in terms of success is triggered I'm total for a billion dollars and help a quarter of a billion excuse me let me correct that a quarter of a billion dollars in help to dairy farmers throughout the country and that's good that's obviously what the intention was I have a difference with the administration with the President on this tariff war I've been clear about that the president has said that farmers are better off with market facilitation program payments and they were with the access they had to China before the trade war I think in the u.s. MCA we made some headway with Canada on that section seven I can tell you the dairy markets very important in for California and Mexico beat yet when I talked to farmers it's not just my disagreement with this that no one wins a tariff war because everybody has leverage but farmers in California are feeling the pain of it and they they agree they think that it's important that they have access to markets and they maintain those markets and they're very fearful when we lose these markets because of this current trade war we may never regain them and that is a concern I have so the market facilitation program and how those monies are used for the payments really don't come close so I mean the example in dairy 12 since per hundredweight I mean you're getting 16 to 18 dollars per hundredweight 12 cents you know it's in the margins mace stave off a bankruptcy or foreclosure by a bank for a certain time period but 12 cents per hundredweight is not good and I save it Airy so I don't know what the USDA leadership thinks I'm interested I've got a few questions and how the market facilitation program was set up and how you're implementing it the Chairman develop thank you for agreeing to host this joint hearing with being secretary Northy Europe got a farm background you know how it difficult it is there in farm country and we appreciate your participation here this morning to give us a sense of of with your testimony where we're going with this

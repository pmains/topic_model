now we want to go now to Capitol Hill to get the Democratic perspective on all these revelations congressman Brad Schneider's joining us live congressman thank you very much for joining us here on the world right now I want to get your thoughts to this bombshell to these email exchange that we've seen from Donald Trump jr. how worried are you if you're worried at all about what you've seen today no I think these are the female change the news coming out is a real concern I think the fact that it is clear that the Russians tried to interfere in our elections but all of our intelligence agencies have confirmed that the president continues to question that and now we're seeing evidence of emails between the president's son and people reporting to have connections with the Russian government there's something we should be very concerned about and why it's so important to have these investigations follow to their conclusion we have senator Tim Kaine in the last few minutes day was potentially treason would you go that far I think we have to let the investigations go to their extent and see where it leads it those are questions of law I think we can all agree regardless of your party that what we're seeing is wrong and the fact that the President signed Donald Trump jr. believed it was the right thing to do to meet with someone who was purportedly representing the Russian government bringing evidence against his opponent as we have seen in previous campaigns that would be reasons to call the FBI in this case it was reasons to set up a meeting and that's really concerning we heard from Donald Trump jr. basically saying that nothing came out of that meeting we had a similar statements from Kellyanne Conway who said yesterday in an interview here on CNN with our Chris Cuomo that nothing came out of that meeting does this change anything well I think we've seen from the administration's spokespeople for the administration family members of the president that what they say today is it could be easily contradicted tomorrow and so the reason we have an independent investigator and Robert Mueller the reason we need to have the investigations on the Senate and the House sides to understand everything that the Russians tried to do so it can't happen again it's a threat to our democracy that the very foundations of our government but we also need to understand what involvement if any the administration the campaign and the President may have had and let these investigations go to their conclusion what does this mean for the President of the United States well that's where the investigation will lead us this is a obviously a very concerning moment and again it's not a part shouldn't be a partisan issue every Americans should be worried about the integrity of our elections and any country trying to undermine that the Russians clearly have done so the president has refused to to say whether he believes that or not in definitive terms and now we're seeing at least evidence of the president's son reaching out to people saying they have connections with the Russian government to try to bolster the Trump campaign this brings a lot of things into question I think the investigation will ultimately I hope show us what the facts are is it possible that president from would not know about this meeting well that's what they're saying and again we're going to let the investigation prove that it's hard to believe that a venn candidate who was his own press secretary was so involved with every aspect of his campaign would not have been aware of a meeting that included his son his son-in-law and his then campaign manager but that's what they're saying again I'm concerned about the willingness of the Trump campaign Donald Trump jr. to sit down and and meet with people who were saying they represented the Russian government he should have called the FBI not called the meeting room well in the last few hours we have seen the government basically delayed August recess how damaging are these emails and the impact you may have on the White House and indeed its ability to govern is anything being done well I think you know there are so many things we need to address we don't have a jobs bill we don't have an and we're not getting to the important issues of fixing the Affordable Care Act or addressing comprehensive tax reform comprehensive immigration reform and the news orling around the president is unfortunately consuming all of all of the air not just on TV but in Washington we need to really do the people's work and get down to business to address the issues we face to grow our economy to help working families to make sure that we are protecting America's leadership role in the world and unfortunately what the news we're seeing and the response coming out the administration that's getting put to the backburner congressman Brad Schneider thank you very much for joining us here was great to get your perspective Issa thank you it's good talking with you likewise well that was a democratic perspective and president Trump's biggest supporters have always hit back harder reports of questionable meetings that actions regarding Russia but this is no reporters directly from Trump jr. himself so how are Trump supporters responding now we'll get the reaction from Jeffrey Lord and his late

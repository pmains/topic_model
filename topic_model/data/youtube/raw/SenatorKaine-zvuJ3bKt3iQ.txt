hey with his head we got remember the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committee Democratic senator Tim Kaine of Virginia he's long called for Congress to vote on a war authorization against Isis that's just not happening is it why not you know joing bottom line Congress would rather just criticize the president and say you don't have a strategy or this is going wrong or that's going wrong but they don't want to be held accountable have the hearing pepper the witnesses with questions and then vote yes or no and it sadly is bipartisan in both houses so I have not been able to yet convince my colleagues this is a word that tactically we're doing what we need to do but congress hasn't authorized the war in second in Syria we've got some major international law questions I think about the yellow war well the thing is senator we also though I mean when you start talking about strategy nobody can answer the big question I mean we can't as a nation answer the big question Congress can't and that is do you have the leader of Syria stay or go right right you know that that was an ambivalence right early I think President Obama my intuition is that he wishes he had the words Assad must go back right because it really isn't up to the United States to set the terms for who the leader of another country is could we say Assad is a war criminal we're going to file you know complaints against Assad and that Hague I mean there's all kinds of things you can say about his war crimes as barbarous activities but to say Assad must go the US can't set the terms really the problem is though how do you go into a country where somebody has committed the war crimes that Assad is committed and continues to commit bombs and Doctors Without Borders Hospital yep last night I mean it's it's on the front page of all the papers it puts us in a terrible position I agree with you we can't decide who's going to stay who's going to go though Bill Clinton and a lot of Republicans Democrats did in the 1990s in the Balkans but how do we even start without being able answer that big question here was a you know here was a fork in the road where I think we made the wrong turn we could still do it in february2014 the UN Security Council passed a resolution that called for cross-border delivery of humanitarian aid into Syria without Assads permission that we could do that the world community at that point should have set up a humanitarian safe zone in northern Syria and we would call it a humanitarian zone this is for you if you're fleeing Assad ISIL or collar or hunger you can come here and you're going to be safe and oh by the way if anybody messes with you we're going to have military assets to protect this humanitarian zone that the UN is why didn't we do it you know I think there was a reluctance to use military assets to protect it at that point it would have been a lot simpler because the issues since then between the Kurds and the Turks and what the Russian engagement has made that real estate more complicated but look there's still 8 million displaced Syrians inside Syria who could leave tomorrow four million of left why any more family we still made to a safe zone there it's heavy this is this is not only a crisis in Syria it's not only a regional Crisis it's now a crisis for Europe it is a crisis across the globe why can't we create a the world community create a safe center for these refugees to return on look there wasn't a commitment to use the military assets to protect the humanitarian mission but now we're using military a slice to battle so you know this was something I mean I'll say we were talking at the break about Senator McCain the Armed Services chair he was calling for this in 2013 and I wasn't convinced until the UN Security Council passed the resolution Russia didn't veto it we were smart enough to put it on the table during the sochi winter olympics and russia was worried about being an apologist right for Assad's brutality when everybody was watching him so they accepted the resolution and at that point we had an international legal predicate to do this and it we would have probably kept a couple million people in Syria have we done it for people watching at home right now if you can boil it down and say the American strategy in Syria is blank how do you explain it well we here's what I'd say but then it's not as clear as it should be i'll tell you why not it is it is basically to shrink the ISIL battle space and that's been succeeding in both Iraq and Syria the real estate that they were gaining is shrinking that's good and it's continue to put pressure on them to shrink their battle space and defeat them the problem is ISIL now knows their days on the battlefield or numbered so what they're deciding to do is ok we are numbered on the battlefield so let's just bomb an airliner in the I are going to Brussels are going to Paris or angkor Istanbul they're moving all around because they know the battlefield space is shrinking and the the reason that we haven't really gotten to the strategies how do you get to a strategy on something like this that's why a congressional war declaration is important the president comes and has to make the case and usually poses an authorization and Congress doesn't accept what the president proposes Congress puts the State Department and military witnesses in the dock ask some tough questions takes the president's originally proposed authorization and changes it President Bush presented one authorization after nine eleven Congress didn't pass it they ended up changing it that's how you work on a strategy and you do it with the American public watching so that eventually when Congress votes the American public had been brought into what's at stake we haven't done it because Congress just wants to you know flyspeck the president say you're not doing it right but boy don't ask us to go yes or no it's a it's like a you know hide under the table our president street the war powers act like optional suggestion and not in a serious way is your candidate in this race Hillary Clinton going to treat Congress a co-equal branch with more respect regarding War Powers in the current President does if she would here's my gut feeling about we haven't talked about this she was a senator she was a Santos Barack Obama why how about talking to her about it before she was she was a senator and I think she gets the prerogatives of this in look senator President Obama and I talked about this too and when I'm pounding on in about war authorization sometimes the staff gets mad at me but he'll say to me look I was a senator I know what you mean but but you know maybe I'm focused on this stuff because it was Virginians like Madison and others who put this into the Constitution we are so radical by by having a system of government where we're not supposed to be at war without a vote of Congress throughout human history and still in the world wars for the king or the prince or the President or the monarch or the Emperor here it's supposed to be only initiated by Congress but both parties both houses for a very long way I try to get a commitment from Hillary Clinton before she might get elected president to treat it differently than the passport I have a high degree of confidence and somebody like her who's been an armed services member and also the nation's chief diplomat

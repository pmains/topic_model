hi congressman tracy mann from kansas big first district joining you for my washington dc office i've been home in kansas over the last week had a really good time doing a lot of things one of the things i most enjoyed was veterans day activities on thursday you know it's i'm so grateful to all of our veterans the men and women that have fought for our country that have really given us our freedoms and laid it on the line for us the least we could do is celebrate them i also i don't know i were able to take the kids to the k-state versus west virginia football game on saturday which was a lot of fun as well i want to talk about a few things happening here in washington one of these vaccine mandates and i've said this many times i strongly oppose these vaccine mandates at the end of the day it's about freedom right and as government grows freedom shrinks and when freedom grows government shrinks and these mandates are an absolute growth of government really glad to see the court of appeals basically issue a stay on the vaccine requirement that impacts people that have employees of 100 or more so there's currently a stay issued on that where hopefully that stay remains in place we will see meanwhile we're pushing back with legislation speaking out on the floor in committee and in many many other ways against these backseat mandates we'll see what happens there the other thing that's going to be happening this week is going to be front and center is going to be this reconciliation bill also called the bbb some call to build back better i call it bad bad bad because this is horrible policy and two weeks ago uh when i was here and the bill first came out we went through it and uh and really highlighted a lot of the worst things i'd say the more you look at this the more you realize how bad it is 1.75 trillion dollars uh it would provide 79 billion dollars to hire more than 80 000 more irs agents which which is is a step in the wrong direction and would only serve to grow government it offers amnesty to two people that came to the country illegally it also does not have the height amendment so you have 2466 pages but what it doesn't have is the height amendment and the height of minute is what prevents taxpayer-funded abortions so this bill is bad bad bad the cbo which stands for the congressional budget office they are currently scoring it which means they're going through it to see what it would actually cost once they're done with their work and potentially come before the floor of the house uh we'll strongly oppose and do everything we can do to uh kill this bill so more to come there also know wednesday night really excited to have a teletown hall that we'll be hosting here in my office and we're really going to focus on veterans being that veteran's day is this month um so we look forward to hearing veterans um feel free to call in we'll have a couple of folks join us a special guest who are veterans as well so look forward to seeing everybody on wednesday night thanks a lot

and the former two-term governor is here live in our studio this morning along with Jackie for his post primary day perspective I know bright and early first thing after election day or trooper for being here at six in the morning thank you again so how do you feel about Cynthia dill and Charlie somewheres winning last night well I think it certainly clarifies things we now know you know who the opponents are and they're both abled people and I think we're going to have a good vigorous debate and that's what the whole process is supposed to be all about over the past of several months this campaign as well as the other campaigns have filed with the the Federal Election Commission a series of detailed financial reports this is based upon federal law going back to 1907 the essence of this is amounts have to be reported and identification of donors have to be reported all this changed about two years ago with the decision of the United States Supreme Court that's characterized as the Citizens United case the result over the past two years has been a tidal wave a tidal wave of money mostly anonymous flowing into campaigns across the United States so this morning I have sent a letter to all of the other candidates proposing that we enter into a similar agreement to that which has been agreed upon of in Massachusetts where Elizabeth Warren and Scott Brown in a hotly contested vigorously hard-fought campaign for the United States Senate made an agreement that appears to be holding thus far that they are going to disavow an actively discouraged so-called third party or independent expenditures in their campaign for the United States Senate yesterday I had a press conference talking about citizens united and tried to make an effort to keep the anonymous you know big money third party unaccountable money out of man but after it was over one of the reporters said well you're talking about politics and shouldn't you be talking about policy and I said no no this is policy this is policy the unaccountable money and the fact that our Senate and our Congress doesn't work we could have the world's best health care plan we could all sit around a table and work it out but if the Senate doesn't work it doesn't go anywhere people are going to say oh you can't do anything they're all Republicans and Democrats they won't talk to you they won't cooperate you'll never get anything done well I see people here who remember in 94 when they said exactly the same thing well it did work why did it work because we were civil because we listened because we brought people together I just feel the Democrat bodies left me rather than we're leaving the Democrat box so i want to see somebody go down there and change

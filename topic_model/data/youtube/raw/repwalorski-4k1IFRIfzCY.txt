i believe every person born or unborn deserves dignity and respect i'm congresswoman jackie wolorski and i stand with all pro-life americans in defending the sanctity of life and fighting for the most vulnerable among us as we mark 48 years since roe v wade we have to keep working to protect innocent lives and oppose efforts to roll back the progress we've already made sadly the new administration and the leadership in congress are committed to a radical agenda that devalues life and denies the humanity of precious unborn babies but i'm as dedicated as ever to the fight for life that's why soon i'll be reintroducing the dignity for aborted children act to require the dignified burial or cremation of aborted fetal remains with a strong reporting requirement to hold abortion providers accountable americans from every corner of the nation are celebrating life and lending their voices to the voiceless i stand with them for the idea that every human life is a gift from god i pray that through compassion and service to others we can foster a culture of life and i renew my commitment to protecting the sanctity of life preventing the use of taxpayer dollars to fund abortions and defending the inherent dignity of every person born or unborn

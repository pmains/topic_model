thank you very much mr. chairman and thank you so much for leading the way on this historic investment in the American people and our American economy this bill is an important investment in our nation's infrastructure from highways to rail to transit but it is so much more than that it helps us meet our responsibilities combat combat the urgent threat of climate change it lifts up our tribal communities who for too long have endured roads that represent developing world conditions it will expand public transportation options from buses to rail and to help everyday Americans get to work to school to the grocery store and importantly it is a long-term investment in my home state of Arizona and let me tell you how the invest Act includes a significant boost for the tribal transportation program and important changes to the nationally significant federal and tribal project program that allow for dedicated funding to make it easier for tribes to access these funds for infrastructure needs and it supports tribal self-determination and governance by establishing the office of tribal government affairs to carry out these programs I push for each of these priorities on behalf of tribes in my state and across the country and I appreciate the fact that our Chairman included them in this bill this will empower tribes across the nation and improve the lives of our tribal citizens in positive and meaningful ways this bill also invests in infrastructure essential to Arizona such as the interstate 11 which will connect Phoenix metro area to Las Vegas which are right now the only two major metropolitan areas in the United States not connected by an interstate the invest Act supports significant funding for transit so that we continue to build out the light rail system in Phoenix and it helps support our high-performing transit districts by increasing set aside for small transit intensive cities program to help communities like Flagstaff and serve the residents of northern Arizona and finally it supports the effort to make infrastructure construction in Arizona more sustainable and ensure supply materials are available to support our growing population I am grateful that it incorporates my legislation to require dotd to establish a working group to evaluate the availability of transportation related construction materials like aggregates and recommend options for continued access to these important resources this bill addresses many vital needs but there is one area I hope we can address in the future and that's the challenge that Ropin rapidly-growing states like Arizona faced under the current funding formula under the bill the formula is tied to the 2009 allocations which are tied to the formulas under the safetea-lu passed in 2005 which were based off the 2000 census data and traffic volumes from that period that disproportionately impact states like Arizona and the Phoenix metro region which has the highest population growth in the country tying these 20-year old population numbers to investments for the next five years hinders our ability to tackle our infrastructure needs so I appreciate that the investment Act takes a step forward on this by directing the federal highway administration to study the formula federal funding formulas must reflect current changing populations so that fast-growing states and regions like the district that I represent can best meet their infrastructure needs from these growth challenges again Thank You chairman DeFazio for your leadership on this bill and the incredible work of your great staff I yield back

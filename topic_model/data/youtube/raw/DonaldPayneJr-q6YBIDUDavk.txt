so in closing I just like to thank the gentlelady Robin Kelly for her leadership and leading tonight's Congressional Black Caucus our these special orders give us the opportunities to speak directly to the American people about the work on their behalf and the issues that we care about this is something that we do and we are honored to be able to do it also like to thank the people at home that are tuned in tonight and I hope it is our point to engage ongoing and meaningful dialogue and I hope that we will continue to join us on Monday nights we began by discussing the nomination of Loretta Lynch as the next US Attorney General miss Lynch's nomination has been slow walked by the Republicans would rather make it more about the president's immigration policy than about mrs. Lynch's qualifications and strength of character miss Lynch has earned a number of outside endorsements including the International Association of Chiefs of Police and her record is impeccable it is the hope of this caucus that the full Senate comes to realize the urgency of her nomination and confirms her immediately miss Lynch's professional record suggests that she will embrace a vision of the Department of Justice whose mission is to advance the cause of justice and equality for all Americans this is absolutely critical to the african-american community who needs whose knees are not currently being met by our criminal justice system today we see criminal justice the criminal justice system that does not treat all black lives as though they matter from Staten Island the Ferguson unarmed black men have been the victims of excessive deadly force by law enforcement this creates and perpetuates a distrust in our communities and it makes it increasingly difficult to have a meaningful dialogue but law enforcement and our communities they are charged with protecting these negative perceptions of police treatment are compounded by a number of other factors including the disturbing gaps in incarceration rates african-americans are incarcerated at a rate that is seven times higher than our white counterparts these individuals are removed from the workforce often for drug-related crimes during their prime working years they struggle to reenter society having difficulty finding jobs and becoming productive members of their communities instead of immediately incarcerating those who commit drug-related non-violent crimes more effort should be devoted to rehabilitation at the same time we need to reevaluate the effectiveness of the war on drugs awarded disproportionately affects african-americans and devastates african-american and minority communities and when ex-felons reenter society we need to ensure that our criminal justice system of voice purely punitive measures against them including ex felon disenfranchisement finally reform of our criminal justice system is eliminating disparities in sentences according to the National Urban League mandatory minimums and disparities in crack cocaine sentencing incarcerated countless numbers of African Americans for an inhumane length of time and have the US the world leader in prison population this has created a modern-day caste system in America when we address these issues we will make significant progress toward a criminal justice system that reflects our values of full equality for all Americans and mr. speaker with that I yield back the balance of my time

I heard Congress to reject the bill that would expand concealed carry permits across the 50 states we have a real problem with gun violence in this country that needs to be addressed this will only make it worse every state has its own set of rules and regulations for who can get a concealed weapons permit in some states do not have very good standards what this bill would do is it would force every state in the Union to be subject to the lowest standards set by any other state that is here responsible the state should have the right to decide who has a concealed carry permit and who does not this is not a place for Congress to step in and make our country even more dangerous and more subject to gun violence I hope Congress will reject this bill this week I'm gonna vote no and I urge all my colleagues to do the same

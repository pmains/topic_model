N RESULTS EVEN AFTER THE  INSURRECTION. NOW, IN THE CLIP, HIRSCHMAN ASKS EASTMAN IF HE IS OUT OF HIS  EFFING MIND. JOINING ME NOW, A MEMBER OF THE  SELECT COMMITTEE, DEMOCRATIC  CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF FROM  CALIFORNIA. HE'S ALSO THE CHAIR OF THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. REPRESENTATIVE SCHIFF, WE'RE SO  HAPPY YOU'RE HERE. THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE IT. >> GREAT TO BE WITH YOU.  >> SO JOHN EASTMAN IS THE  CONSERVATIVE LAWYER WHO TRIED TO PRESSURE PENCE TO OVERTURN THE  ELECTION, AS YOU KNOW. WILL YOU BE ABLE TO PROVE THAT  TRUMP WAS BEHIND THIS CAMPAIGN? >> WELL, YOU KNOW, I THINK WE  CERTAINLY ARE PRESENTING  EVIDENCE THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS  THE ARCHITECT OF THIS WHOLE LOT  PLOTT TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION  WITH ITS DIFFERENT ELEMENTS,  ELEMENTS THAT INCLUDED ALL THE  LITIGATION, THE BIG LIE THAT  DROVE IT ALL, A PRESSURE  CAMPAIGN ON STATE AND LOCAL  OFFICIALS, AND, AS YOU'LL SEE  LATER THIS WEEK, THE PRESSURE  CAMPAIGN ON THE VICE PRESIDENT. HE WAS OBVIOUSLY PART AND PARCEL OF THAT ISSUE IN HIS OWN TWEETS  GOING OUT TO THE MALL TO  PRESSURE THE VICE PRESIDENT. SO THE EVIDENCE, MUCH OF IT IN  THE PUBLIC EYE IS POWERFUL AND  THERE'S MORE THE PUBLIC WILL SEE THIS WEEK.  >> THURSDAY'S HEARING -- IT WAS  GOING TO BE WEDNESDAY. THURSDAY'S HEARING WILL FOCUS ON MIKE PENCE. WHY DIDN'T THE COMMITTEE ASK  PENCE HIMSELF TO TESTIFY OR IS  HIS CHIEF OF STAFF MARK SHORT,  WHO WAS THE FORMER VICE  PRESIDENT ON JANUARY 6th? >> YOU KNOW, I'M NOT AT LIBERTY  TO TALK ABOUT WHICH WITNESSES  WILL BE TESTIFYING, BUT I CAN  SAY THAT IN SOME CASES WE'VE  GOTTEN THE INFORMATION WE NEED  FROM PEOPLE IN THE ROOM. IT MAY NOT BE THE PRINCIPALS,  BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE NOT  EXCLUDING THE IDEA OF BRINGING  IN SOME OF THE TOP PEOPLE. SO WHETHER THEY TESTIFY THIS  WEEK OR NOT, DOESN'T EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY THAT WE BRING IN  OTHER WITNESSES LATER.  >> OTHER MEMBERS OF THE SELECT  COMMITTEE HAVE BEEN ALL OVER THE PLACE ON WHETHER YOU PLAN TO  MAKE CRIMINAL REFERRALS TO THE  DOJ. YOU SAID THAT YOU FEEL THERE'S  CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF CRIMINAL  ACTIVITY COMMITTED BY TRUMP. SO WHY WOULDN'T THAT YOU DO IF  YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT? >> AS A COMMITTEE, WE MAY. THE POINT IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONCLUDE THE HEARINGS. WE'LL HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT  THE EVIDENCE, WHETHER TO MAKE A  REFERRAL IF WE DO MAKE A  REFERRAL, WHAT THAT REFERRAL TO  BEMENT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I  THINK THERE'S BEEN MUCH ADO  ABOUT NOTHING IN TERMS OF  DISAGREEMENTS WITHIN THE  COMMITTEE. WE REALLY HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE  TO TALK IT THROUGH. SO I WOULDN'T CHARACTERIZE IT AS DISAGREEMENTS. WE HAVEN'T THAT DISCUSSION YET,  BUT WE WILL IN PROPER TIME, AND  THEN WE'LL DECIDE WHETHER TO  MAKE REFERRALS AND WHAT THOSE  REFERRALS WOULD LOOK LIKE IF WE  DO.  >> SO YOU HAVEN'T DISCUSSED THIS IN ALL YOUR TIME ABOUT CRIMINAL  REFERRALS? >> I THINK INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS  HAVE TALKED TO OTHER MEMBERS  ABOUT IT, BUT WE'VE HAD OUR  FOCUS PRIMARILY ON DOING THE  INVESTIGATION, AND THEN OF  COURSE LATELY ON PRESENTING THE  EVIDENCE DURING THE HEARINGS. SO WE'RE TAKING IT ONE STEP  AFTER ANOTHER, AND I THINK IT  WAS PREMATURE BEFORE WE REALLY  HAD DONE MUCH OF THE  INVESTIGATION, LET ALONE  CONCLUDED IT, TO BE TALKING  ABOUT WHAT WE WOULD WANT TO  REFER TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. THE EXCEPTIONS, OF COURSE, ARE  WHEN PEOPLE ARE IN CRIMINAL  CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS THERE. IT WAS PATENTLY OBVIOUS THAT WE  WOULD REFER THEM, AND IT WAS  JUST A QUESTION OF WHICH ONES TO REFER AND WHEN. BUT THE BROADER QUESTION, WE'LL  GET TO IT AT THE APPROPRIATE  TIME.  >> WHAT IS THE END GAME HERE? AT YOU PROVE TRUMP OR HIS ALLIES BROKE THE LAW, BUT THERE IS NO  CRIMINAL REFERRAL, WHAT IS THE  POINT OF THIS WHOLE  INVESTIGATION? IS IT JUST ABOUT SETTING THE  RECORD STRAIGHT? >> NO. I MEAN, THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT  MISSIONS HERE. THERE'S OUR MISSION AND THEN  THERE'S MISSION OF THE JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT. OUR MISSION IS NOT A CRIMINAL  PROSECUTION. WE DON'T HAVE THAT AUTHORITY. OUR MISSION IS TO EXPOSE THE  FACTS TO THE PUBLIC LIGHT ABOUT  A PLOT TO OVERTURN A  PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, THE FIRST NONPEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER  WE'VE HAD IN OUR HISTORY, AND  PRESCRIBE REMEDIES, LEGISLATIVE  REMEDIES TO PROTECT OUR COUNTRY  GOING FORWARD. THE PRINCIPAL MISSION OF THE  JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS TO BRING  PEOPLE TO JUSTICE WHO BREAK THE  LAW. WE CAN MAKE A REFERRAL, BUT OF  COURSE THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT  DOESN'T SIT AROUND WAITING FOR  REFERRALS FROM US, AT LEAST THEY HAVEN'T IN THE PAST. I HOPE THEY'RE NOT SIMPLY  WAITING FOR US NOW. IT'S THEIR DUTY TO FOLLOW THE  EVIDENCE AND IF THERE ARE  CREDIBLE ALLEGATIONS OF CRIME,  TO INCLUDE THEM. OUR MISSION IS QUITE DIFFERENT. THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT WE WON'T  MAKE A REFERRAL. WE MAY VERY WELL DO SO. BUT I WOULD HATE TO GIVE THE  PUBLIC THE IMPRESSION THAT  SOMEHOW THAT'S NECESSARY FOR THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO DO ITS  WORK OR THEY'RE WAITING FOR US. THEY SHOULDN'T BE WAITING. IF THEY ARE, I DON'T UNDERSTAND  WHY THEY'RE DEPARTING FROM WHAT  THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT GENERALLY DOES.  >> IF THEY SHOULDN'T BE WAITING, DO YOU FIND AT LEAST IN WHAT YOU KNOW ENOUGH CREDIBLE EVIDENCE  FOR THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO  ACT AT THIS MOMENT? >> I CERTAINLY BELIEVE THERE'S  ENOUGH EVIDENCE FOR THEM TO OPEN AN INVESTIGATION OF SEVERAL  PEOPLE. AND SO JIJ JUDGE DAVID CARTER OF CALIFORNIA BELIEVES THE FORMER  PRESIDENT AND OTHERS WERE  ENGAGED IN LIKELY MULTIPLE  CRIMINAL ACTS. AND SO IF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT CON OCCURS WITH JUDGE CARTER,  LET ALONE MY OWN VIEW OR OTHERS, THEY SHOULD BE PURSUING THAT. AND SO, YES, I THINK THERE IS  SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO OPEN AN  INVESTIGATION AND IT WOULD BE OF YOU UP TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ULTIMATELY TO DECIDE DOES THAT  EVIDENCE RISE TO PROOF BEYOND A  REASONABLE DOUBT SUCH THAT  THEY'RE COMFORTABLE INDICTING  SOMEONE. BUT THERE'S CERTAINLY NIGH VIEW  ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO OPEN UP  INVESTIGATIONS.  >> AS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE  INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, I GOT TO GET YOUR TAKE ON PRESIDENT  BIDEN'S TRIP TO SAUDI ARABIA IN  JULY AFTER PROMISING TO TURN THE COUNTRY INTO THE PARIAH OF THE  MIDDLE EAST. WE'RE TOLD HE'S GOING TO MEET  WITH THE MAN INTELLIGENCE  OFFICIALS SAY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BRUTAL MURDER OF JAMAL  KHASHOGGI. IS THIS A MISTAKE? >> I THINK IT IS. I WOULDN'T GO. I WOULDN'T SHAKE HIS HAND. I WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM. AND I UNDERSTAND THE PRESIDENT  HAS TO DEAL WITH A WHOLE VARIETY OF DIFFICULT ISSUES, BUT I  WOULDN'T GO. THIS IS SOMEONE WHO, YOU KNOW,  WAS INVOLVED IN THE PREMEDITATED MURDER OF A U.S. RESIDENT, A  JOURNALIST, WHO HAS A TERRIBLE  HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD. AND IT JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU HOW THE NEED FOR FOSSIL FUELS SO  DISTORTS OUR FOREIGN POLICY AND  CAUSES TO US ACT IN WAYS NOT  CONSISTENT WITH OUR VALUES. YOU KNOW, YOU ADD ANOTHER  ARGUMENT ON TOP OF THE F

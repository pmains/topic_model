here now with reaction louisiana senator john kennedy all right so you got cyber attacks from russia the iranians enriching again you got russia and china providing the iranians arms and china is now saying yeah we're going for reunification just like they shut down hong kong it's about to get worse and if you mess with us we have 1.5 billion people and we will take out your military sites uh what's joe going to do senator i don't understand president biden's foreign policy he keeps talking about rule based order i don't know what that means nobody's opposed to rules-based order that would be like a opposing golden retrievers but i don't know what it means um the question he needs to be asking is what does america want from its foreign policy i know what i want i want a foreign policy that helps create an america in which people can continue to prosper and americans can live their lives as they see fit and as a moral principle i want that for every other country how do you achieve that two rules number one don't be a bully and number two don't tolerate bullies i'm talking about iran and russia and china how do you achieve that weakness invites the wolves uh the reason bullies will fear us is because america is the strongest country militarily in all of human history we're also the wealthiest country in all of human history we need to maintain it president biden is undermining it he's proposing massive tax increases which will destroy wealth he's spent and is proposing to spend trillions of dollars that we don't have on things we don't need uh number two um he's he's proposing to cut the military we need to be increasing our military spending number three six months ago sean we were on a glide path as a country to energy independence president biden stopped that for sure number four he needs to tell his people to stop apologizing for america we have nothing to apologize for we're not perfect but we're good when his u.n ambassador in her first speech to every country in the world in at the u.n in new york says that a white supremacy is woven through the fabric of america's founding principles that's not helpful you mentioned russia here's what we need to do with russia president biden told putin to stop the cyber attacks the cyber attacks have continued he needs to hit putin with a serious cyber attack two wrongs don't make a right make it right but they do make it even uh number two he needs to re he meaning president bad needs to reimpose sanctions on the nord stream too you mentioned iran iran knows what we want no nuclear warhead no missile technology and stop exporting terrorism president biden needs to give iran six months we'll continue to talk with them but no more than six months and if iran doesn't agree with additional sanctions sanctions president biden needs to uh to hit them so hard that even google can't find them um you have putin gets away a waiver to build his pipeline while while simultaneously canceling jobs at the keystone xl pipeline you have the iranians he lifts the sanctions and to be very honest i think it now becomes a pivotal question is there a good chance that the 1.5 billion dollar bank of china deal that zero experience hunter got might have compromised the biden family with china and what will joe do when the reunification with taiwan comes senator and my last part is 57 percent of americans 58 percent of independents a third of democrats believe joe's not running the show do you believe he's running the show robert cahalia and john yeah i i i don't know i just judge the man by his actions he's president biden is responsible whether he's running the show or not and i can tell you with respect to china it's also true with iran and russia weakness invites the wolves if he wants to get president chi's attention in china president biden should do two things immediately number one he should negotiate and sign a trade agreement with taiwan whoa that will get china's attention and number two he needs to publicly back australia australia has tried to stand up to china china is boycotting all australian goods and in australia sends a lot of its exports to china we need to come to the real to the aid of of australia and we need to speak loudly and clearly and tell the european union we expect their help i don't see i agree with much of your analysis i don't see it happening there's one other thing we can do sean last word go ahead this is going to be controversial we need america needs to vaccinate the world you don't have to take the vaccine if you don't want it but it's the right thing to do and it will make friends all over the world and every vial every syringe needs to have made in the usa on it uh i think for the sake of the world to give people that option that shows once again i would argue we showed it all throughout our history we abuse power less than any great country we advance the human condition we share such invention and innovation scientifically medically with other countries for free uh i would say that makes america good yeah all right what american leadership is all about senator thank you

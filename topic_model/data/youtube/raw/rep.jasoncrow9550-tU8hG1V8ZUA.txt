hi uh it's congressman jason crowe here and i'm uh joined today with a a very very special guest somebody who i'm honored to have with us as we go into this memorial day a weekend um a fellow uh servicemen a command sergeant major isaiah vimoto who has an incredibly long history of service to our country uh and um command sergeant major of omoto's family uh has given so much to our country and i'll let him uh speak about that um here in a moment but they are uh to me the epitome of what it means to be um people committed to our nation to our defense and to put uh country and service above self uh in in a way that uh very few people frankly understand so welcome uh sergeant major homoto thank you so much thank you well sergeant major i'd love if you would uh just start by giving us a brief overview of your service you know how did you come to be into the military and what did you do during your time and um i would love to just talk about uh you know your service career and what you took away from it yes sir well so you know i think most people would probably uh i'm from the uh born and raised in the islands of samoa uh some more as a territory of the united states down the south pacific uh growing up i've always admired those people uh young older i mean kids above i mean uh older than me who have graduated high school and went into service but i admired them when they came back i mean i looked up to them i mean they were you know they were strong they're looking good i mean they're just their walk i said man i want to be just like those guys one day so uh my mother told me that i was eight years old when i told her that i want to join the army when i grow up and and uh so years later my mom my mother recounted that so after high school i was a junior in high school when i took the asvab uh then passed and then of course my senior year i after right after graduation i sought out the recruiter uh he completed my paperwork and off i went into the service and uh when i left the island i did not look back i mean really again at that time my goal was i had goals i set my goals i'm just going to go in the military i'm going to do 20 years retire come out work again for another 20 years and now retire at least twice before i reach 60. well that was my goal as a young teenager but uh things changed when i came to the army a few years later i mean my wife got married and from then on there was one assignment after another so that goal of 20 years ended up become 34 plus years later but i've really but i joined the infantry but when i left samoa my recruiter said that my scores were good enough to be a supply sergeant you know you could be a supply i said what did the supply do at that point i didn't have any military my family that can coach and mentor me at a time so you know i was shooting in the dark at the time i was relying on a recruiter so he said well a supply sergeant or supply guy these are the people that behind the counter working office to hand out supplies to the truth okay oh that sounds good is that something you want to do i don't care i just want to join the army so when i arrived in hawaii the map station hawaii at that time they just started cohort units so this is where a whole company or battalions of people uh come together they train they i mean basic and ait together and then they stay together for three years so i was one of those very first cohorts uh so when i got in hawaii after you know meeting the the mep station commander so he got all 150 of us in a room one night and he said well man i know all of you came here with a different mls because your recruiter said you're good here you get there but at this time the army needs a few good infantrymen who knows what infantryman is you know of course everybody's looking at each other you know of course me he's just a dumb kid from some boys like i don't even know what instrument is you know so this young man raised his hand and said sir instrument is somebody who are on the ground close with and destroy the enemy the colonel goes absolutely right and that's what the army needs today so all of you guys here know what your recruiter said you now infantryman raise your right hand and then from then on yeah so i served my whole time you know and the rest is history but then i served i mean i went on uh i served you know really i mean every position from a rifleman to a team leader to a squad leader all the way up to you know uh had culminated my 34 years as a 18 year old core command sergeant major so i've seen a lot of really the big takeaway for me was really the people uh despite all the changes you know and all the challenges we face in the army you know i learned earlier that early on that is all about people because without people we will not have an army without people the mission ought to be accomplished so i really uh fostered that and i really that's what i miss a lot is that it's people and then the camaraderie that we have in the military i'm sure you can uh the testing that's watching absolutely it's the people it's the people that i that i really miss i i completely relate to that just um from everywhere you know the you come from america samoa and the pacific islander heritage and history of military services i believe a lot of people from samoa and guam uh go into the military and i serve as some folks from the pacific um it's an incredible heritage there i see i actually see a regimental arranger regiment scroll on the wall behind you too i think yes sir yeah what uh what what what battalion did you serve in certain major yeah i was in a bitco bro company in the third seventh threesome five all right all right and fort benning before ben jordan well i'd love if you would be willing to share um a little bit about your family uh your your son went into the service and if you're willing i think that's a really important um component of your family story and as we go into memorial day um what we wanted to talk about today yes sir yes i'll be glad to see so uh you know my wife and i we have uh we raised five children uh we have three boys and uh two girls uh the oldest of uh was our son tim so that uh i'll start off with tim so really for tim uh you know where my i mean my belief i'm latter-day saint i'm the member of the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints and uh you know we always uh encourage our young men and women to serve you know sacrifice three years at a time to serve a mission for our church so that time the tim's upbringing was all about you know him when he did when he graduated high school he's gonna go serve a two-year mission before he goes off to college and and then whatever else he desires to do when i came back from iraq in oh five to go for six early six orlado 6. uh i came home and uh of course tim just graduated from high school and then the time uh you know uh one evening he said dad and mom i have something to tell you guys i just want you to know that i made up my mind i i've seen that you know i want to i want to go i want to go in the army so we both looked at each other it's like why uh you supposed to go on a mission he said yeah uh i didn't go to college he said i know but then he said something that was very profound he said uh dad you know i've been watching the news when you were downrange i've seen a lot of our soldiers killed in action i felt it's my turn to serve you know so when uh when when he said that you know uh i've seen a lot of i mean that the point right there i mean i didn't we have a lot of my soldiers blown up with an efp uh sniper you know the time but you know everybody else sports itself but i was there without him he's just seeing those young man in combat you know and agony and the pain that they went through i see my children in them so and then when my son said it's his turn to serve that's all that that flashes in my mind was those young men that led them i started working in combat so but then after much uh trying to convince him otherwise as he signed i think it's important that you go finish your education you don't want to go on a mission at least go to college you know that way you know when you finish college you can go and join the army and do whatever you want to do but he was so sad to see that i think it's uh i think i want to go do this now if i don't like the army then um i'll just come out and go go to school i just know that i've known you for 17 for 18 years there's nothing but the military you're not like you're breed you're born raise eat and breathe military stuff you always love that stuff so anyway but he chose that's what he the path that he chose um and then um i was funny i took him to the recruiter the next day well not next day so i said well what are your plans when do you want to go in you know he said well i did the math which he did his own little investigation and he said well i figured if i go in at least end this month i'll come home for christmas you know for the holidays and then after a base training i go back and finish up so you know so anyway so uh we i took him recruited following week the recruiter looked at him i said well i asked him could i say hey sergeant um this is my son tim uh he's thinking about joining the military and i would like for you to talk to me anyway so i sit down and pick up a magazine and they'll write kind of this is one for me so her recruiter ask him and say son well welcome and uh what is it you want to do the attend without hesitation i heard him say well sergeant i want to join the infantry i want some action you know just like that and i looked up and the recruiter looked at me and we kind of locked eyes and i was kind of like well you know that's what you want sir the recruiter told tim you say son you join infj you're gonna have plenty of action you know so anyway bottom line so he signed up uh he put in a week he was off fort bidding you know but my wife just kind of she cried all the way back from the mep station after we sent him off you know tell us i said well it's okay he's not going to combat he's going to basic training in ait so at that time the same time i was uh i got an interview uh selected to be the takeover as a brigade major for the 173rd airborne brigade in italy so uh someone said well i'm very sad because my son is we were in fort campbell at the time when we set them off uh so he said well i'm very sad because we're supposed to be trying to get him here but now we're going all the way to illinois you know but anyway so i said well don't worry i'll work something where i can then i was able to work his assignment and got he had an airborne contract so i was able to work to assign me and got him to uh vicenza italy so so that's tim i like to go more i'm sure you probably have to cover probably when you have questions later on and then our second uh oldest sabrina sabrina again she was a senior in college uh after first semester she came home from holidays and she told us uh surprised me and my wife saying mom and dad i have something to tell you guys so of course mother's first instinct was like are you pregnant you know my daughter said no i'm not pregnant are you getting married no i'm not getting married so what is it and she said dad i know how you are i just want you to know that i prayed about it i thought about it i prayed about it i thought about it i wanted it what did you do did you rob a bank she go no i joined the army i said but you got one more semester why don't you give out so anyway so she too joined the army even though she had one more semester while she was a senior she had one more submission but i just i tried to convince her we tried to convince her but that's what they were set on you know but i always ask a question why do you want to do this you know their response with my son and me at first was like it's my turn to serve i want to ask the same question my daughter why do you want to do this you know once you go to school you go well that i just want to sir i think again just like tim i thought it's my turn because i see a lot of my peers they're working they got jobs but for me i'm still in school you know anyway so she she too uh later i'll say but uh uh yeah i mean this is i was at 18 and one core a ser made it at times i was able to bring her into the core she was able to deploy she was a lady poor so she deployed with me as well tim also did plug with me because i was his brigade soft major in italy so now two of my children had the opportunity to play with me and then my third one is ariel ariel was uh she decided to sit down in her second you know third year uh but i had all my when i was getting ready to go to the ring so i told him well ain't no sitting around here you gotta find a job you know so i came back uh six months later for an hour and she was doing it find a job and you know she just didn't know how to she was applied but she was expecting people to call her you know i said yeah that's what's supposed to happen but you're supposed to be knocking on the doors if you really want the job anyway so um ariel ended up she's uh joining the army as well as an intel uh analyst so uh she she didn't deploy because i was i retired when she came when she got in the army uh but i was able to witness her so she was assigned to the first special forces group here in uh um here in fort lewis jblm and she deployed with them to afghanistan so three of my children have been afghanistan you know so uh my fourth oldest is junior so he's the first of our kids to graduate from college with a double major after coaching football when he got out and teaching high school pe uh he decided that uh if danny was kind of boring uh i want to go do contracting overseas you think you can get me there you know i said sure i got connection i can get you there so he he's got this contract uh uh the pizza it's not the pizza what is the the balloon the bear got what they call it that you know what's up with the the rays the balloon were kind of like the goodyear balloon yeah so he was able to land a contract with those guys that he trained up and he was stationed in uh in kabul so now so junior did also but in support of the military so uh and uh so he did not join the millers but he also did his service with the military indirectly you know through uh those means so he was there so now four months you're looking at the point you know to uh afghanistan you know young has won this uh uh who's uh just finished his second year in college so right now he's so he's the one that's home now and uh keeping us young still and um and of course we have uh four beautiful grandchildren you know so three of them are from my daughter that's currently deployed uh sabrina our oldest daughter she on her second appointment now so uh uh but she three of her children that we raised here until last week and we took the texans through the in-laws and then my youngest grandson be a year old next month uh who lives in arizona so that's a family and my wife uh she was a nurse when we met she went back to nursing now uh she just got off work this morning so uh she's uh in bed now yeah that's the that's the family right there and but an amazing uh family of service in every way and sergeant major i want to be respectful of your time and i know we just have a few minutes of your time left but i i would love um it's memorial day weekend coming up and um for folks like us um it has a different meaning and particularly for you and your family um and i would love for you if you're if you're willing to share just for a couple of minutes um what that meaning is and if you'd be willing to share about uh tim's sacrifice um well really i feel for us memorial day i think i think it means a little different to us because we have we lost a loved one but i think uh but really even more today's in general is just today the real members of those who uh who gave their lives in the service of our country and that's just the you know basically the bottom line but i think for us here in our thing we uh really it's a day for us not only so let me be back so this three days really hits home hard mainly for my wife so one is uh my son's birthday and that's uh tim's birthday is august 2nd so that's the day when it seemed like is that wounds that scared because you know i'm fine but it all my wife's one you know gets hit the hardest the second day is the uh this is the june 5th which is coming up that's the day when you fell you know and then of course memorial day so those are the three days of always ev year-round they seem like uh just open a pandora box again you know open it that scares feeling that scab back you know for the family because it means a lot you know even though we remember tim every day or when you see his pictures in a wall we you know it's just uh there's a certain smell like oh potential or hey your memory is now or in conversations like what we're doing now you're talking about tim and those things kind of brings us those memories but at the same time i guess for me as a soldier i'm comforted knowing that you know that there's love that there's people that really thought of him along with all our men and women who died in combat in the preservation of our freedom and service of our country but it means a lot to us because we did not so much for tim but to develop is to remember those of our fallen heroes those are men and women who gave their all those who they they could have chosen something else but they chose the service uh round the certain about nation only knowing that there's uh chaos that there's death involved i mean like my son tim people are dying as he said he said well i feel like it's my turn to serve i see many of our soldiers dying i felt my turn to serve most americans turn the opposite directions oh hey i'm not going there there's people dying over there so you're shooting but there's very few who put on the uniform and said send me i'm willing to do this and that's what means a lot to us as a family and force as a for those for us to serve as those men and women who said send me i will go and do the bids for our country thanks sergeant major um well be thinking about tim and his sacrifice in afghanistan this weekend as i know many people will and others friends of mine and comrades of mine i just want to i just want to wrap here by um thanking you and your family um you all have given more than we ever could have asked of you as a family uh your lifetime of service your children in service um tim uh we owe you all a debt of gratitude that we can never repay other than try to do right by that sacrifice uh and to honor it with the way that we live our lives the way we conduct ourselves uh the the nation we continue to build um and um just can't thank you enough and i i appreciate your willingness to share the story today sergeant major thank you thank you so much for right now if i can add one more thing i know uh you know in our those or who made ultimate sacrifice i know um they're not asking if they were here they're not they will not ask anything in return but we can always remember them but how we live our lives today our lives as a like the quote in the movie saving private ryan let's say you know uh the end when he walks in the you know cemetery and you look at his wife am i a good husband am i a good man you know i mean that's how we should live our life are we living you know are we being good we've been you know good to each other i mean are we worthy to sacrifice of those men and women who pay that sacrifice for us so i think that's the way we live my life in our lives it's like there's nothing we can do to bring tim and all those our men and women who died but what at least we can do is live our lives in a manner that's pleasing to them they're worthy of their sacrifice yes so well said thank you for sharing that god bless you and your family thank you sergeant major thanks so much

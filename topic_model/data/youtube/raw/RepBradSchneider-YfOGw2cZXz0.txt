statistics and information on best practices going ahead the size of the head apologies we also provide resources which is the thing that most people are interested in and that's both grants and training and technical assistance the Bureau of Justice Assistance has the broadest portfolio within God's justice program so it includes things like the justice assistance grant program that you're probably familiar with body worn cameras little sedation ones just came out I believe the sexual assault 10 initiative in going away from brands the public safety officers benefits program which is which probably one of one payment a lump sum payment to families of officers killed in the line of duty or officers that are severely disabled of my idea about a new rule Orpheus will be just hit the Federal Register today I continue to have some technical issues [Music] for the interest of time I'm going to avoid you move ahead and again you'll see the hole you'll see the whole presentation after view of this assistance we have GG gyro justice assistance we have Bureau of Justice Statistics which is the name indicates there's a primary data gathering our D Department and that number the National Crime Victimization survey which along with the FBI on to the farm crime reports are the two primary ways you mentor by the prime in the United States then we have the National Institute of justice which is a primary research of that work catching up now which is primary research arm research and development arm of the department justice pain support effort such as body armor they also thanks everly DNA and forensics that we have the office of Juvenile Justice is Lindsay prevention they provide mentoring funds to states and local communities they support you and out of this improvement and they also support things such as Amber Alert and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children then we have our officer victims and prime they administer funds through the prime victim's blood which is money collected through throughout that forfeiture and and through fines they support projects such as elder abuse they also support victims of financial terrorism also victims of mass violence and international above here and abroad finally we have our Smart Office which works which works approved state sex offender monitoring and registration and people to share informations with the across America now I'm gonna hit on some some of our key priorities sorry the some of the key priorities of this department of this administration the first is the law enforcement see people and well that says you know this is finally here we go this is police week which I'll touch upon later we have a number of efforts to support officer safety and wellness as our colleagues and the cop's office another priority is finding the opioid abuse after that we just put out a solicitation for the combating opioid abuse Assistance Program so we urge you to check that out projects in neighborhoods it's a very comprehensive and I gang violence and gunfire program that solicitation is upcoming we have several efforts to combat human trafficking both of your businesses ascent to enter our services you find along with our Office of Juvenile Justice and delinquency prevention or con aspects of issues of musicians including both the law enforcement and victims I'm going to skip the prison of recreant elimination I've got that self-explanatory and move on to seminal events which is a clean free way that we can look at work from the states in the criminal justice system that done by our national and then turn things over to the office of community oriented policing services or as we are commonly referred to the cop's office and we are an agency you can see here on the org chart for the department we similar to the answer to the associate attorney general who answers to the deputy trying to make sure to the office of the Attorney General so this just gives you a picture of where we are represented within the overall Department of Justice and then just quickly about the cop's office we were created in 1994 the big crime bill that that created our office along with aquanauts against women our mission is to advance how they feed your community policing and I won't read through all of the bullet Pierce's you have them in front of you but some of the highlights Susan vested more than 14 billion in funding primarily through the hiring of police officers we have a very robust technology program and we support crime prevention initiatives and was provided training in variety of topics we have fun gened is more to hire more than a hundred and thirty thousand additional police officers and we provided grants to thirteen thousand of the nation's $18 the whole enforcement agencies across the country for Illinois since 99 or we have awarded nearly 600 550 billion to agencies throughout the state funding for six thousands of police officers and sheriff's deputies to seven hundred and seventeen different agencies within the state some people you know we would hope at this day people there were community students but if you don't it's basically a philosophy duh promote organizational strategies that support the systemic use the purchase of problem-solving techniques to proactively address the immediate conditions that give rise to crime to drill that down simply building relationships and solve problems that's basically that the essential philosophy around community policing and you can see here the three components are opportunity purchase or conventional transformation and problem solving now what you're probably most interested in is the money that we're going to be putting out the door this year our fiscal year twenty eight pain budget includes and it's the right-hand column you can see there 142 nine point five million but a hiring program 30 million for carbon resources grant program ten million we see development 25 million for a new school violence prevention program 8 million for my best task force's 32 million for anti-heroin 10 million for a cure to their training and 36 million for overseas regional information sharing transfer so for a total of 300 point five million for the cop's office in fiscal year 2018 if you see we had a increases in virtually every funding had worried that we have moving forward to talk about the cop tires program this really is our bread butter such a cop's office is most known for we provide 75 percent of the approved enjoy level salary and fringe benefits policing officers you can use the greatest to hire new officers you can rehire officers that have already been laid off or rehire permit layoffs that are happening at a future date and last year 2017 you can see we made a hundred and seventy-nine awards just fine eight hundred and two officers so this is the biggest program that we have it is our bread butter and what we're most known for another program that's become increasingly popular in offices the community policing development grant program I won't go into full detail about it but there is something that welcome awkward but is eligible to apply for Nexo micro grant initiative and the goal here is to provide seed money for innovation innovative community projects so one example that I have in Salt Lake City Utah they have very compressive projects where the local Armed Forces Department working with business owners to help resolve some of the issues around homelessness and how it impacted on business so then it gives you an idea of the kind of progress that we would fund through the micro grant big big new ones for us this year of us and order to receive significant funding through the stop school bottles Act those programs are still in development so there's not a lot that we can share other than we're coordinating on covered development when the solicitations opens you're going to see a very robust program that is the lead you know this is this intention is to permit to what the cop's office part you can think of it and you have those target sharpening metal detectors locks lighting it and there are some stuff from training us components there as well so that one could be opening later this summer but keep an eye on a committed new and the applicants are actually going to be units of local government so the police department wouldn't be a fine it would be a city or county the infamous and anti-heroin quarters I won't spend a lot of time off because all the states are eligible but what I would do is encourage you if either of these are issues in your community to reach out to the states either those department justice or the state police to see if they are going to be a five minute and how you as local jurisdictions could be able to take advantage of any of those task forces quickly coming to be in here and encourage everyone to look up our collaborative reform initiative for technical assistance this is something we provide technical assistance on a range of topics free of charge you just go into the website and and put in a request we will screen it and hopefully be able to provide with some technical assistance timeline we had our budget in accident March we have a handful of grants that are open now communities and development anti-hero an anti mess and the deadlines are June 7th or PC development due 27th for my heroin and meth so I always encourage you to go through our live our website for those details we have a variety of resources that are available free of charge on very specific public safety issues and then here's the contact information we have our response center which is you know more or less our call center than my contact information so if there's anything that I didn't address here please feel free to reach out and then we will turn it over to our colleague at Oviedo great thank you hi my name is Kathy Poston I'm an attorney advisor at the office on violence against women are often the mission of our office is to provide federal leadership in developing the nation's response with what we call the four dollar crimes Messick violence dating violence sexual assault and stalking we implement grant programs authorized under the Violence Against Women Act and I am having problems using my slides if someone could use them for me just add one thank you passed back in 1994 and it's been subsequently we authorized in 2012 2005 and 2013 these ministers books formula grant programs and discretionary grant programs our formula grant programs our largest Folio grant programs are stop violence against you miss formula grant program each state gets a set amount according to the population the money goes to a state's top administrator who then in turn makes Awards according to a formula with a certain percentage going to law enforcement agencies within the state victim service providers within the state courts within the state and prosecutors offices within the state they can do specific activities that are laid out in statute what I should have emphasized about the Violence Against Women Act when Congress authorized these grant programs they were very specific in which organizations which types of organizations were eligible for which string of programs and they were very specific in what types of activities could be funded under the grant program certainly our stop violence against women running the grant program is our broad bring a program and permit states to distribute funds by way of some awards to as I mentioned prosecutors offices law enforcement agencies victim service providers and courts and activities can include everything from the if some services to covering salaries and cleaning specialized units to creating policies protocols there's a very broad range of activities that can be funded under the stop violence controlling the formula grant program very similar formula grant programs addressing sexual assault and we have our coalition's grant program based on two coalition's within each state and tribal coalition's to test whether drugs to support victim service providers in those states our discretionary grant programs cover and wide range of either activities like our legal assistance for victims grant program or focus on a specific type of victim like our grant program that focuses on improving the response to individuals who are victims who also have even developed mental or physical disabilities or are elder abuse for that program are improving criminal justice response grant program goes to units of local government to assist them in improving the response to domestic violence dating violence sexual assault and stalking that grant program is really focused on training as well as prison specialized units so this gives you a slide of doing such a disservice to the particulars of these grant programs but you'll see there's a very wide range of activities grant programs that cover different specified interventions to not only hold offenders accountable but also to ensure that victims are getting the service that means the next slide keeps an idea of some funded activities can focus on everything from port improvement training for judges law enforcement we can support position training for law enforcement specialized specialized law enforcement officers or detectives some of our grant programs have a prevention or education component some are much more focused on the provision of direct services in the next slide a focus on the types of populations that the grant programs might focus on and the next slide then focuses on it's just sort of a list of the different types of organizations that are eligible under the different grant programs I think what's important to recognize is that we post our solicitations annual solicitations and right now we only have four that are currently open our stop solicitations our coalition solicitation our tribal governments so if the patient are currently open surah FL are FY 2018 solicitations for the discretionary program clauses we always encourage anyone who's interested in our grant programs to take a look at the past fiscal year so the patient because you'll get an idea of what types of materials need to do submitted with an application package will also get sort of an overview of the grant program as one of my colleagues mentioned best trafficking is a priority for the justice Department and a couple of our FY 2018 solicitations had a priority of the trafficking organizations that wanted to address trafficking if you can switch to the next second five next one please thank you very much we're retired our OCW funding opportunities through grants.gov but also we have solicitations information about open source stations as well as links to our closed solicitations on our website we also encourage interested organizations to follow us on Twitter at OVW justice because we announced information about when solicitations are open as well as other activities with the office we always also encourage organizations that are interested in applying for our funding to look at our how to apply tips on our website that is some more information next slide please we provide we want our grantees to do effective work so we have a vibrant technical assistance program for our grantees where we we don't want grantees reinvesting the wheels that we make a different award to large membership organizations and large advocacy organizations so a lot of information it's publicly available on our DNA to ta org website there's a list of not only o BW ta providers some of the trainings the materials the policy and practices information that base assembles is available on that website as well as some of our key agents are open to potential OVW grantees that we encourage organizations take a look at a calendar next slide laughs lastly we require our grantees to file progress the first of all about all their activities not only does it help us monitor our brand piece it also provides information for our statutorily mandated report to Congress so I encourage you if you're interested in really finding out what grantees are doing with our funds to take a look at the weather it sees stop report to Congress or our biennial report to Congress on the effectiveness of grants and Obama that's the report on our discretionary grant program not only the first half of that report sort of synthesizes research and information about what are effective interventions it also then summarizes which of our grantees are engaged in those activities the second half of the report to Congress is a separate chapter on each grant program so you don't love pretty close a lot of sort of very vibrant and rich information about what grantees are actually doing with our sons that is a very short and very incomplete on the wide-ranging and early exciting work that is being done through our grant programs but again as my colleague tips on the cop's office my information is available on the next slide so in / - if you have more questions about different programs or with like me to walk you through our website I'm available to do that for some of my colleagues at OVW it would be available we're going to forward all of our questions at the

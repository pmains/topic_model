thank you oh I'm the last one here but I wanted to stay because I want to go over some really important points that you and I had conversations about in our meeting and I said I want to go over again the importance of logistics infrastructure as we're focused on great power competition is outlined in the NDS as we talked about this a logistical tale is needs to be robust enough to address our shipping priorities would you commit to me that if you're confirmed you will pay closer attention to our logistical needs to include funding for Sealift airlift and other aspects of our logistics infrastructure it was also included here amphibious shipping for the Marine Corps absolutely Center and just just to share with you for the broader audience look the the army gets to the fight through the sea left 90% of its equipment goes by sea and if they can't get there it won't be in the fight it won't be relevant and I've had this conversation as Secretary of the army was Secretary of the Navy Spencer and he agrees we need to modernize and build capacity and Darcy lifts and then second with regard of the Marines absolutely they need to have the requisite number of amphibs to do their missions they're short now and that's something that I'm committed to seeing through thank you I want to address the night courts I'd like to conduct one that we've discussed this a little bit the savings and recommittal ization enabled reprogramming to unifying the Army's efforts behind these priorities and I congratulate you for that if confirm will you carry out a similar rigorous defense wide review or multiple service specific reviews to focus on future game changers which might include things like AI hypersonics or nuclear command and control you've touched on this a little bit but absolutely I mean the the the Congress and the American people were very generous with what they give us for defense and I think we can make better use of every single dollar certainly before we come back asking for more thank you again I wonder address since I get the last word here I guess about ongoing use of the 2001 and 2002 AUMF the US Constitution vests with Congress the sole and solemn responsibility to declare war however over the past several years administrations from both parties have used the existing AUMF in a way that outstrips intent of Congress and has at best dubious legal justifications in a real world example of current concern do you believe the 2001 AUMF or the 2002 AUMF provides the necessary legal authorization for us to use military force against Iran not to conduct a war center as you and I discussed but obviously that the president has under Article 2 the right to self to respond if attacked but no not in terms of how you described it as we discussed it conduct war but article 2 is aside from the AUMF right I said if we were if Iran were attack attack us our soldiers we always have the right of self-defense right in to execute those types but that's under article 2 I'm speaking specifically of the 2001 and 2002 AUMF right either one of those authorizes you to know because they are 2001 applies to terrorist groups and organizations and that would not be the case here with regard to the country of Iran thank you again I I want to touch a little bit on the issue of sexual assault and harassment we've had civilian and military representatives from DoD come in for years swearing to take the problem seriously and effective no change disappointing the estimated prevalence rates are rebounding will you commit to working on a major effort to reform our prevention efforts nothing changes regulation but an actual cultural change it needs to happen absolutely Center this is in absolutely intolerable that what we see is happening out there it is it's the the goal should be zero and we needed we need to jump continue to jump on this problem take care of the survivors the victims and then also hold the perpetrators accountable one of the things that I found coming into the job as Secretary of the army that we weren't leveraging which I think gets what you were saying is I don't think we've leveraged well enough in the past the culture of the Army and the chain of command that says leaders at every level down to the squad leader level get involved and take this task on and make sure they know their soldiers want up and a prevent sexual assault and harassment before begins not deal with it after the fact well there's about a minute left I'm going to give you an opportunity to address the issues and enter we if I would think reaffirm your a willingness to stand by their recommendations of your ethics committee and your ethics officers in how you would conduct yourself with in terms of Umrah theum absolutely Center look it's it's it's beyond just the laws and regulations policies I will always follow those but it's the spirit of that thinks it's what you grew up with in the Army what I grew up with in the Army what Center ernst grew up in the army is the commitment to the nation living an honorable life and living ethically that's what drives me that's what drives me well thank you thank you for your many many years of service and I look forward to your confirmation Thank You senator thank you I yield back

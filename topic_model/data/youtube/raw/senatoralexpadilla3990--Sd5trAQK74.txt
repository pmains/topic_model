discuss and are senator alex padilla democrat from california he sits on the environment and public works committee senator thank you for taking the time this morning good to be back jim good to see you you are among 200 congressional uh well you signed a letter as well as other congressional staffers urging president biden to declare a climate emergency can you explain to our viewers what that would allow the president to do exactly uh sure and appreciate the opportunity and first let's uh set the context you already did half of it which is calling out not just wildfires in california other parts of the west but the flooding in st louis extreme weather events throughout the country and frankly around the world uh but we also have to remind folks of why we're going why we're turning to the president's because our republican colleagues in the senate men who continue to uh disregard the science uh or fail to act legislatively to address the climate challenge uh have a unless there's no choice but to return to executive action and we do believe president biden has uh the ability to declare an emergency and use the powers that an emergency declaration uh provides uh to help take bold action on climate because time is of the essence you know we talked about uh the defense production act for example in the earlier days of the covet 19 pandemic leveraging our manufacturing capability in the country to produce ventilators other things to counter the pandemic the same can be uh the same as the case when it comes to tackling climate let's boost the supply chain to produce things like the the solar power infrastructure the wind power infrastructure the renewable energy that we need to keep electricity keep the economy going but wean ourselves off of fossil fuels and the emissions that they cause you uh are uh working on legislation that you've introduced to establish federal protections for workers against heat stress uh do you have 60 votes in the senate to get this passed uh we're working our way first step is to introduce the bill the second step is to start uh lining up support but again as you know as we speak there's 85 million americans who are living in areas with heat warnings last week the number was a hundred million in the united states again clearly not alone this you look at what's happening in europe you look at what's happening in india and it's not just uh people who can escape maybe to air conditioned offices think about folks who work in agricultural fields who work on construction sites who work in warehouses where there may not be ventilation or air conditioning extreme heat is the leading cause of death uh in for many and so uh states like california have a state standard to protect workers from heat from the excessive temperatures access to shade access to cold drinking water those sorts of things that can save lives literally but we need a national standard a federal standard is long overdue we do have the support of the administration on this but we also know that the regulation setting process can take years and years and years the climate crisis is only getting worse by the year but we can't afford to wait senator to politics now midterms coming up it's cnn's reporting that some democrats are planning as part of a push to uh limit their losses in the midterms to to paint republicans as extremists i wonder because at the same time you have uh democratic groups backing some of those same extremists republican candidates candidates election deniers for instance in a state like maryland does that work for you is that not fundamentally contradictory yeah the the bottom line is making a clear contrast for voters to decide this november who to vote for uh we know what the nation need do we need investments in uh job creation domestically we need to tackle costs for working families how do we bring down the cost for prescription drugs how do we bring down the cost of child care how do we bring down the cost of the various areas where we're facing inflation democrats have plans that have been stifled because of republican opposition in congress so let's make that abundantly clear for voters you want to restore a woman's right to choose vote for democrats you want to tackle climate aggressively vote for democrats is creating that contrast uh that i think is going to continue to bolster uh our chances i get that point but but part of the democratic case here you hear it from senior democratic leaders nancy pelosi among them is that some of these republican candidates and trump himself are a threat to democracy how can democrats say that but then back some of those election deniers in their own races yeah look at the it's going to be up to candidates across the board uh to pose those questions uh for republican candidates to answer do you believe climate change is real or not do you believe a woman should be able to make the decisions uh on her own body or not be public beyond the record and let the voters decide senator alex padilla of california nice to have you back on the program thank you jim

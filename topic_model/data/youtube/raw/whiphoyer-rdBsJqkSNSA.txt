meet in America a man who's putting his money where his mouth is thank you sir thanks Craig appreciate dental and it really does House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer Democrat from Maryland is with me now also wearing a red tie I should point out now I suppose that I'm not wear red because I I'm an idiot like you didn't get the memo arrogant may be the problem congressman good to see you I want to play just a bit of sound of Dave brat this is the congressman from the neighboring state of Virginia member of the house freedom caucus here's what he said too many elements of Obamacare present and the most important thing is it we're paying attention to coverage but Obamacare paid attention to coverage eight years ago but we're in death spirals right now because no one paid attention to the economic into the prices and the costs that are increasing at thirty percent that's the part we need assurances on the speaker said we're going to bend the cost curve down twenty five percent down and we haven't seen enough evidence on that major point well is just a few minutes ago here on the program congressman congressman brat they're insisting that it's about cost what see you did at it that's the problem with this film Craig first of all if congressman Brad talks about cost the cost curve in fact has gone down significantly it has not gone down every place in every instance but the cost curve has in fact been bent in the right direction of reducing costs of course what the congressman wants to do will increase very very substantially the cost for every American who has insurance whether they have employer-based insurance or they're on the private market for their insurance david brats suggestion will increase their costs very radically now he's not for the bill that the Republicans have offered but the bill that the Republicans have offered will literally have Americans paying more and get laughs it will have the Medicaid put at risk and millions of people losing their coverage under Medicaid over the years and it will put Medicare at risk by a defunding and making it lose its fiscal viability a much sooner than it would under the ACA so the fact of the matter is Americans are going to see their health care put at risk and by the Republican bill David brats not for that I think but surprisingly this bill does not go to where president Trump says he wants to go everybody having health care at a lower cost and higher quality this bill doesn't even come out you could argue congressman did no bill would come close to that well as you could argue that but that's what the president Trump says he's going to give us now he has no bill that he has put forward to accomplish that objective and in fact as you point out Craig there is no such bill but that's what the president has claimed he's going to support and what he's going to put forward and you can't deny that he said it in the state of the union but the fact is this bill that is now being considered without any hearings with 48 hours notice to the American people with no American being asked to come in and testify as to what they believe the effects of the bill will be here the committee is marking it up they're rushing to a judgment in my opinion because they don't want the American people to see how drastically this will reduce their availability and affordability of health care and then transmit that message to the members of Congress well and as you know the Republican Party is deeply divided on this issue it's interesting some say it does too much and some says it there too little while i have you i want to talk about something else here really quickly the wikileaks dump of documents and claims coming from the CIA CIA hacking arsenal if you will in DC news is that all the key to the documents the CIA not commenting on the document spot they include techniques to to hack into common devices like phones and televisions computers as well back in 2010 the Obama administration promised to work with tech companies like Apple like Google to disclose vulnerabilities on an ongoing basis these documents are data from 2013 to last year did the Obama administration drop the ball here congressman look I think frankly the CIA should not have been in a position where its documents were subject to being hacked I'm very concerned about that so in my opinion not only CIA but other federal agencies need to make very sure that their information systems are secure and weather is the CIA or other agencies we need to have a full-scale hearing about where we are and where we need to be and how we're going to get there House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer joining us this afternoon congressman thank you thank you Greg spying

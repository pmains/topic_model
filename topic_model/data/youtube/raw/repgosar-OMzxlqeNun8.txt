Thank You mr. Speaker I rise today to recognize the one-year anniversary of the tragic Yarnell Hill Fire which claimed the lives of nine lete Granite Mountain hotshot firefighters in late June of 2013 the Yarnell fire began when lightning struck approximately 30 miles southwest of Prescott Arizona off of highway 89 on June 28 2013 the blaze burned approximately 84 hundred acres and damaged more than a thousand structures over a 15-day period during the disaster 19 firefighters from the Granite Mountain interagency hotshot crew lost their lives battling the fire the sixth deadliest American fire fighter disaster overall and the deadliest wildfire ever in Arizona indeed this dark day yielded the largest loss of firefighter life since September 11 2001 to this day words cannot express my sadness and the depth of my condolences to the families of these brave 19 first responders who gave their lives protecting our community I will certainly remember this horrible tragedy for the rest of my life as well as the public memorial service that was attended by more than 1,200 members of our community these brave men made the ultimate sacrifice fighting to protect our citizens and for that we will be eternally grateful even though a year has passed please continue to keep the families of these hotshot firefighters in your prayers furthermore I ask that the federal agencies responsible for actively managing our forests not forget this tragedy and take the steps to prevent similar catastrophic qualifiers for reoccurring the citizens of Yarnell Arizona and the surrounding communities know all too well the importance of proactive wildfire management and while the Wildfire that claimed the lives of 19 brave souls was one of the worst tragedies in his in the history of Arizona millions more across the country are also impacted by these disasters looking back over the past year it is important to highlight what progress has been made in finding common-sense solutions to preventing wildfires while still acknowledging the reality the most that more must and can be done we owe it to our OHS who risk everything in order to protect our lives our communities and our home Conger still needs to consider additional legislation that will work to get the executive branch out of the way when action must be taken swiftly this problem can be mitigated by empowering the private sector to create rural jobs and to residen resurrecting the timber industry as loggers then millions of acres have badly overgrown Arizona forest although we are never going to prevent all forest fires this legislative efforts will help make fires less frequent less intense when they do occur I remain optimistic that above all else the heroic actions of the Granite Mountain hotshots will continue to inspire our leaders to make the necessary changes to prevent future devastation and destruction we owe nothing less to these heroes more importantly I will continue to do everything in my power to ensure that their legacies live on and yield substantial forest management changes I would like to conclude my remarks by reading the names and ages of these 19 firefighters in tribute to their service Andrew Ashcroft age 29 Robert Caldwell age 23 Travis Carter age 31 dustin Deford age 24 Christopher McKenzie age 30 Eric Marsh age 43 grant McKee age 21 Shaun Misner age 26 scott norris age 28 Wade Parker age 22 John person age 24 Anthony Rose age 23 Jesse steed age 36 Joe Thurston age 32 Travis Kirby Phil age 27 William Warneke age 25 clayton witted age 28 kevin Wujek age 21 heads-up eager age 27 all these brave mens were taken from us way too young leaving behind families and friends let them never forget let us never forget their sacrifice mr. speaker and with that I yield back

all right welcome back ladies and gentlemen now uh my old friend uh we've interviewed him many times for the radio now we're going to be on real america's voice 2 and wgs show house minority with the congressman for the first district of louisiana the honorable steve scalise is with us here this morning and house minority whip how are you uh sir good morning doing great good morning and uh congratulations on you know you're you're all across the web now and people can see you see all throughout this land uh thank you steve and uh yeah we're excited about it and uh certainly glad to have you on and thank you for your time this morning uh are you gonna be uh in uh the uh capital uh tonight for uh joe biden's speech his it's not a state of the union but his address to congress i won't be there jeff they limited the house chamber to only 25 republicans and 25 democrats no real reason for that the science you could clearly have a lot more people but that's what pelosi did so you know there are a lot of our newer members who haven't been to a joint address before would like to go so i said let them uh let them go in my place when we run the house next year we're actually gonna open it open it up uh so that we can have normal house proceedings again but until then you know joe biden's outside with a mask on saying you don't have to have a mask outside but let them let them make up their own science i'm to follow actual medical science science uh you know steve it's amazing how left wing this administration has been i think a few people realized that he would be left of lenin as john kennedy said i mean my god this agenda is horrible uh anything redeeming so far well i guess it's it's not quite a hundred days because every day they're in they do more damage but they've done a lot of damage and it's been a very far-left agenda like you said when president biden said that he was gonna govern in a uniting way remember all that stuff i'm to work with everybody i'm gonna work with the people that didn't vote for me well do you know he has yet to meet with anybody in house republican leadership i mean we're at about 100 days he's trump in trump's probably first two weeks we had meetings in the white house republican and democrat leadership talking about areas where we could work together biden's yet to do it he's yet to try to work with us the coveted bill had nothing to do with bovid 90 and that bill had nothing to do with covid 1.9 trillion dollars of borrowed money then you go to what they're doing on infrastructure over 75 percent of this doesn't have anything to do with roads or bridges or even broadband it's just spending borrowed money higher taxes horrible energy policy killing energy jobs wide open border i've been to the southern border it is a disaster beyond epic proportions uh then you look at what he's doing on foreign policy letting iran get a nuclear weapon china's just completely dominant on our economy again he just signed the paris accord which turns our manufacturing economy over to china and then russia's moving back into eastern europe what can this guy point to that he's actually done that's good it's unreal i mean you're exactly right it has been a disaster from the border to overseas to all throughout this country and here at uh louisiana our home state i mean look at what he's done to the oil and gas industry i mean he's declared war on it yeah the american energy industry is is going to be in a really bad straight i mean day one he cancels the keystone pipeline thousands of good jobs then he puts a complete ban on leases and permits on federal lands which of course for us has been devastating because the oil and gas industry was already in in a tough position prior to covet then covet guts global demand so you don't have any uh anybody buying oil the price of oil actually went negative never seen that in the history of the country and then it was just starting to come back and he puts this van in place so there's no investment in energy production in south louisiana port fuchsia on which i represent those companies are really really struggling and and by the way if it's all under the name of global warming and carbon emissions it's not like we're not flying around on airplanes or driving cars anymore we're just getting our [ __ ] our oil from other countries so john kerry who's you know the global warmings are turns out he was flying around on a private jet by the way 40 times more carbon emissions to fly on a private jet than flying commercial going to iceland to get a global warming award we busted him on that uh and and it's like okay where is he going to fuel his private jet uh he doesn't have solar panels on that jet he's getting that oil from foreign countries now so saudi arabia russia are benefiting and they emit more carbon to make the same oil steel can't be made in pittsburgh anymore because of his paris accord unachievable carbon emissions so what happens steel's still being made it's just being made in china or india where they emit five times more carbon so this is that pseudoscience this it's like this religion that they practice called global warming and they're and they're emitting more carbon in wrecking america's economy at the same time and uh of course john kerry now caught uh spreading uh information uh secrets to the iranians about israel and he should immediately resign and uh maybe he committed a crime with that kind of a leak uh steve do you think it's very alarming this is just coming out i surely want to get more information because uh israel's are one of our great allies uh the only the truly demo elected democracy in the middle east as we know president obama and vice president biden at the time were very hostile towards israel president trump comes in rebuilds that relationship not only rebuilds it but puts the embassy in jerusalem stands up to iran so they don't get a nuclear weapon to eviscerate us or israel and then biden comes in bringing back that old band again bringing back all the obama folks and uh you know john kerry if if he did this as you said uh potential criminal uh offense as well as just the national disgrace he ought to resign uh he he was adding no value anyways actually undermined american foreign policy in the past why would we bring him back steve the the only value he added was uh comic relief uh but uh we really need to get rid of him because uh he's a disaster so many of these people are just total disasters as you say they're bringing back the obama administration leftovers uh it's just a bad night susan rice is back you remember her we only have about two minutes uh at our of course home university tulane it was just announced that a guest lecturer is going to be hunter biden who's supposedly going to be teaching about the quote fake news what is the status of his uh laptop investigation doesn't the fbi still have that or are they looking into that i hope they're looking into because there's so many uh violations of of law that he's been involved in uh what he's done overseas taking money from foreign countries uh and how that conflicts his dad both when he was vice president now he's president united states uh they said he just signed a book deal for a few million dollars and the book sold like 10 000 copies you know was that just them paying off to keep the family happy i don't know but this kind of stuff is just over and over again disgusting look you should read the police report on the gun crimes he's committed in delaware it's in a police report and the police won't do anything about it and what's joe biden's answer to say hey let's go and enforce gun laws even if it applies to my son no it's to try to take away our gun rights people who abide by the law his son didn't i don't know if tulane's paying him money to go speak i'm not really sure what he has to offer uh but well this is unreal i mean can you imagine if if one of the trump kids who actually have a lot of really great things that they could talk about if they went to tulane they wouldn't even let them on campus right i mean tulane has gone so far left and my final question is you were shot in 2017 by a deranged leftist i think they were trying to take out a lot of republicans that day this guy inspired by hate the fbi ruled that suicide by cop wasn't that uh steve scalise a terrorist attack it was it was domestic terrorism and in fact the department of homeland security uh indicated it was but then for some reason when the fbi came out with their report they called it suicide by cop everybody knows it wasn't the gunman went there he was he was a bernie sanders supporter been in many bernie rallies but then he targeted republicans he had a list of six republicans names in his pocket he was he didn't know that there were cops there by the way the two police officers with me on my details are playing closed officers and they started returning fire and yeah thank god they were there they did their job heroically these nuts that want to defund the police uh god help us there were no been over a dozen members members of congress killed that day but he tried to kill the two cops we got a roll but uh love to have you back on keep up the great work uh see scalise with us right

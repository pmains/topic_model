but we wouldn't be here this morning if it weren't for others if others that made it all possible for us to be gathered here this morning and they're still making that possible i've had so many miracles in my life i wouldn't have a ship sailing with seven seas if it wasn't for joe manchin i went to the hospital in huntington west virginia with my name one every time i go up that driveway to that hospital i am just overwhelmed with gratitude for what has happened what he has done for me and what has happened in my life this whole country boy from quiet del west virginia growing up on a dairy farm never dreamed in the deepest uh concentration that anything like this would ever happen to me and i never thought that maybe bill mcnutt would invite me to do what we're going to do here this morning bill's one of these guys that just can't quit he won't quit and he's involved in so many things i can't keep track of it but one of the things i'm really proud of him doing is in corsica texas he got a gold star family memorial monument placed on the courthouse lawn the first and only one on the courthouse lawn and he had to fight a big problem to get that accomplished so bill thank you for that it wouldn't have happened without you today we have every state has gold star family memorial monuments in them and in july we're going to place one in hawaii in guam i helped take that island back so i want to go back and see what what it looks like now but in west virginia i'm so proud of west virginians the communities of west virginia have already placed seven of these gold star family memorial monuments and i am proud to say that charleston west virginia has the largest one in the country as it should be but many states have many of them and there's six more in west virginia in the process right now so we're going to end up with 13 or 14 of them but that big state of texas they're gonna outdo us you know everything's big in texas so i know we're gonna be outdone but senator mentioned how proud i am to be a part of this this morning and so grateful to you for what you've done and it is my extreme pleasure and thrill to be able to present this award to you uh it is such a magnificent emblem of our country of our nation of our freedom and the all the privileges that we have so thank you very much for being here and thank you for being willing to accept this award well thank you woody thank you so much thank you i'll let you put that back thank you thank you ladies and gentlemen [Music] i've always said there's a couple people you never want to fall on speaking and that was one of them woody um i can't tell you how humbled i am and an honor this is uh not just for me but for the state of west virginia for two of the recipients both to be from west virginia i look around i see so many and general crane in the national guard is our military and that's who we rally around and i always said this it wasn't for our national guard i don't believe the country would really know the effect that we have and the fact our guard does because it's the one that keeps us connected the national guard and the average person on the street they connect to the guard we don't really see our military unless you go to a base so how you all represent and the quality of the people that you have in the organization and what they give for us they're there all the time the greatest honor i ever had and the greatest title i ever had as commander-in-chief being a governor of the state of west virginia and i i took that so seriously and i was so proud and privileged to me that was a greater honor than being governor but you had to be governor to be commander-in-chief so they went hand-in-hand um i look around and i want to thank so many people but to the veteran service officers what you all do and i say you're the unsung heroes people are needing your assistance every day they depend on you they have nowhere else to turn and sometimes if you're not their mouthpiece nothing gets done if we don't hear from you and with that i want to say to my staff tamara boggs who's our state director but when i look at kim berry and and who we have our brian and we have terry and we we have our whole group here and mike and we have so many charles and all of y'all marcus and the group in the back there i see all my they make it happen and they understand the value of our service people what woody was saying and what bill's been saying is that for a state that is small in stature and has on tracing is the greatest military veterans uh basically per capita we have a greater uh service per capita than most any state so we've always been the first to call when it's been called when the country's been in in need i look back at the greatest generation world war ii my father and the army i had one uncle in the marines and i had a james which a lot of you all knew uncle jimmy we call him a james he was in the uh in the navy uh and um the story about uh and when i was growing up my grandmother his mother my grandmother would tell me that uncle jimmy was afraid the war was going to end and he couldn't serve so he left high school early and she received his diploma and uh because he wanted to make sure he was in the service and got into the fight before he got all the way to san francisco when the war was uh v-day and and he always made sure that he was part of that generation i i look at those and the greatest attribute from a generation of woody has been basically and what makes them the greatest you never heard them brag you never heard them talk about much you always heard them take a full responsibility for their own actions and i think that's the thing that we miss so much people willing to say i made a mistake or i'm willing to serve or basically do whatever they're responsible for doing woody in this generation did that that's why they were the greatest generation but when you think of george marshall the story that bill told us and and him starting out with 1939 180 000 that's all we had sir and build that up to 8 million by 1943. uh the united states was the arsenal for the whole world we saved the world because of what we were able to manufacture if it wasn't for our manufacturing capabilities the energy that we had the coal that came out of west virginia that forged the mines and the steel and and built all the ships and and equipment that we needed to help save the world from fascism uh i think and i've always said this my little state gave so much and so few gave so much for so many and i see the sacrifices of veterans given a veteran gives a sacrifice basically putting that uniform on you're saying i'm gonna take a bullet for you i'm gonna protect you that to me how do you say thank you you know and to have an award saying what i did is represent the people of west virginia my staff and all of you all the best that i could in being on the veterans committee being on appropriations to where we basically assign what money goes where and the priorities we have as a country that's extremely important for me and i have that opportunity and i'm going to do it and do it the best of my ability with that we have challenges we had a challenge as you know the horrible situation we had in clarksburg va we're not only going to correct that we're going to prevent that from ever happening any place in the country no veteran should ever be put in a situation such as that and no veterans family should ever have to go through that we'll make sure that never happens again we have a hearing finally holding people accountable um we can do better and we'll intend to do better woody williams has basically represented everything that i know that i've ever seen in my life that's good about west virginia and he represents in such a way it's such a classy way wherever he goes and he's so proud of it and here's a person that came about 10 miles from where i grew up so we're in the same part of the state so i know it well and uh the area that he came from was kind of the farming area i came from where the mines were the deep mines uh but within 10 12 mile radius so the the character of woody being able he's he'll tell you you've heard the story if you haven't heard the story he tried to get into the military what at 17 or 18 and they told you were too small too short too short and why why did you want to go into the marines well i didn't like that ugly armor uniform that's exactly correct he wanted a pretty uniform and he held out until he got one but by the time he was uh you went in what 41 well i didn't i couldn't go until 43 43 tried to get him right to start couldn't get in then he got in about 19 20 years of age by then they said we'll take you were we glad they did it wasn't for that who knows what would have happened

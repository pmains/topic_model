republicans are making it clear that they are not in favor of free and fair elections first violent insurrectionists tried to overturn the presidential election by force and now republicans at the state level are trying to ram through laws to suppress the vote they're closing polling locations they're not allowing counties to do outreach on vote by mail now florida's following a national trend texas republicans are not doing this to stop voter fraud they're doing this to stop people of color from voting it is our responsibility to ensure that no matter where you live in the united states of america the right to vote and the access to that vote is protected democrats in texas fought back and they blocked one of those bills by walking out of the state house and we killed that bill it is time for everyone in washington who believes in our democracy to show the same level of backbone congress can protect our right to vote by passing s-1 the for the people act which would block these anti-democratic state laws it's already passed the house and now it sits before the senate here's the catch even though republicans represent a minority of americans and a minority in congress they still hold outsized power over our democracy why because of the filibuster senate republicans blocked the independent investigation into what happened on january 6th by using the filibuster and they'll likely block the for the people act by using the filibuster as well it's time to get rid of the filibuster time to pass the for the people act and time to stop this assault on our democracy join our fight

hi my name is kate mckibben i'm from wilmette new hampshire i'm a real senior citizen 71 years old and proud to live that long i have elective surgery coming up later this week and if i wasn't able to if we didn't have medicare i wouldn't be able to have this operation and if i didn't have this operation i would very probably end up as a semi-invalid i find it deplorable that people feel that medicare is some sort of an entitlement we've paid for medicare we paid for the whole time we worked we donated every single paycheck we shouldn't have to choose between living comfortably or being able to be mobile or healthy and not going bankrupt it just shouldn't have to be that way and it we have a system now that we're not we have a system where we're covered and frankly i don't want to see it destroyed

I'd now like to introduce newly elected City Council member james Van Bramer he was among the founders of the queens pride house and has been an unwavering positive presence the GL and LGBT community for many years Thank You senator gillibrand I just want to say that we are so lucky to have someone as smart as hard-working and as tough as senator Kirsten Gillibrand working on behalf of the LGBT community in all of the communities to me there are many people who aspire to leadership positions some who have already been in leadership positions but the true mark of leadership is when you were in a position to help people when you had the opportunity to change people's lives for the better what did you do did you stand up when you had that opportunity I can't speak for others but I know that Senator Gillibrand while she has had the opportunity while she's been afforded that leadership role has acted swiftly and powerfully on behalf of people now my partner is here Dan Hendrick is a little shy but he's standing right there we've been together for nearly 11 years may first be eleven year anniversary and I passed yes and and I just want to say on a personal level I'm my partner we talked about this beforehand he once served in the military the United States Navy and he was a linguist to Senator Joe and and he was removed because of the shameful shameful don't ask don't tell policy an honorable discharge but removed nonetheless from the opportunity to willingly serve our country it is an absolute disgrace than anyone would be denied that opportunity and i want to say we have for being such a champion such a stalwart for helping to move the entire Congress and I believe probably our president to doing the right thing soon not later sooner we know that explosions are still happening so I just want to say thank you and I'm so proud to endorse you I will do everything we can to keep you we're lucky to have you Thank You senator Gillibrand

clearly is i already have here okay my name is david litz i'm the executive secretary of the national action wise for suicide prevention and um me and uh and a couple folks on our staff here will be um kind of walking you through a little bit about what the action alliance is and some of the important things that are happening on a national level to prevent suicides things that i think that you all will want to know about uh so in addition to ice cream which i'm sure you all came for you know where hopefully you will leave with some some knowledge and some perspective that you didn't have when you obtained the marine uh we're expecting uh representative napolitano and representative tim ryan here surely and when they come in i'll introduce them to make some opening remarks um but until then i just want to say that suicide prevention depends upon which side of the coin you look at you can see suicide prevention as being one aspect of mental health if you look at it on the other side you can see that mental health is one better mental health here is one of many strategies that we would use to prevent suicide uh depending upon again which side you look at it suicide intervention is part of mental health or mental health is part of suicide prevention um and they're both true so let's look at um there we go so uh now let's go back to deal so we're going to give you a little bit of an overview about what the national action alliance is all about some of the achievements that have been accomplished in its relatively short lifespan um we'll go through the four initial priorities that we're really focusing on as a national alliance and then i want to talk with you about some things that members can do to promote suicide prevention and guess what i'm not going to ask for an things that you can do that actually are free um other than you know some uh some commitment of political capital so to speak um so let's go to the next slide just a very quickly framing of the magnitude of the problem of suicide it is really one of the leading public health problems in our country the 10th leading cause of death the second leading cause of death among young people and uh there's been a significant increase in suicides uh among uh middle-aged adults 35 to 64 it's about uh the same number of people died by suicide as uh died to breast cancer much more people died to suicide than to hiv um or in about three times the number who died to homicide and because auto accidents have gone down significantly um now more people are dying to suicide than um than vital auto accidents so at this time representative republican do you want so i just want to talk with you about um you know the history of congressional support for suicide prevention um goes back to the 97 98 time frame when um both houses of congress passed resolution resolutions um making it clear that suicide prevention was an important public health problem and that we needed to address it we needed to develop a national strategy so the first national strategy was developed in 2001. um shortly after that there was funding um for the dearly smith memorial act um i'll say a little bit more about the connection to that to congress but that funds on grants through samhsa the substance abuse and mental health services administration for states tribes and campuses to do suicide prevention work it also funds the national suicide prevention resource center which all of us have a job at um there's also then funding for the national suicide prevention lifeline which connects also through stamford connects crisis centers across the country i think there are about 150 now um certified crisis centers that are linked to one number so the person now in this country and military people around the world can call one number and get a person who's really expert in talking with them about suicide and perhaps their own desire to die and then there's of course some legislation that came out of congress supporting suicide prevention in the va so let's go to the next slide um there are definitely many members of congress involved at various levels and previous members upper right hand corner is a representative former representative john mchugh he's now secretary of the army and he is one of the co-chairs he's the public sector co-chair of the action alliance and then on the left is a former senator um gordon smith from oregon and uh senator smith is the private sector co-chair he's now president and ceo of the national association of broadcasters which many of you may know are also very active in promoting mental health issues um bottom right hand corner another shot of uh ah there we go senator smith uh along with secretary sebelius and secretary gates that launched the action lines back in september of 2010 um and then here we have our very own representing nepal town in a briefing not too long ago that included some suicide prevention content um so the next slide this is just a a list of members or former members that are involved in the action alliance um we also have just um brought on a senator byron jordan who's been long a champion of suicide prevention among american indians american indian youth and and then of course the representative palatana so at this point would you like to make some comments thank you thank you very much um wonderful to be here to have uh such a wonderful reception with the ice cream right on um it is really uh important for all of us to continue doing recognizing the work that is being done by the alliance and others but i certainly want to know that mental health is beginning to take a little more holding capital uh the recognition the fact that staff is here and some of the folks that support the issues that we're all been promoting for i don't know how many years we've worked extensively to continue the outreach but i certainly thank the alliance for bringing in um us together again and continuing the dialogue that is so critical to all of us as you know we've got the mental health caucus uh that we're hoping to re-institute we're in the process of doing that but being able to get organizations to come and talk about it through members of congress and their staff so that they can begin to understand the severity of the problem because it isn't something that's going to go away it's getting worse and we were involved many years ago with latinos and suicide that was still the highest percentage in the us attempted suicides ages 9 to 11 expense so that caused us to begin to look at our own backyard and say well what can we do would we reach out to what's being done well samsung initially had a little bit of money when we started the private project which at this point now is called the year mark and so now where we've been this is the third congress we've attempted to get it defunded to put in 200 schools clinicians to work with children to begin at an early age to identify the the children's emotional problems that show in behavioral aspects in the classroom uh the promised athletic schools high school is currently in 16 school is still growing it is now picked up by state of california by the county of the fact that it's in california city because it's indian market we can't get a lot of funding out of samsa that said there are many programs what we need to do is find out how do we connect all the docs and being able to get out to the young people you you let you you know you need um continue to send your message to others uh we just had the uh um right to talk a couple days ago uh to talk about uh it's okay to speak up it's all right to share sorry to ask for help and we have to have great partners essentially almost a decade ago with entertainment institute council to make sure that the media understands how critical it is but that i don't want to show the problem show solutions and use real life stories to tell the people that it's okay to seek help because there is help uh maybe not enough and that's something we need to begin working on the murray diet which they still do yearly programming awards we all need to know what we're all doing and be able to work together in the network and be more cohesive in our and getting some of these programs to be addressed funded recognize and spread the world of the word the word uh national broadcasters is on we're hoping to get other folks to be able to spread the word in languages guys because and so those are areas that we're very heavily working as you will know they don't have those little boundaries uh just look at the color of your skin or whether you're rich or poor um and it's still the third leading cost of uh death in youth 18 uh 15 to 24 that's something that we need to understand that we need to begin working towards getting our young people to understand there is help and of course everybody says well i don't know how many of you understand spanish but in my age in my um age range there was you're crazy you belong in a crazy house in a microwave well it's not totally the truth anymore i mean we need to recognize that things prey upon us and that causes us to begin to have uh concerns and we need to understand whether there's women's menopause whether it's the students worry about their grace and begins to falter and begin to have um psychotic episodes but i understand that this appraisal of a lot of people i know who might have seen a shooting or somebody who lost a parent in war or whose parents are divorcing those are mental health issues that we need to help our youngsters few words because if you don't then they become exacerbated and become things that later on in life prevent these gestures from really fulfilling your life so the fact that we want to continue working on suicide prevention on alerting people what the signs are and how you can spread the word if you will to anybody everybody students uh college students uh grandparents for goodness sakes uh because i know the story of some people telling my aunt we thought my uncle was a little bit off but he was the richness he happened to be a schizophrenic and never talked to anybody uh and then of course uh with mental health resources this funding senses we need to continue now glad first of all recognizing that this is the issue in our modern day world and we need to be able to work together to counter that of course the education the training and of course making sure that there's enough personnel to answer the calls in the emergency phone numbers that that we provide them um the mental health task force that i culture with uh tim murphy uh child psychologist is the other world peaceful jesus laker who's founded the new york knicks uh mark dallas daisy with the stars uh and of course he has a job three-time female blessing champions of the world and um these are people who are in their family or personally are suffering from from donors middle notice and they're recognized and they're open about it many more of those so if you need any and meet anybody or hear of anybody we need to know who they are because we want them to have people understand that they are annoyed that there is an issue maybe other will begin to seek help because these people didn't seek help the mental health services of the military critical because and i i carried the banner for years right after um we started with the war in iraq this wendy is a different one people coming home are going to have homes we are losing 22 soldiers that date to suicide a day unbelievable and unacceptable so how do we work to be able to help those families deal with it to help the veteran you can hear or even think somebody's thinking because they're getting things away or because it's learn the symptoms and understand that we can help there is a way to be able to reach someone but you've got to understand what what you need to look for so again i thank the um members of the action lawyers the advocates of the mental health community but the american foundation persists that prevention providing the ice cream thank you very much and we hope that you will be getting out that we have a study reward because let me tell you been very early in this room and we know some of them and there's only maybe about 20 people here so thank you so very much to all of you for having uh come and participate of this my colleague we are very lucky to have some members of congress who understand that the the importance and this is one of them thank you great thank you um thank you dr lewis for calling captain thank you this is um unfortunately a topic that we keep having to have discussions about i want to i want to thank grace for always being a leader in the issue of mental health here in congress and i just want to say a couple things that i think are potentially relevant first and foremost is that we have to deal with this in a comprehensive way and i i love just the three or four words that david you're going to talk about later about resiliency and connectedness and hope we spend a lot of our time working with military folks and we know the rates of suicide are very very high a lot of it's because they aren't connected a lot of its they they end up very isolated in places in their towns and cities across the country where they don't have anyone to talk to and i just want to share with you an initiative that i'm associated with from a foundation that's starting called the mindful nation foundation and they're doing work where they're creating a veteran's core of vets who will be trained in alternative approaches like mindfulness meditation yoga a variety of others where they will learn these techniques or they already they may already know but get them connected 30 or 40 of them send them out into the world skilled in the social media to be able to go back to towns like youngstown ohio or somewhere some other small town in the country and begin to go and find these vets who won't go to the va they they're afraid they're going to get labeled with post-traumatic stress and they won't go and they become more and more isolated more disconnected and i want these vets to be trained in these alternative therapies and then go out and do a search and rescue to find them in their own communities and start little groups around the country in these alternative methods that really seem to be working uh in so many ways more and more of that more and more people are using things like mindfulness meditation or other forms of meditation where they're being being able to process a lot of the trauma that they've had and they're also able to bring some more balance into their system another thing that i wanted to mention too because secretary sebelius is involved in this is the new research going on not much of it funded through through nih and the institutes of health here but i think we need to do a lot more and the component of this obviously a short term how do we stop things now but a lot of the research that's coming on with stomach imbalances a lot of people don't know 95 of serotonin is in your gi tract they're starting to call your stomach your second brain and a lot of trauma food diet all of this thing all of these things can affect the balance in your stomach whereas serotonin the feel good hormone is produced and so i think it's important for us to recognize this as a potential contributor to depression and isolation and all of these things so we really need uh to take this and i know the alliance is doing this in a very comprehensive way and we don't do that we're going to limit the opportunities that we have to really solve these problems uh in the long run so i'm very thankful and and for the openness that i think dr litz that you promote uh not getting pigeonholed in the sand well this you know it's just medication or it's just this was just that we've got to really look at this why is this a problem and what are we doing to address them and for us sometimes we get so things are so complicated today that we think there must be a very complicated solution to some of our things uh solutions to some of our problems when the reality is things are so complicated that the solution sometimes is very simple like are you connected to anybody do you have a friend you have somebody to talk to that may be the difference from someone who's been very traumatized in their life whether it was a shooting or a gang accident or a parent or domestic abuse that what tips them from killing themselves or not killing themselves is they have a best friend or they have someone that will listen to them so that simple solution cannot be underestimated uh or a little quiet time each day or different techniques to try to process some of the trauma that you may have so i'm just very thankful we are totally supported from our uh military mental health caucus for what you're trying to do here very thankful that you're taking such a a strong approach on this and thank everybody for being here and we can do the work in conjunction with you embracing our pockets we want to be a part of it and we just think that uh lastly that there's so many resources that are being wasted by young people young lives talent energy creativity that that ends too soon and you think about the military side of someone who's trained as a marine uh or a soldier and has all these great skills that we admire as americans and they have trauma and if they can overcome it to bring that success story to our economy to our education systems uh to our social service organizations wherever they may get back involved once they help themselves is a boon for our country and a talent that we can really tap into so thank you so much um unfortunately i have to take off my staff will be here and we want to partner with you as much as we can whether it's the vet school or anything else that we're doing so thank you so much i will say there are a couple of extra seats in the front i know that's my favorite spot that's right that you can have my heart relaxed i wanted to make one more connection with senator smith who is our private sector co-chair and the gary smith memorial act um it is um this fall will be 10 years since senator smith lost his son for suicide and the yearly spent memorial act was named after his son so with that i want to dale who introduce our deputy secretary of the alliance and she's going to take you through a little bit more of an overview of what the actual alliance is and what it's doing um andy romero is my mental health coordinator has been on it since i hired years ago she's passed a bill in her own state of mental health so you've got to know there's people in the hill that really have a lot of background and have the institutional knowledge in this minor order at this point i'd like to just show a short video they'll kind of um give you some context for what the action alliance says the launch of the national action alliance for suicide brought together an impressive group of our nation's leaders from both the public and private they chose world suicide prevention day to begin their work together suicide is a personal and national tragedy we have lost too many people to a very preventable cause of death and it doesn't have to be this way suicide is a very personal issue for those of us touched directly it knows no boundaries of age gender ethnicity income or profession it was almost seven years ago to this day that my wife and i received the news that our son had taken his life there is no way to describe the loss of any child it is the most challenging thing a parent can go through in this world it tests the limits of every human emotion and leaves those left behind questioning every thought every comment and every missed opportunity that survivors believe might have prevented the tragic loss the effects of suicide run deep more than 34 000 americans die by suicide each year that's one suicide every 15 minutes i work with the counselors at our school to prevent suicide something to me that is very important in all native american communities suicide is the second leading cause of death for indian youth ages 15 to 24 and is 3.5 times higher than the national average i lost five friends last year to suicide it was something hard not only for me but also for all the adults and other youth and tribal council members of mescalero it was hard because it wasn't a year span when we lost these people it was all within one month suicide reaches into all parts of society research indicates that there are increased suicide rates among veterans and suicide rates among service members recently reached historic highs within the army and learning board secretary of defense my top institutional priority is taking care of those who have won the burden and paid the price for protecting our nation that includes doing everything possible to prevent military suicides it is always a horrible tragedy to see a service member safely off the battlefield only to lose them to this scourge we can we must and we will do better it really violates our basic warrior ethos that ethos is as important as it is direct and so never leave a fallen comrade behind that is what motivates us but as proud as we are and what we can accomplish on this one we neither can nor wish to go involved the national action alliance brings together top leaders from the public and private sectors to build on noteworthy achievements in suicide prevention as we come together today and stand unified in this room as a nation to mark this day i would say that it is the lives you've saved in your years that matter most and when it comes to preventing suicide we all have that opportunity let's get to work let's roll up our sleeves let's pull together the very best of ideas and let's go to a higher plateau where we are actively and anxiously engaged in saving human life the national action alliance is not just another high-level committee that will hold a few meetings and write a report it's a public private collaboration with real responsibility to take the steps needed to accelerate our work in suicide prevention we don't have one life to lose in this world and we're here to bring the full force of our nation's resources to bear on confronting the challenge breaking the silence and stopping the pain and suffering because so many things divide this down so many things have been ripped off but this one must not this one doesn't register republican or democrat this registers i'm here today to talk a little bit based on my experience as a survivor of my suicide what i remember though it's been many years is the under hopelessness and despair would be in the place where you want to kill yourself we have the ability we have the tools we have the knowledge to restore hope and health to those who were challenged like my son was by holding out the light of hope for others by letting them know we need them we need our soldiers we need our family members our brothers and sisters we need to preserve the greatest asset the greatest resource of our country which are our brothers and sisters our children and parents i have said on many occasions like this that those who do this work work on the side of angels well talk to transition out of that one but i'll try it's wonderful to be with you all here today thank you promised women and others for hosting us this afternoon it's a pleasure to be with you i'd like to take you through a little bit of the background of the actualize and what we've been up to recently so i'll start with the background um envisioning a nation without suicide our mission at the action alliance is to advance our national strategy for suicide prevention in a three-pronged fashion first is to champion suicide prevention as a national priority and we've seen our members do this in many ways for example we've seen facebook partner with samhsa and the national suicide prevention lifeline to strengthen their crisis support for facebook users we've also seen the international association of chiefs of police begin the development of a national strategy for law enforcement officer suicide prevention we've seen the national association of broadcasters produce psas about mental health and lastly we've seen the department of justice incorporate suicide prevention into one of their existing grant programs which is focused on american youth these are just a few ways in which our members are serving as these champions um congresswoman certainly are doing that as an example here today as well we're also catalyzing efforts to implement high priority objectives of this national strategy and i'll speak to that on the next slide and cultivating the resources that we need to sustain progress we're only about three years old and we still have a lot of work to do continuing to advance this strategy and means in other ways is what will help us meet our goal of saving 20 000 lives in five years so to catalyze the implementation of this national strategy we prioritize some of objectives from the national strategy that can produce the systems level change that we need to substantially lower the burden of suicide dr let's earlier talk about some of the statistics with 34 000 deaths per year is actually an old statistic it's actually closer to 40 000 a year now and also objectives that require the public-private collaboration in the national leverage that's offered by the national action for suicide prevention so our members which are about 200 fold now are advancing these objectives um in ways that are enhancing our national infrastructure for suicide prevention and also advancing suicide prevention for specific populations and settings these are a couple examples of some of the recent and forthcoming accomplishments of the action lines that speak to uh objectives of the strategy so some of our recent accomplishments include revising that national strategy that we've been talking about it originally came out in 2001 it needed an overhaul so we can reflect the latest in science and practice this is a pretty young deal dr litz only went back about 15 or 20 years talking about some of the historical milestones here on the hill um so it's still a pretty young field we've learned a lot in our short assistance and we wanted to incorporate that in a new roadmap for our nation a new strategy for suicide prevention you all have copies of that national strategy a little light reading for later and that was released last september by the action lines in the office of the surgeon general we've also developed a report and a website that will help improve the quality of care for patients who are suicidal in boundary health systems such as emergency departments and doctors this will say a little bit more about that initiative shortly we've also produced resources for workplace suicide prevention dr liz mentioned this age group of adults in their middle years and how do we reach them so there are there's the task force that the actual alliance has produced a few resources including a comprehensive blueprint for suicide prevention a manager's guide for post pension or after care what do you do if you lose someone an employee in the workplace and also a couple sets of videos one which is tailored to gain more support from ceos at the leadership level to embrace suicide prevention in the workplace the other to reach the firefighter community and the risks that they may be at in responding to various forms of trauma over the next few months uh we're going to release a couple of things that may interest you uh first is a comprehensive set of resources for suicide prevention in the juvenile justice system in this system suicide is the leading cause of death and so this is a very comprehensive set of resources that will help juvenile justice and the mental health systems partner together and to aggressively address this leading cause of death also a first ever prioritized research agenda for suicide prevention that will point our limited research dollars towards the areas that will likely help us reach that goal of saving 20 000 lives in five years next is the plan for assessing and evaluating the implementation of the national strategy this point will capture evidence of both progress and outcomes as we work to advance its 2012 version of the national strategy and then training guidelines for clinicians across all disciplines these guidelines will address gaps problems and opportunities related to clinicians suicide prevention capacity these clinicians are our safety net for patients who are suicidal and usually they don't have the knowledge and the skills needed to assess and manage suicide risk so these guidelines which will come out later this year will help address their training next slide okay so this required strategy that i've been talking about stresses uh that suicide is the complex public health problem i think representative ryan is talking about the complexity of this issue and how we need to address it in a comprehensive fashion and there are multiple risk and protective factors at play but it's also a preventable public health problem it emphasizes that we all have a role to play in its prevention and it outlines ways that diverse partners can take part in promoting protective factors such as social connectedness that was breakfast a couple minutes ago access to effect of health care and dialogue that is stigma-free that encourages folks to go out and seek help in various forms also in reducing risk factors such as substance abuse access to legal means of suicide poor quality of health care and others and then advancing that comprehensive approach to suicide prevention intervention and postpartum kind of a full spectrum of care so around our table the action lines are around 200 high-level leaders from diverse sectors including the congresswoman we also have folks from business defense education faith communities health care justice research traditional social media and organizations that serve native americans veterans and other populations uh we also have um mr baker who is in that video who's a consumer mental health services and is a a survivor of his own suicide attempt other folks like him who have lived experience around this table next slide at least as i mentioned earlier we prioritize objectives with the strategy these are our four initial priorities and now in the next couple of minutes we're going to outline them in greater detail and i'll start with data and surveillance so currently i know data surveillance is not a very sexy topic but it's a very important topic we currently have about an 18 month time lag on the national level of knowing the scope of a suicide problem in this country related to deaths by suicide or mortality data though this life has decreased from about three years to 18 months we still have a long way to go to have better access to timely data that can do a number of things it can help us monitor trends in the data it can help inform our policy and program development it can also help us evaluate whether it is what is making a difference at any time and what that difference is there's also a need to improve the quality and usefulness of these data both mortality data or death by suicide and on the morbidity side which be suicide attempts and foster suicide so with the leadership of the centers for disease control the action alliance has developed recommendations for improving national data systems for suicide related uh surveillance and a couple needed action these are just a few examples are promoting the use of standard definitions both in how we code suicide and how we survey about what the problem is and in utilizing recommended shared recommended data elements in our surveillance efforts also another area for action is improving existing mortality and organic data systems we do have a number of uh systems in place but they do need improvement or enhancement or expansions such as the national violent death reporting system though it says nationalism only about 17 states we're going to certainly learn a lot more about the scope of the problem that this was implemented nationwide a couple of others are adding data variables about global populations such as lgbt where we know more about suicide attempts and thoughts of suicide among the population but we cannot tell you how many lgbt if you're dying by suicide because we don't have the systems in place to capture that data so i'll stop there and i will turn it over so one of our task forces asked the question could we end suicide among those who are getting health care in this country and you know if we could i mean so how many deaths are acceptable to people who are in the health system and what are the next steps that we should take um this task force pulled in the leading experts around the country in how to treat people who are dealing with desire to die desire to take their own life and they look they found this example in henry court health system in detroit they had a population of about 200 000 people uh that were in their mental health cardholder system and they ask themselves you know what can they do to really drive down suicides in this population so over the course of about a decade really doing transformational things in four years they had cut the suicide rate by about 75 and then shortly after that they went 10 full quarters without a single suicide among over 200 000 people that are mentally ill folks so um this kind of set an example you know can we replicate this can we make this the norm in this country instead of the exception so our task force um let's go to the next one our task force now is working with systems in about eight days eight or nine states and since uh probably our interests we've got kentucky arizona texas tennessee indiana new york wisconsin utah and missouri that are involved at some level in this and we're trying to figure out what is essential in to replicate what henry board did and let's do it in behavioral health settings and then buzz also test it in mainline health systems and see what we can do can we replicate this and make this the standard of care in this country again instead of just something that happened to happen once in detroit um so we're driving this ahead we're we're trying to find partners who will fund this um and the sampson has contributed some money to funding it and we're hoping you know to in the next two or three years to make some real progress i want to now turn it over to colleen who's going to talk a little bit about what we're doing in healthcare reform one of our priorities is to integrate suicide prevention into the implementation of the animal where we care act great thank you david and for this time and encouraging adoption of similar measure measures in the private sector to date you've really been working with cms to provide resources and technical assistance around suicide prevention while there are some behavioral health expertise within cms we really help provide some content to specific to suicide by providing white papers literature reviews and such so going forward there's really four areas that we're focusing our efforts on where there's a lot of opportunity to collaborate with cms and really integrate suicide prevention into their work the first area is early identification and intervention for those at risk the second area is the delivery of effective treatment for suicide users high risk for suicide an important area is improved data collection for early identification and intervention we've known through the national violent death reporting system that folks who die by suicide are engaging with the healthcare system shortly before their death so there's a lot of opportunities there to be providing screening when there's indicative risk for suicide the second area is the delivery of effective healthcare treatment we spoke earlier to the point that within the field not everyone is trained in suicide prevention even if they are a mental health provider so how can we encourage folks to be trained and to deliver effective care so if we're paying for treatment we know that it's effective evidence-based treatment the patient is receiving the third area we know that when the patient is discharged from an emergency department or an inpatient study they are very highly visible suicide during that transition so what opportunities are there in health care reform related to care transitions and follow-up care that we can take advantage of to improve these care transitions to close the loop for these patients at higher risk there's a number of very low-cost interventions as simple as sending out caring letters to post after discharge saying we're here we have services don't forget to you know re-engage with us and eventually shown to produce suicide as well as examples of engaging the crisis center network and doing outgoing calls and follow-up calls to patients at risk again of the variable resource intervention that kind of stays live and the fourth area is improving data collection katie spoke to the need to improve e-coding external cause of injury codes to the better idea of who's showing up in emergency departments and hospitals for intentional injuries and being able to target our interventions to those will start with um so the the last of the four priorities that we wanted to talk about today acknowledges the fact that we know that some messaging around suicide can actually contribute to what we call contagion it increases the rate of suicide so if you have headlines if you have a news story after news story about suicide you will actually increase the rate of suicide in a population that's exposed to that media um so we're trying to change the conversation as we call it around suicide in this country um and so that there are fewer details about suicide and less prominent coverage um and and less coverage that makes people think the suicide is more common than it is which may lower the threshold for someone who's right on the edge of perhaps taking their life um we also know that positive messaging particularly stories of people overcoming adversity can actually lower suicide rates in population so if you have even someone on oprah winfrey let's say um or some show i guess it's still on help me anyway i don't watch tv um and if you have someone some celebrities say you know i was thinking about killing myself i was at this point in desperation and then this and this and this happen that actually gives someone else hope that perhaps tomorrow will be better and that kind of exposure lowers suicide rates in the population so we think that this kind of messaging changing the conversation this country is really important so um we're working out we're reaching out to the media we're also reaching out to the messengers a lot of those messages come from the government they come from the centers for disease control and they uh announce new statistics they come from the department of defense independence affairs from uh sampson hhs and they can come from congress as well so we're trying to change those messages so next slide and so what we want to do is have more messages about solutions and fewer messages about the problem and there are a lot of solutions we have about four narratives grown in this country that aren't helpful one narrative really got going about two years ago and you would think from what you read in the papers that if you were an lgbt youth and got bullied that you were going to kill yourself i mean that was just this social narrative that got picked up okay with that enough we're not military you go out to combat you get exposed to horrible things you get ptsd you come home you start drinking the relationships go to pot and you kill yourself okay third marriage middle age um you're uh you lose your job you maybe get another job making half what you did you lose your house you lose your family you're desperate you kill yourself then the fourth one um is you're an 80 year old guy your wife dies you've lost everything you know maybe health is failing so you kill yourself so we have these four narratives going in this country that makes people believe that suicide in those situations is much more common than it is and guess what the vast majority of people who are in any of those situations do not kill themselves they don't even make attempts they actually find ways to get through and so we need to get those stories out and this is something that um i would like to propose um to all of you who have uh you know the ear of a congress of a representative that think about veterans day we've got veterans employment problems right and we've got veterans that are having a lot of problems and they're feeling like i just don't know how to get through so we have proposed proposed and honey did people get this content cheap in their pockets for this veterans day event and what we're proposing is that each member of congress could actually help us change the conversation to around veterans issues so it's not in the powerpoint it's in the other hand so um you know your representative could um you know contact a veteran or a few veterans um in his or her district um maybe get the people around them who have supported them in their transitions and make a story out of the success like the success included mental health treatment great success included an employer who stuck their neck out and hired that and that that um that employer can talk about all the great things that the veteran has brought into their company great so we can make at least for one day this um discovery for anyone who's interested in that we do have the resources actually develop a little packet that would kind of guide you through that so maybe we can work with any and we can you know anybody that likes this idea um you know like every every representative needs to have something to do on veteran's day right so here's a chance to do something we're going to create a little a little kit um that will help you put this together and there may be help from the department of labor that's the department of labor event vet's office representative here the va also has a wonderful web page to support employers and hiring vets anyway that's one thing i want to mention that that you can do another thing that members of congress can do is as you're working with agencies in the federal government any agency that deals with any of the many risk factors or protective factors for suicide has a role to play in suicide prevention and just like the um uh ojdp on juvenile justice groups you know added suicide into their grant programs just to make the grantees aware that they want them to address suicide this is not something that that requires an earmark it doesn't require you know more appropriations it just requires these agencies to add suicide in these rfas for their grant programs so as you're as you're doing oversight uh on your committees for these various groups that deal with these risk matches bureau prisons and uh barabinian affairs i mean there's a whole bunch of them um you know ask them you know or even insert report language that you want them to address suicide in these grant programs it's i think it's something that we can and we really we really need to do um let's just put up the last um ah yes i want to talk just a little bit about resources so right now um thank you for the reminder so the action alliance is funded kind of on a year-to-year basis mostly a great deal comes from uh really the commitment from samhsa to fund this but there's no line anywhere that's you know kind of ensures that the actual lines will be able to go on doing this great work um into the next year i mean we just we always we're living year to year uh so which is and we just we're just glad that we're living fortunately um you know we've had a lot of other federal support um you know acl from hhs um the bureau of indian affairs of cdc dod education department health resources services administration any health service the list goes on of other feds that have contributed important um work to the action alliance uh important funding meeting space for instance you know cost thousands of dollars just to have a meeting uh in a space and so um the army you know contributed that for one meeting and the national association of broadcasters for another um ani's said she would help us get space here on the hill if necessary so we're taking donations anywhere we can get it basically we just really believe in the work we think that we're doing important things we're doing things that have to be done at the national level they cannot be done at state and local level and so you know i would just uh encourage you all to think about how you can support suicide prevention i can support um the action alliance on how you can support veterans um and uh and if you have any questions uh you can ask them now or you may contact us because we have uh contact information um yeah you can uh um please feel free to contact ms anytime so we we want to get you out of here but we also want to answer any questions that you might have um so the floor is open it's your turn i just want to make an announcement um cassidy and my boss and representative danny davis introduced or dropped last friday at the garrett lakes ministry authorization so if any of y'all sponsors are interested i'll leave a little one page around the table up here thank you anyone else question comment comment and that is i understand setting goals about reducing and eliminating suicide are you currently out of your plans too and i guess it's more of a recommendation that the answer is no to track help seeking behavior either through websites or hotlines where the suicide reporting if there's more consciousness could actually go up it could look like the numbers are increasing whether or not but help city behavior could be a good indicator that there's traction right we um we just launched a group of leading scientists and evaluators to think through how we evaluate some of this stuff and how we set priorities on we call it the impact group it has leadership from the injury control research center injury control research center another site just funded by cdc at the university of rochester um national institute of mental health jane pearson is also completing that and again access to the leading thing so that's on the radar we're working how do you make sense of these different data um and sometimes things might go up actually that's a good sign right and especially if you can't get to you know data like death by suicide for a number of years those shorter term outcomes are especially important well it takes a while to get to that people take seven to ten years to seek help so if you show that that helps your behavior showing up i think that strengthens the um all for how many calls come in every month and you know when we reach the million calls for the year etc those numbers are going up as well so when you get the millions of years when you do that unfortunately we are attracted to it that's great thank you questions um i just wanted to remind staff that as your members if your members are putting on press releases um or sharing information on mental health we do ask that members put the national crisis hotline number on those press releases you can go to our see copies of our festival this is for congresswoman napolitano it's mandatory we do it on all of our press releases especially those well those that retain a mental office to say prevention and the reason is because as your constituents are reading this information we want to ensure that we're also providing a direct resource for those individuals to call a number if they're in crisis or somebody else is in crisis so it's just something to remember and if your offices do need additional resources if you need anything else about the action alliance please feel free to call our office if your office is also working on any mental health policy related legislation please let us know we just like to make sure that we're using correct terminology we would not want any other piece of legislation to go out from congress that label somebody as mentally defective which is currently in federal law so we just want to ensure that we're being very cautious of those things and that we ourselves here on the hill are also abiding by these um these guidelines that will help to rid the stigma as well so we're in congresswoman questions yes sir congresswoman wilson's office i applaud the efforts in social media how do you balance however the privacy issues that are involved there are very intimidated by social media that things might be disclosed on social media i mean i i'm not sure that there's anything that would be this close that they wouldn't put there i guess i'm thinking about hacking oh yeah um i really have not considered that i don't know that anyone in our group is that it's a very good question earlier i'm sorry yeah i'm just going to say that i know that facebook you know has a lot of people working on the security issues on facebook i assume that some of the other social media um do the same thing so they're always looking for um you know that kind of safety and security stuff they're so you know certainly you know direct that kind of question to to the actual you know media people whether that's facebook it has not come up in the actual lives just to follow i think behind all of this i'm hearing a need for trust and certainly trusting our brothers and sisters who will help us and let her perform uh i'm also hearing a lot of distrust about social media so on the one hand i think it's great if we can empower that but hopefully there's some sense of trust that if we enter that realm yeah it will be your honor you know um the connectedness pieces we're really um focusing a lot on connecting this and you've got great mental health treatment recovery all that kind of stuff wonderful for the people that will go get that care there's also you know human to human connections we know are very powerful for preventing suicide and so we're really encouraging that i was on a dod suicide prevention task force and you know over a period of three months we visited bases uh in military installations to talk to about a thousand more people um and they're all connected by by facebook and but we asked some of the younger um military and some folks that you know when when you want your supervisor when your supervisor's kind of checking in on you how do you want them to check in you know do you want like a facebook message you want a text message no i want to hear their voice so even you know we heard that from 18 to 19 and 20 year olds that still that human connection is a lot more powerful than you know a thousand five hundred facebook friends um so social media certainly um there's potential there in finding people who are putting clues up there and how do we respond to that um but in terms of building connectedness i have an idea a lot of times that's going to take more than you know done likes on a facebook page that's not good but it may not be enough questions comments great i think is there more ice cream

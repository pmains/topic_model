joining me now is congressman adam kinzinger of illinois he's one of the few republicans who has publicly criticized former president trump he's also one of two republicans on the house committee investigating january 6. congressman kenzinger welcome back to meet the press let me just start with this better be with you uh i'm a pretty cynical guy i've been doing this a long time on january 7th 2021 i i think i i i'm guessing you were there too i really thought okay this is it this is the breaking point we lindsey graham enough is enough count me out that it all felt like a moment how did a year later we go to a republican party that is more in the grips of donald trump than what it was on january 7th 2021 you know i think we could probably spend a half hour on it i'll give you kind of the most recent so there's a lot of stuff that led up but the most recent is january 7th i'll tell you within my republican caucus there was a lot of silence a lot of discussion where we go from here this was wrong and something happened two weeks later which is kevin mccarthy went to mar-a-lago and it caught everybody off guard they were shocked but in that picture he had with donald trump and i think kevin had told us something like oh i just happened to be in florida and he wanted to meet so i was going to meet with him no that was an intentional meeting that took like these you know the paddles that you see on on the tv shows and resurrected donald trump back to life and i think that one i think when history looks back it'll be kevin's meeting with donald trump which actually made him as immediate of a force as it was he may have come back but i think that was a very important meeting um did donald trump reveal what the republican party is or change it you know i think it's actually a little of both so i think on the one hand donald trump is a symptom of years and years of leaders you know profit driven radio shows whatever turning the base into this angry fearful you know victimized group of people who are saying look oh you can never get a fair shot you know as time goes by you're going to lose more and more political power keep in mind republicans still won just about half of every races but then donald trump came along and i think unintentionally because i think he just wanted to be you know that guy unintentionally got in front of a wave where people wanted somebody to blow stuff up i think it's a little both i think they've it's it's fed off each other the problem is leaders have to now interdict this fear and anger cycle and they're not doing it they're instead hiding look you're one of the you are one of the few republicans uh that wants to fight within the republican party to change it i want to play a video you put out earlier this week and ask you about on the other side on this anniversary of january 6 let's confront the anger fear and hopelessness that brought that dark day about victory won't come in a day a month or even a year but victory will come i promise you that you've started your country first organization but i gotta ask what are you running for because you've announced you're not running for reelection you announced earlier this week you would not be a candidate for governor um and i think there are republicans who sort of who would like to see the trumpest wing out of the party who want to see you run for something and and combat this and push back so what are you running for well look i think that was part of the battle is like you know do you stay in the house do you deal with the everyday the the kind of stupid arguments we have that are the same and trying to get your 200 views on c-span by arguing on the house floor that's an important role i've done it for 12 years after this and i'm more passionate about the country what is that role next in terms of running for anything i don't know but i know that this country first movement which by the way country1st.com has blown up i know that is a force of people that are angry and i'm gonna go with this we're gonna we're gonna get involved in primaries we're announcing a program at the end of january and it's not even just about the republican party though i think it's important it's about just restoring our ability to talk to each other and calling out the abuse that is happening of our voters every time they get that email that says send me 20 bucks otherwise you know xyz pelosi is going to kill your family that is abuse of our voters and they need to hear it you know the biggest problem you have though is the information echo chamber if you will you have sort of misinformation peddlers that you know people say you and the media need to stand up and tell the truth well there's a good portion of us that do but 30 percent of the country doesn't watch it you know you've got an algorithm that facebook is essentially mainline this garbage into people's intellectual uh veins if you will how do you change that you know i wish i had the answer because that is especially in the last year something that i've been even increasingly more concerned about i always believed there would be enough crossover that truth would kind of prevail the last year has taught me that there are people that live in a totally different reality all you can do all i can do is tell the truth and talk about the abuse because i think if people wake up to the fact that they are actually being financially emotionally abused by leaders maybe that'll be enough to awaken this giant this change but i'm going to tell you if we if there's nothing to interdict this cycle in five or 10 years we're in trouble uh we moved to the january six committee and i know you're always very hesitant to get in front of the the chair and the vice chair so i i'll get that caveat out of the way if you got no more information submitted to this committee right now how much of the story do you think you have i think a significant part i think where we're at right now we know a lot of the narrative and as i've said i think the most important thing is not even the day of january 6th that what it's what led to it um we have a lot of what's out there in the public venue what the president himself said the fact that he was watching for three hours on tv probably gleefully while this happened so i think if everything shut down today we'd be able to put out a power powerful and substantive narrative we still have more information obviously we want to get all right but let me try to give me one thing you don't have yet that you really think you need you know a witness or that you really or you need to understand that would make this a stronger report you know i think the one thing that if i could wave a magic wand and have more information on it would certainly be what did the president know about january 6 leading up to january 6th and i think what's important is it's the difference between was the president absolutely incompetent or a coward on the six when he didn't do anything or did he know what was coming and i think that's the difference between incompetence with your oath and possibly criminal that's where i want to get more information we do have obviously some some things leading up to that but the more information we can get obviously the better adam kinzinger republican uh from illinois i think the last time i had you on i i made mention that you you represented a part of where my family grew up anyway uh it's a wonderful part of the state thanks for coming on and sharing your perspective with us it's cold you bet

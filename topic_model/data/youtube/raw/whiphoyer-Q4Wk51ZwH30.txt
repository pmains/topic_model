the ranking member for yielding mr. Engel and I thank mr. Royce I've said this before I will say it again mr. Royce is chairman and mr. Engel is ranking member are an example for frankly all of us of how to work together productively in a bipartisan fashion to reach a result that is good for our country for our people and indeed for international security I also want to thank senators Cardin and corker for their leadership and in their involvement this legislation is the product of very careful and sometimes difficult negotiations on a bipartisan basis it is strong tough and appropriate response to Russia's attempts to meddle in our election process its support for violent separatists in Ukraine its illegal occupation of Crimea and yes it's unhelpful activity in Syria it also imposes new sanctions on Iran's ballistic program which threatens the United States our Gulf allies and Israel Russia's power comes from its ability to coerce other nations by its energy distribution in many instances this bill seeks to make it harder for Russia to use that type of coercion and empower other nations to join us in standing up against Russian aggression these sanctions will only be successful however if they are truly bipartisan and if Congress continues to play it's important and necessary oversight role Democrats and Republicans are coming together on this bill mr. speaker to ensure that the president cannot alter sanctions toward Russia without congressional review this is a critical this is critical at a moment when our allies are uncertain about where this administration stands with respect to Russian aggression I remain open to additional sanctions on Russia's energy sector at a later date if the Russian leader and his associates failed to heed the message of this bill that their business as usual cannot and must not continue once this bill passes the Senate as I believe it will Russia will know that sanctions levied because of its malevolent acts will be lifted only with the concurrence either tacitly or expressly of the Congress in the United States there will be no side deals or turning a blind eye to its actions this legislation mr. speaker will also make it clear that Russia's interference in Ukraine comes with consequences and it puts pressure on Iran to end its blissful ballistic missile program in addition it deters hopefully North Korea from pursuing its dangerous a development of nuclear weapon vehicles to deliver those weapons as close as the western part of this country I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and send it to the Senate as quickly as possible and yield back the balance of my time town from New York or gentleman Californians well Mr Speaker I wanted to recognize the good work of the Democratic whip mr. Steny Hoyer and also the Republican leader Kevin McCarthy on this legislation and saying

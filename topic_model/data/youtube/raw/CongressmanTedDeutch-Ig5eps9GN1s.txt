thank you a chairman caster mr. Griffith it's wonderful to be here thanks for holding this remembered day imagine walking outside to a beautiful sunny South Florida day the sort of weather that attracts visitors to the Sunshine States the backbone of our economy imagine strolling down lost all those Boulevard in Fort Lauderdale under cloudless skies and yet standing in water up to your ankles rising seas make sunny day flooding a regular occurrence in South Florida the South Florida Sun Sentinel labeled October's annual king tides the time of year when fish swim in the streets for my constituents climate change is already a part of their daily lives Americans around the country are experiencing their own climate impacts today rushing flood water stronger storms brutal droughts sprawling wildfires won't discriminate between Republican or Democratic households these impacts inspired me and congressman Francis Rooney to introduce the bipartisan energy innovation and carbon dividend act that's HR 763 our proposal would finally put a price on carbon for too long damaging carbon emissions have been left off the balance sheets of the world's largest polluters instead we are all paying the price that's why we need a market-driven solution that will get us to zero emissions last month the International Monetary Fund called carbon pricing the single most powerful and efficient tool to reduce emissions the IMF called for a $75 per ton fee by 2030 our bill gets there by 2026 we start at a modest $15 per ton assessed on fossil fuels at the source at refineries at mines and pipelines but the price quickly ratchets up $10 per year putting a price on carbon will send a bright signal across the economy that it is time to switch to a clean energy economy it will drive clean power innovations that make business sense as much as they make climate cents the big question is we as the money go 100% goes back to the American people as a monthly dividend check we've seen what happens when carbon fees hit consumers directly and the revenue is then used for purposes other than directly helping consumers it doesn't work and it penalize is the most vulnerable monthly dividends will allow families to afford renewable energy as an alternative to carbon-based fuels last month Columbia University's Center on global energy policy released an in-depth report on our bill and I would ask unanimous consent to submit for the record an assessment of the energy innovation and carbon dividend Act the report found that our bill will produce economy-wide net greenhouse gas emission reductions of 38 percent by 2030 exceeding our Paris agreement commitments by 2050 90 percent reductions it would also create over 2 million net jobs over 10 years and will return monthly checks of as much as three hundred and sixty-seven dollars per month to a family of four returning the costs of pollution back to American families is essential we need a drastic turn away from hundreds of years of unchecked carbon pollution toward a carbon-free economy but we must root this dramatic change in justice justice means those who have profited off the destruction of our environment pay the price justice means protecting people who have been locked into a carbon heavy lifestyle through no fault of their own and the balance of market driven solutions and protection for the most vulnerable is why this bill has the support of advocates from across the ideological spectrum from citizens climate Lobby to the Alliance for market solutions to the Catholic Bishops of America and other faith-based organizations I ask that this committee respond to their call by recommending that the Ways and Means Committee fully consider this bill it's important to set goals and targets but we need to do something to get us there this bill can do exactly that it's time to stop passing the cost for carbon pollution on to the next generation it's time to pull the levers in our economy to deliver real and lasting change it's time to put a price on carbon the energy innovation and carbon dividend Act will do that the stakes could not be any higher and we must act now again madam chairman I'm so grateful for the opportunity today thank you for giving us the chance to present well thank you to my good friend from Florida congressman Deutz you know you mentioned the flooding there in downtown Fort Lauderdale and if you haven't been to Fort Lauderdale it's a beautiful place it's known as the Venice of the United States well you don't want to be the Venice of the United States because Venice Italy right now is completely flooded over but my brother-in-law the day the one day of the the terrible flooding there sent me some video where the flooding now is coming over on to sidewalks into the street they had a lot of those little scooters they're practically washed away into the canal if we don't get busy this is going to get worse so I really appreciate your leadership on this the committee will be grappling with how we price carbon and what our recommendations are so thank you for your advice to the committee thanks so much

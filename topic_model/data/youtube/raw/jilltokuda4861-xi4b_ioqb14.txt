[Music] okay we are gonna get started hello everybody thank you for joining us here uh it's 12 noon here in hawaii bye bye i know we have some folks here on the call who are on east coast time so they are probably as we're eating lunch they're getting ready for dinner but wanted to thank everybody for taking time to join us today uh we have a lot of special guests here today uh we're joined by senator uh senator maisie hirono um as well as emily came from emily's list as well as our congressional candidate for house district 2 uh jill tokuda and really the purpose of today's convening and today's roundtable is really to just have a conversation with these three amazing leaders uh about uh you know the recent uh events coming out of the supreme court you know and and how will that decision uh affect uh women's reproductive health not just here in hawaii but around the nation and i couldn't think of having anybody else other than the three here on the call who have been leaders both at the state and national level to ensure that hawaii you know as well as our country and the women across the country have access to reproductive health and no matter what the uh what's going on across the country that we have people fighting for these rights so i want to say thank you both to emily and senator as well as to jill uh for joining us uh on today's talk story um just a few housekeeping rules if you do have questions please uh submit them to us we want to get to them uh so you can put them in the chat or they you have the q a box so please submit them and we'll try to answer as many questions as we can uh but to kick off today's uh round table um i do want to introduce jill tokuda who is our candidate here today uh running to represent hawaii's second congressional district so jill uh the floor is yours thank you jacob you know and thank you everyone for joining us today i know we have multiple time zones represented on this call which is very exciting but really just seeks to emphasize the importance of this discussion the urgency with which we are gathering and meeting today and in case you hear some chickens in the background by the way i am sadly in the middle of congressional district too i'm in kihei on maui right now um in the middle of you know a lot of listen and talk story sessions with folks all across maui but this was just so important so i'm very fortunate to be sitting here on maui um talking with all of you today uh and as jacob mentioned and as many of us know on this course see so many familiar faces and friends on here you know i am joel to quit um i'm many different things i wear many different hats i'm a mom i'm a former state senator i am blessed to be a former staffer for senator hirono when we fought the good fight when she was lieutenant governor and been a part of every campaign she's ran for uh since that point but most importantly you know i'm an angry woman today who really feels that this has got to stop sorry about that jacob we might have to strike that from the recording but i will tell you this you know when we first made the decision to run for congressional district 2 and make sure we had the right kind of strong representation hawaii needs in congress i happened to be in dc the evening that the decision was leaked and i remember taking it as a sign it really was a sign that we couldn't just sit on the sidelines anymore every single one of us had a responsibility and obligation to stand up and to fight it was absolutely acceptable for me to think that our children our grandchildren our sisters our daughters our nieces right now would be living in a world with less rights than we grew up with and the scarier part is than what comes next you know and really to me it was about how do we then stand up together and fight for those things that quite frankly are human rights they're an alien of rights that we have as people um and you know on this call today i'm very very happy to see folks that have been fighting for decades literally decades in the field to make sure that our rights are protected and you know to me knowledge really is power and i couldn't think of two better people to bring to this zoom screen uh than senator hirono my long time friend and emily kane from emily's list i'm pretty sure she gets all kinds of jokes about that but how perfect is that we've literally got emily from emily's list here on the call with us today to really talk about what's at stake and what we do next i mean if you think about it it's literally been a month less than a month since that decision was actually out since they overturned roe v wade that day we were praying would never come and it did and think about even in the short time that it's been since then how women across the country across the globe quite frankly have stepped up to say no more enough's enough you know from being able to pass on the house floor the right to contraception act really moving these things forward to states coming together to figure out how they would protect the people that live there that's so critical so important i mean even here in hawaii where we have strong laws it's about how we can ensure access um you know congressional district 2 is one of the most rural areas in our state and even before what we saw happened to roe v wade access to reproductive services abortions were difficult for many people who live in our rural community senator hirono represented this congressional district knows that access to reproductive health care uh is not equal even in a state as progressive as hawaii and we have so much more that we've really got to be fighting for to make sure that the protections that we know every woman every girl should have remains the same as well and so again just thank all of you for being here i think if i look on this card too we've got folks that have fought on the state level you know and with them we have battled many things together for making sure that we took on limited service pregnancy centers crisis pregnancy centers that were trying to embed themselves here in hawaii and still are and the fight is still going on for that to making sure that every person who needs access to emergency contraception has that to even more importantly now as i was talking to my sons my two teenage sons you know we've been fighting for such basic things as medically accurate sex education and now more than ever with the threats that we see we've even got to make sure that's shored up so every person is armed with the knowledge again the knowledge and the access to really have total control over their body so you know as i said in the beginning i'm really running because we've got to make sure that we get off the sidelines and we all fight together and senator hirono macy's doing an amazing job up there with some other partners but we need more in our ranks that are willing to stand up be bold and be brave and do what is right it's our responsibility it's our obligation as women to really carry this torch forward so i just want to thank all of the participants on today and i know many uh because of the time zones we'll be watching this later on a pre-recording but this really is our time to stand up and to fight as we have for so many years and really start to also train that next generation put more on the bench that will step up to both run for office you know and also make sure that uh these rights are protected from all parts of our country from all levels of government so thank you all for for being here um and you know really looking forward to an amazing discussion with senator and with emily and so with that i believe um just please everyone in your own little boxes clapping i know we can't see our faces but let's just give a round of applause to two champions who are fighting the good fight for us in dc and i would love to join them and make sure that we do everything we can to protect a woman's right to choose you thank you jill um up next uh the our next speaker needs no introduction uh so please help me welcome u.s senator maisie hirono senator oh thank you everyone and jill of course well said you have always been a fighter and i can't wait for you to join me in congress and emily of course emily's list has been at the forefront on the woman's right to choose so what we have here is a very outcome-driven extremist supreme court that decided that the individual who should control our body should be a bunch of politicians and not the individual and so what ensues now is pretty much chaos the millions and millions of of individuals maybe women across the country are now being forced to carry a baby to term and we all read recently the 10 year old girl who had to go to another state in order to obtain abortion services as a result of a rape this is what we were confronting all across our country and yes hawaii was the first state in the nation to decriminalize abortion however if the republicans take over both the u.s south and the u.s senate they will try to have a national ban on abortion which is why at every level we need to elect pro-choice people to state legislative offices obviously to the u.s house and senate and to the governorships a lot of these kinds of very restrictive laws are continuing to be enacted at the state level which is why we need to make sure that we are paying attention as they said to the local races in fact when i first ran for the state legislature back in 1980 when a lot of you a lot of you weren't even born even at that point there were forces that were trying to extremely limit a woman's right an individual's right to an abortion through all kinds of uh limitations on when that right could be exercised so uh these kinds of efforts and these battles have been fought by the conservatives for decades and decades and they had a lot of money to put to it and now they have an extremist supreme court perfectly happy you know to toss out a constitutional right that we thought we could rely on for almost 50 years what is going on at the national level of course is that we want to codify roe v wade and the the house passed such a bill the senate did not could not come up with enough votes but the effort will continue we're also putting forth bills that would make sure that people have access to contraceptives because that's also at risk and also to to defend title 10 which is a funding source for a lot of clinics to provide um the kind of complete services that that that the the clients need including um maternal maternal services so there's a whole range of uh bills that are being sought to to be passed at the legislative level in both the in state legislatures as well as in congress and one one of the more interesting bills as we live in a time when you know every time we click on to our computers that people are collecting information about us uh one of the bills that i put in is a bill called my body my data to protect people's reproductive information from being used by in fact you know states like like texas which is trying to criminalize abortion and so there are just all kinds of protections that we need to be focused on as we deal with the aftermath of this extremely right-wing supreme court decision with more to come there will be other constitutional rights that will be attacked and let me just say that this needs to be put in the context as i mentioned that this is a very outcome driven supreme court which leads us to focus on on court reform such as contemplating increasing the number of people on our supreme court talking about imposing term limits uh they should definitely have to follow a code of ethics one would think that if such a code were applicable to the supreme court that justice thomas would have recused himself from some of the kinds of trump um trump issues that came before them so uh we all need to uh fight together and and that's what um this call is about and i'm really glad that jill is with us and of course emily thank you thank you senator and uh our last guest speaker uh for today's event is going to be emily kane emily is the executive director of emily's list so um emily thank you for joining us thank you it is such an honor to be here i am emily from emily's list it never gets old i've been here for five years at emily's list and never get tired of explaining that while it is not named for me uh the acronym that emily is early money is like yeast uh still holds true today and at emily's list we are working hard as we have now for nearly 38 years to elect democratic pro-choice women like senator hirono like jill to every level of government it's a real honor for me to be here i've been on emily's list like i said for five years and i have to be honest on some days it just feels like a mazie hirono fan club it's basically what we do at emily's list is just fan girl over the senator from hawaii and it makes me extra proud to be here tonight especially to join forces with her to not just talk about something so important as access to abortion in our country but to join forces in supporting the incredible jiltakuda the other thing i happen to have in common with them both is i'm also a former state legislator i served five terms a total of 10 years in the main state legislature here and yes i am coming to you live from my house in maine and i served in both the house and the senate and i have to say we're just all so grateful at emily's list for the senator's leadership and that jill stepped up at this important time to run for the seat just to put things in context it was four weeks ago tomorrow that the supreme court decision came down think about that four weeks it was about four plus weeks before that that the decision was leaked uh well i guess it was about seven eight weeks before that that the decision was leaked and yet still when it came it hit us like a ton of bricks but i'll tell you at emily's list we were ready we've been ready in fact as the senator knows it still knows those of us who care a lot about access to abortion have been saying for years that this is what the republicans have been building towards this is what they have truly wanted and now we've even heard mitch mcconnell say it himself that if the republicans take the house and senate they are going to push and try to pass a national abortion ban thankfully hawaii has an incredible tradition of pro-choice democratic women's leadership and the emily's community is so proud to be a part of that and we can't afford right now to be sending any republicans from anywhere especially to the united states congress did you see that today there were only five republicans to vote to give women access and a right to contraception only five to birth control that's unbelievable it just goes to show you how anti-women they are how anti-science they are how anti-medicine they are and how much control they want to have over women's bodies this is really about control and it's really about freedom and the freedom to make our own choices as more states pass abortion bans following the supreme court's decision our country needs pro-choice champions in the house and senate now more than ever with everything on the line it's so critically important and on emily's list every day we're working to elect democratic pro-choice women who will fight for federal protection for abortion rights and for the right to make our own health care and family plan decisions for years anti-choice politicians have worked to strip away our fundamental rights to give government control of critical health care decisions they're working to ban abortion full stop this was the plan all along abortion is now banned in so many states it is likely to be banned imminently and even more and it hangs in the balance in many states across the country only because there is a democratic majority or a democratic governor so right now at emily's list we're fighting harder than ever to elect emily's list endorse candidates to office these are women who will protect our rights and to who will ensure that abortion rights do not depend on your zip code or your financial situation we are also working very hard to center choice effectively in the november elections here's the facts we know that the american people are on our side we know that the majority of voters are with us and if we can effectively tell that story and draw that sharp contrast between anti-choice republicans who want to vote to ban abortion nationally and democrats who want to protect the right to choose and expand access to women's reproductive health care voters come our way and they win the data shows that and quite frankly common sense shows that so we're grateful to be a part of the story when it comes to again the fan club that is emily's list for senator hirono and we're so proud to be with jill in this race it takes courage and it takes vision to fight for progress like senator hirono has and like jill has at the state level already makes me extra proud to be with him both today and just a quick note on jill because she didn't mention it but as a state senator jill introduced or sponsored more than a dozen bills defending women's reproductive freedom and expanding access to contraceptives in health care as a founding member of the patsy teaming political action committee she worked to help elect democratic pro-choice women in hawaii because she knows it works better when there are more of us there emily's list has long recognized jill for her leadership we've been with her throughout her career of service and we're excited to be with her with senator hirono and with all of you all the way till november thank you for having me i'm happy to answer any questions along with this awesome panel it's really a pleasure thank you and you know i'm gonna bring um everybody back onto screen now uh we have received a lot of questions so um i'm sorry if we don't get to all of them but we do have some great questions coming in um so i'm just gonna ask this first question the first question came from miss millie uh miss millie is a teacher at ilima intermediate and she's been leading the fight on menstrual equity here in the state uh so thank you miss milly for joining but her question is uh many of my students reached out to me to ask about roe being overturned over email and social social media they often say miss people say we have to vote but we can't even vote yet what do we do so her question is what advice do you have for hawaii public school students who are concerned about their loss of rights privacy and body autonomy i'll throw it out there to any of the three if they want to take a stab at this question when do you start jill thank you and first of all to miss millie thank you for getting your students at middle school involved in the legislative process that's amazing had huge victories this past session when it came to menstrual equity and i can tell you this um that it was a subject sometimes not always talked about but it's a real serious issue for women of color for vulnerable populations women in need um so many and it had to be talked about and what i think really put a face to that issue and can do the same when it comes to reproductive freedoms is that it was our children that stood up they stood up and said this demands your attention this demands your action um and really really appreciate that you're having the tough discussions with your students too they are recognizing themselves from what they see as you said in social media what they hear on the news that their rights are being taken away in front of them and the worst thing that could happen is if they feel powerless because they're too young to vote they absolutely have the power to me our young people will be the ones to lead in many cases to be able to help show the adults sometimes even in their lives that these things are worth fighting for and stepping up for it and so you know i always tell young people when they used to come to my office never shy away from your power in fact embrace your power but we as adults also have a responsibility to stand right there with them you know and while they can't vote and sometimes we know it's a hard discussion for them to even have with the adults in their lives if they can be the ones to pull in their parents their grandparents their loved ones neighbors that are voting and really expand the network and the impact and to show people that this is not just a group of students who care about the rights that are being threatened whether it be reproductive rights whether it be gender identity you know same sex marriage so many other things if they can show that this is about them creating a community of impact a community of advocacy within their adults and families in their lives that makes a huge difference and i think there's a lot of power to them and so for myself i've always just advocated for them to start to be that spark it's up to them and to pull in every adult that they can and to make it known to the policy makers and decision makers that um that they really are a force and that they are the ones helping to lead the adults in many cases towards the decisions that have to be made but i would love to hear from senator hirono and emily some of the great advice that they've given our young people on how to be true advocates and warriors out there on the front lines of this important cause i'm always very inspired when young people step forward whether it be on the issue of gun safety or in this case body automated autonomy these are students who recognize that they should have control over their bodily decisions that is fantastic and therefore i would say you know the power of the young voices to say talk to talk with your parents your aunties your uncles to say shouldn't i make a decision about my own body that's going to make such a that's going to have so much meaning to me auntie uncle father dad whoever and you have to vote to make sure that i will have control over my own body i think that is a powerful thing and then of course i i'm just amazed that young people already have this kind of awareness and to to uh if there are other classmates who feel that way and to raise their voices i think it would be a powerful powerful message to the adults and others who actually who can vote but i tell you the age 18 comes around really really quickly and you all are going to be able to make the decisions that will impact your lives in a good way and so never give up hope in fact it is the young people these days who give me hope that that we're going to be doing that the right things for all of you so thank you so much for miss nelly for sharing that story of your students awareness thank her for us i i have very little to add just two quick things i would add um number one is that young people have a very important voice in making sure the adults that they know go vote and actually turn up to vote i mean can you imagine if a cute little kid says to you mom did you vote i mean how do you say no to that right of course you don't want to let them down so i never underestimate the power of of kids to impact how responsible the adults in their lives feel to go to the polls and the second thing i would say is it's never too early to start volunteering on a campaign and i know they'll need some volunteers so i know for me some of my best campaign volunteers were people who weren't yet old enough to vote but who made a big difference whether it was making calls and phone banking helping with social media because young people often know a lot more about social media than some of us do um and again mobilizing in the community showing up to knock on doors to just stuff thank you notes and to be a part of events and i think there's a powerful lesson to be learned there for them about what it takes to run for office because most likely they're going to be the ones we're voting for at some point in the future so i would say those are my two pieces of advice number one don't be shy about hustling the adults in your life to go vote and number two volunteer as a young person for jill's campaign let me just add one little story of how important it is for children to be aware of the importance of voting i'm a really big supporter of kids vote that is a program where you know kids learn about people who are running for office and when i was running for governor back in 2002 i actually won the kids vote vote to become governor in hawaii it's the adults who were in my view let us trade so i actually i run into people who say oh i voted for you when i was in third grade and they're now like in their 40s right so there you go it's really important to have that awareness of the importance of voting really young thank you um our next question uh came in from a individual on the neighbor island and their question is um you know while our protections for women's rights stays in place locally we still have an issue on access on the neighbor islands what can congress do and what can our elected officials in washington dc do uh to expand access to the more rural areas on the neighbor islands well just as jill mentioned we've always always had issues regarding access to appropriate health care on the neighbor islands and we have issues with having enough doctors primary care doctors etc but one of the ways that we do fund clinics in our communities is through title 10 and that is millions of dollars that go to these community clinics to provide a range of of health care services including mammograms and information relating to abortion etc but during the trump years he cut title 10 funding extremely and he also imposed a gag rule so that any uh clinical clinics that accepted title 10 funds could not talk about or advise anyone about abortion so there was no abortion counseling the bible administration has reversed that thank goodness and i just this today i was on the floor of the senate to increase funding for title 10 clinical programs that is one of the ways that there can be a lot more people who will be able to access affordable uh health care in the full range so that was going on on the floor of the senate today and if i could just add to that you know given a lot of the conversations i've been having going through some of the most rural parts um of our islands which is part of cd2 i think again even more so at the federal level the fight to make sure and protect a lot of times access for rural communities comes through telehealth services it comes through the mail and if there are restrictions or you know on those kinds of means of being able to access reproductive health care um you know emergency contraception contraception all of these things then we were gonna have um easily half of our state in a very difficult situation based upon where they live in access already um you know to in clinic services so you know the fight that senator hirono is doing with so many others to make sure that those are also protected um those are critical so telehealth and male right now those are the lifelines in addition to trying to make sure we get real federal funding support for our our rural clinics that's critical too but those are some of the additional protections we've gotta show up and continue um to make sure i'm protected emily did you want to add anything to that you know i think again i think this just reinforces why we need more mazies and jills in office all across the country and in every state yeah because honestly um it's the kind of specific these two answers you just heard are exactly why we need more we're more these two women and more like them across the country because those answers you heard were specific right they're specific to hawaii specific to the roles that each level of government plays um and i think it's really it was just a real testament and testimony really in my mind of the power of the leadership of these two women um and what we can expect more of everything they said was spot on you know the next question we have from our audience is if a federal ban is to go into place what will happen um and i guess maybe to rephrase it you know if a federal ban does uh pass uh where does that leave the states in states like us where uh you know are these rights are protected so maybe senator if you wanted to start with uh trying to take a stab at that one well a federal ban would override whatever state protections there are for abortion care and that is why uh we have to make sure that we don't elect people at the federal level who will impose such a ban which means we have to elect pro-choice democrats and we can't let that happen i i cannot tell you how critical it is and how important it is that we want to have control over our own bodies i mean that's what it comes down to really who should get control over decisions of our body us or a bunch of politicians i think it's just pretty insane that these anti-basically anti-women politicians want to uh force us to have babies and as young as 10 years old um you know rape victim so we need to make sure that we don't sit on our colleagues and and not vote we have to vote it's all about voter turnout we have a lot of candidates who are pro-choice at every level and we have to do that otherwise we are going to contend with a national ban on abortion that just cannot happen it's gonna it's it's already bad enough as it is with almost half the states having trigger laws and all kinds of other restrictions including texas where they can bounty send them bounty hunters to come after you uh and where the the um just the pain of uh and the chaos is really visited as we all know so much more on the people who already have to deal with health disparities in our country that would be the black people and people of color and for people who already have access to health care issues and and disparate health outcomes already and it's only going to be made that much worse we cannot let that happen i would just add a couple of things the answer to that i mean of course everything the senator said is correct if you want to know what will happen you can take a look right now at utah arizona south dakota wisconsin missouri arkansas oklahoma texas louisiana oh you know georgia alabama mississippi tennessee kentucky ohio west virginia and south carolina it's already banned there completely and the immediate health care vacuum is jeopardizing the lives of people every single day it's putting them in a position where they have to travel hours and hours and days in order to get help it's risking women's lives it's risking the lives of patients who are trying to do the right thing for their bodies and their lives right and it's um it's stark and it's scary i was uh in wisconsin the day before the decision happened um and meeting with a group of women there who were hustling to try to put money together to put to get to open um another clinic on the border with illinois because the waiting period was already 30 to 60 days which changes the procedure right that you would need it there was already a 30 to 60 day waiting period before the ban took effect so it is a stark healthcare crisis and crisis um of epic proportion that we cannot let happen and that's why we are going to fight every single day to elect and re-elect pro-choice women at emily's list but pro-choice democrats across the country who will not support in any way a ban if i can just add on here if that happens women will die i mean that's just the bottom line we will see death we will see a return to back alley abortions the most dangerous types of procedures um this is catastrophic foreign to me that it's it's the line in the sand that cannot be crossed there is no if it happens we cannot let that happen which is why it's so critical you know in your email boxes on your tvs you sees you know ads for both emily's list and so many planned parenthood narrow we've really got to step up and support all of the organizations that are working with us to make sure that regardless of what we may have in our state right now really at the federal level making sure that that day never comes sadly we saw it slowly trickling in that it could happen at the supreme court level but that day cannot come if it's about protecting our young girls our women quite frankly i don't see how anyone who could sign their name to it or support something like that could look at a woman in their life a young girl in their life with a straight face they have daughters they have wives they have sisters they have a mother everyone has a mother how how could you say that she is less than a man how could you say that she is a second-class citizen with no writing controls or her body that's exactly what you're saying and we have to put that mirror in front of them every single person who even thinks that a federal ban could happen or should happen and supports that needs a mirror in front of their face to remind them where they came from and the rights and the lives that are seeing are less than them and so i think it's really critical it's the fear we all have it just cannot happen that's an absolute and that's why we've got to fight mahalo we are coming up on time so i do want to get to the last couple of questions uh this question is actually pointed to emily so emily one of our audience member astor that being that they live here there's no short of powerful women leaders that will protect hawaii's interest but how do i help support other women candidates around the country well first let me say only after you have fully supported jill let's start with that you have to fully support jill in every way you can and then when you're ready to do a little bit more you can come visit us at emily's list.org and that's where you're going to find all of our endorsed candidates candidates who are maisies senator hirono's current current colleagues like senator catherine cortez masto in nevada who's in a tough race there with a terrible ant choice dangerous republican named adam laxalt you can find senator maggie hassan there running in a key new hampshire senate seat one that was won just by a smidge last time by people a few just a few hundred votes you find senator patty murray the top-ranked woman senator in in the democratic caucus from washington state running in a tough race in a state you might not think might be tough but in a year like this every race is on the table you also find uh your colleague tammy duckworth in illinois who is amazing and inspiration and just we're going to send her back too we also have the opportunity to flip senate seats like in north carolina where states former state supreme court justice sherry beasley is running where we could put a black woman in the united states senate or currently they are none also future colleague val demings congressman val demings running in florida for a very key race running against marco rubio another anti-choice republican who pretty much this week said i don't have time to deal with abortion because it's not really affecting him it is it is senator and val demings is the one who can who can take him on you can also learn about candidates running for governor like stacey abrams in georgia or you can look to michelle lujan grisham current governor of new mexico my governor janet mills in a tough re-election race here future governor nelly gorba in rhode island we have lots of governors to choose from so many members of congress who jill will get to serve with too many to list on this call and we also are supporting hundreds and hundreds of state and local candidates running for key state legislative seats in really important places like north carolina where if the democrats don't hold the majority abortion will be banned right key states like pennsylvania michigan virginia north carolina kansas where if we don't hold on to majorities abortion will go away um and so you can visit us at emily's list.org but again only after you've done everything you can for jill thank you emily can i just add on and not to put you on the spot emily but i love all that shout out so yes we need all the help we can get for race for not taking it for granted um but you know one of the the best things i remember doing with emily's list with um senator hirono when she was lieutenant governor we saw the need to train up future candidates bench make the bench wide and deep with strong pro-choice women who get it who will both run for office and help those who are in elected office move policy and i remember gosh maybe it must have been in like 2000. we had emily's list come down and do a training in hawaii to really make sure that women knew that early money is like east and not just the money how to use it well and right in a time when elections and campaigns and rights are being threatened and things are changing i want to get elected and we will get elected be successful in both august and november but after that emily i think it would be great if emily's list could come back to hawaii uh and we could do a training to again let's deepen that bench and what we've seen with hawaii too i mean look at tammy duckworth she was from hawaii our people go far and wide to support candidates far and wide that's why you got such a great question like this and so would emily's list be able and willing to come back and partner with us to do a training session so that we make sure we keep sending strong democratic pro-choice women to every possible office in hawaii we can also do it sooner if we do it virtually right because of the pandemic we transition to all of our training efforts um to be able to be done virtually and so we are not only have put 30 nearly 38 years of training materials online at the emily's list training virtual training center where we give access to democratic pro-choice women who are interested in running and it takes them through a series of exercises to figure out what would i run for what do i care about enough if i know i want to run someday but not right now what should i be doing it's all there and we did that intentionally because we know that right now people can't always gather but we also want to meet people where they're at any time of year if it's 11 at night and you watch the news and something makes you so mad you want to run for office the online training center on emily's list is 24 7. it's open we also are we have we now also offer a fellowship program that runs twice a year where we actually do a boot camp style um over you know it's like once one weekend a month over several months where we build a cohort of women that we're creating a network for them nationally um to run for office and so we can certainly look at that as well and yes we would love to return to hawaii anytime you you don't have to ask me twice um i'll see what i can do as we plan past the election but in the meantime if there's anyone who's interested or you have that late night urge to run for office emily's list.org go to our training center and we can certainly uh help you start to make your plan thank you you know i hate to cut this uh conversation short you know but we do have a tight time frame so uh you know just really the wanted to give each of you uh time for some closing uh remarks if you can keep it brief uh we'll start with emily and um and then we'll go with uh senator and then we'll wrap it up with jill i just will close by saying thank you thank you to all of you who are on this webinar today and if you heard something that inspired you made you mad or may you learned something my ask is that you share it with somebody else this is the kind of time where people get overwhelmed with information bad information a lot of it from from the internet and if you heard the wisdom you heard from senator hirono the wisdom you heard from jill and maybe even i taught you a few things today um if that inspires you to to help jill moore to tell a friend about what you learned to make sure that they're as motivated as you are in this election that would be my ask of you and again make sure you've done everything you can for jill of all the money all the volunteer opportunities um and thank you most of all for being a part of this effort in such an important race for such a key leader i hope that everyone feels a sense of urgency because the highly money interests conservative interests first they're coming for our bodily autonomy and then lgbtq people contraception you name it they're coming after a lot of our constitutional rights because we have a supreme court that is not going to protect our constitutional rights and therefore for everyone on this uh who's been on this call please keep doing what you're doing but you just need to do even more of it which means that if before you would give ten dollars give twenty dollars if before you would spend five hours helping a campaign spend 10 hours i mean really consciously make the decision that you're gonna do something more with your own time your own resources because that is what it's gonna take thank you i just first and foremost want to thank senator hirono and emily for being a part of this really important conversation and i know many more conversations and calls to action that we'll have to continue and you know just to emphasize the power of knowledge and the power of the ask which emily's list is great at training us in that you've got to ask you've got to be bold you've got to take risks and quite frankly as a senator here will sometimes be uncomfortable but that's what it takes to do the right thing and put yourself out there but just in the time from this call that we've had um thank you emily we've actually had 10 people sign up to volunteer as a result of this call already so in literally 45 minutes making that ass makes the difference and that's what we've got to go out there and do we are a strong army amongst ourselves we are stronger together as was mentioned if we go out and we we ask our friends our neighbors our families to understand as maisie said the urgency that exists right now the real threats that exist right now not just our reproductive feelings but our right to exist as people they're literally cutting us down in terms of who we are where we come from and the ability for us to make choices all kinds of basic fundamental choices about our bodies about what we're able to do and so thank you to everyone for joining this call thank you to all that will watch this later and i hope it does empower you to stand up and take action because as senator said the urgency is now and as emily said you know the action is needed we've got to stand up together so thank you for allowing me to be a part of this and i am absolutely 110 always ready and you know that to stand up and fight side by side shoulder to shoulder with all of you and i can't wait to be in a position to make that difference so mahalo to everyone listening in mahalo to our panel and i'm really excited about where we go from here thank you and thank you to everybody that joined us we'll make sure that a copy of this uh recording is uh sent to you um but really want to thank you for taking your time thank you to our three speakers emily kane senator hirono and of course our congressional cd2 candidate jill tokura hello everybody take care

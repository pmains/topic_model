let's bring in Republican senator from Georgia Kelly Leffler to discuss the new developments in the case tonight senator good to have you back Thank You Shannon great to be with you so we heard from the Georgia Bureau of Investigations they tweeted out tonight that they were not told about the press conference before it happened today with the charges they were not consulted on the charges filed by the district attorney and that they are going to complete their own investigation you've heard we've had a number of legal experts on our air today who've said they think this is overcharged a tweet from Brandon Morris who's a senior editor over the conservative site redstate.com says this let me tell you what this guy just set up meaning the district attorney when these officers are cleared of all charges that this delusional DA has put on them there will be retaliation in the streets by people who believe the delusion this guy is selling irresponsible and inexcusable what do you think about what happened today well Shannon it's really important that the Georgia Bureau of Investigation carries out its investigation fully and thoroughly we need to get to the bottom of this this is a tragic very complex situation we need a full investigation and look we have to follow due process so that that justice can be served and we need to let that process play out are you worried about reports tonight and we've had pushback on this we're getting reports all over the place from police officials union officials others who are not directly tied to this that their number of officers not showing up tonight are you worried about how that impacts their ability to protect the city of Atlanta well absolutely Shannon I mean this is what I've been warning about with this defund the police movement it's a dangerous idea it not only puts our communities at risk but it puts the viability of our law enforcement community at risk and we need to stand strong with law enforcement to help them protect our communities and not create this environment where police are looked at in a way that they aren't creating this safety that they actually bring to our communities every day and so I have been warning about this and I'll continue to advocate to keep our law enforcement strong but also to enact those reforms that might be needed to root out those that that do wrong mm-hmm I think everybody agrees on that okay quickly when I asked you about big tech senator Holley is introducing something that would allow Americans to sue tech companies that censor political speech or hide content from competitors Politico said this there's no evidence of a systemic anti conservative bias on social media but the allegations have become a rallying cry for Trump Holley and their GOP allies so crying wolf over this well look you know it's very clear that there needs to be strong action and that's what I'm taking I'm sticky I'm taking strong action to protect the First Amendment the freedom of speech for all Americans regardless of their political party I've signed on to legislation to look at the limits on immunity from litigation that currently protect big tech you know if you look at what's happened it's all happened against conservative speech and we need to take a close look at that if you think about when 230 was written section 230 was written in 1996 before these big tech companies were founded it's time to have a fresh look because right now conservative speech is really under fire by big tech yeah and we're gonna keep on talking about that senator Leffler thank you for joining us tonight thanks for having me on

what's premium Senator Tom Cotton Senator we've got so many different things to talk to you about but first things first on this Twitter revelation we knew about the shadow band and couldn't get confirmation what is your takeaway from what we hear about the suppression of Dan Bond Geno Charlie Kirk and others well Brian as you said I think it just confirms what we all knew was happening that Twitter had engaged in censorship and Shadow Banning and blacklisting of center right voices Across America looks like they particularly had it in for anyone affiliated with Fox News as you mentioned Dan bongino and Charlie Kirk also Jay bhattacharya Stanford Medical School Professor who dissented from the left's party line on the coronavirus lockdowns and policies who often appeared on this network but it gets to a deeper a deeper point which is that the progressive left in America simply no longer believes in the principles of free speech and free inquiry and open debate they rely instead on censorship and Shadow Banning and Blacklist that's very bad for our democracy it's very bad for the spirit of open debate that any democracy relies on and I'm very glad that Elon Musk has exposed this and I just have to say that some of these Twitter Executives have testified before that these practices didn't occur so the the new house Republican majority I think it just has another line of inquiry for their oversight hearings in a few weeks you know it gets me it's like all the doctor said was that lockdowns are harmful for children we all knew that at the time you taught we interviewed a million parents and they all said the same thing my child is not doing as well then the test scores prove it when they get back you talk to any teacher who says the same thing that the kids are behind I mean that's what happens when you keep your kids out of school for a year who told them to do it exactly we want to get to the bottom of that but what he was saying was not so outrageous why wasn't that allowed to be said second thing when Jack Dorsey sits in front of Congress and he's under oath and he says he wasn't doing this now he said he wasn't Shadow Banning so maybe this is semantics he might say it's called something else visibility filtering so uh is he held accountable for that what happens in that situation yeah Ainsley I think our friend Jim Jordan the new chairman of the house Judiciary Committee just got an another line of inquiry added to his long line of inquiries for the oversight that needs to be conducted on the administration and on their allies in Corporate America another thing I want to point out is I mean Twitter is not a small company it is remarkable that this was happening and you had Executives lying in public in some cases misleading the public under oath and not a single person in Twitter spoke out went to a newspaper or another website went to the government went to a representative in Congress to be a whistleblower and say what was happening it just goes to show how monolithically left-wing these companies are absolutely and we wouldn't know any of it had Elon Musk not bought the whole joint for 40 billion bucks but now it's being laid bare something else we wanted to talk to you about another jaw-dropping development over the uh in the last hour and 15 minutes and that is one of your colleagues in the U.S Senate Kristen Cinema no longer is a Democrat she is now registered as an independent the big question is whether or not she would caucus or meet with the Republicans Or democrats if she met with your side it would help you you'd be back to 50 50. Todd Perkins says that fox is being told Cinema is expected to maintain her committee assignments through the Democrats suggesting she will caucus with the Democrats like Senators King and Sanders so what's your uh what's Your Gut tell you this morning about Kristen Cinema saying so long to the Democratic party well it's a reflection on the Democratic party and just how extreme and left-wing it's become in recent years they've essentially uh drummed Kirsten Cinema out of their party look we don't agree on many issues but I've told her over the last few years that if she wanted to dip a toe and the Republican party's pool we'd be happy to have her jump in with us as well I don't know I haven't talked to her this morning since this news has been breaking I knew this is something that might happen but I uh I would just tell her that if she wants to come over and join us we'd be happy to welcome her into our party we're a big tent party we have everyone from Susan Collins to Ted Cruz uh in the Senate with us the Democrats let's just say don't have that degree of diverse viewpoints and don't welcome people who dissent from their party line kind of like we saw in the Twitter story as well they simply do not Brook any dissent from their party line so but we'd be glad to Welcome Center cinema into our ranks so it caught us by spice this morning this week this interview was recorded last night she gave a 45-minute interview to Politico saying this Titanic news listen I know some people might be a little bit surprised by this but actually I think it makes a lot of sense you know a growing number of arizonans and people like me just don't feel like we fit neatly into one party's box or the other what I think is important about this decision and this move is that I'll be able to show up to work every day as an independent and not be you know stuck into one party's demands of following without thinking you know removing myself from the partisan structure not only is it true to who I am and how I operate I also think it'll provide a place of belonging for many folks across the state in the country who also are tired of the partisanship removing herself from the party structure but still caucusing with the party you we watch that together for the first time what's your takeaway well again it's a reflection on how extreme the Democrats have become and it's not like Kirsten Cinema is voting against Chuck Schumer's agenda half the time and she voted for both of their big spending bills their gun control Bill she voted to uh or to implement a very radical abortion policy as well it's just that she won't take certain steps that are too extreme for most Americans like trying to end the practice of unlimited debate and amendment in the Senate and make it a pure majoritarian body where the majority can roll over the minority and do things like pack the court system maybe in the Supreme Court make Washington DC a state federalize our election law to take over election Administration from our states this is all an example of how Democrats are simply trying to change forever the structure of American politics to their benefit she put her foot down on that last earlier this year and said she wouldn't do it and I think you've seen examples of punishment and retaliation coming from the Democrats at her they won't dare do that just again an example of how extreme they've become all right Brittany Greiner is home now she landed in San Antonio Texas this is the front cover of the New York Post I don't know if you can see this if you have a monitor but it says deal with the devil people are complaining we're so glad that she's home but people are saying that's not a fair trade this guy is one of the the worst criminals in the world listen to this this is Mike bronze take who's a former DEA chief of operations he's talking about how bad this guy is Victor boot listen Victor boot in my eyes is one of the most dangerous men on the face of the Earth on the face of the Earth without a doubt he transformed these young adolescent Warriors into uh Insidious mindless maniacally driven killing machines that operated with assembly line efficiency the U.S has indicted him on four Terror related charges including conspiracy to kill Americans what makes him a threat to the United States he is a shadow facilitator he's arming not only designated terrorist groups Insurgent groups but he's also arming very powerful drug trafficking cartels around the globe meanwhile Paul Whalen is still there is there any way that we can get him out Nancy Pelosi said that we had to trade for for the NBA WNBA player because uh Brittany Greiner because we didn't have any other any other way to get Paul Whalen out two he said he's in a different position he's in a different category they're accusing him of spying over there in Russia well it is in a different position Ainsley because he's not been accused of a crime that he committed you know Rogue regimes like Russia and China and Iran always accuse Americans that they detain unjustly as spying whereas Brittany Greiner uh whatever you think of the charges against her I mean did commit those crimes now we welcome anytime we bring back Americans who had been held under unjust terms of confinement or unjust length of sentences but we should have never traded Victor boot uh I just want to stress how dangerous he is this is not someone who is selling firearms for street gangs in Moscow we're talking about anti-aircraft systems tanks and artillery missiles and Rockets that fueled thousands of thousands of deaths rapes amputations torture dismemberment and now he's back with Vladimir Putin now he's going to help Vladimir Putin get all that stuff exactly it and this is it's not just about his past moral culpability it's about what he's going to do now this is not some decrepit 78 year old man who is dying in confinement he's only 55 years old Vladimir Putin has wanted him out for a decade but he's gotten even more insistent over the last year as he's gone to war in Ukraine a war that is increasingly supported by paramilitary groups private security firms and Warlords in Ukraine why do we think uh why do we think Vladimir Putin held Brittany Griner since her such a long term earlier this year because he realized that he could use her as leverage against Joe Biden to get back one of the world's most dangerous men that he could then unleash against the United States and our allies all around the world we should have never released Victor boot it was a dangerous concession of Vladimir Putin and it will set a dangerous precedent going forward well it's great that she is back home in San Antonio we just hope that Brittany Greiner now takes up the case of Paul Wieland so that nobody ever forgets about him as so many did for her a marine went over there for a wedding I know Senator thank you very much for joining us on this very busy Friday morning thank you all

i would just close by saying this um [Music] think about it we have a department in the biden administration that's more focused on finding undocumented wells than undocumented illegal immigrants think about it uh we hear about profits for oil companies who is the greatest profiteer of the action taken on january 20th of 2021 that made it very clear that the biden administration was going to be completely hostile as candidate biden said in 2020 to the fossil fuel industry vladimir putin went from sixty dollars a barrel to a hundred dollars a barrel it was that day on january twentieth twenty twenty 2021 that he was emboldened and we see what's happening now his war machine is being funded as a result of america no longer being energy independent and this whole notion that this is a high priority i mean we heard the same thing in regards to the border that oh this is a top top issue and the president repeats these lines when he gives for example the state of the union but that's not what's happening here it's all lip service and the american people see through it you need to refocus at the department of interior as well as divide administration in its entirety the american people are sick of paying four dollars a gallon for gasoline they're sick of paying two and a half dollars a gallon for propane to heat their homes well my colleague from minnesota can dismiss heating our homes as being important uh where i come from pretty damn important at this time of year including into april when we have temperatures that are getting down close to zero yet uh you guys need to refocus and you need to listen to the american people they want affordable energy that's the only way we reach prosperity it is all about job security economic security and national security

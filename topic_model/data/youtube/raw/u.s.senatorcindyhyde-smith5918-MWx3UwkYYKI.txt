thank you chairwoman feinstein and rankin and ranking member kennedy and i certainly want to thank our witnesses today we truly appreciate you being here and as we discuss the 2023 budget for the corps and the bureau of reclamation secretary connor i just really appreciate the time that you spent in traveling to vicksburg mississippi in february for a briefing on the yazoo area pump project that is a really important project to me it is one of my very top priorities because i have seen the suffering that has happened in mississippi but today i'd like to discuss environmental justice a topic this administration says is a top priority as well as you know the comprehensive yazoo backwater area project is a congressionally authorized core project designed to prevent to provide flood protection to thousands of residents in the south mississippi delta most of whom are african-americans i have visited this place many many times and i don't live far from it the yazoo backwater area com comprises of 1446 square miles six mississippi counties these are some of the most rural underserved counties in the entire united states this project consists of three components designed to be used in tandem including levees to keep mississippi and yazoo river floodwaters out floodgates to let accumulated interior flood water out and pumping stations to remove flood waters trapped on the protected side of the levee system when the floodgates have to be closed because the mississippi river is high and excess rainfall occurs all of these features have been completed except for the pumps unfortunately the epa in 2008 stopped the corps from completing the pumps the project's last remaining feature since that epa veto in 2008 the area has experienced catastrophic flooding nearly every year causing billions with a b in damages and destroying lives home property wildlife habitat and the environment in 2019 the yazoo backwater area which is more than 11 times the size of washington dc remained flooded for well over six months it was underwater it was disastrous on the quality of life for the people who live and work there many who are already impoverished two people lost their lives during the onset of the govern 19 pandemic in 2020 there was another terrible flood it again displaced residents and forced them into crowded shelters or to move in with family neither option ideal during an unprecedented pandemic recognizing that this perpetual flooding was simply not sustainable for the people or the environment and armed with the new scientific information the corps issued a new proposed plan for the pumps in december of 2020 unfortunately the epa last november put the brakes on the corps from moving forward yet again it simply dismissed years of new core environmental studies and thousands of pages of scientific information that fully justifies the pumps we often hear we need to listen to the science well what does the science say the science says the core's new proposed plan would not convert any wetlands to non-wetlands the science says the project would benefit all sections of the economy and contribute to the well-being of all area residents the science says the project would benefit wetlands aquatic species wildlife and wildlife habitat and every important resource that flooding has been destroying for decades but here's the real irony the current administration has placed environmental justice at the top of its priority list the yazoo backwater area population is nearly 70 percent minority with roughly 30 percent living in poverty the coors environmental justice appendix indicates that the pumps would significantly benefit low income and minority populations and it shows that more than 90 percent of the homes would be devastated from a 100-year flood event or minority occupied secretary connor please there's two things and i want you to thoroughly answer both of these for me if you would please share your thoughts on the environmental justice benefits associated with the yazoo backwater project and do you consider the core's new proposed plan to be consistent with this administration's emphasis on promoting environmental justice senator hyde smith i wish i would have started with your statement to when i got into yazoo because it took me a while to get to up to speed the way you just articulated it's a very complex system let me i'll get exactly to your points because i don't think it's ironic uh that this administration focuses on environmental justice um and i s and how we've dealt with the yazoo basin or how we're going to deal let me put it that way because yes we cannot move forward with the project that the corps most recently proposed because of the reinstitution of the veto that is correct and that's concerning because we've got to get to some project to address the uncompleted project as you mentioned and we are getting the attention that we need at a very high level to move forward a interagency group chaired by ceq chair brenda mallory she's convenience together and when i went down to yazoo in february it was with chair mallory to get a firsthand account and you cannot understand the system without that first-hand account in in because of the complexity of it uh so we need to address the intended project as it was originally conceived and you're right it's missing that last phase of the project so we've got to deal with that backwater flooding we've got to figure out the mix of structural and non-structural and when i say structural i think pumps are still in the mix for the discussion that we're going to have in this age interagency group there's questions about the science from some of the other agencies uh the corps feels very strongly that it's got peer-reviewed science but we need to have that dialogue about what exactly are the impacts to wetlands are we reducing the wetland function those are going to be some detailed conversations but i can assure you this is part of the environmental justice agenda to get to a project to get to a solution because of the factors that you mentioned with respect to minority residents in that area as well as the poverty level that exists in that area so that's why it's getting this attention and i just want to note i appreciate the fact being part of this group that there is a sense of urgency that we need to get to a reconfigured project and so i share your views the importance and i will keep you posted as that interagency group continues to work on that reconfigured project please do so and general spelman give me your knowledge of civil engineering please share your thoughts on how practical if even possible it would be to provide meaningful flood protection in the yazoo backwater area without a pumping station how would that be possible so senator uh he says you know this pump station was part of the project since it was initially authorized in the 1941 flood control act we've looked at 34 options to how to evacuate water from that basin and our recommendation we're certainly open to any other ideas that may be out there but we're confident in our science we're confident in our engineering that the pump station can be operated in manner that protects these communities that you mentioned but also protects the 38 000 acres of wetland that are are in that uh in that area so we're confident of that the other 34 options we looked at everything from looking at ring levees around every home we just could not economically justify that we've looked at elevating homes we looked at buyouts we looked at elevating roads and again not all of that after we got through that analysis was consistent with our long-standing environmental operating principles and some of it frankly we just could not get to economic justification we stand by our recommendation but again we're open to any other ideas that may be out there i appreciate your answer very much both of you and i know i'm over time thank you

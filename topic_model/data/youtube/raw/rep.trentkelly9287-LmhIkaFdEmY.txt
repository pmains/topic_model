Congressman I said earlier I said the you were a participant and a witness in in modern political history it went uh what we say 15 rounds yeah 15 rounds just like a prize heavyweight box right yes my question at the end of this and I know you stuck by and I think our full delegation as far as GOP stuck by uh uh Kevin McCarthy is the Republican Party specifically in the House of Representatives are they stronger or weaker because of this fight I think a little of both Paul to be honest listen uh at the very first all these negotiations you know happened going back to November of last year after the election so they've been going on and so 98 of this was already hammered out and uh 90 over 90 of the conference agreed that these were good things and uh and then initially Monday night I knew we wouldn't weren't going to get a deal Monday night but I figured we'd get it Tuesday or whatever the second day was but uh at some point it morphed into uh the goal post kept moving people started doing things for individual reasons not for the good of the country not for the good of the conference not for the good of the party but they started doing it for individual reasons and uh but but there were people who were just hard nose from the get-go and if you notice I sat right in the middle I talked to 16 of the 20 no's at least 16 or 20 if not all 20. and uh and it was an ongoing process I talked to them throughout I sat right there in the middle of it I was uh negotiating and trying kind of cool heads and so it's not surprising I think I think after all we're better off I don't think democracy is always pretty yeah I I see it in a way that if you're going to fight for that and you win it and Kevin McCarthy said himself he said he never gives up and this proves it so I see it as the GOP stronger and being able to do that and you you have this total acquiescence in the house whatever Pelosi said everybody bent down and I think a lot of Americans probably see this uh in the same way um here's a cut and I want you to comment on this of what uh the new speaker said and this was a little bit before of the final vote but here goes if Eric swalwell cannot get a security clearance in the private sector there's no reason why he should be given one to be on Intel or Homeland Security he will not be serving them so you're going to you're going to remove him from those communities Omar should not be serving on Foreign Affairs what about any committees for Elan Omar this is a new level of what the Democrats have gone Adam Schiff he has openly knowingly now used a fake dossier lied to the American public in the process and doesn't have any ill will says he wants to continue to do it so we're going to reshape I mean think about what happened in Afghanistan why did Afghanistan collapse so fast was the Intel committee under Adam's shift focused on impeachment and not on the safety of America why are people coming across the border that aren't a terrorist watch list what are they doing about it and their own members on that committee says it's not happening when it's true we need to have an Intel committee that looks at what's happening around the world and keeps America safe it should do exactly what it was created overseeing of the our agencies and others you know Congressman if you're okay with where we are in this country some of the appointments that this Administration has made you're either politically ignorant or you just don't give a damn but I mean this is akin to putting Bernie Madoff on the financial committee it is and uh and some of those folks will be removed from committees some of these constitutional officers who have gotten political will be removed from the positions that they are within the staff uh and lots of things but you know I want the American people to remember Nancy Pelosi didn't get 218 votes with uh one more vote to give than Kevin had she I think she had 214. she actually brought in someone drove them in with covet knowing he had his children and the height of covet and built a special thing and exposed the whole membership so she could get her last vote so you know this is not it's not as new it just went a little longer than usual I I do want to ask you this one of the controversies on here and I tend to agree with uh your group on this one as far as this uh what's the consensus call not the consensus call but the vacate call uh to motion to vacate this was one of the things that McCarthy apparently agreed to the number of members needed to um uh to call just just one that could call for a motion to vacate you want to explain that yeah it just means any member can say you know I make a motion it's a privileged motion which means anyone can make it and say I make a motion to vacate the chair and uh and listen this thing's been around for over a hundred years prior to Nancy Pelosi she made it where it had to be 50 of her talk because uh but it's not a big deal I mean if people are going to do that they're going to do that Paul but even at the end of the day if one person is all that does that or five or whatever it still takes a majority to vacate and uh I I just don't think it's going to make that much of a difference one way or the other I think it's good for people to feel like they have the input but at the end of the day a strong leader is going to be able to overcome that every time in most of these if their father will be vacated uh they'll be tabled and then voted on and it'll have no consequence he also agreed to a rule that says that any move to raise the debt ceiling must also be accompanied by spending cuts uh the rules package includes a resolution estab publishing a house select committee on the weaponization of the federal government McCarthy has agreed to vote individually on 12 appropriation bills rather than one Omnibus spending Bill a lot of people are in favor of that one the package also reinstates the Holmen rule which lets lawmakers amend appropriation legislation and reduce the salary of government officials and I got a couple more here lawmakers now get 72 hours to review bills before they come to the house floor Hallelujah and the rules package also includes votes on bills relating to key sticking points for conservative lawmakers including on border security and abortion among other areas any comments on those yeah I mean they're all good and listen it wasn't just this one group of people who negotiated it that's the whole body you've been hearing me say most of these things the whole time basically the only thing that moved uh since Monday of last week when we first started voting was the motion to vacate went from five to one everything else was already all those other rules were already in existence uh the first boat that we took and so there was very little movement except on the motion to vacate and then there were a few other little things that were in there I think one of the things that we've learned in the last 48 hours is exactly what you're seeing that these these changes and everything else were all on there and then when it got to the fifth and sixth and 7th and 8th and Ninth votes all the huddle up in the back rooms were okay tell us what you want and then apparently McCarthy did this over and over and apparently they were not able to at least clearly uh until the as opposition tell them what they want they kept moving the ball I will say I don't know if you saw where I sat but I'm sitting right in the middle of everybody who's loving the other way and I'm talking and you can see that the whole time and I will say there were uh somewhere between three and six started at six got down to three who all they wanted was McCarthy not to be speaker and that's okay because they were very clear about that they were very articulate I don't like Kevin McCarthy and I'm okay with that and then but the other ones a lot of those moved and when you would ask those other ones outside of that small group what they wanted they didn't want anything they were just enjoying the Limelight and enjoying the TV time and the TV hits and the fundraising letters they were sitting uh sitting right there on the floor sitting by us that's what uh some of them were doing about five or six see where I bet like they just didn't want Kevin McCarthy I know when we come back I want to ask you this how close are we to you getting your committee assignments and one more quick segment with Congressman Trent Kelly when we return in just a moment live from the Trustmark Studios Trent Kelly Congressman Mississippi the the the district one First District I have this real quickly here the total number of votes cast is 428 of which The Honorable Kevin McCarthy of the State of California has received 216. and now the hard work begins what we do here today next week next month next year will set the tone for everything that follows but I hope one thing is clear after this week I never give up well I don't think he ever had and and knowing how many votes that he had constantly over and over I don't think it was ever really in doubt uh when when Jim Jordan was nominated I probably that would probably have been the the the the biggest chance but of course Jim Jordan actually voted for McCarthy well yeah Jim Jim Jordan I mean you know this was tried to be made a freedom caucus thing and it was not a freedom caucus thing actually more people in the freedom caucus voted for McCarthy initially than voted against him and at all times during it but like Jim Jordan and Warren Davidson and Jeff Duncan and Mark Greene and Tim Burton those are all Freedom caucus guys and uh and they were with McCarthy strong the whole time the majority of them caucus so uh listen we're in a better place we've got some great rule changes and we just need to move on and we need to pass this rule package tonight uh get this thing pushed through and let's get to the business the American people let's hold the uh by an Administration accountable and let's start out let's start doing some things that are good for America well you guys have been away for the weekend so I'm sure the connectivity maybe as far as McCarthy he would know this but do you think you're gonna be able to pass that we'll have enough votes and and patch up that 20 to do this I do uh listen there are some people with heartburn uh on uh one you know on the kind of the more moderate side of the Republican party that are frustrated uh but Kevin's a good leader in that listen he'll come in there and he's like these rules the one they're affected the most maiden and uh him being the speaker and I'm good with these and I think we'll get those rose packages I don't think it'll be as contentious you never know though nothing's done until it's done but I think we'll pass a rule package tonight when do you think you'll get your community assignments and what are the what do they look like well they've got uh we still got a few chairs that were contested that they have to appoint and once they do that these uh the committee chairman appoint the subcommittee chairman unless there's on some other things going on with that so I looked by the end of the week uh to to have that other than Intel and that's leader appointed so you still got to do ratios on committees and all those things that have to be negotiated between the parties and so uh it's a little bit of work so this week we should the majority of my committees that should be on and uh to be reappointed to Intel that may be a couple of weeks we look at the the hearings January 6 Hunter and Afghanistan it's just the the three I'm not even gonna say the top three do those yes so uh well uh a little bit of some of those on the intelligence committee and uh ours are in conjunction with Jim Jordan and some other folks on oversight and also but uh ours will be the quiet part of it nobody will ever know I'm involved it'll just be we'll be uh we'll be uh getting a lot of the underlying facts and circumstances relaying those and part of the negotiations but uh the primary Committees of jurisdiction are going to be oversight and Judiciary but Intel has a large part of both of those yeah yeah well I don't think they'll be televised on most of the liberal networks anymore like they were before but they uh I guess C-SPAN will still televise some of them and I hope so because it's going to be interesting certainly Hunter uh and uh and one more thing the president was down yeah I want to be clear here Paul we're not going after Hunter we're going after Joe Biden for dealing through Hunter to do things illegal we're going after the president and not honor Hunter Hunter is just uh he's the one who was the Catalyst or the or the connection between the Nexus between uh the president doing dealings and getting benefits for being the vice president United States and president United States through his son I understand but the laptop is Central to this in many times what do you think about the president's visit to the border and I think the governor of Texas said it uh best it's two years of 20 million dollars too late yeah and I didn't even invite the Republican who represents that area but he's all about being bipartisan right so I'm taking these Democrats and I'm not taking any Republicans I I think it's just for the TV to say that he can be there now that takes one more thing he doesn't have to get beat up over what's what's one of your main objectives as you get back started in this uh as far as you know Congress yeah I mean my main objective is to work on uh to make sure we get a budget that balances to do that in a way that does not destroy our military and that's going to be difficult it's going to be hard work but that's what we should be doing and so uh just looking forward to working on my armed services we've got to get a form Bill through this year so we want to take care of our farmers and all the producers and all those people tied to the farm industry so it'll be a busy busy year legislatively for me absolutely in a fast two years before we get to the election again so Congressman Trent Kelly safe travels sir any final thoughts no but thank you so much Paul and thank the American people for enduring there you got it safe travel sir

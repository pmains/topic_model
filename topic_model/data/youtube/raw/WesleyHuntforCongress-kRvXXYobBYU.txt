i'm going to bring in wesley hunt who is running for congress in a district that i really call the texas energy corridor wesley hunt joins me now okay obvious question can texas supply the oil and gas we need this winter and if not why not so i'm running for united states congress a congressional district 38 in houston texas but this is the issue that's near and dear to our hearts and as we talked about you know natural gas is at a 10-year high right now and the administration wants to add a tax to that which is only going to push that price to the consumer right now gas prices are up 30 from last year it is actually all a part of this green new deal agenda and since it's not working and since it's not popular they're trying to hide it in a 3.5 trillion dollar tax plan now texas can do our part to supply our country with with with enough energy that that can last us for the entire winter time but the bottom administration cancelling the keystone pipeline you're protecting the interest of russia by allowing them to have their pipeline only make us more reliant on foreign fossil fuels crippling our energy independence this is a problem it's got to stop and this is why i'm running for congress because we've got to take back the house to stop the bleeding got it one more subject for you uh white house press secretary jen saki she says that governor abbott the governor of texas is putting politics above public health when the governor opposes the vaccine mandate politics above public health how do you see it under no circumstances is this the role of the federal government to mandate if an american citizen should or should not get a vaccine that is their personal choice look i am a vaccinated american and i'm all for it but i don't want the government telling me what to do it's actually a part of a bigger agenda it's a part of a socialist agenda and they want the government to take more control over our everyday lives that's not the american way and that's not what our constitution it was instituted for us to be able to live our lives and how we should make our own decisions based on our own health i applaud governor abbott i applaud governor desantis for taking the stand and no we absolutely should not mandate vaccines for american citizens is governor abbott stand popular in texas all across texas it is all over it is it is popular in texas because texas is it's actually about freedom it's about individual liberties it's about allowing us to make our own decisions look it's your health it is your body and by god who is the federal government to make decisions on these very personal issues so would you kindly move to new jersey and help us out because we've lost i live in new jersey and i'm afraid we've completely lost track of personal individual liberty and freedom i i've got space in my house sir if you ever want to move you can move set us straight please sir let me tell you come on down to texas we need you i don't think you do it was great having you on the show wesley and i good luck in the in the election coming up we'll see you again soon thank you so much god bless you thank you

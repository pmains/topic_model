Trump is set to deliver a speech on the tax bill this afternoon for more now are joined by the House Minority Whip congressman Steny Hoyer congressman thanks so much for joining us we do appreciate it Thank You Melissa glad to be with you I want to ask first about what has gone on in Alabama and if at all that changes the tax vote you're a colleague a Senator Chuck Schumer is seeking to delay a vote until after doug jones is seated as senator do you support that and what are the chances do you think that that could actually happen well I think that would be very appropriate as a matter of fact Mitch McConnell thought it would be very appropriate after Scott Brown was elected in January 19th of 2010 the day after Senator McConnell said there ought to be no more votes on the ACA until Scott Brown was seated the theory being that we had a new senator that the public had spoken he pointed out in Massachusetts we point out in Alabama neither one of our our home states if you will so it should be delayed Chuck Schumer is absolutely right we have a new senator a new voice that has been elected in Alabama and that voice ought to be heard on arguably one of the most important pieces of legislation I think one of the worst pieces of legislation that we've considered in a very very long time that will cause the country great harm so what is it I think McConnell was right in 2010 I think Schumer is right in 2017 and we ought to follow both of their advice what is the procedure for this happening well the procedure for this happening would have to be the Senate would agree to seat doug jones prior to final certification if there is no challenge and I don't think there's going to be a challenge and it is a pretty good victory for mr. Jones we do that in the House of Representative the vote we say there is no contest and we will seat the member and some numbers we seat the day after they're elected which i think is appropriate do you feel do you feel renewed hope congressman that perhaps the Democrats could actually defeat a tax bill I certainly hope we can be defeat this tax bill it is a terrible tax bill a terrible tax bill for working people a terrible tax bill in blowing a hole in the deficit and the debt and if offered by Democrats this tax bill will have received no Republican votes on the debt issue alone 1.7 trillion dollars added to the national debt which our children are going to have to pay and in the process and it raises taxes on 72 million Americans and gives the resources that speaker Ryan talked about struggling Americans the resources don't go to struggling Americans the resources go overwhelmingly to the richest people in our country and the corporations we need a tax reform bill but we also harm veterans in the process we we take the Work Opportunity Tax Credit away which has led to 300,000 veterans being employed this is a bill that has not seen the light of day that has not had any hearings has not had any witnesses to come before and most economists believe it will not be paid for and will leave at least at least a trillion dollars debt and secondly it will not have the positive effect on the economy that its proponents argue so it's a bad bill it ought to be defeated congressman when it comes to the math though it seems like that's an uphill battle to say the least given our residence in a high tax state though many of us are focused on the deductibility of state and local income tax right there were a number of blue state Republicans who I believe supported that of the bill in the in the house is there any hole any shouldn't say hope do you have any expectation they may change their vote as this has started at least to gain a bit more currency among some of their constituents is a real concern well I think it is a real concern to a lawful lot of states that have significant number of Republicans representing them and I think those belongings voted against their state's interest and their taxpayers interest so yes I think there would be some rethought I frankly think though some riri thought as a result of the election last night where it is clear that Republicans in Virginia in in other states out well in Alabama in even in Maine where you saw the voters who have a Republican governor who was against extending Medicaid under the ACA voted 6040 to do so against the wishes of their governor so I think you're seeing all over the country a disgust with the present leadership of our country and discussed with the Congress's inability to work and a support for Democratic positions on the Affordable Care Act and on this tax bill where you see some 60% of Americans saying they have no doubt that this is a tax bill for the wealthiest in America and not for them this is a tax bill that will take us backwards hurt our economy hurt the taxpayers we need tax reform we can work on tax reform in a bipartisan way we need to bring down the corporate rate to make it more competitive so there are many things on which we can agree but this bill is a bad bill and I think no Republican is voting for it on the basis of policy but on the basis of politics once this is resolved either way congressman you got any visibility on what infrastructure may look like other than what's been reported and what would the Democrats uh be looking for or to put on the table well we need an infrastructure bill but it's sort of like healthcare taxes infrastructure jobs the president said he was going to do all those he hasn't offered a single bill on any one of those issues including infrastructure he's just waited upon the Congress to do so and they haven't done so very successfully the Republican majority but we need an infrastructure bill I think there's broad agreement that we need to invest a very very substantial amount of money in our infrastructure not only in roads and bridges but our internet our grid our ports our airports we need to make sure that we are competitive with the rest of the world on an infrastructure and we don't have a bill from the president they've been a lot of discussion Pete DeFazio who's the ranking member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee has a bill obviously he's included in there are some revenues for that bill and that's the key revenues where you're going to get the revenues John my colleague has a bill in as well so that time real quickly though you really don't think you got a shot here I mean do you what this boats gonna shot at winning this boats gonna happen next week Jones is not gonna get seated in time the house is gonna vote in favor and it's gonna become law don't you think that's the likely highly likely outcome I hope not I think it's a bad bill bad policy and bad for the country and I would hope that at least one or two Republican senators would come to that place i think susan collins is not a guaranteed vote at all she thought she had a deal it appears that paul ryan says no there was no deal and i think that they're going to continue to put at risk health care for some thirteen million americans and i think they're gonna put at risk of prices for everybody who has health insurance in america so if that happens i would be shocked if susan collins voted for this so we'll see but i haven't lost hope that good will prevail any more than i lost hope in the voters of alabama that they wouldn't use good sense to vote for decency a good order and common sense in the United States Senate race which they did last night I still hope that the United States Senate will do the same congressman Hoyer thank you study where House Minority Whip when we come back that tax plan still in flux put the wealthy are getting out ahead we're

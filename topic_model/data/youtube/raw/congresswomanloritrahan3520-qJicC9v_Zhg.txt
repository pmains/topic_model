well mr chairman thank you for holding today's hearing and for the opportunity to testify today by including these priorities as we reauthorize the water resources development act we'll be able to undertake critical water development projects that benefit communities across our country in my district massachusetts 3 combined sewage overflows or csos are an all too familiar issue in fact many of my colleagues have come to know me as the sewage lady here in congress because of how much i talk about the need to stop sewage overflows so i don't think it was a surprise for anyone when i used the five environmental infrastructure requests that each member was allotted to request authorizations of 20 million dollars each to fix the csos in lowell lawrence haverhill methuen and fitchburg csos are an issue that have plagued my district for as long as i can remember it was an issue when i toured lowell's regional wastewater utilities facility as part of my first infrastructure tour after being elected to the congress just three years ago and it remains an issue to this day in fact i was just at that same facility again a few weeks ago and each year hundreds of millions of gallons of waste are dumped into the merrimack river from manchester new hampshire to lowell and all the way out to the mouth of the river in newburyport and honestly that's probably a conservative estimate based on some of the heavy rain years that we've had recently in addition to polluting the treasure that is our river the human health effects from csos are also cause for alarm six hundred thousand people rely on the merrimack as their main drinking water supply and our gateway cities are continuing to grow the same is true with the nashville river where fitchburg's sewage overflows so lower lawrence haverhill methuen and fitchburg have each taken a number of steps to drive down the amount of sewage that must be discharged each year and i certainly commend their leadership on that but each of us knows that this doesn't get fixed without a serious course correction at the federal level now the bipartisan infrastructure law is an excellent start already the epa has provided 188 million dollars this year alone for water infrastructure projects including csos in massachusetts but still fixing csos is not cheap over the last 15 years lowell has invested 150 million dollars in cso control projects resulting in a 60 reduction in annual volume of cso discharges and even so an average of 300 to 450 million gallons of raw sewage are released into the river each year overall the city estimates it will cost roughly 400 million to eliminate all cso discharges from its sewer systems lawrence haverhill fitchburg and methuen also faced the daunting prospect of multi-million dollar projects to fix their csos the same is true for manchester new hampshire which is further upstream along the merrimack in fact manchester dumps 221 million gallons and csos into the merrimack each year and that is why my good friend mr pappas a member of this committee also requested a 20 million dollar author authorization to help manchester fix its sewage system i strongly support this request and i thank him for making it after all we are all part of the merrimack river ecosystem and sewage in the river in manchester eventually works its way to lowell to methuen to lawrence and to haverhill so chairman defazio ranking member member graves my colleagues on the committee i'm not asking for an authorization to fix all of the sewage systems in my district but i am asking for your help to make a dent 20 million dollar authorizations for each of these five cities will go a long way to cleaning up our drinking water and improving the health of hundreds of thousands of people in my district so thank you again for the opportunity to testify today and for considering my requests i i look forward to working with all of you as we craft uh where to and find ways to help the communities we serve thank you i yield back

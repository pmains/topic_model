I didn't run for Congress to get headlines. I ran to get results for you. And that's exactly what I've done. Working with Republicans and Democrats, I
got more money for local police because they keep us safe. I'm taking on the oil and drug companies because
they're ripping us off. I got 8 bills signed into law by Trump and
6 by Biden because bipartisanship matters. I'm Kim Schrier and I approve this message
because it makes a difference who you send to Congress.

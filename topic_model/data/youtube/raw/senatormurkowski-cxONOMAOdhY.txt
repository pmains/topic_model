thank you madam president i i am happy to come to the floor today to join my colleagues the senator from alaska senator sullivan as well as as my colleague from kansas to to talk about where we are with this administration or where unfortunately we aren't when it comes to prioritizing american made energy as has been noted uh here on the floor by my colleagues the president has just returned from the middle east and it wasn't for a sightseeing trip it it was for um it was really all about oil it was he was talking about oil above all the president made that trip to ask the leaders of several foreign nations members of opec to increase their production levels okay we get it gasoline prices are way too high we know that we've hit we've hit national records in in recent weeks they're averaging right now about 5.32 cents a gallon in my state that's actually down a little bit from where we were last month but it's up over 50 percent from where we were last year and as has been said repeatedly and we don't need to say it here on the floors of the senate people are feeling it in their homes they're feeling it in their pocketbooks families are businesses are and and whether you are in places like anchorage or fairbanks your budgets are are stretched thinner and thinner and thinner and and it's increasingly difficult for small tourist operations whether you're trying to take people out on flights seeing trips in the air or on the water our fishing fleets having to fill up their their fishing vessels uh but especially particularly our outlying villages these villages that are off the road system that are are have already faced high prices now the prices are astronomical i met with some leaders from the northwest arctic borough just a few days ago and they shared with me that in in many of their communities the communities were paying about 5.25 on average but these were prices that were locked in from last fall when the last fuel barge came into into those northern waters and was able to make its way up the the river systems now with the first spring barge come literally literally in one day going from five dollars and 25 cents to over eight dollars a gallon that's the lock-in price that they're gonna be living with until that next barge so think about what that means when you're a community that is locked into these extraordinarily high prices so when that last fuel barge comes you're going to have small villages that are going to be looking to see how much not how much do we need to get through the winter but how much can we afford they don't have much of a tax base how much can we afford my fear is that they're only going to be able to buy as much as they can and it's not going to be enough to get them through the winter and so halfway through the winter in the darkest and coldest when everything is locked in the ice they're going to run out of fuel and you've got to be able to keep the heat on or everything breaks and so how do you get the fuel madam president you fly it in think about what those costs then become so for us in in alaska this is this is this is not only frightening but it has the potential to just be just be catastrophic as we look at no end in sight for these prices now i i don't i don't begrudge the president for meeting with world leaders we expect him to do this and i think it's a great idea to do what we can to increase supply to reduce prices this is kind of the basics of supply and demand i've championed this for years let's increase our our supply but the question is where that energy is going to come from where should we focus our time where should we focus our efforts and i think it just has to begin at home it has to be here but apparently this administration has decided they're going to go elsewhere they're going to seek oil from the middle east they're sending envoys to venezuela they're pushing for a weakened iran deal signaling that oil oil from the two worst regimes in the world could somehow come back online this makes zero sense to me it just makes no sense why would we do this why would we go abroad when we have the resources here why choose oil produced at lower environmental standards like my like my friend from from kansas just said you're going to to countries that have lower environmental standards and and and track records when it comes to human rights abuses that we're just going to turn our eye to it we're just going to close our eyes and say that's okay now no it's not okay why why do we give fist bumps to foreign leaders while sucker-punching the producers the refiners and the gas station owners in our own domestic industry and unfortunately that's what we're seeing we're seeing that happen in my state we've got billions of barrels of oil in our federal areas we've got a world-class pipeline that is one quarter full and a general refusal from the administration to help us do much of anything about it we can talk about the 1002 area largest untapped conventional oil field in north america is is what is projected but you're not seeing this administration pushing forward with that even though we mandated even though congress mandated this in 2017 um not a chance they're not moving forward with that they've halted all development illegally i might add but also take the take the five-year plan the proposed five-year plan it's long overdue now we're learning that the administration may not hold a single offshore lease through 2028 they're proposing a single sale in cook inlet in alaska after canceling the one that was just supposed to have been held suggesting that they're they're they're okay they're somehow okay with crimping the only source of natural gas for hundreds of thousands of alaskans so again madam president these this direction just makes no sense to me we need a course correction from the biden administration even even as we are as we're moving forward in so many other initiatives we need to have a strategic plan that assures that our own energy security our own energy security is addressed and and and also helping to improve the energy security of our allies and i believe that we can do this without without taking our eye off the ball of what we need to do to reduce emissions to address the challenges that that that face us when it comes to climate but we've got to acknowledge the world has changed there is still though no substitute or equal for american energy so what we need is for common sense to prevail over wishful thinking we need resource development here at home in places like alaska like in kansas they need to be our first and our highest priority and the longer it takes for that to happen the greater the price that alaskans will be paying and all americans will be paying with that madam president i yield the floor

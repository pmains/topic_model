i had a problem with my 2018 income tax and i didn't realize i had a problem until i called them when i got the call hearing about a 2018 tax refund i knew that there was something wrong and so i started tracking down what had gone wrong with ms diaz's tax return and i didn't realize i never received it because i was rejected it's only mr hinges that discovered that to me and because my girl's father put my daughter's name on his income and he was not supposed to do that [Music] i never you realize that i'll still be waiting forever this refund if he wasn't you guys [Music] she expressed that this refund and the stimulus checks that she's going to receive because she's now filed a refund or filed a tax return is going to be a a life-changing amount of money oh my god i the other help from you instead of the 2018 was the old explanation about why i didn't receive my my stimulus check from the 2020. i never got any help and then he again explained to me everything and finally i received for the first time the amount because i never i never did i never received so he again explained everything to me that helped me a lot because i am a single mother i have two girls 122 and one 15 years old and my mother lives with me they three of them my my dependents so that was really tough time last year i know that there's other people out there who are experiencing struggles and this the money that they're entitled to could affect their lives and i would love to be able to help as many people as i can

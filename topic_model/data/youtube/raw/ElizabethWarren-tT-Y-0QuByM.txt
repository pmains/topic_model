he grew up on the ragged edge of the middle class in Scranton he committed to public service early in life and never stopped serving and he's faced unspeakable tragedy with fortitude and grace these experiences animate the empathy he extends to Americans who are struggling no matter what their story empathy matters and in this moment of crisis it is more important than ever that the next president restores Americans faith in good effective government Joe Biden has spent nearly his entire life in public service he knows that a government run with integrity competence and heart will save lives and save livelihoods and we can't afford to let Donald Trump continue to endanger the lives and livelihoods of every American and that's why I'm proud to endorse Joe Biden as President of the United States I've seen the vice president help a community heal one year of the day after the Boston Marathon bombings that tore up bodies and tore our sense of safety and community he was here people who'd been hurt people who were afraid he gave them peace and it gave them grace I watched it [Music] [Applause] we respond we endure we overcome and we own the finish line but when Donald Trump is gone we will need to do more than heal a nation that has been bitterly divided we will need to rebuild and transform our country and I've seen Joe Biden help a nation rebuild in 2009 President Obama put him in charge of leading the implementation of the historic Recovery Act to save our economy and help working families during the recovery and later when I worked in the White House setting up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau I saw him up close doing the work getting in the weeds never forgetting who we were all there to serve among all the other candidates I competed with in the Democratic primary there's no one I've agreed with a hundred percent of the time over the years but one thing I appreciate about Joe Biden is he will always tell you where he stands when you disagree he'll listen and not just listen but really hear you and treat you with respect no matter where you're coming from and he's shown throughout this campaign that when you come up with new facts or a good argument he's not too afraid or too proud to be persuaded Joe Biden was there at the very moment I became a senator he's sworn in and what he did he said you gave me hell and you're gonna do a great job because that's the thing about Jack he wants you in the fight with him and when you're in the fight with Joe at your side you know you have a partner who's committed to getting something good done for this country Joe Biden is a selfless public servant he is committed to the fight for social racial and economic justice Joe Biden will lead a government that works for the American people and now it's up to all of us to help make Joe Biden the next president of the United States let's get to work go to Joe Biden kampf right now and chip in your five bucks make some phone calls send some text we're all in this together now

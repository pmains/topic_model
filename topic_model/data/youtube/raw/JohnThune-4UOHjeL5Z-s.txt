in an effort for bond by the administration to further their environmental goals they have created this ESG environmental social and governance agenda which is designed to limit capital investment into industries that the Democrats don't like and namely oil and oil and gas conventional energy but at other areas as well the economy and so this latest effort would extend that approach to literally the retirement Savings of hundreds of millions of or tens of millions of Americans and I think it's a huge as Mike pointed out a huge uh horrible devastating impact on the retirement Savings of 152 million Americans who are invested in 401ks and essentially the way this would work is that investment advisors would be allowed to invest in ESG priorities without the consent of individuals who whose money is being invested even if it would lead to a lower return or carry higher risk that is a huge change a sea change when it comes to how investment funds are managed in this country and people in this country are already experiencing the impact of democrat policies whether that's higher inflation uh whether that's uh higher taxes higher interest rates Iraqi economy the the one thing we shouldn't be doing now is piling on yet another burden on Americans whose investment savings could be tremendously adversely impacted by this uh really ill-advised Department of Labor rule which the brawn resolution gets at so this afternoon we're going to vote people are going to go on the record as to whether or not they want to impair undermine the savings retirement literally of millions and millions of Americans and we're going to find out whether or not there are any Democrats who agree with us that we ought to stop this initiative in its tracks because this Bears directly on the economic well-being and vitality of retirees and people today who are saving retirement all across this country let me say there are more there are more uh coming and one of the reasons for that is just the excessive weight of the regulatory State on our economy I mean this Administration uh if you talk to anybody in the stakeholder community in the regulated Community it's a it's a daily basis they are just being pounded with more regulations and in many in case like what what Mike's trying to do with this uh would be incredibly detrimental to literally millions of Americans and that's going to be true on some of the other CRA votes that will come up in the future there are other regulations that are also going to be targeted for this very reason and I think you'll find on some of those just like you will today there will be some Democrats who will vote for it because they recognize that um the the adverse and detrimental impact does it have on ordinary Americans

what purpose does the gentleman from texas seek recognition mr speaker i move that the house suspend the rules and pass h.r 5913 as amended clerk will report the title of the bill h.r 5913 a bill to create an independent advisory panel to comprehensively assess the management structure and capabilities related to the department of homeland security and make recommendations to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the management of the of the department pursuant to the rule the gentleman from texas mr mccall and the gentleman from mississippi mr thompson each will control 20 minutes the chair recognizes the gentleman from texas mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members have five legislative days within which to revise and extend the remarks include extraneous material on the bill under consideration without objection speaker i yield myself as much time as i may consume gentleman is recognized mr speaker i rise today in support of the dhs accountability act of 2012. congress has an important opportunity to make the department of homeland security a more effective and efficient organization the purpose of this bipartisan legislation is to create an independent advisory panel to conduct a top to bottom examination of deficiencies in the department's management management structure and capabilities it follows six subcommittee oversight hearings examining corruption low morale inefficiency and waste of taxpayer dollars and comes almost 10 years since the inception of dhs i appreciate the strong support of the ranking member of the homeland security oversight subcommittee the gentleman from massachusetts mr keating as an original co-sponsor of this bill as the third largest federal department dhs has more than 240 000 employees an annual budget of 60 billion dollars its transformation according to the gao is critical to achieving its homeland security mission however excessive bureaucracy waste and effectiveness lack of transparency have hindered its operations and wasted taxpayer dollars mismanagement at the department is a threat of the security of our homeland since 2003 gao has designated the transformation of dhs as high risk because the department had to transform 22 agencies several with major management challenges into one department and failure to effectively address the department's management risks could have serious consequences dhs remains on gao's high risk list while gao has conducted numerous audits of specific dhs programs a comprehensive management assessment of the department has yet to be conducted our hearings and gao findings conclude that dhs has made some progress but is still dysfunctional in several areas the department continues to face challenges in acquisition management human capital integration of financial data and i t in august my subcommittee released a report outline outlining how the department's management failures related to a variety of acquisition programs have wasted taxpayer dollars and had a serious impact on our ability to protect the homeland the reports findings show how why such a panel is needed to help fix the department's shortcomings go's recent work also identified areas of duplicative effort for instance gao found agencies are paying for risk assessments that are not being completed while simultaneously conducting their own assessments employee morale also remains one of the lowest in the federal government additionally there are examples of border patrol agents accepting bribes theft by airport screeners and immigration officers complicit in fraud these deficiencies cannot continue based on the findings of these hearings ngo reviews i have doubts that the department can carry out its core mission of protecting the homeland if the problems persist these issues of corruption waste duplication and abuse of power are all symptomatic of deeply rooted flaws in the department's management i believe it will take a dedicated team of independent investigators to identify the root causes and recommended concrete changes a top to bottom management review is necessary because the current management team is not getting the job done the dhs accountability act of 2012 as amended will create an independent eight member advisory panel appointed by the legislative and executive branches to comprehensively assess dhs management structure and capabilities it will require the panel to make recommendations to improve dhs's efficiency and effectiveness and it will require an interim report sent to congress one year after panel's selection with a final report due two years after its inception the panel will possess subpoena power and the authority to conduct hearings and receive expert witness testimony the panel's recommendations will help make dhs a leaner smarter and more effective organization and fared out duplicative programs and offices fellow members this legislation is our opportunity to take action and i urge you to support the dhs accountability act of 2012. with that mr speaker i reserve the balance of my time gentlemen reserves this time gentlemen from mississippi mr speaker i rise in support of h.r 5913 the dhs accountability act of 2012 and yield myself such time as i may consume the gentleman is recognized thank you mr speaker mr speaker the bill before the house today would create an independent advisory panel to comprehensively assess and make recommendations regarding the management structure and capabilities of the department of homeland security while there is some question about whether this legislation is necessary as similar independent initiatives are already underway i appreciate the effort to improve the effectiveness of dhs's management and will not approve the bill with that mr speaker i reserve the balance of my time as reserve gentleman from texas mr speaker i have no further speakers i urge members to support this bill i yield back the balance of my time yields back his time gentleman from mississippi uh mr speaker i yield three minutes to the ranking member of the committee on homeland security subcommittee on oversight investigations and management the gentleman from massachusetts mr keating general from massachusetts is recognized for three minutes thank you ranking member thompson for yielding your time and for your leadership on the homeland security committee mr speaker i rise in support of hr 5913 the department of homeland security accountability act of 2012. the ranking member for the subcommittee on oversight investigation and management i was pleased to work with chairman mccall and serve as the original co-sponsor of this measure i appreciate the bipartisan discussions that led to the introduction of the amended version we adopted at the subcommittee level which is the version being considered today this bill goes to the heart of the subcommittee's mandate and that is ensuring the effective management of the department of homeland security ensuring that effectiveness for the department of homeland security is not a partisan matter and should serve as a priority as it is essential to our security and safety in this country since its inception the department of homeland security has faced significant management challenges many of which stem from the very nature of its creation which was transforming 22 legacy agencies into one attempted cohesive unified department to its credit the department has come a long way since its inception but more work remains to be done the consideration of this bill comes at a time when congress is examining cost saving and revenue generating measures to reduce our deficit while ensuring the safety and well-being of our citizens there's no doubt that the department is making positive strides and having clear plans in place to reduce duplicative efforts in the management area for example the department's efficiency review initiative which is highlighted by vice president biden as a model for all federal agencies has resulted in more than a billion dollars in dhs cost avoidance including 180 million dollars saved by consolidating duplicative software licensing agreements and i'm pleased that the secretary has advanced internal measures aimed at eliminating waste and fraud unfortunately this does not change the fact that the number of dhs activities are still shared by other federal agencies in march of 2011 and february 2012 gao identified six areas across dhs where overlap or potential unnecessary duplication exists for example when it comes to personnel background investigations cybersecurity trainings and the identification of fraudulent travel documents the lines between multiple agencies remain blurred furthermore despite its management strides the department has yet to fully address deficiencies in component operations that resulted in wasting of funds the department's federal protective service has received over 230 million dollars from federal agencies for risk assessment and security service yet these agencies have not found the fps's services adequate or satisfactory so they perform their own assessments as well this bill will determine instances of waste and abuse through an independent advisory panel will be charged with two main responsibilities to comprehensively access the management structure and capabilities related to the department and to make recommendations to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the management of the department the legislation instructs the panel to examine five broad categories efficiency effectiveness of management structuring capabilities whether unnecessary duplication exists the extent to which management of key homeland security missions is centralized waste and duplication mr speaker this bipartisan effort will compromise this panel's work through the course of this session which has been extensive i want to thank chairman mccall for his efforts at dealing with these issues i want to thank for the bipartisan corporation that's there on important issues of national security and i want to thank the ranking member for yielding his time and his leadership on the committee i yield back the balance of my time gentleman yields back his time does he jump from mississippi yield back the balance of his time uh i yield back and i am prepared to close texas gentleman from texas has yielded back his time does the gentleman from mississippi you're watching uh then i'm prepared to close mr speaker by somebody's

days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration without objection mr speaker yield myself as much time as i may consume gentleman is recognized speaker i rise today in support of h.r 915 the jaime zapata border enforcement security task force act this bill which will codify additional border enforcement security task force units was named to honor the memory of slain immigration and customs enforcement special agent jaime zapata in 2011 special agent zapata and his associate special agent victor avila were ambushed on a dangerous stretch of highway in mexico by the ruthless zetta drug cartel the vehicle that the two special agents were traveling in was forced off the road by the heavily armed thugs once the vehicle had come to a stop the cartel members forced the doors open fired their weapons at point-blank range and tried to drag away special agent zapata who fought back and was able to relock the doors special agent zapata tried to explain to the men that he and special agent avila were u.s diplomats the gunman responded to his plea with bullets special agent zapata then heroically drove himself and special agent avila away from the scene and to safety investigators later found that more than 80 individual bullet casings at the scene of the crime by nothing short of a miracle special agent agent avila survived the ordeal however jaime zapata did not border enforcement security task force units are comprised of dhs and other federal state and local law enforcement personnel and coordinate efforts to enhance border security and mitigate threats posed by transnational crime drug trafficking armed smuggling illegal alien traffic violence and kidnappings these units will leverage the experience of personnel from the united states immigration and customs enforcement united states customs and border protection the united states coast guard and other dhs components as well as other federal agencies state local and tribal and win appropriate foreign law partners with increasing violence in mexico and the growing resourcefulness of the vast criminal networks operating along the border this type of interagency response is critical the men and women who have selflessly dedicated themselves to protecting our borders deserve this protection jaime zapata paid the ultimate price and i've made it a personal mis mission along with my colleague mr cuellar from texas to help ensure no more brave men and women are lost to violence along our southwest border in addition to drug cartels freely moving across the border with drugs cash and weapons the growing presence of iran and hezbollah and latin america are also a threat we do not have the luxury of sitting by idly while those looking to do us harm continue to enter the united states illegally i'd like to thank my friend again colleague representative cuellar for introducing this vitally important piece of bipartisan legislation and i'd also like to thank senators lieberman and collins for taking action on this bill h.r 915 honors special agent jaime zapata by making sure that those who serve as he did have the tools they need to secure the border and i reserve the balance of my time gentleman's time is reserved gentleman from mississippi mr speaker i rise in support of the senate amendment to h.r 915 the

establish targeted cross-agency teams to identify disrupt and dismantle criminal organizations posing significant threats to border security the program also serves as a model for inter-agency cooperation coordination and information sharing which is vital in the post-9 11 environment i would note that it is appropriate that this bill is named in the memory of jaime zapata an ice special agent who was killed in the line of duty in mexico while working as part of a best teen h.r 915 has enjoyed strong bipartisan support in the house passing with overwhelming support earlier this year as well as in the senate passage today will clear the bill for the president's signature i would like to commend the gentleman from texas mr cuellar for his continued work on this important

the family with the mother and father of this strong hero that we got to know in the service of the line of duty as you know ice immigration and customer enforcement in partnership with the u.s customer board of protection as well with other federal and state local and foreign law enforcement has created this best initiative by the way the first best initiative was created in laredo back in 2005 and has become a model across the the country and this is a comprehensive approach to identify disrupt dismantle transnational criminal organizations that have posed significant threats to the border and maritime security through investigations scissors of contraband arrest prosecutions the best units are building an impressive record of success today there are 34 best units throughout the united states they work not only with the mexican counterparts but on the northern part with the canadian counterparts and certainly we want to make sure that congress provides the best support the support to the best units in order to enhance border securities and of course the communities that we have that we all represent so again members i would ask that you all work and support this bill

agree with my colleague that our relationship with mexico is vitally important and the idea that the best teams border enforcement security teams have provided an invaluable service on the border in terms of confiscating cash and weapons going south into mexico they have been extremely successful and if anything merits additional resources it's this program and i can't think of a better program to name after jaime zapata i will also say on the several occasions i've met with agent avila and his family it's been very emotional to see someone who's come back almost from a operation of war if you will who's been shot at by the lozetas cartel members almost going through a pstd type situation a very very emotional experience and i wish agent novel and his family the best in their recovery a

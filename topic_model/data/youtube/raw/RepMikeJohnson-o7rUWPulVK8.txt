thank you mr olson over here i it's ironic to hear my colleagues today talk about disinformation because there's a lot of it being shared from the other side of the aisle let me reset the table here on the documented facts what exactly we know about this whole school boards issue as activist groups on the left continue to push their agenda on america's children last year parents across the country began to speak out they came to school board meetings they expressed their views on critical race theory and mass mandates and controversial curricula that's their first amendment right but as more parents spoke out the national school boards association and the biden administration colluded that's a specifically used term for a reason to create a justification to use federal law enforcement tools to silence those parents who are becoming a real problem for the agenda as part of this collusion the nsba the school board association sent a now famous letter to the white house dated september 29 2001 urging the bite administration to use the heavy hand of federal law enforcement including the patriot act to target those moms and dads and chill their protected first amendment rights the white house not only colluded with the nsba to craft the substance of that letter but following the letter president biden called the then sba president to say he was quote appreciative of their letter and invited her to visit the oval office the nsba letter stated quote malice violence and threats is against school officials quoting could be the equivalent of a form of domestic terrorism or hate crimes unquote we didn't make that up this is all documented the nsba on may 20th of this year released a report it had to commission a report because 20 of its organizations its state school board associations pulled out and disavowed the nsba over all this nonsense so they commissioned a report to examine the events surrounding that september 29th letter to president biden the report offered all of us and all the american people who are paying attention new evidence of exactly how the justice department coordinated with the white house to target parents the report found that the first communications the first communications between nsba and the white house are occurred on september 9th almost a month prior to all this and that the biden white house closely coordinated with the nsba on its letter to president biden this is the nsba's information not republicans in congress contrary to attorney general garland's sworn testimony to this committee sir whistleblower information now shows that the justice department and its components quickly operationalized his directive and on october 20th the day before a.g garland's congressional testimony the fbi's assistant director for counterterrorism division sent an email referencing garland's october 4th directive and notifying fbi personnel about a new threat tag created to apply to school board investigations we know the threat tag is edu officials we're not making this up sir the whistleblowers have confirmed it all and that threat tag has been used in almost every region of the country relating to all types of educational settings i don't want to misquote you but you are under oath and i believe that just a few moments ago you testified quote no one has been investigated because of the edu officials threat tag did i misquote you no one has been investigated solely because of a threat tag i will tell you that people are investigated because of acts of violence or threats of violence that's why people are interested all right and so it's your testimony today that parents moms and dads who went to school boards engaged in violence to sufficient to uh to trigger investigations so i don't have specific information on which you don't number four the course right now that number you can't tell us a number of cases why is that sensitive i don't i don't know the number of cases what i can tell you is that hold on wait a minute you're the director how do you not know the number of cases isn't this an important thing you've testified here how important this is you don't know the number if i if i if i may so the nesscore division would only handle a matter if it is a matter that falls within the crimes that we are responsible for prosecuting um there may be cases that are being handled by other divisions how many is your how many is your division handling i'm not aware of any that the now security division is handling tell me about the threat tag edu officials what was its purpose i think i would off i would suggest directing that question to the fbi that's so convenient because when they're here they point the finger elsewhere let me just say this look moms and dads voice and their concerns at school board meetings are not domestic terrorists and for the white house to suggest as much or collude with anybody who does is absolutely outrageous it's one of the glaring examples and the reasons why millions of american people now believe that the u.s department of justice has been weaponized for political purposes and you and i both know the real threat to that is the rapid erosion of faith that our citizens have in our system of justice itself in our institutions it's at record lows right now we cannot maintain a constitutional republic if people don't trust the system of justice and the fairness of the system and targeting citizens for expressing their outrage over curricula is not an appropriate use of your resources we're going to get down to the bottom of this we get the majority here in a few months and we need you back under oath because i think there's a lot more answers you're going to have to provide i yield back if i may respond sure i absolutely agree it is essential that we maintain the trust of the american people and that they understand that we follow the rule of law and that we investigate crimes without regard to politics and ideology allegations that the fbi is silencing parents is reckless and false that's not what the facts show and that's not what the whistleblower has expired you

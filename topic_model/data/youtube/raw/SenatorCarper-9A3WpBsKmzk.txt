harper yeah my pleasure thank you madam chair uh chief conte is a former governor of the first state of delaware for eight years i recall numerous instances in in which i uh call on the delaware national guard in emergencies they could have been the floods blizzards ice storms brought you name it a lot more uh i know the importance of the valley work that our citizen soldiers have done for decades in the first day in other states around the country as we have learned in contrast to every other state's national guard in the country the dc national guard operates differently and i'm i'm convinced if someone had been able to activate the dc national guard and have a thousand or two thousand guardsmen and women deployed at the capitol uh in a timely way on the the 6th of january this destruction if death and destruction would not have occurred the the leader of the uh unlike the all the states of the 50 states that we have the leader of the district of columbia not empowered to activate the dc national guard during an emergency that's one of the reasons why i worked for years with congresswoman eleanor holmes norton to in support of legislation to admit to washington d.c as our 51st state and to provide equal rights to the americans who make this community over i showed 700 000 people their home there's question chief condi and your testimony you highlighted a request for dc national guard assistance at the u.s capitol on january 6 would have been to would have had to have been made by the u.s capitol police with the consent of the u.s department of defense you just take a minute to explain that process and why mayor bowser is not able to request bc national guard assistance when federal installations and property as well as human lives uh are threatened in the district that she leads please go ahead yes thank you for the question yeah so the mayor does not have full authority over the national guard to include their activation or deployment when the mayor we make a request as the district of columbia we make a request we send that to the federal government ultimately the secretary of secretary of the army receives that request there's a whole approval process that that request has to go through in order for national guard resources to be deployed to the district of columbia unlike governors and other states who are able to activate their national guard without going through those approval processes and receiving approval from the highest level of the federal government uh we just uh that that just does not have to take place in other states so a real hindrance to us in terms of our response and the ability to pump them up thanks sarah thanks for that response could you just take a minute to share with us your thoughts on whether having a dc national guard under the command of a mayor or even a governor of a neighboring state might help the d.c metropolitan police in coordinating with federal authorities to better protect the city and its citizens and along with federal installations during assault like the one we experienced on january the 6th yes i think we i think we certainly uh should um we found we know even on that day on january the 6th you know prior to any movement of the national guard from the assignments that they had been given the traffic post again that required approval at the highest levels of the federal government to include the secretary of the army and secretary of defense in order to just move the national bar or a change of mission in essence so uh yes i think that that should certainly be something that falls under the mayor's authority all right thanks so much a question if i could for mr sun mr sun and your testimony you state that the events of january 6 were not the results of poor planning on behalf of the u.s cabinet police uh but rather a lack of actionable intelligence that would have allowed the uh that would have allowed the uh uh let me start over or rather a lack of actual intelligence that would have allowed the us capital to leave the capitol police to properly prepare as i was looking through mr stinger's testimony and former sergeant-at-arms for the u.s senate he he states that i want to quote he says the sharing of information and resources is paramount for success that's it that's his quote i strongly agree with that statement uh mr sun what went wrong leading up to january 6 with regard to gathering and sharing actual intelligence why do you think the likelihood of a truly devastating attack was so badly underestimated mr sunderland i think as you start to hear some some from some of the federal agencies on the investigations that are currently going on where they're finding the evidence that this was a coordinated attack uh that had been coordinated among numerous states for some time in advance of this that's the information that would have been extremely helpful to us for them to detect some type of level of coordination that would have given us the indication that we're going to see more than just a may become violent that you know may be inclined to violence type of type of preparations you look at it now you see you know knowing what occurred you see what type of resources were brought to bear around the around the capitol that type of information could give us you know sufficient advance warning to prep plan for more of an an attack such as what we saw a great uh paul newman movie uh cool hand luke and i allowing you probably a lot of people certainly in my generation remember what we have here is a failure to communicate i was right at the end of the film what what we have recent failure to communicate uh do we have a failure to communicate here where when i'm not one who's crazy about like pointing fingers and assigning blind but to whom do we assign that uh failure to communicate i believe that questions for me sir what i what i look at is you know we have a process for communications and being a consumer of intelligence i look at it more of you know we're i think there's a failure of having a wide enough lens to look at what are the current threats that we're facing uh in in in the nation uh now from some of the domestic extremists i think the communications processes are there they need to be worked on a little bit but i think the intelligence community needs to broaden its aperture on what information it collects we now know in in retrospect that the the uh the gapping on the the rioters on january 6th didn't begin on january 5th or the 4th or the 3rd it started like weeks before and uh was fomented and encouraged as we now know by by among others our our president and somehow that all that work and all the intelligence that was gathered by the fbi and other homeland security never got it found its way to the people who right here dc could have used it the most to have avoided the tragedy of january the 6th thank you are the our thanks to particularly the officers of the capital ps capital police and others who join them and trying to protect us and in this capital on that sad day

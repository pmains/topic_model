joining me now is Tom Cotton Arkansas Senator member of the Senate Judiciary Committee also author of the new book Only the Strong Senator I think it's fair to say that places like DC California I mean this seriously kind of informs where the overall Democrat direction is right now vis-a-vis criminals yeah Lauren this is amazing coming from the DC city council putting left-wing Audiology ahead of the safety of the residents of our nation's capital we're not talking about reducing sentences for people who are arrested with a dime bag of marijuana we're talking about things like carjacking in a city that's had a wave of carjackings in a city where a professional football player a Washington was carjacked and shot just a few months ago this reflects the Democrats soft on crime left-wing ideology this is a major issue in the Georgia Senate race this is what Georgian should get out and vote for Herschel Walker and it's also something that Congress will take a look at if the mayor of Washington DC goes forward with this resolution or with this bill then I will introduce a resolution of disapproval and Congress to stop it from happening because the people of Washington deserve better and Americans deserve better our nation's capital belongs to the American people not to left-wing politicians here now Senator I want to switch gears here because the Daily Caller is reporting tonight that House Republicans have introduced legislation to audit funds appropriated by Congress from the American people to Ukraine now do you think this is something Republicans in the Senate will support I know I support it because I think we should know how our money is being spent where it's being spent and if in fact it's being used in the appropriate manner wherever it's sent yeah Laura I agree with you and all those principles I haven't seen the exact legislation but I think the American people deserve that kind of accountability whenever their tax dollars are spent I'd also like to add that while there are some things that only the United States and our military and our defense industry can provide to Ukraine the European Partners we have can provide money to Ukraine whether it's France or Germany or the European Union the Biden Administration needs to do a better job Senator they're not I mean I know we'd like that but I'd like a lot of things but Germany's not pawning up France is really not ponying up we're certainly not seeing the money coming from Italy this is all on the backs of the American taxpayer and I know there's like a split in the Republican party on this with the people who think we should be all in in Ukraine the people who think we have to take a sober look at this but at some point is Europe going to ever carry the burden for Europe or is it always going to be us no tornado as we know Laura they need to and the Biden Administration needs to use more pressure and leverage to compel them to again there are certain weapon systems that only America can provide but European nations and the European Union can provide more funds to support Ukraine it shouldn't be only on the backs of the American taxpayer well right now um Senator there is an enormous amount of angst in the Republican Party about what's next what's going to happen in 2024 um and on this issue of accountability listen to this shocking revelation after 1600 Auditors come through the dod's 3.5 trillion dollars in assets and 3.7 trillion in liabilities officials found that the department couldn't account this is the Pentagon couldn't account for about 61 percent of its assets so I mean I know again Republicans the Pentagon can like do no wrong I mean I'm sorry but that's what a lot of Republicans seem to think they can't account for 61 of their assets are you gonna you know lead the charge on this from the Senate this is ridiculous yeah well so so Laura the reason we finally know this is that during the Trump era uh the Trump Administration in Congress insisted that the Department of Defense finally go through with these kind of audits and we ought not wait till 2024 in a new presidential uh election we should start right now build upon this audit make sure the dod is getting good value for our taxpayers I mean right now you have almost as many civilians in the Department of Defense as you have uh troops we also need to make sure the focus is where it should be which is making sure that our troops have the best equipment and training to defend our nation not that our drill sergeants are using the right pronouns so there's a lot of room for oversight in the new Congress of the Department of Defense Senator cotton great to see you as always for joining us and answering all of our questions thank you so much

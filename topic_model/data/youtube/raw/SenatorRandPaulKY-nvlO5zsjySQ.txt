happy thanksgiving everyone this is one of our favorite holidays kelly and i enjoy thanksgiving getting the family together i know it's been a tough year for many we keep those who are ill in our prayers and we wish them the best we also give thanks to those who have survived one of our favorite things to do on thanksgiving is to have a touch football game in the yard and i'm also in charge of the turkey sort of depends on whether they judge that i did a good job the previous year but i think i'm in charge of the turkey this year but kelly and i do love thanksgiving we send our our warmest wishes to all of our fellow kentuckians although we haven't been able to see as many of you in person this year we've been together in spirit and we wish you all the warmest and happiest of thanksgiving especially to those of us who are serving overseas our brave men and women in uniform we hold you in our prayers this thanksgiving and we wish all of you a wonderful season of warmth and love with your families happy thanksgiving everyone

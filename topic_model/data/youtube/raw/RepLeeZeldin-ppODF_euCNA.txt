mr. speaker before I begin I ask unanimous consent that all members may have five legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the topic of our special order without objection so ordered mr. speaker earlier this month President Trump decertified the Iran nuclear deal tonight during this hour several members of Congress will be speaking here on the House floor about the president's correct and necessary desertification and discussing the urgent need to address Iran's problematic nuclear and non-nuclear activities the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa otherwise known as the Iran nuclear deal is deeply flawed and very one-sided for what is in it and it's fatally flawed and deeply one-sided for what's not in the so-called deal props up the wrong regime in Iran the world's largest state sponsor of terror with a jackpot of 150 billion dollars of sanctions relief the United States made a slew of permanent concessions in exchange for temporary concessions on the part of the Iranians a point that comes into greater focus as the sunset provisions are analyzed this deal is not a pathway for how to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon it's a blueprint for exactly how Iran cannot acquire a nuclear weapon we can and must do better President Obama said this agreement was not built on trust it was built on verification I'm still waiting for an answer on how you can support a deal based on verification without knowing what the verification regime is the verification agreement between the IAEA and Iran still hasn't been submitted to Congress and secretary Kerry has admitted that he never read it we have learned though that Iran collects some of their own soil samples and inspects some of their own nuclear sites no US inspectors are permitted to participate in any of these inspections at all the verification regime must become liquid and transparent and Americans should know what the verification agreement is since the jcpoa was entered into Iranian aggression in the Middle East Iraq and Syria and elsewhere has only increased these bad activities have only gotten worse since all of the leverage that brought the Iranians to the table was negotiated away in the jcpoa Ranas continued to illegally testifier intercontinental ballistic missiles and finance terror they even seized one of our naval vessels subsequently holding hostage and publicly embarrassing 10 American sailors Iran is committed to wiping Israel off the map and they chant death to America in their streets on their holidays all while unjustly imprisoning American citizens they call Israel the little Satan and America of the Great Satan these are unfortunately just a few of Iran's bad activities is also so important to note that Iran has not only violated the spirit of the nuclear deal with its non-nuclear bad activities it has also violated the letter of the deal for example Iran spins more ir6 centrifuges than they are allowed to under the jcpoa they've assembled more ir8 rotor assemblies than they are allowed to they've attempted to acquire carbon fiber that they agreed that they wouldn't they stockpiled more heavy water than they were supposed to under the jcpoa and iran is also not allowing any inspections at all at any of their military sites so Ron's not only violating this spirit of the deal but they're also violating the letter of the deal the president Trump was absolutely correct to decertify the jcpoa if Iran is serious about helping turn the jcpoa into a truly reasonable agreement and they should make those intentions clear both in private conversations with the United States and the other countries of the p5 plus one but also in their public rhetoric many of our ons other bad activities will need to cease if Iran does not want to save the jcpoa then the sanctions should immediately ramp up and throughout this next hour we will discuss the president's correct decision to desertification SPRO blaa Matic nuclear and non-nuclear activities joining me tonight are members of Congress from all across our great country who are deeply passionate about America's best interests and supportive of the president's decision to decertify the Iran nuclear deal at this time is my great pleasure to welcome the distinguished gentleman from South Carolina mr. Joe Wilson a leader on the House Foreign Affairs Committee throughout all of Congress oftentimes been to the Middle East a grandson of a veteran a son of a veteran and a proud father of four veterans Joe Wilson South Carolina mr. speaker Thank You comes from Lee Zeldin for your leadership we sincerely appreciate your leadership from American families particularly based on your service in Iraq on October 23 1983 an otherwise peaceful Sunday morning in Beirut Lebanon there was tragically a disruption of a suicide truck bomb that crashed into the Marine Corps barracks killing 241 courageous US Marines this was the deadliest attack of 21,000 pounds of TNT since the US Marines were in the Battle of Iwo Jima investigators determined that hezbollah and iran backed terrorist organization that has targeted America and our allies for decades was responsible for the attack the thirty fourth anniversary of the Beirut attack serves as a solemn reminder that we have responsibility to defeat Hezbollah in radical Islamic terrorists across the globe many of whom are financed by Iran all the way from Nazir to the Philippines it is important that we defeat the terrorists overseas to protect American families at home President Donald Trump's decision to decertify the Iranian deal was correct president Trump is protecting American families the deal was reckless and dangerous from the story it never served the interest of American families in a threaten the safety and security of America and our allies in the region from Israel to southeastern Europe Greece Bulgaria and Romania I am grateful to join members of the House especially my colleagues of the House Foreign Affairs Committee in promoting the fight against global terrorism this includes tougher sanctions like those being considered by the house that target Hezbollah and its financier in Tehran it includes working together with president Trump's administration that is committed to peace through strength I am grateful to thank congressman Lee Zeldin of New York and appreciated Iraq veteran for his leadership and for being firm with the Iranian regime which subjugates its extraordinary people as the father of four sons who have served our country overseas I want to say once again God bless our troops and we will never forget September 11th in the global war on terrorism I yield back my time Thank You congressman Wilson for your continued leadership at this time it is my privilege to bring up freshman from Tennessee's 8th congressional district David cust off last Congress I had the privilege of being both the lowest-ranking Jewish Republican in Congress and the highest-ranking Jewish Republican in Congress but now that we have David Kostov here of Tennessee we get to we voted for each other two to chair the Jewish Republican caucus of two and one day we may have a minyan those are these are our dreams that some day may come true at this time is my privilege to yield to David kostov Thank You mr. speaker and congressman Selvam thank you so much for your leadership on this very important issue I rise today to applaud the president's decision to decertify the joint comprehensive plan of action or what's known as the Iran deal this deeply flawed Iran deal has failed to prevent the Iranian regime from ballistic missile testing and overall hostility that threatens American national security and just quite frankly this was a bad idea from day one most recently on September 23rd 2017 Iran test-fired a new long-range missile that could carry multiple warheads and as the country's third test of a missile with a range of approximately 1,000 240 miles an Iran news agency further stated how this missile quote adds to Israel's misery and will be their nightmare close quote as we have seen Iran continues to be the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism and the IRGC has known connections to Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas and Gaza over these past few years we've seen these terrorist proxy groups carry out attacks on American troops and innocent Israelis in addition in addition Iran has gained access to over 100 billion dollars in previously frozen assets enabling the money to be funneled diverted to various terrorist organizations from the frequent ballistic missile tests to supporting terrorism and funding proxies such as Lebanon Syria and Yemen Iran has escalated his aggressive behavior since the deal was signed just two years ago ultimately this deal temporarily pushes back Iran's ability to build up its nuclear infrastructure and does not cease the Iranian regime's ambition to become nuclear after 15 years the bad deal therefore ushers Iran into a nuclear Club where it can continue to test uranium pathways and pursue illicit nuclear materials unbeknownst to the IAEA President Obama entered this poorly crafted using unilateral executive authority quite frankly circumventing the consent of Congress and disregarding the will of the American people as we have seen this was clearly a bad deal from day one it does not stop Iran's path to obtaining a nuclear weapon but rather paves it as we work in Congress to implement further sanctions against the Iranian regime we must work towards a strategy that protects our allies in the Middle East and effectively prevents Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons we must remain vigilant against those who wish to inflict harm on America and stand united with their allies around the world thank you again congressman Zeldin for your leadership and I yield back well Thank You congressman cust off for your important insightful words and is my pleasure at this time to introduce the gentleman from Florida's third congressional district he is an important voice on the House Foreign Affairs Committee very learning on these issues related to Iran and the Middle Eastern region especially and a great member here in Congress congressman Yoho I appreciate the leadership of mr. Zeldin and I appreciate you using that word learn it feels good you know this is an interesting thing because I was there during the time that John Kerry and the president were negotiating this deal keep in mind this is a deal that John Kerry and the president agreed to but nobody signed we didn't sign it our Senate never voted on it and it's an Iran didn't sign it so this is a deal in paper only that nobody has signed and if you were to do any business transaction in the real world this would be worthless this piece of paper and I want to mention words of one of our previous presidents it's been about 60 years after President Dwight Eisenhower announced that Atoms for Peace program and one lesson is clear civilian nuclear programs flourish only through cooperation and openness secrecy and isolation typically are signs of a nuclear weapons program so here we are I have in front of me the Institute for Science and International Security August 31st 2017 and in it in the introduction it says one of the most serious compliance issues concerns ie ie a z' access to military sites incredible verification of section T which prohibits key nuclear weapons development activities and controls dual use equipment potentially usable in such activities in this report the issues of verifying section t is discussed the absence of credible implementation and verification of section T undermines the effectiveness of the jcpoa and my colleague mr. Zeldin brought up we know they're used in IR six and IR eight centrifuges we know they have the carbon fibers that they're not supposed to have we also know that they've over produced heavy water more than two times the first time we bought it at the American taxpayers expense the other two times it's gone to Russia and the only reason you would have an excess of heavy water is if you're producing nuclear physical material in addition to that the heavy water the inspection that we are supposed to do anytime anywhere John Kerry said this over and over anytime anywhere that we can go and if they're non-compliant the sanctions will snap back they must have used an over stretched rubber band because nothing has ever snapped back and with the IAEA supposedly being able to inspect anywhere there's so many places that are off-limits it's only those areas that Iran says that we can go in and inspect Parchin military sites is a place that we know they detonated a nuclear trigger we have not been able to go in there and check to Saul yet we have to accept their word that they're checking the soil and I brought this up in the committee and I'm going to repeat it here it would be like having a drug addict testing his own urine sample and taking it to the lab it's just not the way to do business in the 21st century on something that's so important and during that time when we negotiate it were when the deal was being negotiated there was an intelligence report I don't know if you were in Congress and but there was an intelligence report that had always had Iran as a state sponsor of terror the year this deal was done state sponsor of Terror was taken off and when we questioned about it they said it was an oversight and this deal it just stinks from the beginning and John Kerry said no deal is better than a bad deal this is a bad deal the president should decertify it it does not take us out of the deal but it allows us to put the pressure back on Iran so that they are fully compliant with the letter of the law and if we don't hold up people to the letter of the law as we move forward in future negotiations ie North Korea why should they follow the letter of the law so this is high time that we do this I appreciate it and I yield back and thank you for doing this well Thank You congressman Yoho and brings up some very important points and the the Iran nuclear deal was an unsigned political commitment those were the words that were given to us by the administration and to think that we wouldn't have even asked for a signature on something so important was a foolish my next the next speaker that we have tonight in this important special order in support of President Trump's decision to decertify the Iran nuclear deal and the need to address Iran x' other problematic nuclear and non-nuclear activities is a freshman from my home state of New York someone I served with in the New York State Legislature and we're really excited to have her here serving with us in the halls of Congress she's hit the ground running and is very passionate about our military our veterans and also especially why we're here tonight the path forward with regards to miss Claudia 10a of New York's 22nd congressional district thank you so much congressman Zeldin and I'm grateful to you obviously we all are so proud from New York for your service as an Iraq veteran and also for your leadership in serving both in the state Senate and also in representing our great state in the House of Representatives on this very important issue on October 13th president Trump made the informed decision to decertify the joint comprehensive plan of action the jcpoa or I'm going to refer to it as the Iran nuclear deal and to develop for the first time a holistic strategy to address the Iranian Menace I applaud this sound choice which prioritizes the safety and security of our citizens and the American homeland predictably the flawed deal with Iran has done nothing to stem that rogue nations aggression and misbehavior domestically in the Middle East and throughout the globe quite to the contrary by front-loading the benefits to Iran the Iran nuclear deal is funding these destabilizing and dangerous activities human rights abuses continue against the Iranian people as citizens who dare to speak out against the oppressive regime face imprisonment or abuse supporters of the Iran nuclear deal told the American people that this deal would lead to a more open Iran with a renewed acceptance of diverse voices and opinions from within mr. speaker and mr. and my colleagues there have been already over 450 executions and Iran this year alone obviously the so-called moderates within the regime with whom we negotiated the Iran nuclear deal either aren't as modders as we thought or simply a rebel irrelevant in this regime the American people were further told that the Iran nuclear deal would bring Iran into the fold and make the nation a more productive contributing member of the international community sadly but not surprisingly iran's transgressions in the region continue to be appalling the Iranian regime is expanding its malicious network of control through increased financial and military support for terrorist organizations including Hezbollah and Hamas in Syria the arena Revolutionary Guard has provided fighters and expertise to the brutal Assad regime that gasses and brutalizes its own citizen Iran has shown no signs that it is interested in pursuing peace or even curbing its malevolent behaviors chance of death to America and death to Israel continue as Iran rapidly develops his missile program and engages in proxy conflicts with the US and our allies I thank the president and my colleagues as I indicated especially congressman Lee Eldin Zeldin from New York for continuing to shine the light on this important national security issue I yield back Thank You congresswoman Tenny for being here for your remarks this evening and your leadership on this important deal thank you it is my pleasure at this time to introduce congressman Andy Barr who is a leader on the House Financial Services Committee has been very active in the efforts as it relates to sanctions and it's so important to note that it was sanctions that brought the Iranians to the table and applied an incredible amount of economic pressure the Iranian regime that's in charge desperately needed relief in order to get through their next election and now the Iranians have had an opportunity to experience life with that sanctions regime and life without it and congressman Barr the Chairman bar is a very important voice here in the halls of Congress for ensuring the right leverage is on the table to deal with Iran's nuclear and non-nuclear activities thank you for being here congressman Barr well Thank You congressman Zeldin and thank you for your leadership on this issue your voice in criticism of this flawed nuclear deal with Iran and of course for your valiant service to the United States in the military and I rise to night in strong support of the president's decision to decertify this deeply flawed jcpoa the Iran nuclear deal under the Iran nuclear agreement review act I agree with the president's finding that Iran is not transparently not verifiably and not fully implementing the agreement and I agree with the president's finding that continued sanctions relief is not in the vital interest vital security interests of the United States that's because the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran was a dangerous and historic mistake the deal provided the mullahs and Tehran was roughly roughly a hundred billion dollars in upfront sanctions relief in exchange for Iran's promised future promised to temporarily pause it's an enrichment program unfortunately the agreement contained fatally deficient verification protocols and the International Atomic Energy Agency now concedes that it has no capacity to verify that Tehran is engaged in activities which could contribute to the development of a nuclear explosive device that's because under the terms of the agreement the very terms of the jcpoa international inspectors are barred from accessing Iran's military sites where illicit nuclear activities are most likely taking place President Obama's a promise that there would be Anytime Anywhere inspections but that promise was replaced with quote managed access to suspect nuclear sites in which international inspectors must appeal to Iran and Russia and China in a bureaucratic process that would take days during which Iran could remove anything covert and in violation of the agreement and as congressman Zeldin correctly pointed out we don't even know what the verification protocols actually are because we haven't been able to access the secret agreement between international inspectors non-us inspectors and the leadership in Tehran but the most serious concern is not that Iran would cheat it is that even if Iran is fully complying with this Agreement bad outcomes are guaranteed first Iran will be allowed an arsenal an arsenal of nuclear weapons in as little as 10 years under the very terms of this Agreement Iran was not denied a nuclear weapon the path was paved for Iran to have an arsenal nuclear weapon weapons with international sanction Iran was not required to dismantle key bomb-making technology was permitted to retain vast enrichment capacity and it was allowed to continue research and development on advanced centrifuges and here's this it will be allowed to continue to acquire intercontinental ballistic missiles intercontinental ballistic missiles why do you need intercontinental ballistic missiles if you have peaceful designs for your nuclear program ladies and gentlemen those of you who are listening at home across America remember this an intercontinental ballistic missile is not a missile design for tel-aviv an intercontinental ballistic missile is designed for New York City and Washington DC and Atlanta Georgia in Los Angeles California and Seattle Washington and Chicago our homeland security has been jeopardized because of this fatally flawed agreement an Iran will receive a sanctions relief jackpot they've already received upwards of a hundred billion dollars so far and in the in our capacity as the chairman of the subcommittee that oversees sanctions overseas the Treasury Department's implementation of sanctions we've heard it we've heard the reporting that as a result of this Agreement Iran has not become pacified Iran has actually accelerated its support for terrorist proxies in Lebanon and Gaza Syria Iraq Yemen and Nigeria and because Iran's neighbors know that this deal reverses a decades-long bipartisan US policy blocking Iran's nuclear program this agreement continues to risk a nuclear arms race in the broader Middle East now look our apologist they're defenders of the Iran nuclear deal and they say it's working they say there's evidence of dismantling of the nuclear program but we have the benefit of almost two years of implementation of the deal we have the benefit of hindsight to see if this deal is actually working here are the facts the facts are that since the joint comprehensive plan of action was implemented in January of 2016 Iran has continued to sponsor Hezbollah and other radical terrorist militias in the region its support for the Assad regime alone including the use of planes to airlift military supplies has helped claim an estimated 400 lives last April even President Obama suggested that the Iranians were violating the spirit of the deal by engaging in these activities rather than being deterred Iran went on in October to sentence three Americans to long prison terms on bogus charges in January of this year the country tested a ballistic missile in violation of UN Security Council resolution to 231 in April just as a commercial airline manufacturer was announcing new sales to Iran as a result of the sanctions relief under the jcpoa we learned that dozens of Syrian civilians including at least 11 children were gassed in an Iranian supported chemical weapons attack additionally Iran has stated that it will no longer permit inspections of its military bases it continues to intent attempt to intimidate our allies and is facilitating the imports and exports of arms as of February 2017 Iran has fired as many as 14 ballistic missiles and the leaders of Iran continued to chant death to America and pledged to wipe Israel off the face of the planet so where do we go from here as the chairman of the subcommittee that oversees enforcement of sanctions we have been working on additional measures that can be taken including non-nuclear sanctions consistent with the jcpoa to hold Iran accountable for its malign activities on April 4th we held a hearing on the effectiveness of non nuclear sanctions against Iran where we determined that Iran air a state-owned commercial airline as you it's aircraft to transport fighters and weapons throughout the Middle East on behalf of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a result of these findings I wrote a letter to Treasury secretary minutiae urging him to ban the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran air similarly I supported to appropriations amendments that would prevent the sale of aircraft to Iran and prohibit US firms from financing such a sale finally I recently drafted a letter to the Treasury Department urging it to identify all entities it believes to have transacted business with the IRGC a precursor to possible additional secondary sanctions these actions are all important and relevant in the aftermath of the president's correct decision to decertify the deal because it invites Congress to step in and offer constructive recommendations on how to to address the flaws the fatal flaws in the in the JCAP jcpoa these are some of those recommendations to the administration and we hope the Treasury Department will respond accordingly going forward we must do the following to stem Iran's nuclear ambitions we must designate the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization we must make permanent the sunset causes on Iran's nuclear program in testing this cannot be temporary prohibition of the Iran nuclear program this must be a permanent ban on Iran ever having nuclear weapons capability and the capability of delivering those weapons and finally we need to do a better job strengthening the agreement revising the agreement scrapping the old agreement and actually getting to Anytime Anywhere inspections that means we've got to work with the p5 plus one and our European allies to revise the jcpoa so that we mandate Anytime Anywhere inspections of nuclear facilities and so that we are guaranteed that the IAEA that international inspectors and u.s. inspectors have access to all suspected sites within the territorial boundaries of Iran in conclusion I want to thank congressman Zeldin for the special order I want to thank President Trump and his administration for their leadership on stopping Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and for the important the important national security imperative of revisiting this flawed Iran nuclear deal so that we can actually achieve peace in the world and we thank congressman Zeldin for your leadership and in in pursuing this very important objective and I yield back well thank you congressman Barr and certainly in the days the weeks the months that are ahead many throughout our country will be leaning on your leadership as we discussed the path forward as far as sanctions and the right way to reestablish the leverage that brought the Iranians to the table in the first place at this time I'd like to introduce congressman Todd Rokita of Indiana as fourth congressional district congressman Rokita is a strong voice in ensuring that America has a an effective strong but effective foreign policy one that makes sure that our military is always set up for success our veterans are taken care of when they come home and as I mentioned earlier as I was introducing congresswoman teni part of that effort certainly is ensuring the right path forward as it relates to Iran so I introduced welcome congressman Todd Rokita for as much time as he may consume well I think the gentleman from New York for yielding and for hosting this special order and my humble opinion Speaker the people of New York are lucky to have a gentleman like this representing them and I know it's the highest honor of his life as well I also want to associate with my good friend from Kentucky mr. Barr for the remarks that he made I think he has made mr. Zeldin an excellent record of not only the the premise of the deal but the effect of the deal so far and I agree with mr. speaker I agree with the gentleman from New York that mr. Barr is going to be critical in leading the effort forward in sanctions whether they are part of the jcpoa or not so I think the gentleman from Kentucky for his words tonight as well you know earlier this month President Trump said a new direction for the United States a direction of leadership he made clear that we would no longer allow the Iranian government to continue to pursue nuclear weapons continue funding terrorism or threaten the very existence of our great friend Israel the strongest ally we have in the region president Trump made clear that unlike the previous administration we will not reward Iran for chanting death to America and we will not allow this terrorist regime to dictate our nation's foreign policy you see getting the Iran deal done was the only thing the previous administration cared about I think about that just getting the deal done I think we all remember that sentiment around here getting the deal done no matter how terrible was the only thing the previous administration cared about we had to get the deal done we had to get the deal done as bad as it was that's good yeah and it's unlike our current president who has demanded action to hold Iran accountable guarantee our national security and protect Israel and our allies across the world night and day and I appreciate the president's leadership on this and other matters you know the United States should never have signed on to the deal in the first place mr. speaker because it was a bad deal it gave Iran a meated access to a hundred and fifty billion u.s. dollars it allowed the Iranians to continue their ballistic missile research and it contains a sunset provision that will allow the Iranians to return immediately to enriching uranium without consequence now even then Secretary of State John Kerry said that quote some of the hundred and fifty billion dollars will end up in the hands of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps or other entities some of which are labeled terrorists unquote that was our Secretary of State's direct quote admitting that some of this hundred fifty billion dollars was going to get to terrorists now there is no situation in which the United States should allow money to get to terrorists Hoosiers that I represent see this quite clearly surely the Americans that the rest of us represent see the same thing but then President Obama and Secretary Kerry allowed this to happen and were cheered on in fact by many in this very chamber and many in the Senate now this year alone Iran has tested their ballistic missiles at least three times and they tested a rocket space launch vehicle now in their most recent test in September they used a ballistic missile with the potential range to hit Israel the only stable democracy in the region and as mr. Barr pointed out mr. speaker intercontinental ballistic missiles aren't even meant for Israel they're meant to come here they're meant to go to our other allies a bad deal indeed the threats Iran poses are truly extreme terrorists nuclear arms race and continued threats to America and its neighbors unfortunately we cannot get go back in time and stop then President Obama from signing this disastrous Iran nuclear deal and by the way it's signing in the in the theoretical sense because mr. Yoho was also right mr. speaker when he said that this was a group set of papers that really had no signatories it was an executive action by them President Obama for sure but all in all no matter what the semantics a bad deal but we can we can move forward by creating tough sanctions like mr. speaker mr. Barr was pointing out and making sure Iran is held accountable and that starts tonight with the work that Lee Zeldin and other members of Congress are doing I think Mr Speaker I thank the gentleman from New York again for yielding me this time I thank him for his leadership mr. speaker let's get it right this time let's make sure Iran doesn't become the threat that the previous administration has allowed it to become I yield back Thank You congressman rakita for being here for your important words as well for all of the members who have spoke I would also like to recognize House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman at Royce congressman Peter Roskam former congressman now CIA director Mike Pompeo just some of the voices over the course of these last few years on this very important issue and the need to hold Iran accountable and to fight for the best possible agreement for the United States over the course of tonight we discussed the jcpoa what was in it we discussed the jcpoa as far as what wasn't in it and some of the challenges that we have faced since the jcpoa has first been entered into now we all want to deal with iran's bad activities we have to ask ourselves how are we going to do that what's the leverage that brought the Iranians to the table to negotiate your own nuclear deal how do we get that leverage back now some people out there are saying that Iran is abiding by their word that the United States would somehow be going back on our word by the president D certifying the Iran nuclear deal and we can have a discussion about what violates the spirit of the Iran nuclear deal and we talked about Iran's are there bad activities their financing of terror over throwing a foreign governments illegally test-fire intercontinental ballistic missiles holding Americans hostage publicly embarrassing American Navy sailors we had to pay a ransom to get hostages back in January of 2016 they call Israel a little Satan America the Great Satan they pledged to wipe Israel off the map they chant death to America they're supporting Assad in Syria and Hezbollah what do we deal do to deal with Iran's non-nuclear bad activities right now we don't have the leverage to deal with that we really needed to bring that to the table when we were sitting down with Iran last time because when you negotiate away the leverage that brings them to the table what is left to deal with all of those activities that we would say violate the spirit of the jcpoa but people say that if if the president he certifies Iran nuclear deal that would mean that we are going back on our word and then Iran has been abiding by the deal we cannot forget about all of the ways that Iran is violating the letter of the jcpoa why is there no accountability in debate as we know that Iran spins more ir6 centrifuges than they are permitted to under the jcpoa why are we talking about that why aren't we saying that Iran is not following their word when they assemble more rotor assembly ir8 rotor assemblies than they are allowed to under the jcpoa why aren't we saying that iran is not following through with their word as they attempt to purchase carbon fiber that they are not allowed to try to purchase under the jcpoa why are we giving Iran a free pass to the president's opposition despise him so much that you're willing to literally take Iran's side when Iran says that we will never be able to inspect any of their military sites before during after this deal they said we'll never be able to inspect all their military sites the Obama administration said we will inspect their military site so you have a material disagreement on this jcpoa this Iran nuclear deal we said that sanctions were going to be phased in over time based on compliance the Iranian regime said sanctions relief we're going to be immediate no suspension but why are we not holding Iran to their word on the ways that they are violating the letter of the jcpoa why is it that before implementation day when inspectors the last time they gets a parching and a fine nuclear they find particles in the soil that are consistent with nuclear capability and then after we discover those particles the Iranians say that's it no more access to Parchin why are we not saying that Iran is not following their commitments under the jcpoa this is the letter of the jcpoa that would be great if we can have a discussion here about what the verification regime is i would love to read the deal between the IAEA and Iran when when I was out when I was at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing with then Secretary of State John Kerry and I wanted to engage with him to have a conversation about what the verification agreement was I was shocked that even he said that he hadn't read the verification regime between the IAEA and Iran it really scratches your head and I asked the question here on the House floor last Congress while we were debating the jcpoa I said President Obama says that we're entering into the jcpoa not based on on trust but based on verification so my question that I posed then and I still haven't gotten an answer today is how do you support a deal based on verification without knowing what the verification is we're propping up the wrong regime and in 2009 during the Green Revolution an undemocratic election millions of Iranians go to the streets these are people who go to the streets that right now that there are people millions of Iranians today who would love a free stable democratic Iran after an undemocratic election they go to the streets we said it was none of our business fast forward years later we're paying a ransom 400 million dollars that was disputed for good reason for decades claims going both ways there's a reason why that money wasn't paid out there was a disputes multiple claims u.s. to Iran and Iran to the United States and then 1.3 billion dollars of interest they said it wasn't no it wasn't a ransom 1.7 billion dollars in cold hard cash in pallets that have to get delivered at the exact same moment of the American hostages by the way not all of them at the exact same moments of the American hostages being released and we're saying that that's not ransom that was a coincidence that we're signing documents in the middle of January on the same exact day within 24 hours of each other now after we provided a jackpot of sanctions relief in exchange for this very one-sided deal there was an election and after that election in Iran members of the American media and around the world they said this was evidence of progress in Iran that the most moderate candidates were elected but you know what that completely ignores the 12,000 most moderate candidates not being allowed access to the ballot we're propping up the wrong regime and after our American sailors were detained held hostage and embarrassed and videos and photography all around the world we said thank you that was a response thank you and after all the concessions that were made as part of the jcpoa our Secretary of State became president for the tehran chamber of commerce and here we are fast-forward to today and everyone who wants to see this president fail will stand with Iran before they would stand with the United States they will ignore Iran violating the spirit of jcpoa they will turn a blind eye head-in-the-sand over Iran violating the letter of the jcpoa Mr Speaker we gathered here this evening to talk about the president's correct decision to decertify the jcpoa the Iran nuclear agreement to talk about the need to eliminate Iran's very problematic nuclear and non-nuclear activities we heard from a half a dozen other members of Congress Congressman Joe Wilson of South Carolina's second congressional district David cust off of Tennessee's 8th congressional district congressman Ted Yoho of Florida's third congressional district congresswoman Claudia Tenny of New York's 22nd Congressional District Congressman Andy Barr of Kentucky 6th congressional district and congressman Todd Rokita of Indiana x' 4th congressional district I thank them I thank all of my colleagues for their leadership on this issue there's important work ahead and there really should be more work on both sides of the aisle working together on behalf of the American people putting country first on this issue they're people since the election they've they've pledged to entirely oppose and obstruct this president on everything in anything while the president's hand was on the Bible the streets of the parade route were lined up with people holding up signs that said impeach him now while his hand was on the Bible last November Americans all around this country elected a president whose hand was on the Bible yet people are calling for his impeachment just for the fact that he got elected and every day we're here we have members who come to the floor doing whatever they can in any way that day that minutes to try to tear the president down I had disagreements with President Obama but he was my president and you know we disagreed on the Iran nuclear deal and that's okay we can disagree we should disagree with President Trump or President Obama or President Bush before that where we have strong philosophical differences on policy so we're elected to do we're not elected to all just come here and agree with each other but for those who are so set politically on trying to bring this president down so much so that they will take Iran's side in this over the United States I'd encourage you to rethink that and put country over party because we need to work together as colleagues representing the greatest country in the world on a better path path forward it's a privilege for all of us to be able to serve here in the United States Capitol United States Congress because there's so much history on this floor and there's gonna be much debate ahead on what challenges lie ahead for us with regards to Iran and with service members in harm's way we understand and we reflect that really that's what's most important we should never send our troops into harm's way unless they are sent to win we send our troops to win or we do not send them at all and when they come home they're treated with the love the dignity the respect that they deserve on behalf of a very grateful nation and with a strong consistent foreign policy and taking care of our vets and setting up our military for success it's having the right foreign policy with challenges that are in front of us in the Middle East and elsewhere and that is why we are here for this hour this special order in support of the president's decision to decertify the Iran nuclear deal mr. president you made the right decision we stand with you we stand with the United States we want to hold Iran accountable we want the best path forward for our great country I yield back

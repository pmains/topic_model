i'm tina smith i am a pediatric nurse of 31 years and i'm an advocate for sexual assault survivors i became involved it's maybe been about four or five years ago now my sexual assault was when i was a child so it wasn't until i was late 40s early 50s that i started talking about what happened to me and that's where my advocacy began and sharing my story made me feel a little more powerful and i hope empower others to to do the same and to not just share their stories but to get out there and stand up what's right for victims of assault i am absolutely voting for senator jeanne shaheen this year i've always felt followed she puts new hampshire citizens first and she um she cares she listens and then she kind of rolls her sleeves up and gets to work senator shaheen um she's fought pretty much her whole career for victims of crime and her sexual assault survivors bill of rights act is something that has protected victims of abuse in new hampshire and throughout the country senator shaheen listens to us she believes and that's important as a survivor they're hard conversations to have and she's not afraid to sit down and hear those conversations i have admittedly opened and been honest that i have not always been someone that's voted didn't feel like my voice mattered as much and seeing the work of people like senator jeanne shaheen has just pushed me to show how important it is to vote [Music]

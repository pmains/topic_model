congressman mike gallagher also house minority whip steve scalise who you saw at the beginning there he led the gop press conference today on the origins of the pandemic thank you gentlemen great to have both of you with us um i i want to start with this actually um to you mike gallagher this is a sound bite from the then secretary of defense mark esper who was asked about this and i want to just remind everybody that these games happened in the early fall of 2019 september october 2019. so this is a crucial moment in history of this watch us okay thank you all very much very special screening for the military team that went to wu horn the athletes athletic team i'm not aware what you're talking about so you see how that went um congressman gallagher do we think that any of our athletes who attended have tested for covet antibodies do we know if any of them got sick then we don't that's why we need answers from the pentagon what we do know is that athletes from countries like france italy germany have reported having like symptoms so all i am asking secretary austin and chairman milly to do is review the 284 americans who went to those games and asked simple questions were they sick do we have antibody tests though it's you know too late to do some testing we can get their medical records we need to get a better understanding of the origin of this pandemic to understand all of the things that the chinese communist party did to cover up the disease thereby costing us precious time and potentially millions of lives is there are you suggesting congressman gallagher that that there was that the pentagon knows something about this that they're not sharing i'm just suggesting that it would be a good idea to talk to all of the athletes who went to the wuhan games and get an assessment as to whether they think they were exposed right we now know thanks to declassified information from the outgoing trump administration that lab workers at the wuhan institute were infected as early as november some points have put that even earlier so imagine if the chinese communist party knew that they had an outbreak but still allowed the games to happen what we would have is our first super spreader event where 9 000 athletes go back to their home countries expediting the spread of the pandemic what about you uh congressman scalise do you think that the pentagon knows more about this than they're letting on is there any reason to think that well what we're finding out every day is that there's a mountain of evidence growing that there were people scientists here in america that knew the high likelihood that the virus started in the wuhan lab and yet they weren't sharing it with others and in fact those of us who a year ago and longer ago were suggesting not claiming but suggesting it might have started in the lab we're being called conspiracy theorists those kind of posts were blocked on social media and now today most of the medical community in not only the united states but around the world recognizes it might have very well started in the lab but yet not a single hearing by speaker pelosi in the house on this it's like they're trying to cover up for china instead of getting basic answers that we all ought to want to find the truth about yeah i understood but just to go back to my question for just quickly um do you think the pentagon has been forthcoming about what they know about whether or not any of the athletes uh in the military more than 200 in the fall of 2019 got covered well we don't know that martha and just like congressman gallagher said we should be trying to get the answers to this we are trying to get those answers uh and if they don't allow hearings it's hard to get those answers because those officials don't come in that's why we're going to be having our own hearing next week and we've called a lot of witnesses to come forward good respected scientific and medical experts that hopefully can shed more light on this but frankly it's speaker pelosi they have the subpoena powers they should be bringing everybody in who had communication with those scientists at the woohon lab because china's surely not being forthright the communist party there is hiding evidence maybe has destroyed evidence let's find out as much as we can now but we can still get some of those answers but you know this is what i heard dr marty mccary of johns hopkins bring up earlier today in another interview earlier on fox and he said you know it's great that congress is looking into this but they're not likely to find anything that you know so much has been destroyed the chinese government has a vested interest in making sure that none of this ever gets out uh and that there are not any samples from those early covid um from those early cover genetic dna uh samples that that they that they're not you're not going to find them is this is this effort going to have any anything free i don't necessarily agree with that assessment because we're learning more today just in the last few weeks i mean look at the email trove that came out a few weeks ago you know there are more reports now that gain a function research whether it was directly or indirectly funded had a role to play in this the way that they were genetically modifying the mice over there in that move on lap all of these are things we can find out a lot more and people in america know some of those answers let's at least get those answers on the table yeah uh and i think the you know coordinated pressure on china to tell us what they know is you know even if we don't get it we have to do that and certainly in conjunction with many other countries in the world thank you very much congressman scalise good to see you today congressman gallagher thank you very much sir good to see you both good being with you martha thank you

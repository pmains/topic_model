one of the difficulties of the uh of the citizens united case is it's a constitutional decision and that means it really can't be changed by the by the congress they can't just write a bill and it's based upon they based it upon the first amendment essentially and the idea that corporations are people and therefore they have an ex opportunity or freedom to express themselves just as individuals uh that makes it much harder to fix they did there is one loophole if you will uh that the decision explicitly uh left open and that is disclosure believe it or not clarence thomas wrote a concurring opinion where he said there shouldn't even be disclosure uh which i found sort of breathtaking uh but so the first step it seems to me is timely disclosure so if that billionaire i mentioned from wherever at least the people of maine would know who he or she is where his or her money came from and and on a timely basis not five days after the election so that i think that's a step that can be made immediately uh beyond that it it's going to be very difficult we may end up having to look at a constitutional amendment uh because it's again unless there's a change in the composition of the supreme court it's going to be very difficult to do much substantively with that uh with that decision but you're absolutely right i i'm convinced uh that it's the it is a huge part of of of the problem that we have now because quite often our representatives aren't representing us they're representing the people that are funding them

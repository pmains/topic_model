I rise today with great gratitude for the men and women all across our country who serve our federal government now Virginia is home to one hundred and seventy eight thousand of these public servants as well in Virginia we have over 90,000 active duty members of our military and while many of our federal employees in Virginia live in the DMV or in the Greater Capital Region the truth is even in a state like ours even the Commonwealth of Virginia 79 percent of our federal workers live outside the beltway and as someone who spent longer in business and in management than I have in the role as a senator I know one of the things that any good business leader or for that matter I tried to do is when I was governor of the state is how you treat your workforce reflects the quality of service that workforce provides to its customers and in this case the customers of the federal government are the American people and the work of our federal government and the way our federal government invests in its workforce the way we manage and invest in human capital is not by any means a partisan or for that matter coming from the Commonwealth of Virginia State with so many federal workers its but not by any means a parochial issue this is an issue that impacts all Americans all Americans who pay taxes who follow our laws and expect the federal government to work for them and to work well in an efficient manner that's why mr. president I also rise today with great concern about recent efforts by this administration to scapegoat and undermine the work of our federal employees it started with hiring freezes that threw a wrench into the day-to-day operations of nearly every federal agency and frankly this kind of wrench that was thrown in with no apparent benefit to the taxpayers writ large it continued with executive orders undermining work port workforce for federal workers and their ability to organize as part of a union and have that collective voice heard in terms of representations with management and it culminated last month with the Trump administration's plan to freeze federal employee pay and cut retirement benefits for 2.6 million federal retirees and survivors 2.6 million federal retirees and survivors having the retirement benefits cut this is the thanks our federal employees get for their service now president Trump campaigned on a promise to drain the swamp but the great irony is that the most glaring instances of failure and corruption at the federal level in recent months have not come from career federal employees they've come from appointees installed by this administration look no further than the EPA where the American people fall some of the most blatant examples of swamp-like behavior in the waste and abuse from former EPA Administrator mr. Pruitt we also saw that with few exceptions those at the EPA with the courage to stand up and say this is not okay we're not appointees but were career federal employees and for some and for some that meant they were either demoted or reassigned in retaliation all because they had the courage to speak up and to do what was right this is the thanks that our federal employees got for their service got for their service of trying to protect taxpayer funds got for their service of trying to prevent waste and fraud got for their service in trying to point out the swamp-like behavior to quote mr. Trump there's a pointee scott pruett unfortunately mr. president these issues don't appear to be confined to the walls of one agency or one rogue administrator we've seen disturbing reports of Trump political appointees purging career employees at the State Department and at the Veterans Administration these reports should concern all of us Republicans and Democrats alike who believe in good and honest government by and for the people now my hope is that we can stop this ongoing onslaught on our federal work force we will have differences but as again somebody who spent longer in business than I have in government if you want your workforce to do well you need to reward those who do well challenge and penalize who don't perform but not take these broad brushstrokes that unfortunately have come out of this administration frankly undermining both the performance and the morale of federal employees who serve day in and day out without a lot of recognition now before I close I want to make another comment on this subject because one part of our federal government in particular or naked partisanship not only functions our government but really functions the rule of law itself what I'm speaking about of course is about the attacks ad hominem for the most case against our federal law enforcement agencies and our intelligence community the intelligence community as we know was founded 71 years ago tomorrow when President Truman signed the National Security Act that date July 26th also marks the hundred and 10th birthday of the FBI as well as intelligence professionals day a time to show our gratitude to those brave and women men and women who keep us safe every day if only that gratitude that I know is shared by people on both sides the aisle were shared by our current commander in chief unfortunately in the months since the Russia attacked the very institutions of our democracy we've seen some of the most bizarre reactions from the president and his allies instead of uniting our country behind the cause of defending democracy and bringing our adversaries to justice this president has led an all-out attack on the credibility of the FBI the Justice Department and our intelligence community demeaning career FBI officials who save countless American lives over their careers impugning the motives a special counsel Muller perhaps the most respected federal lawman of this generation worst of all we saw the president knighted States stand on stage with Vladimir Putin last week and publicly side with Putin over the career men and women of our intelligence community many of whom risk their lives on a daily basis in order to keep our country safe this is the thanks they get for their years of service oftentimes particularly folks in the intelligence community who serve without any recognition mr. president the men and women of the FBI the Department of Justice and the intelligence community deserve better all of our public servants deserve better than what we've seen from this administration my advice for this president if he's really serious about draining the swamp is to leave our federal employees alone and take a good look at some of the folks that he's appointed with in his own administration Thank You mr. president

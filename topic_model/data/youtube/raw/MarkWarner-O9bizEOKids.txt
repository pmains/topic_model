Democratic Senator Mark Warner good morning to you senator good morning Gretchen now I know that you the gain of six met with the super committee about a week ago what happened at that meeting we tried to lay out the fact that there's a super committee it's actually easier to try to go for a bigger deal try to and go ahead and cut our deficit by additional three trillion on in addition to the one trillion we cut at the end of July that it's easier to get a three trillion dollar number than it is to get 1.2 trillion now that means if you get 23 trillion you've got to go ahead and deal with the dreaded revenue question in terms of tax reform it means you've got to deal with the dreaded entitlement question but if you try to simply piece this together without a larger framework it's tough to do so you know one of the good news there's a lot of grim news in Washington in these days but one of the critiques we got with the Gang of Six well this was only a Senate effort even though we've got 45 senators now signed on but just yesterday we got a hundred House members almost equal number of Democrats Republicans saying come on super committee if you go big we got you back right you got you back but is once I going to allow additional revenues is the other side going to allow entitlement cuts here's what the Democrats roughly are proposing they're going to cut three trillion over the ten years off the deficit including five hundred billion cut from medicare and medicaid and raises 1.3 trillion in revenue that's huge the Republicans are going to trim the deficit by two trillion cutting 685 billion from health benefits raising less in revenue taxes and fees do you see any sign on the revenue that there's give well listen I think there has to be one of the ways we can tell whether the super committee is getting close whether the negotiations are serious is whose head on the extremes are spinning you know the Democrats got a lot of grief for their proposal the AARP came out and attacked him in others there was not the same level of grief on the Republican side I think you know we're going to know what they're closed if both the kind of if some of the groups on the left and some of the groups on the right are both squawking equally that's the only way you're going to see I think a real compromised ok that's interesting because so far they've been pretty secretive but maybe you can see some implicit squawk and going on there I gotta listen with the alternative is what no I know what's going on in Greece I mean this should not be rocket science this brings me to my next question which is the gain of six had a lot more time as in months to put together their plan this super committee now is down to less than three weeks did you advise them to just simply either take the debt Commission plan or to take your plan and have that be the the boilerplate contract and then just go from there to save time well we did say that you know our plan which is frankly simpson-bowles with you know tighter spending enforcement's and some other some other aspects you know we spent a year on our simpson-bowles spent another year we hope they would build off of that we know in the next two weeks they're not going to completely rewrite the tax code so if they put this into a two-step process get as much down as possible and then set another peg the time with the consequences if they don't act you know the remarkable thing is we get a straight up-or-down vote and they can put whatever they want into this agreement if we miss this chance you know we're back to the regular order of feuding and fighting and that would be a real mistake I'd feel a lot better if you were on their committee but I do have something else to say senator Warner and I know you're very proud of this you're the honorary chairman of a billion-plus change it has a big announce you have a big announcement today about what what thresholds you have just crossed well thanks for asking about this this is an effort to try to make sure that corporate america that doesn't awful lot to give back to their communities that we find a way to recognize that and encourage other corporations to give back not just by writing a check by but getting their actual individuals and the companies involved in the community we've got over 50 companies have now committed over a billion hours a billion two hours in terms of giving back to their communities over the next year we want to increase that to about 300 companies you know there's a lot of people bashing business these days but there's an awful lot of good that business does and we want to try to highlight that so we've got a big announcement this morning are you gonna make it here well it's just that we hope to go from 1.2 billion that was already been promised with 50 companies we want to increase that to over 300 companies we want to solicit other corporations to get involved in terms of not just again writing a check but having their employees often times not just paint a house but sometimes give their professional services from nonprofits and others and we hope to kind of blow that campaign out with a big announcement of using your influence in context for a great reason Senator Mark Warner thanks so much thanks guys all right who knew Medicare allowed this doctors writing off dance lesson

Well we're standing at the base of lower
granite dam. The last dam on the Snake River and this is key to the economic
vitality of the Inland Northwest. Our grain goes out to the world we have the
quality of the grain and the transportation system and you can have a
quality product but if you can't get it to market it's not worth much, and this
is our freeway to the world. If these dams were removed the product it would
move down them, would add six hundred and seventy five thousand trucks to our
roads. If you've been over to Seattle on the weekend there's not room for another
six hundred and seventy-five thousand trucks. It's not a one or the other, there's room
for fish. There's room for a navigation there's room for hydroelectric
production. Cathy absolutely knows the issues. She has been a tireless advocate
for our way of life here in the northwest, specifically Eastern
Washington she understands the economic viability and the complexities of our
economy there's a hundred thousand jobs that are tied to the river system that's
a lot of jobs and if we didn't have those that would have a great impact on
our local economies. And it wouldn't be a good one.

Madam President judges you know the judges are making decisions around the country right now right now in voting rights on civil rights on LGBT rights on women's rights when health care and sentencing on corporate power this body this body several times several times over the last couple of years has said no even though almost every Republican all with good government paid health insurance all with good salaries all well-dressed all be above senator after senator in this body tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act or take away Medicaid or take away consumer protection so that people who have a pre-existing condition would have their insurance canceled they all stood there on that but you know what enough people in this country because millions and millions were affected enough people in this country said no and push back and stopped the Republican majority from taking away the protections of pre-existing addition in stopping insurance companies from canceling people's insurance that got too sick and too expensive or could never get insurance in the first place so you know what this Republican majority did they went through the courts and they they have voted for and supported Supreme Court justices and district judges and federal and circuit judges and district judges who have put their thumb on the scales of justice and pick corporations over workers in chosen Wall Street over consumers and chosen insurance companies over sick people over and over again this body tried to do it but democracy rose up and said no you're not going to take our health insurance no you're not gonna let the insurance companies run everything no you're not gonna let Wall Street run everything no you're not going to do that but you know what because they couldn't do it through democratic participation Madam President because they couldn't do it by going down to Mitch McConnell's office the Republican leader they couldn't walk down the hall all their lobbyists and stop that from happening they decided to try doing it through the federal judiciary remember what I said they put their thumb on the scale of justice they choose Wall Street over work over consumers they choose the insurance companies over sick people that's what this vote is about that's what this judge is all about today this body yesterday confirmed a judge who would limit rights for a generation these are judges they're almost all inexperienced these are lawyers that are in their 30s or early 40s they're not what we used to do we used to pick President Obama used to do this President Bush off and did this president bush senior used to do this pick sort of wise prudent would be the word that President Bush senior would use wise prudent lawyers who believed in public service didn't believe in some far-right agenda where they put their thumb on the scale of justice and hurt workers and hurt consumers they picked middle-of-the-road thoughtful prudent judges that actually believed in civil rights shocky they actually believed gay people should have a chance in this country that actually believed that workers should get a fair shot but you know because they have picked judges that put their thumb on the scale of justice we see the rich are getting richer and richer rich getting richer and richer we see the middle class in New Hampshire in Ohio and Nebraska gets squeezed over and over and over again we see what's happened to this country we see we see lobbyists coming down the hall into Senator McConnell's office a Republican leader writing tax bills you know what you know what that tax law that President Trump wanted and then he signed you know what it does it says if a company shuts down in Lordstown Ohio which it's done General Motors this week 4500 people have lost their jobs they pay a tax rate of 21% you know what under the Trump tax law they can move south of the border and they pay a tax rate of ten and a half percent so in other words they get a 50% off coupon companies that shut down production in Omaha or in Manchester or in Cleveland and move overseas they get a 50% off coupon on their taxes that's what these fights are about these fights are about the special interests that run this Senate the companies that outsource and the drug companies in Wall Street heck Madam President Walsh the White House looks like a retreat for Wall Street executive Madam President I ask for an initial five minutes is there objection thank you madam president of Jackson now this issue today we're about to vote on it's about Eric Murphy it's about confirming a very young very experienced lawyer in Cleveland whose claim to fame is he argued against marriage equality in the landmark obergefell Hodges case so why Jim obergefell has spoken out against his nomination now here's what he said he actually argued marriage marriage equality would be disruptive disruptive to our nation telling people who love each other they can't marry that's disruptive to our nation who does that harm why why would it matter a couple in in Atlanta indicator or a couple in in in Sioux Falls and or a couple in Topeka or Omaha or Lincoln or Manchester or Laconia or Cleveland or mance well why would it matter why why would it be disrupt this this bhisma gentlemen who were about and I know every Republican except maybe one courageous one will vote for him because that's how we do it nowadays you can't win through the democratic process you'll win through the back door in the judiciary that's what they're going to do they're gonna vote for a man who said it's disruptive to not allow people who love each other to marry he'll make decisions on the right of LGBT to cup couples he will you know some in this body like to claim they support people regardless of their of their orientation he's moved to restrict access to contraceptives for women we're gonna we're gonna have women Republicans vote for somebody like that he's defended big tobacco as if there's any defense for addicting our children to tobacco we've had huge public health victories but let's go back let's go back on voting rights let's go back on supporting public health let's go back on equal rights for people let's go back on civil rights is that is that what we're gonna do today but maybe most despicable on this day today fifty-four years ago in in mr. figures commuted in his state of Alabama fifty-four years ago my wife had visited this bridge five times crossed this bridge since then fifty-four years ago John Lewis our colleague down the hall you know pass just on the other side of the special-interest Majority Leader's office down the hall John Lewis a young member young 23 year old 25 year old I think at that point got his head in by Alabama state troopers you know why because he wanted people to register to vote he wanted people to have their full rights now that happened 54 years ago today the day we're gonna vote on mr. Murphy mr. Murphy defended Ohio's voter purge taking registered voters off the off the rolls he led the reef efforts to take away the golden week in Ohio passed by a Republican legislature bipartisanly he defended restrictive voter ID in professional ballot rules a provisional ballot rules so Connie and I this weekend were walked across the Edmund Pettus Bay Edmund Pettus Bridge we saw foot soldiers who had been beaten up 54 years ago as they were trying to cross this bridge we listened to their stories they were these men and women were beaten many of them were 15 16 18 20 years old they did that so their children that they would in the future and their children have the right to vote but judges around this country judge is supported by this majority none of whom think for themselves when it comes to voting on these nominations all the way up to the Supreme Court they're dismantling these rights I don't I can't imagine my colleagues my Republican colleagues came here from Georgia and Kansas and Nebraska or Montana and I think he's going to vote right I can't imagine I just can't imagine they came here thinking I'm gonna take the oath of office right here up right in that corner I'm gonna take the oath of office and you know what things I'm going to do I'm going to vote to restrict voting rights I'm going to vote to tell gay people they can't marry I'm going to vote to take away worker rights I'm going to vote for judges that put their thumb on the scale of justice and choose corporations and outsource jobs over workers and choose Wall Street over consumers and choose big healthcare insurance companies with their multi-million dollar salaries for executives and hurt poor people I'd hurt sick people I can't believe that's why any of you came so please vote no on Murphy please as this 54th anniversary of Selma happens right about this time of day I think they tried to cross the ridge around noon 54 years ago today almost from this moment I asked my colleagues to vote no

situation with armenia and azerbaijan has been very frustrating and i don't believe azerbaijan has lived up to their agreements and certainly uh we've learned a lot of things in the last two months but russia clearly is not good at keeping their word with the war criminal who is heading the country today um what can we expect for additional support for armenia and and trying to hold azerbaijan to the commitments they made uh in the truce uh settlement uh congressman this is something that i've been very engaged on including uh throughout the uh the ukraine situation i've spoken repeatedly with uh prime minister uh passion armenia as well as president-elect from azerbaijan trying first of all to make sure that no one takes any steps that would potentially revert to conflict but also to try to advance uh and support a long-term uh political settlement and by the way we still have us our status as a minutes group uh co-chair uh we've been developing promoting confidence-building measures uh and again i've spoken repeatedly to to both leaders as well as the foreign ministers our budget has uh 45 million dollars of assistance in it uh for armenia uh two million of that is is for demining which is for demanding right and we need to do more

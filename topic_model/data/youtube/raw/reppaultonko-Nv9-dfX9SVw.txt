an extraordinary and compelling event uh we're gonna start things off with congressman tonko offering a few brief remarks uh we have some honored guests uh that we'll be going to for some introductions and then discussion to follow as a standard with our faces of series uh if you have questions members of the media please feel free to drop them into the chat box or at the very end uh we'll just open things up and we can we can keep things pretty light and uh we should have some time for questions and uh i think the congressman will facilitate at that point so uh without further ado i'm going to hand things off to congressman tonko congressman hey thank you matt good morning everybody and thank you for joining us because we have some very powerful messages that will be shared by families today individuals whose children are affected by rare diseases and suffice it to say these families are tremendously courageous most loving and have shared with us their journeys and they've become the inspiration for legislation that i've introduced first let me just welcome our guests and then i'll explain our legislation we have joining us from the district uh three individuals we have melissa goats whose daughter juliana um has been diagnosed with fcs and i will let them uh define to their um whatever measure uh with the media uh what the fcs and other uh rare diseases are all about so that is melissa goats with her daughter juliana then we have lisa cariota carney whose daughter olivia lives with the angelman syndrome and then we have laurie sames whose daughter hannah has been diagnosed with g-a-n so their stories are tremendously powerful and they're looking for hope they're looking for the sort of intervention here from the federal agencies so as to best have that hope as it relates to either effective and affordable treatments or in the form of cures so we have developed the heart act helping experts accelerate rare treatments act the heart act would involve itself with the uh with the fda uh it addresses some seven thousand rare diseases that impact a staggering 30 million people 30 million americans and there really is a need i believe to be much more vigilant about providing a response to these individuals and their families we would require through the heart act that the risk evaluation and mitigation strategy necessarily incorporate the families what's an interesting side light here is that these families compile tremendous data and information and they become probably one of the best sources of information so as to aid in the efforts by the agency to uh move toward a cure or again more effective or affordable treatments so it involves uh it would require that formal involvement and in partnership with the families as they do their risk evaluation and mitigation strategy then there are sections of the world that have devoted uh more focus uh to combating rare diseases so our bill would require the gao uh to uh put together a partnership or at least review what the eu for instance is doing and within the eu setting in that framework of of countries there is some progress and again sound detention being paid uh rare diseases so we would require that that that that review with the eu be ongoing and that there be formal reports on an annual basis as to the progress or what the annual experience has been that's shared by fda this i think puts a structure into the process and allows people to have a better shot at realizing uh treatment or uh cures that would um uh enable the families to uh sense that uh that needed hope that would respond to their children this action this heart act is perhaps some of the greatest progress to come in some 38 years since the orphan drug act had been passed which began the first focus on rare diseases but i think we must and we can do better uh and so it's important for us to drive this effort so as to uh structure a response for on behalf of the families again their testimony their uh is their their stories related to us are very powerful powerful sentiments that enable us to uh be a more sensitive um a bit of federal government that would take to heart and mind uh their struggles and truly work in the best and most effective way for progress the bill that i've authored and have introduced as a sponsor is co-sponsored by um representative david mckinley of of west virginia ironically i just returned this weekend from a couple days of visit in west virginia with representative mckinley in an effort to have a bipartisan experience i traveled throughout many communities that he represents heard from the people about all sorts of issues he is the rancor on the subcommittee that i chair the subcommittee on environment and climate change and um it's our effort to try and build stronger relationships so that we can be more productive in washington so it's ironic that he is our co-sponsor on this legislation and i thank representative mckinley for that partnership um with that i think it's so important that you hear from our guests they can give you the real sense and the spirit and the heart of what drives this legislation so melissa why don't we start with you melissa is also co-president of the fcs foundation which she has put together in order to have that support that's essential and again uh she's here speaking to the needs of her daughter juliana melissa thank you so much um thank you for for putting this together and for allowing us to share our story it's so meaningful um for us to be able to do that and i just want to say thank you first and foremost to you congressman and to your staff who have been so supportive of the fcs foundation um and our experience with the fda and this legislation since day one it it means so much to us and it gives us so much hope that there is progress that we can make and we really appreciate that my pleasure my daughter juliana uh was born in 2012 and in 2013 uh we were in the hospital she had a liver infection a kidney infection and pancreatitis and her triglycerides were 28 000 so for reference uh triglycerides should be around 500. her blood was a bubblegum pink so we found out then that she had this ultra rare disease it's one in a million called fcs and as most mothers do when their children are diagnosed with anything they do a deep dive into whatever research they can find and there was nothing um there was no supporting community there was no research there was nothing and it felt very alone and isolating for a very long time until i met my co-president lindsay in 2015 and we met and it you know finding that community is so life-changing and that's how we started the fcs foundation so there is currently no treatment for fcs there was a potential drug that went for review with the fda that was not approved which sort of sparked this conversation for us and the importance of this legislation once we realized this was not an isolated fcs issue that a lot of rare disease groups were coming up against this um you know trying to get drugs approved within the fda uh we realized how important this was and you know it's really just about understanding the rare disease community i think the fda does a really great job and and we really look forward to having a great working relationship with them um but we think that there's just some things about rare disease that are unique you know small sample studies uh can be hard and finding patients to enroll in studies and understanding what rare patients are willing to do for risk benefit you know that's that's different than it's going to look for the larger community okay melissa thank you or do you have more that you want to share or no that's it for now i figured that was a good okay they're very very very well done um next we have lisa cariota carney whose daughter olivia uh has been diagnosed with angelman uh syndrome so lisa you could share your story with us please and again thank you for joining us thank you thank you for inviting me and melissa asked me to come in and speak a little bit about olivia as well but olivia's syndrome is uh one in thirty thousand and she was diagnosed at nine months old i was a special um needs teacher in albany and i knew something was wrong from the beginning she wasn't babbling she wasn't sitting up she wasn't meeting the milestones so um like melissa said it is it's heartbreaking to hear anything about a child let alone a syndrome that your child may not walk will not talk right now after 16 years we are on a committee um called fast and it's a program it's a organization for angelman syndrome and we are working on a cure um but they haven't came out with the uh the drug i think they're going through this spinal i i'm not quite sure how they're doing this yet or if it's medication but olivia's been in many studies in boston and in new york city for a cure trying to just close the gap of because olivia's deletion is a deletion on a gene of a chromosome so they were trying to close the gap of this uh gene so right now we're just kind of waiting and seeing if there will be a cure if medicine will be able to um help even just with her saying a few words or with her seizures um and with her gait the way she walks so hopefully with this new heart act if it gets passed we'll be able to find a cure or have someone help in the community thank you lisa thank you and uh finally we have laurie sainz um whose daughter haina hannah excuse me um has been diagnosed with g-a-n uh lori if you just could tell us a bit about hannah again we've talked to all three moms and they tell us their daughters are managing so that's good to hear but uh tell us about hannah please lori yeah hannah was diagnosed um with giant axonal neuropathy organ in march of 2008 she had just turned four and uh it's neurodegenerative um we basically picked ourselves up off the ground and decided to fight and we established hannah's hope fund thankfully we were able to raise um millions of dollars uh initially six million to fund the first in human gene therapy to the central nervous system that clinical study started in march of uh actually in may of 2015 and we had money our foundation hannah's hope fund had money for everything toxicology studies the first batch of human grade vector for the clinical trial we didn't have money to pay for a clinical trial even though gann is ultra rare i know about 100 cases around the world the national institutes of health in uh ninds did take on the clinical study um sadly it's moved at a glacial pace i believe just 12 patients have been injected since 2015. um so you know we are using the bayesian method of biostatistical analysis so when you have such a small patient sampling and ethically you can't do a first in human gene therapy clinical trial with a lumbar puncturing kids with a placebo arm so thankfully there was a great rational approach to that so the kids data pre-treatment taken at different intervals as the disease progresses in a natural history study those data sets are compared to the post-treatment data sets so we're really hoping that you know the the data is pretty powerful with such a small sampling for that intervention but that intervention is just uh targeting mostly the lower motor neurons in the central nervous system ganas is is a disease of every nerve cell in the body we also have a drug discovery program underway dr natasha snyder at unc at chapel hill is our principal investigator leading that effort we actually have three drugs that are already fda approved that we hope to repurpose one of them miraculously my daughter's already on because it was part of an immunomodulation protocol that she received prior to receiving the gene therapy back in 2016. we've done pre-clinical studies with that drug and in different models and we believe it's very efficacious for our disease it that drug off label would be a thirteen hundred dollars a month per patient it's um the drug has been around for decades and so we do have to do a small study obviously our sampling is very small um to hopefully get that drug approved and the other drugs approved to help our disease so this act is critically needed um the rare disease space these gene therapies take a very long time to develop they don't apply to many different types of genetic disorders whereas drug screens and especially if you can get a win with a repurposed drug um that already has a good safety profile we need an avenue with such small patient populations with limited funds to be able to show efficacy and without a placebo arm we don't have the numbers for a placebo arm we need to take those patients pre-treatment data sets and compare them to those post treatment data sets and a rational approach to looking at what risk benefit is for the ultra rare because it's far different than what these drugs are used for less severe um less much less traumatic popular diseases that they were originally approved for thank you lori so perhaps a question to any of the three of you to laurie lisa or melissa what's the biggest difference that you can imagine that would come into your lives with the passage of the heart act i would envision a a very close collaboration with an arm of the fda that fully understands risk benefit for my disease when we had our pre-investigational new drug meeting with the fda for our gene therapy i showed video clips um snippets from a two-year-old to a 22 year old and in that moment they understood risk benefit for my disease so i think there needs to be a collaborative effort because we can't expect them to know the intricacies or the dramatic impact of you know 7 000 different rare diseases so there needs to be a new model and i think this is a great avenue to help implement a new model right thank you and um any other comments from i i think to echo exactly that you know when we when we went through the process with the fda for our the previous drug you know we we did the patient-led meetings we participated in the advisory committee hearing um but there was still sort of a disconnect between their understanding of what it truly meant to live with this ultra-rare disease and at one point in the advisory committee hearing um one of the risks was little platelets and they said well you're just substituting one you know one thing for another meaning low platelets for pancreatitis and that to me was just the biggest moment where i said they don't understand our disease because the risk of of low platelets is not the same as knowing our patients are going to wake up month after month in the hospital with pancreatitis so really being able to have that dialogue with them of understanding what it means to live with the rare disease um and that impact every single day of living with chronic pain or you know social anxiety and all the things that come with it um that will change what our patients are willing to tolerate in terms of treatment anything else so it's really establishing that dialogue and making certain that awareness is struck as to uh some of the very detailed and uh uh dynamic the dynamics that could make a difference uh are understood so um okay and so you know the the fact that um many of these rare diseases uh largely impact children um were you surprised by that fact the more you began to learn about your own child's situation oh yeah you know there was just like melissa there was not an investigator in the world funded to study my daughter's disease when she was diagnosed it was just unbelievable to me that there's these horrific childhood disorders that just no one knows about them and no one's working on them it was horrifying and then when we um we held the world's first first symposium for gann less than three months after hannah was diagnosed we brought dr stephen gray a young research associate in jude zamolsky's lab at unc at chapel hill he came to our symposium to learn about our disease and to see if they had anything going on in the gene therapy center that could impact our disease and then you know maybe nine months later we had data and we thought okay this could this could be it and it was a complete feeling of panic because what was stopping us was money um thankfully our community here in upstate new york they you know rallied around hannah's open and help us helped us raise the money but yeah it's isolating and terrifying um and anyone else want to uh well i think i think to that point too um you know it's hard to encourage some of these um clinicians and these and these companies to want to invest in rare disease also looking at you know having been through the process looking how difficult it can be to prove with a small sample study that that a drug is effective um you know these are these are companies you know and i'm not they're looking to make money by by developing these drugs you know and that's that doesn't offend me um but i think it's difficult for them to want to commit to these small populations when you know you look down and there's so many you look down the path and there there can be so many potential hurdles because there isn't an understanding of how important it is that these drugs get approval um their efficacy and their safety and all of those things and and just how easy or how difficult is it to find the right treatment um for for these diseases it's very difficult i mean it's it's harder than finding a needle in a haystack i mean the underlying disease mechanisms of all of these are usually quite unique the hope that you know we have is we find a drug that will for example enhance axonal transport so therefore it wouldn't just work for gan it would work for any type of neuropathy that impacts the axon versus the myelin portion of the nerve so we all you know when we meet with our scientific advisors we look for something sexy that has greater implications than just our small disease to try to peak the interest of industry to want to invest in it because it would be more impactful and thus you know make more money for shareholders um but it's tough yeah well you know each of you and speaking with you um have this obvious dedication and devotion uh to your children and their cause their medical need um and obviously the the accumulated information and data that you routinely compile becomes significant in that equation for success but something like this the um what does the promise of new treatment mean to your families obviously you're wrapped into this totally but what can you put into words what it means i i think for us and i'll it means hope you know because for me to be able to talk to juliana and to tell her um she recently started to experience one of the side effects of the disease which is uh xanthomas on her body it's basically the fat in her body is trying to find somewhere to go um and so we were talking about it and and i'm like you know we're we're working on it we're working on these clinical trials and we're working on finding something and i think just being able to share that with her and for her to think like okay people are paying attention and they care and that hope it it it helps it helps to just kind of continue on with your day otherwise it feels like you know you don't know what's going to happen right and and for us it's um quality of life anything that can help with you know having a better quality of life it's it's not about quantity it's about quality right you know right the quality of life for everybody in that picture in that frame yeah it's it's about you know for juliana it's like not having to miss a birthday party because you're in the hospital you know you know things that things we take for granted yeah um and if there were a message that you would share with members of congress with my colleagues um what would it be a message on behalf of those families and certainly the children living with rare diseases i would say that um you know in terms of of why this bill is so important you know the the fda is doing a good job they're doing the best that they can but this is a real problem that exists and that it's something that we need to look at and work on and be practical about and that's exactly what i think the five points here do and doing that will really help increase the ability for for effective and safe drugs to be approved for our rare disease communities to give them that hope because they need it and right now you know it's just not it's not flowing the way um it should be or it's supposed to be you know i think the fda will say that they have these things in place already but i can tell you from my experience and from speaking with other rare disease groups uh it is not working the way it's intended to work so these things help i think strengthen what the fda already wants to do it's just really holding everyone accountable to that right and with and with the intellect that obviously is part of this nation that intellectual capacity needs to be tapped into in the most effective way so that we can move this along as quickly as possible yeah in partnership you know i think bioethicists sometimes have tunnel vision and um can be very stubborn and day in day in the life you know just walking our shoes and these patients shoes just one day and you'd have a whole different perspective on risk benefit it really needs to be in partnership because they'll never understand unless they're shown and told and then they'll appreciate risk benefit for these horrific diseases you know i think you know you've just highlighted why uh it's so essential that patients and their families be part of the uh of the process yeah uh that their information their stories telling is incredibly important and and just the uh the overall compilation of data you know one thing i want to get into because we're all you know dealing with the impact of covid uh so many people have had family members loved ones neighbors whatever um past with the covet um virus and uh the crisis has influenced many people um has there been an impact on you and your loved ones oh yeah um hannah and i were on lockdown probably two weeks before it hit our area you know we were told it's it's in your area before you you get confirmed cases yeah i mean it's if you know that would be horrific for anyone with an underlying condition so yeah it completely changed the way we lived um and then you know once we got vaccinated um our world opened up again that's a great question because i think there's an element that people don't think about so juliana has to have a really low fat diet about 10 to 15 grams of fat a day a tablespoon of olive oil has 12 grams of fat to put in perspective so she has a diet of lean protein some pasta beans things that were not in grocery stores in march and april of 2020 and when i tell you the anxiety that i felt of how i would feed her because it still makes me upset um things that she could eat i could not find in the grocery stores i was having my friends at any supermarket to buy me packs of chicken um you know beans and to this day i still like horde in my basement now and in our freezer because i can't just feed her anything you know um or she'll be sick and the worst the last place i wanted her to be you know in april in may of 2020 was in the hospital um or any time but you know so the food there was food insecurity around her rare disease of how am i going to feed her and keep her healthy and not have access to basic things that are in the supermarkets and i think i remember thinking like if if you know the the people i spoke with at the fta knew how this felt right now and how terrifying this is um you know we we have to eat and i don't know if i'm always going to have options for her there you go gloria are you looking to contribute i think you are um no you know um i just you know i think the lockdown was just very hard on everyone but just to hear melissa and juliana's uh you know story of that covet impact and yeah these rare diseases are awful i didn't even consider you know someone like juliana during covet and terrific yeah and i know there was food insecurity with our our our other patients too you know we were sharing creative recipes online with one another like how can we use you know canned tuna or like whatever we can get our hands on how can we make this into a meal that will meet our dietary needs um and it was you know it was a strange impact that i didn't see coming lisa any other thoughts here i'm thinking i i was just saying to myself about with olivia with because she has such um anxiety with um like sensory issues i couldn't bring around to the community because she wouldn't wear a mask and everywhere i went i kept getting yelled at even though i had a doctor's note they kept saying that she wasn't allowed in stores or out um i remember trying to wheel her in a wheelchair through colony center one day and they told me she couldn't come in because she wouldn't wear a mask so it took me eight months to finally get her to wear a mask so simple things like that plus she didn't understand obviously what is going on in the world and she loves to hug people that's part of her syndrome so she couldn't she's wasn't allowed to hug wasn't allowed to touch anybody wasn't allowed to see our family so it was definitely a it was definitely a change right and it could uh result in setbacks i would think and right uh because of that you know the path the patterns for them may be very important right in their ways and then she wasn't going to school so so um matt perhaps we should see if we have any questions from our media folks great thank you congressman and thank you of course to our participants if anybody from the media who's assembled here has a question you can feel free to just unmute yourself and and ask away or again feel free to drop a question into chat and we'll get to your question hi um i have a question this is uh bethany bump from the albany times union um i'm hoping uh maybe congressman you can clarify this for me or one of the parents here but i'm trying to understand is there currently no avenue for family to provide input or to collaborate with the fda when it does do this risk evaluation and mitigation or is it just not given enough weight when they actually make their decisions i'm i'm happy to yeah quite i think this is best answered by you folks because you live it front line um so this is it's melissa um so there is there are avenues in place you know there are patient-led meetings um there are opportunities for groups to come in and share their story um what what we found was uh i don't know how heavy weight it carried because the the p if you had heard our patient testimonies at the advisory committee hearing and if you had heard what they had to say about their their willingness for risk benefit and and what they tolerated on a daily basis um i would have you i was very surprised that the fda could have heard that testimony and still um came back with what they came back with in terms of the drug the rems risk evaluation mitigation being too burdensome or you know platelets low platelets being the same as pancreatitis uh to me that meant that they really weren't listening and we reached out to the fda the fcs foundation did after the drug was not approved to say how can we work together how can we continue to share because our hope was that this was not the last time we would we would work with the fda that there would be additional clinical trials and so we said what can we do you know to work with you so that the next time a drug comes before you you really understand our disease state and what we essentially got was a well thank you but we'll be in touch and that was two and a half years ago and they have not been in touch so there are things in place and they're just not i i don't think that patients are really what they're saying is not really being taken into consideration yeah so bethany i think it's fair to say that while it's authorized or made available we would like to see it required yeah because that partnership is so bold and so meaningful and so um instructive requires that they incorporate the family input into their decision or require they listen because it sounds like they've been listening they're just not they're not incorporating you know for example we had to we had to specifically request that a rare disease expert be at one of our listening sessions we got the agenda beforehand and we saw that no one with rare disease experience was even going to be in that meeting with us and that was a big red flag for us because how were they making sense of our information the division that looks at fcs is the same division that looks at diabetes and those are two totally different disease states though we felt like someone from rare disease had to sit in on that meeting and we were surprised we had to request it specifically and what if we hadn't known to do so yeah lisa laurie is there anything you would want to add to what melissa said in response to bethany i haven't had direct contact yet um with the fda for um a drug other than the biologic that i previously mentioned that's still in um it's the pivotal phase two is starting um but i i guess it's there the fda has the final say but there has to be an objection period um you know you can declare a mistrial so i think that there needs to be an avenue in this situation like melissa has spoken about where like you got it wrong on this one you know um because we're ultra rare and because this is horrific and because the patients are willing to tolerate this you know x y and z but there's no avenue for that the gavel's been slammed and that it just there's no gavel in rare disease you know it needs there needs to be an avenue for retrial for rare disease when they miss it because no one's perfect and lisa anything no because i unfortunately with olivia's um syndrome there hasn't been a drug per se to help with her syndrome um so i really don't have too much to say about that any other questions from our uh partners in the media i do have another but i can take turns um matt what do we do we have anyone else we have a few other folks here but i think bethany if you want to go ahead with your question sure thank you um so my other question has to do with the piece of this legislation that is in regards to the eu review that this would require so i was wondering it are is the u.s is the fda currently reviewing anything out of the eu when it comes to rare diseases or are they just not doing on a regular basis i i can speak to that okay all of that um so that that that piece um you know we see is really important because what we have found and this includes the drug that that we had potentially available to us as well as when we were talking to other rare disease groups is that there are drugs available that drug has now been approved in the eu so our um community who lives in europe has access to the drug that was not approved here in the united states um which is kind of tough because that means that there are people living with this disease who are getting relief and then there are people who are not and so what we'd like to do is to have that study and then to also be able to use the data being collected um to help you know like laurie said for that that retrial you know to say okay our sample sizes are small here in the u.s just by nature of rare disease we can't create more people with this disease so if we use the data of people using the drug in the in europe can we use that to then come back and say look like we've been using this drug for another two years and look at the look at the data um can can we reconsider and use that data here to get this drug approved thank you very much that was um those were my questions but i want to thank you guys for sharing your stories thank you thank you and bethany as you're going through this if you have additional questions about some of the some of the policy pieces feel free to follow up with us and we can make sure to connect you with uh with the resources will do thank you hey matt anyone else i'll repeat the question if anybody else has a has a question again feel free to type in the chat box or just unmute and ask away we'll give it just a minute to see if there are any lingering questions all right hearing none as i just said to bethany if you do have additional questions uh or would like to follow up for for any additional resources please don't hesitate to reach out to our team you can reach me at matt m-a-t-t dot s at mailmail.house.gov and uh or you can just hit reply to one of my rachel's emails uh to wrap things up i'll hand things back to you congressman okay uh well before i make any closing comments uh do any of our three guests have any closing thoughts that they have i if i can um i know i feel like i'm talking a lot um but as you can see i'm very passionate about this this means so much to me um and to juliana they see me working and it's i love being able to tell them what i'm doing um you know they want to know why i was dressed up today because for the last year they've they've seen me in sweatshirts and you know whatever so to be able to tell them what i was doing this morning is is so important to me um you know we would love to be able uh to let the committee know how important this is and and to see this get passed this year you know we've been working since 2018 and we would love to see this get passed and we would so appreciate um congressman if your willingness to talk to chairman pallone about why this is so important and and why this absolutely so we really appreciate your help my pleasure i've been so entrenched on the the biologic side of um biomedical research and knowing that we need to do three trials um you know to try to repurpose three already approved drugs knowing that this act could possibly be passed is just bringing sunshine i mean and hope and it's it's critically needed thank you well and anything uh lisa that you wanted to mention oh i'm just glad i was able to be invited on this committee to see and hear everyone's stories sure and now we're not alone look it's um it's it's understood obviously it's very apparent that you know the challenge is great it's awesome in your lives and uh the love that you have for uh your child for your children and the out right devotion and dedication to make a difference just feature passion that's so evident and my best response to that is to do everything i can to communicate with my colleagues with chairman pallone with the committee to make certain that people understand not only the the the value added here uh the hope that we can deliver but the sense of urgency that wraps um this whole issue um so i just thank you for being the inspiration here um you're you're the command of the of the situation and your need here is something we should all take into mind into heart and you know i think it's the spirit of community that should govern our democracy that when one amongst us hurts we should all feel that pain and i think that's when we're at our best so i thank you for inspiring us to be our best and we'll do all we can uh to provide hope and uh and let those little ones who are looking at you saying why did you get dressed up today no that is all about i'm sorry i didn't yeah that it's all about them and you know what that's a good thing so thank you one and all for joining us and uh and i wish us all luck as we go forward was a success um okay all you're asking for is commitment here and that is a fair thing yeah thank you okay thank you thank you all right thanks everybody thank you bye-bye

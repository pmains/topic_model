hi everyone i just wanted to say welcome to the 2021 congressional app challenge virtual reception here my name is reagan sharp and i'm a constituent services and field representative out of congressman westerman's hot springs office here in arkansas and you may recognize me or my colleague mr michael morrison for some emails or calls that we've made in regards to this so i just wanted to stop in and say hi and kick us off and i'm going to pass it over to congressman westerman now well thank you reagan and thank you for all the the hard work that you put into making the app challenge happen and also to to michael and all of my staff members who have worked so diligently so we could have an app challenge and i want to say good evening and welcome to everyone who's joining us for the app challenge virtual reception this year hopefully um next year maybe we'll be able to do this in person but uh it's it's better to do it virtually still now especially since i'm spending so much time in in dc it makes it a little bit easier from that standpoint um but this this is a an event that i look forward to each year because we get to showcase uh some of the many talented students around the fourth district of arkansas and it's a it's a nationwide challenge it happens in all congressional districts it gives students an opportunity to showcase their ingenuity and their problem-solving abilities and i'm always amazed by the many different uh apps that come out and just the creativity that our participants have in coming up with problems to solve and the approaches that they take to solving those problems and it makes me excited to see what the future holds for you because the world needs more creative people it needs more problem solvers and you're demonstrating that you have those skills and those abilities to do that just a little bit of data about the congressional app challenge in the five years that we've had the challenge the program has yielded over 1134 app challenges across 49 states thousands of functional apps have been developed by over 25 000 students and this year the congressional app challenge had over 7 500 students participate and created over 2075 fully functioning applications in the fourth district we had 50 students enter 20 apps from six different schools the winning team will be displayed on the cac website the house.net website and showcase at the united states capital for a year i would also like to give special thanks to this year's judges robert dodone of aerojet rocketdyne brian harrison of uam tricia barr of asu-3 rivers jim harper of henderson state university kell rudolph of arkansas tech university ozark thank you to the judges i know you had a difficult decision coming up with the winners and i apologize for the cost i think it's just the change in the weather i got covered tested over the weekend so i know i don't i don't have coveted and i've been vaccinated which i encourage everybody to do that as well and with that i would like to introduce our keynote speaker for tonight we have justin ralton with us justin is the site director for lockheed martin uh missiles and fire control at the camden operations where he's served for 18 years he is responsible for supporting all aspects of production and integration of launchers missiles and rockets that support the integrated air and missile defense and tactical missiles lines of business i guess you could say he's a real rocket scientist and uh does amazing work there for lockheed martin justin holds a ba in industrial engineering from louisiana tech university a master's degree in logistics from the university of texas in arlington and is a graduate of lockheed martin's operations leadership development program mr ralton the floor is yours thank you congressman westerman uh thank you for the introduction and thank you for inviting me this uh this evening to this event um and congratulations to each of you that are listening in and for entering this competition and demonstrating your skills through this challenge so as congressman westerman said i work for lockheed martin and we're considered the world's largest defense contractor so a few details about us if you're not that familiar with lockheed uh what we do we provide systems and solutions to our men and women in uniform uh that they need to defend our freedom each and every day so this is definitely a integral part of what they do day in and day out we have over 114 000 employees across the globe and over 54 countries and so of those 114 000 60 000 of those are engineers and 10 000 are software engineers um and so as congressman alluded to you can even become part of this great company right here in south central arkansas we are a final integration site for some of our major programs within the missiles and fire control business area so tonight i was asked if i could give some insight into how computer science and programming is applicable in our line of work so kind of start out and give you a real high level example of that and how it's critical to our success but then i'll also give you a specific example about a young man that joined us as a college intern and how his background connected in kind of a not so typical way so computer programming and coding is very essential uh in allowing our systems to work to be able to meet our customers needs it's kind of like that saying you know you can be the smartest person around uh but if you can't effectively communicate you know what those faults are or what your ideas are it's just kind of you know basically unfortunately wasted talent so that's kind of like our systems they need to be able to talk to each other and be able to communicate to each other we can build you know the coolest missiles out there in the world take back three for instance uh this is a system uh that's literally hitting a bullet with a bullet so it's a missile that'll go out there and take down an enemy threat in the air so if we don't have the coating that allows that radar to scan pick up that potential threat talk to the launcher that the missile needs to fire it's really just a shiny expensive missile that we have no use for so that's really the way that coding definitely plays a huge part in allowing our systems to talk to one another i know it's kind of a high level image but again that's kind of how our platforms talk to one another is just through that example there's a lot of initiatives out there that you may have heard of here locally within lockheed martin we refer to it as digital transformation and really what that boils down really means is we're looking for ways of how to innovate and improve uh our products our processes uh with respect to the digital world so a few of those examples we do a lot of simulation and modeling and what we're able to do with this technology is think about virtual reality if you've ever played one of those virtual reality games literally putting on a headset and so with virtual reality what we're able to do are things like design a brand new building or facility and lay out an entire assembly line within that building put on a headset virtually walk through the entire building before we even break ground on that construction site so it's a great way to implement new ideas put new solutions out there try them out in a virtual world before you actually have to go potentially spend money put things in the wrong place so it saves a lot of time and then saves a lot of cost on the back end of the project as well so that's an example of how we embrace simulation and modeling here another one is called model based engineering so what we do with that we actually take an entire design of a system or a product in a 3d environment model it build it in a 3d world and flow that out all the way down to the production line to where we're actually making the parts so this allows us to make changes along the way if something doesn't fit quite right when it gets to the production line it automatically goes back into the 3d model whereas in the old days you would have a 3d model in the software system turn that into a piece of paper a drawing if you've ever seen engineering drawing and then try to figure out how to put this together um so that's definitely a huge uh time saver from a design standpoint being able to use that for model based engineering and then the third thing i'll give you is it's called a digital twin and so what a digital twin allows you to do and the term kind of tells you what it is so instead of just having a physical product here in the real world you have a digital version of that as well and so what that allows you to do is do some serious modeling and predictions to something without truly having to manufacture it so if you want the system to go further perform differently see how it reacts to a different environment that digital twin gives you the capability to do that in a controlled environment in a virtual or digital world and understand how that's going to work once it gets out into a real production scenario and then along with that our new ceo of the company jim takelet his vision for us as a company is called 21st century warfare i'm not going to bore you with all those details specifically but if you need some new reading material you can go google this strategy on that and how we'll be working to actually network all of our platforms together uh not only lockheed martin platforms but other defense contractors platforms as well and how it really gives the customer the you know men and women in uniform a new capability able for all their systems to talk together so really some great strategy especially from a networking or programming capability if you're interested in that again please go take a look at that online there's a lot of information out there on it so again this gives us a great capability given his telecommunications background so again not necessarily your typical background for the ceo of a defense contractor so that kind of gives you some high level insight into how important computer programming is within our line of work so the story i kind of like to finish up with is to tell you about a specific example of how young college student alex king went from become being a gamer and becoming an industrial engineer with lockheed martin so alex grew up surrounded by video games he said he even started creating games at the age of 14 himself so very much an avid gamer he ended up attending the university of tulsa and majored in computer simulation and gaming at that same time here in camden we were branching out with our industrial engineering group to include simulation and modeling as part of that group team here in camden so what we did we created a 3d design intern position to begin that journey in this new field and alex ended up being selected for that opportunity so instantly with his skills and the requirements that we needed it was a perfect fit he was able to take his understanding and expertise of a virtual world to what we were needing in a manufacturing world so after a very successful internship and unfortunately for us alex accepted a position here in camden after graduating so throughout his internship and now his full-time position he supported numerous efforts from from simulating virtual reality walkthroughs like the buildings that i'd mentioned earlier to animating robots in a 3d environment so some really cool projects that he's been able to do all while continuing to do what he's been passionate about from a very young age so i hope that kind of gives you a real world example of how you can bridge you know what you would think is a not-so-typical background in the gaming world into a manufacturing environment and how it definitely you know crossed perfectly and definitely answered what we needed uh from a company standpoint so to kind of wrap things up as i was sitting down with alex and kind of talking through you know making notes for how i wanted to discuss the things i wanted to cover tonight he actually had some great advice for you as high school students and i just wanted to pass some of this along to you uh so some of the things that he picked up along the way is he said make sure you are getting involved whether that's trying out new hobbies continuing your hobbies you currently have joining clubs that are offered through school and then sometimes if your schedule allows or things it'll help you know possibly even a part-time job but just make sure you're out there and getting involved in in any aspect or any area that you can the other thing is focus on your interests you know think about what truly makes you happy then eventually could that lead to a career like it did for alex and then also i'm sure it's probably a ways away for some of you maybe but thinking about you know as you begin college build off your high school experiences embrace those opportunities to continue to create impactful relationships not only with your teachers professors but also with your other classmates and continue to do those personal projects and research and continue on those things that you enjoy so that way you stay relevant and up to date in whatever field it is that you're passionate about then again networking is key make sure you're expanding your network meeting new folks talking to them understanding you know their backgrounds their passions and then eventually you know one day you will be entering the workforce so thinking about that currently high-end technology is continuing to advance at a record pace and companies like lockheed martin and others understand that importance of adopting new technologies like the virtual reality and some of the things that we've already talked about so don't be afraid to branch out and look at those other industries that may fit you know with your talents not necessarily making the industry fit for you and most of all don't lose sight that each of you has incredible talents and there's a place for each one of you in the workforce so stay focused stay positive and follow your passions thank you very much well thank you justin appreciate those thoughtful words and pass along my thanks to alex for sharing those those insider points for our students tonight and uh you know you mentioned he said that for them to get involved and work on projects and the app challenge is a great example of that so hopefully uh our participants are well on their way to finding a career that they they want to do and be successful at i know my daughter just graduated from the university of arkansas with an industrial engineering degree and she's working for jb hunt company out of northwest arkansas she does a lot of programming and those those skills are very important and i just want to say a little bit more about lockheed martin and the you know what a fantastic uh company we have there and actually it's in east camden i guess in calhoun county and uh a bit of trivia i was told this is a couple years old data but the highest average income in the state of arkansas in the counties is in calhoun county that's a it's also the county with the smallest population but it's because of uh lockheed martin and other companies there in the uh industrial complex uh they're in east camden uh where they have great jobs uh that a lot of people don't don't realize those are there so uh thank you again justin thank you to lockheed for their uh willingness to let you participate tonight and we're going to get on to our awards now we're going to start and i'll give you a little bit of the format how we're going to do this i'm going to announce the winner of whichever award we're talking about and then uh michael's going to play a video that he's put together uh on each of the uh awards and we had some ties for some of these these places um and we're gonna start with fifth place where we had a tie but first we're going to look at funky friend finder by madison mitchell and j damn wilson of lake hamilton junior high school our app name is funky friend finder the best app to find friends my name is madison mitchell and jaden wilson what is funky friend finder and why should you use it you should use our app because some teens have a hard time making friends in junior high and high school therefore we have made it easier to help them make friends we have anonymous chatting different websites where you can make online friends and we have advice quotes if you need some advice for making friends our app is meant for teens or even adults we use code.org blog to code the program how did we come up with funky friend finder we were first given a list of prompts and ended up picking making friends after that we started to list some ideas that we had for the app and came up with 18. we obviously didn't use all of them but we still ended up with five great ideas after we had our ideas we started to plan it using a planning sheet as you can tell the app ended up changing a lot compared to the sheet when the plan was complete that's when we started to code we spent a long time coding the project and improving it but in the end i think it was worth it now let's get on with the app [Music] every app needs a home screen and ours just so happens to have one but with color and love the home screen has a few features you might enjoy it would start buttons that take you to different screens to its mood slider to see exactly how you feel using meet you we have provided a fun way to chat with others to make new friends you will be put into a chat box with a stranger and start chatting but be careful we cannot control what others may say to you so if you're not comfortable please move to the next screen also please do not share any personal information with anyone you don't know sometimes everyone can just use some advice so we've provided some helpful tips and advice for making or keeping your friends with two website links and a custom advice button you will definitely be sure to find friends that will stick by your side pen pals is a great and easy way to make friends with the website we've provided you can browse through tons of profiles from people all around the world you can also make your own profile to help others find you to help make an account we've made a checklist of different hobbies that you can put on your profile it can feel really good just to let something out to someone even if it's completely anonymous butter lets you get something off your chest without anyone knowing who you are however like meet you we cannot control what you may see someone say so if you're not comfortable then please use the box provided just like a website except nothing gets publicly shared want more try some of the websites that we have provided you with yubo is an app to meet friendly strangers who have similar interests as you spot a friend helps you find other teenage friends with over 2 million members bark happy is a fun website to make a profile for your dog and meet other people through dogs and finally hubble is a game for websites for teens to meet each other virtually through other people's rooms we programmed our app using javascript and code.org's app lab thank you for your time thank you madison and jay dan it's pretty impressive and and we'll emphasize they're from lake hamilton junior high school so they've got they're doing that in junior high that's that's quite impressive we also had time for fifth place uh an app called teen work by raquelia williams jessica mccoy keana brown and nathan gontrek of hot springs junior academy hello my name is nathan and this is jessica ricarla and kiana and we're with project teamwork we created teamwork because we noticed that in hot springs and in garland county in general it's really difficult for teenagers especially younger ones to find jobs so we decided we're going to try to make a difference the tools we use for teamwork as a whole is pineapple rjs adobe spark and xcode pineapple is the software you we use to make the app as a whole rdis is the software we use to make all the maps for our app which we did this by zooming with the universal affiliate center for advanced geospatial technology to do so adobe spark is the software we use to make the graphics of all of our app this is nathan with teamwork as we've established and this is our presentation of the app the first thing you're going to see when you pull up the app is a list between the ages of 13 and 18. um let's say you are a 16 year old you would click 16 and it'll pull up a list of all the places that will hire 16 and below you will scroll through the list let's say you want to work at starbucks you click there it will call the place for you and you can try to get yourself hired let's say that's not easy enough for you and you want to see like where all these places are you could click view map at the bottom of the screen and it will pull up a map of all the places that you're looking at let's say you own chick-fil-a and you can't see chick-fil-a on here and you're really mad so you will click import new job and it will send an email to our administrator saying hey i don't see my business on here i was wondering if we could work together and put my business on here we both went our plan is to keep teamwork not just this year but we want to really spread it out through years and years we have a lot of plans for the future of teamwork we want to extend it around the world and we want to make bigger graphs for the teamwork another one of our plans is we really want to make it like different languages because right now we're keeping it mainly in english but we want like spanish and japanese and french yes that was our presentation of the app teamwork thank you for listening well and thank you to uh springs junior academy another uh great app i know with the job market like it is i'm sure a lot of employers would like to have more opportunities to hire people so thank you for putting that app together we're going to move on to fourth place we also have a tie [Music] first app we're going to look at is called therapy by gabrielle avila madison johnson and seth felix of dardanelle high school hello everyone my name is madison johnson and i am here with gabriel avila and seth felix today we will be sharing our app therapy to create this app we used a series of block coding with javascript and app lab our app is targeted towards young adults and teenagers though it can be used by any age group the goal of our app is to help people track their emotions and mental health over the course of weeks months and possibly even years the most resourceful use of this app would be that it's given to students at a school and then within each month updates would be sent to authoritative figures to see how the mood was all across the school anonymously of course when you first open the app you will see a welcome screen that asks you how you are feeling it will then take you to an assessment screen giving you a list of options to choose from based on your day i'm going to say that i had a good day today afterwards it will take you to a screen with a text box asking you why your day was whichever mood you chose and i'm going to say i had a good day because i got a compliment you can then click the next button and the app will take you to a new screen where a calendar will pop up showing you all the days that you've documented by illustrating a smiley face for good days or a sad face for bad days um for the 30th you can click the journal entry and or well you can click the date and it will show you the journal entry and then on the 29th it you can click that and it'll show you why your day wasn't as good and then you can click the home icon and it will take you back to the starting screen up in the top left corner you can click this button and it will guide you to some hotlines if you feel that you are in need of resources and then you can click return and if you press view previous entries you can click whichever mood you would like to see so we're going to say good and it will take you to a chart showing you the mood over the course of the years and then you can return home thank you guys for listening thank you and congratulations again and we also have uh in the tie for fourth place from dardanelle high school an app called keeping up by marcela sierra nadia alonso and anna carranza have you ever missed out on an important sporting event or forgotten the test our app keeping up will help you to never have to deal with this type of dilemma again my name is marcela sierra i'm nadia alonso and the title of our app is keeping up our app is made for both parents and students who would like to receive daily updates about their school district and we took notice of how busy life can get especially for for full-time working parents who do not have the time to look at their school website for news we took into consideration working students and students who are new to high school when creating the idea for this app so they can keep up with their school we hope that our app can provide information that could be important for parents such as upcoming sports events tutoring and teacher contact information with this app we hope to encourage students to keep up with their tests go to tutoring sessions if they're struggling with the particular class and to support their school's sports teams so now we will present our app and we really only struggled with inserting a diagram for the school topics for a good amount of time however we decided to go to our teacher for help and fix the problem so on our app you insert an email address and a password then you will enter the zip code of your school and say whether you're a parent or student you'll then click what school your child attends and then you can choose whatever topic you would like to look at and for this presentation we will be choosing sports [Music] then you select a sport and on the sports page it'll show you matches and that there is practice every day after school you can also click the back button if you want to go back and pick a different sport and the other sport we will choose is golf and then it will it can give you golf updates like when there will be matches and then lastly there is a home button to go back to the home screen the coding we used was a combination of block and javascript and here is our coding well thank you and it looks like you will be making it easier for people to keep up and i tell you there's a strong showing from the dardanelle sand lizards as we move to third place it goes to munch up by elizabeth flores fuentes leslie mendes and dolce gomez also of dardanelle high school oh there's nothing to eat mom i'm hungry sorry sweetie i'm busy right now just order something off of the matchup app what's that it's the newest food delivery app it's fast easy and affordable okay i'll download it this is the munchab app created by elizabeth floors leslie mendez and dolce gomez this is a food delivery app that provides local counties with food at low prices it solves the problem of people not having the time to cook email and also not having the time to go out this app was made using block coding with app lab and javascript new users have the option to create an account by clicking on create account you can enter your information and choose a username and password then follow up with your preferred payment method let's say you want to use credit or debit fill in your information for your card and submit it make sure all your information is correct and confirm it now you are ready to put in your information and log in once you're logged in you can see all the restaurants and stores available near you you can narrow down the choices by clicking on the zip code drop down let's click on the rest of the zip code let's say you want to go to zax fees you can look at the coupons and sales that are available you can also check the ratings and reviews you can also go ahead and order your food the restaurants menu will show up you can click through and choose what you want when you click add to cart it will take you to your cart you can either add more food clear your car or go to checkout if you choose checkout you will see the full price of your order you can leave a tip for your munch up writer or leave them a request once you leave a tip it will update your total now you can confirm your payment your order confirmation screen will show up you can then locate your order it will send you to the map showing where your writer is now you can go home and wait for your meal to arrive here's your zaxby's delivery from the manchester up well thank you thank you so fast of course you're welcome that's making me hungry i need to need the munch up out we're going to move on now to second place and back again to dardanelle high school for an app called helping hands by landon weaver carson ford and seth harper hello oh hey what's up with you not much just get out of jail can't find a job have you seen the new app that's been going around calling up again no here you just put your information right here boom see just like that all right there's four applications ready right here all right my name is landon weaver and i'm here with my partners carson ford and seth harper and we would like to introduce you to our newest app helping hands the purpose of this app is to attempt to help ex-convicts reintegrate into society by finding them an easy way of getting a job we were originally inspired to create this hab due to the mounting concern of the prison population in the united states especially in arkansas which has the fastest rising state prison population in the nation our main reason for making this app is to try to help with this current problem and give aid to our fellow arkansans who have just gotten out of prison to make sure they don't recede back in jail by providing them with good work and money for their effort here you can see the home screen of our app you'll see here we have two options sign up and login we're going to press sign up here you're going to enter your email address and the password you want to use to your account what we are trying to accomplish is allowing prisoners to submit their application also add an additional information when they need to find a job here our app will try to find a job based on the database of careers available for their roles now we're going to enter some basic information such as age address email felony and other stuff needed this button you'll be able to upload your resume with a pdf document a major difficulty we had was adjusting and centering portions of the code and the buttons together so that it would look more professional while at the same time welcoming to our main target audience ex-convicts here you will enter a location and press go so for example conway arkansas here there are four jobs that have been shown after you entered your location specifically we're going to click the one at walmart and with that your application will be sent to the person in review to make sure that people can understand and people can see if you want to be hired so with that thank you and we hope you like our app and our code is right here thank you for another uh creative and and an app that i think was would be very important to helping people who are trying to you need a helping hand or trying to move back into society from the prison system also tied for second place uh is uh it's called hsd student hq by belfam in high tran of hot springs junior high academy hello my name is belle and my partner's name is hai today we want to present to you our new app which is called hssd student hq so we work on our app using an app called pineapple it's an app using the language swift and it allows us to create mobile applications directly from your phone or tablet without having to put in the codes our app has four main screens the first screen is home which has trojan happenings sports and 2021-2022 calendar so in georgian happenings this is all about the news and events that our district is sent to us in gmail to inform us what will happen in the week and our plan in the future is to pull the trojan happening by hashtag but right now we just embed their most recent ones in our app next we have the sports section and when you press on the arrow button it's going to lead to our main sports website through this website students can access to some subsections such as the sports the podcast the inside athletics and students can see the upcoming events and where they take place and what team compete each other back to our main home screen we have the 2021 and 2022 calendar which has all of the events besides sports in the school year one more thing on our home screen is the top right corner which is the arrow button which represents the map so in this hot spring school district map there are all the schools that are in the district so that students and parents can easily navigate where our schools are now onto the second screen is the schedule screen we have the bell schedule and the athletic calendar since our school district used the art and even schedule the spell schedule can let students see when the time of each period which block is in the day and also what periods we have on each day in the week below is an athletic calendar and in this calendar students can see what particular athletic events will happen on what day students can easily access to each date and click on it and students will see what events will happen the date today will also be highlighted for example today is friday so it's highlighted on the calendar so students will easily know what will happen today on the third page we have links that are school related and that we think will be helpful for students when clicking on a link for example schoology it will take you to this guilty page and for some pages you may have to log into your google account note is our fourth and final page in our app on this screen students can put their personalized information such as their school login accounts or the upcoming deadlines for any classes that i want to put and that concludes our presentation thank you and thank you and now we're going to move on to our first place and the winner of the app challenge and it goes to do-gooders by anna womack and mackenzie biswanger of harmony grove high school hi my name is mackenzie biswinger and my partner's name is anawamik we created an app called the do-gooders which basically organizes and offers opportunities for community service hours by keeping track in a calendar filling out goals journaling thoughts on activities and providing links to local community service organizations this app is intended for high school or college students who need to track their community service hours and we use html css and javascript as well as riplet to create this app so i've already created an account so we're just going to log into this account it doesn't have anything on it right now we haven't filled out any information so you're brought to the home page it just kind of displays it's like a dashboard pretty much you go to the calendar page that's where you log all your different activities you have in the upcoming month so you say you have halloween on the 31st hit submit it changes to purple right there and it displays halloween let's go to the goals page this is where you track your hours so you have 20 hours this year that you have to achieve and then 80 hours throughout your entire high school right now you don't have any hours worked but say you worked two hours yesterday you click done boom it shows it right there go to the journaling page that's where you talk about different feelings on activities you've worked on yeah and then you click save note it displays right there that clears and whenever you click on this it displays the note let's go to the opportunities page it displays different opportunities within your hometown and so you click on the link it displays uh their home page you go to the accounts page you can have a profile picture so you select that click the picture you want hit open boom it displays it right there it says hello jack because that's the name we put in um yeah and then you go back to the home page and this is what displays and then you can log out and it brings you back to the login page uh thank you and have a great day thank you mackenzie and anna for for a great app and congratulations on winning our our app contest i want to bring anna in and ask you anna can you just give us a little bit of insight on what inspires you to create this app hi so you want me to speak now hey how are you tonight i'm doing good how are you good congratulations thank you um okay so coming up with this app um i when i first saw this um prompt from my school counselor i was like okay what can i do um to you know help my school so i was having troubles when i started first started volunteering um trying to find an online way i could you know store and log these um community hours and i didn't find any online that like me met all the criteria that i wanted and that were for free so i was like okay let's make something that will meet all the criteria and do more and be for free so that's one of our um that's what um how we came up with this and one i just want to say one of our main problems with this was um with the storage because we used variables instead of session storage which would um which wouldn't like save the data once we moved to a different thing so we had to save it out of the web to actually be able to continue using it and saving it so yeah and future things that we would like to add would be um online opportunities because we just have the local opportunities and we would like to we would have liked to add online opportunities but we didn't have the time so online would be great and make app more user-friendly because um with um the signing up thing it would ask you what um state you're from and you would have to put ar instead of arkansas or any other place you would have to put ar for the things to show up so that's what we would like to add in the future thank you

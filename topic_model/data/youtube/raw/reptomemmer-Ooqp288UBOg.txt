uh one more item representative tom before we let you go i know that uh last week there was a bill uh that would introduce that would prevent uh individuals or organizations associated with the government of the people's republic of china from buying any public or private agricultural land in the united states as well as participating in any u.s department of agricultural programs with the exception of food safety inspections not an issue we've covered on the show but i know that it's one that you've been uh you've been looking at correct john it goes hand in hand with what you just brought up with the impending food shortages remember a country that can't feed itself is a country that is uh not going to survive very long and we got to look at china which has not been uh keeping anyone's best interest in mind but certainly not uh americans uh in the united states china has been steadily and i would say we should all be extremely concerned buying up american farmland uh over the last decade uh in fact china has increased their american agricultural land holdings tenfold over the last decade at the beginning of 2020 china actually held two billion dollars worth of american ag lands so yeah i have been very concerned about this as well i last week we sponsored the prohibition of agricultural land for the people's republic of china act which literally would prohibit china from buying american farmland because this has to stop john it's only going to add to the problems that we've already been talking about what kind of support does it have what are your expectations on the uh on the bill i i expect that as we continue to educate our fellow members because a lot of people aren't aware of this uh right action of the communist party of china buying up farmland in this country people in iowa for instance people at different states minnesota where it's happening they're very well aware right when one of our largest pork producers was purchased by the chinese it sent up red flags everywhere people that are on the ground understand it but policymakers need to be more aware and i believe that as more of my colleagues become aware of what's actually happening right under their own nose right here in the united states of america it's going to get support from both sides of the aisle

in terms of Iran what is the next turn of the screw there what's your view for troops who are on the ground here I mean is there a sense of predictability from this administration in terms of what the mission is yeah well with respect to Iran or with respect I mean well I mean we're clear it clearly has turned into a proxy war with Iran on the ground in Iraq the proxy war has been going on a very long time I've been part of it uh you know when we talk about all the Intel out there like I was the guy collecting that Intel I know exactly what we're talking about so that's been going on a very long time the you have to understand if you're going to have a strategy you have to do something first you have to establish red lines you have to establish that sense of deterrence that has happened right now what we're seeing is that it's worked pretty well we had it almost practically staged attacked by the Iranians right afterwards you know they let the Iraqis know about it if an hour beforehand and you have then you had a narrative oh my god now we've solidified the Iranian people behind the evil regime well that turned out to be pretty false so we've seen the protests going on right now we're seeing the regime weaker than ever and it's and it's always going to come from its own people the more that we can come together as a Congress and just put hash tag for Iran even no idea what kind of impact that has on the people there they're looking for that they're looking for that freedom loving America that that supports them morally and that's the strategy going forward the strategy has certainly not been going to war and can you hear that all the time right you're here these these rallies going on by members of Congress know a war with Iran and that's all fine but that's not the plan and it hasn't been the plan and it's disingenuous to claim that it has been in fact it seems that we're not we're less likely to go the war now because and so that we had should a severe escalation by Soleimani

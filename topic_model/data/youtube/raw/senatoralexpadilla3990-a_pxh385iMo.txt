thank you mr chairman um jackson good evening how you doing i'm good it's been a long day it has thank you for spending it with me i understand it's your birthday yes so uh i'll cut to the chase on my first question what um yeah and like i've been writing up a lot about you since the nomination i've studied your record we've had an opportunity to meet in my office spent some time there and i've been listening pretty closely to today's hearings my first question maybe the highest stakes what would you say to a member of this committee who is uh sitting here like you for about 12 hours now on his or her birthday i would say happy birthday great thank you we're off to a great start here uh you know i actually only asked that question half jokingly because um i was moved by your opening statement yesterday as well especially moved by my colleague reverend booker here a little while ago when he uplifted your commentary about the struggle you clearly feel and that i share about being a working parent and i couldn't help but think to myself um how i've had to to grow and andrew and i remind each other of this pretty regularly try to give good advice to our children we're trying to raise three gentlemen not trying to raise three boys we're trying to raise three gentlemen and uh it's not always perfect but we give them the advice of just you know try your best to be your best right we're not expecting perfection and sometimes parents need to remind themselves of that too can't expect perfection we got to try our best to be our best um it's also you know dawned on me that we've been here for more than 12 hours and there's a very fundamental question that has been asked you know you've given thoughtful answers throughout the day uh but fundamentally what this hearing is today is a job interview it's a very public and very thorough job interview as it should be if you're confirmed you could potentially serve on the supreme court for decades helping shape the direction of american law and american life in profound and lasting ways so it's appropriate that over the course of this interview you should be asked some in-depth questions about your background about your experiences and your approach to the law but before i get to some of those questions that i have the first question i have for you is so why would you want this job and now with the added uh flavor of why would you want this job you have a great one now while we're thinking on a daily basis how we try to find that right balance that is often elusive between work and family and other obligations thank you senator um i've spoken many times about the fact that i came to love the law starting as early as four years old watching my dad study um when he went back to law school when i was a child and i honestly never thought that there was anything else that one could really do because i was so um enamored of my father and so proud of his decision to follow his dream after i was born and so if you're a lawyer and if you believe in public service which was a core family value for my family then becoming a judge is certainly an option that that one pursues and then of course being on the supreme court is the capstone of a life in public service and i would just be so honored um to have the opportunity to use my time and talents in this way so uh thank you thank you for that uh and now to some of the more uh specific questions now as i mentioned i've been listening closely throughout the day uh your knowledge of the law uh your even temperament your charm and uh clearly your endurance is impressive they all shine through uh but i acknowledge that at times this hearing has been a little frustrating uh not because of your answers but i actually point to the process itself you know there's probably a whole lot of questions that everybody watching would really love to hear answers to but they're questions that you can't directly answer questions like a woman's right to choose questions like the second amendment questions like expanding the supreme court now to be clear this is not a criticism of you let me explain when when you're asked a question that comes close to asking your views on a pending case or on an issue that may come before you you've declined to answer as to not prejudge the issue and i'll remind the committee i believe that's been the approach taken by every supreme court nominee for the last three decades so for the benefit of the people watching at home can you explain why you and other judicial nominees have followed this approach why is it important yes thank you senator um the the approach is consistent with the requirement of judicial independence um with the duty to have and keep an open mind when you are considering cases judges unlike policy makers are not uh supposed to be forming opinions in as my mother would say in the ether right judges are supposed to be waiting until a dispute is presented that they can hear in the context of the case and then with an open mind receiving the arguments that are made in the context of that case applying the law and making a decision the concern is that if you are engaged in a public forum like this and you start talking about issues that are being litigated in the courts the concern is that it will erode public confidence in your ability to be open-minded hear and consider only the facts and circumstances in the cases that are presented people might think that you are ruling based on conversations that you had with senator kennedy or um discussions that that i have with you and so judges tend to um not speak publicly about issues that are being litigated and especially judges who are being considered for the supreme court because at the end of the day a lot of these issues will come before that forum and you want people to know that you have an open mind that you haven't prejudged any issue and that you are waiting and staying in your appropriate constitutional lane great uh confidence in the judiciary and the justice system clearly important i think i'll be coming back to that in a minute but maybe as a segway want to raise a similar concern about confidence in the electoral process and discuss for a minute democracy and voting rights now i approach this conversation not as a lawyer but as a former elections official for six years i served as california's chief elections officer and my objective during that time was to yes ensure that our elections were safe and secure but also to help facilitate the participation of as many eligible californians as possible as we are guided by was regarded to do by the national voter registration act and frankly i relished in that responsibility because i believe in the right of every eligible voter to be able to register to vote cast their ballot have their voice heard in our democracy so you can appreciate my outrage when i've watched the supreme court play a role in dismantling one of the crowning achievements of our democracy the federal voting rights act of 1965. over the course of five decades the federal voting rights act protected voters from unnecessary obstacles and barriers to the ballot in fact the voting rights act was authorized and reauthorized five times with overwhelming bipartisan support the voting rights act helped dramatically increase black voter participation in the south in the post jim crow era and in states like arizona texas california and others latino voters have benefited from the acts voter protections and across the country native voters asian american voters and members of language minority communities have all achieved greater access to the polls because of the acts prohibition of discrimination on the basis of race or language minority status but in 2013 the supreme court gutted the teeth of the voting rights act in shelby county versus holder the court struck down to pre-clearance provisions that had required states with a known history of voter disenfranchisement to prove that any changes to their voting laws wouldn't harm voters and last year the supreme court drastically restricted to reach of section 2 which prohibits discrimination in voting on the basis of race now i find it hard to see the outcome of any of this as anything but counter to the spirit of the movement that led to the voting rights act not on any specific case but i know earlier in this hearing you've acknowledged that the supreme court's precedence that the right to vote is fundamental and must be protected has been acknowledged so can you just share for a couple of minutes what you believe the role or responsibility of the supreme court might be in protecting this fundamental right to vote and by extension our democracy thank you senator the right to vote is protected by our constitution um the constitution makes clear that um no one is to be discriminated against in terms of their exercise of uh voting and the congress has used its constitutional authority to enact many statutes that are aimed at voting protection um there are also um there are also laws that um relate to ensuring that there is uh not only voting access but ensuring that that uh there isn't fraud in terms of of voting these concerns are embodied by various laws and provisions and there are disputes at times over the concerns and the balances that that are being made uh across the country relating to the exercise of voting and those disputes come to court and uh then eventually to the supreme court that interprets uh the laws that pertain to the to the fundamental right to vote which as you say the supreme court has um acknowledged is a fundamental right so thank you um on on a different topic not unique to california but uh proud that california is home to the largest native american population in the country more than one in ten native americans call california home and california is home to 109 federally recognized tribes who have a nation-to-nation relationship with the united states of america as a senator from california i believe that respect for tribal sovereignty is paramount that's why after your nomination uh as part of the homework that i was doing i carefully considered your record on tribal issues and for the most part it seems that you haven't had to deal with too many cases involving the rights of native peoples or tribes the cases you've had so far such as mechanic versus jewel ultimately dealt more with questions of administrative procedure rather than fundamental issues of native and tribal rights if you're confirmed though i have no doubt that you'll eventually have to weigh in on major questions related to tribal sovereignty treaty rights tribal resource preservation and the federal government's trust responsibility now there's already at least one major case related to indian law on the supreme court's docket for the next term and it deals with the constitutionality of the indian child welfare act of 1976. i'm not going to ask you to comment on that case specifically or any case that may come before you but as a general matter can you just share what your understanding is of the federal government's legal and moral trust responsibility and relationship with tribal governments uh yes senator um it is established in the law the supreme court has established that there is a special trust relationship between indian tribes in the federal government indian tribes are as a general matter considered to be sovereigns and the relationship is a sovereign to sovereign relationship but it's one in which uh the federal government um has some responsibilities related to um to the indian nation and it's very very um important um care and trust responsibility that the federal government has in terms of um making sure that the tribes are um recognized and and cared for in the context of our system all right look forward to our ongoing conversation on that area of the law as well i want to now revisit something that's been a theme throughout yesterday's opening statements and a lot of today's questions from members and that's the general appreciation for diversity right we're celebrating history and what the more than potential uh impact it would be for somebody like you to join the united states supreme court i know some of my colleagues have touched on this already so i'm going to take it to another level while judges are certainly the face of the judicial branch their work as you can appreciate is significantly supported by the work of law clerks now typically these clerks are well-credentialed talented young lawyers who spend a year or two working closely with a judge who hires them who helps them conduct research research the law and write legal opinions now clerkships at the district court the court of appeals and even especially the supreme court are often a launching pad for a successful legal career many former clerks are leaders in the profession they serve as law firm partners public interest lawyers public sector attorneys and yes federal judges in fact seven of the nine current supreme court justices were federal clerks once upon a time and six of the nine justices clerked at the sprint at the supreme court itself so it's no wonder that many law students and recent graduates compete pretty intensely for these coveted positions but like the judiciary itself the ranks of federal clerks are not particularly diverse according to a february 2021 bulletin by the national association of law placement only 21 percent of federal clerks from the class of 2019 were people of color and this at the supreme court the statistics are similar with the national law journal reporting in 2017 indicating that since 2005 only 15 of clerks were people of color and only one-third were women bays are unacceptably low figures for what has become a de facto pipeline for federal judges with such low clerkship selection rates minorities and women lawyers are denied an early credential that can be of significant help later in their legal career i believe creating more avenues for diverse candidates to participate in clerkships is critical to diversifying the legal profession in the long run judge jackson i'd like you to maybe share with the committee your clerkship experience and maybe how that affected the trajectory of your career and if you believe the judiciary would be better served by a more diverse pool of law clerks thank you senator um i think there's very little question that my law clerks changed the trajectory my law clerkships excuse me changed the trajectory of my career through that opportunity i was able to work for three extraordinary jurists i got to see what it was like to be a judge i got to understand how judges think as they evaluate cases which for a young lawyer is an extraordinary training opportunity and you're correct that it is um [Music] something that is career changing in a lot of ways [Music] i have tried in my time on the bench to do a significant amount of outreach to young people i go to law schools whenever i'm asked i speak and a lot of places you've heard some of my speeches get referenced because i'm often asked to go and i try to go every time i am asked because i know how important it is for people to see that people like me are in the judicial branch and for people to hear about clerkships one of the things that i often get when i go to law schools is a surprise from some groups and some people about um the chance to clerk they weren't even really aware that that was something that they can do or or should try to do so it's been a part of my practice to go to schools to reach out to young people to tell them about clerking to try to get them to apply to me if i can and to show them that this this is something that's possible if i could do it they can do it and and i think it's to the benefit of us all to have um as many different law students seeking clerkships as possible i think you can expect some more invitations from california law schools colleges and maybe even some high schools in the near future and i'm happy to go with you now another uh theme that's been uh pretty consistent throughout the day has uh touched on the right to counsel you've been asked questions about your work as a public defender some have criticized you for providing a defense to certain clients who could not afford an attorney i want to talk to you about this issue but i also don't want to assume that everybody watching at home is a criminal law scholar and so as a center from california which is home to hollywood and the entertainment industry i'll make the reference that whether it's a tv show or a movie most people have heard a law enforcement officer on a screen while making an arrest recite what we know as the miranda rights you have the right to remain silent anything you say can't and will be used against you in a court of law you have the right to on attorney if you cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for you now the miranda rights are not a hollywood invention these and other rights afforded to all individuals including those accused of a crime come from the fourth fifth and sixth amendments to the constitution they come from over half a century's worth of supreme court precedents so judge jackson while many americans know how critical these rights are to our systems of liberty and justice not everyone does so for those who may not fully understand can you reiterate why the constitution protects these fundamental rights uh yes senator the constitution protects these rights um because the constitution is designed to protect liberty that's one of the values that the framers were focused on when they set up our system of government the federal government is limited in its powers in part because the framers wanted to preserve liberty did not want the federal government to encroach on individual freedoms and there's no bigger sphere of encroachment than the federal government or the even state governments using their power to deprive people of liberty in the context of the criminal justice system so the cut the constitution says that when the government seeks to deprive someone of liberty because they accuse them of a crime they have to afford certain rights to the individual they have to make sure that the person is processed fairly criminal defense lawyers protect those constitutional rights by ensuring that the government is doing what the constitution says the government has to do when they seek to deprive someone of liberty it's the criminal defense lawyer who makes the objection to prosecutorial overreach in a case or who makes sure that all of the rights that the framers put into the constitution are being observed in actual practice by the government and it's also really important one of the things that you said the miranda rights say if you're if you can't afford a lawyer one will be appointed to you the person who appoints is the court the court is appointing lawyers for criminal defendants because the court the judges know that in order to be able to do our jobs in order to be able to make sure that criminal processes are fair we have to get arguments not only from the prosecution but also from competent counsel who is making arguments for the defense so it's the court that appoints lawyers for people who can't afford them to make sure that justice is being done in the cases that come to court and it's just as a follow-up as much as we hope the process is always fair doesn't mean that it's always understood now you shared earlier today and when you were in my office you shared your observation from your time as a public defender that many defendants going through the criminal justice process don't always understand what it is exactly that's happening to them can you explain what the impact of this is on our criminal justice system and how your experience through your experience it affirms the need for a constitutional right to counsel through the eyes of a defendant yes senator in my experience one of the things that is important for our entire system of government is that people are being held accountable if they commit crimes that's the point of the criminal justice system and what i noticed as a federal public defender is that the process of ensuring that there's accountability there's responsibility there's rehabilitation is impeded if the people who are in the system aren't actually understanding the process that one of the purposes of punishment one of the goals of our system is to ensure that consequences are handed down for criminal behavior and then as a result that people stop committing crimes and so the the obligation to make sure that people understand what's happening i've seen aids in that goal that the person who is receiving the punishment um is more likely to be able to reflect on their own contribution to be able to realize that they made a mistake that they committed a crime that these here are the consequences this is a horrible thing and i'm not going to do it again if they understand the process that this is justice in our system if they go through and they don't understand if people aren't explaining if they feel they haven't been heard in the process it's my experience that instead they feel bitter they feel victimized and are less likely to be rehabilitated in the long run and so as a as a judge i took that observation and tried to ensure that not only that criminal defendants understood what was happening but that they understood the harms that they had caused with an eye toward making sure that rehabilitation was happening in the long run as a result of my sentences thank you and i'd uh share that i think it's part of our the comprehensive work we need to do to buttress the confidence in the justice system as a result now our criminal justice system is imperfect and too often unfair but when we talk about the virtues and the promises of our criminal justice system we include the constitutional right to an attorney but just in closing mr chair uh we include the constitutional right to an attorney talk about miranda rights and the right to an impartial jury of one's peers we talk about the fourth fifth and sixth amendments and through the lands not of a particular case or defendant but the system as a whole the work of public defenders is not just the work of defending the accused it's the work of upholding the fundamental legal principles that make up our bill of rights so anybody who may criticize judge jackson for providing a constitutionally required defense to any individual accused of a crime i suggest that the criticism is not of judge jackson but of the constitution itself and just in closing not an additional question but judge jackson i've listened to you respond to questions now for the last 12 hours and i've watched some of my colleagues take some of your work and some of your views out of context to try unsuccessfully to paint you as someone that you are not i've been struck by your thoughtfulness your temperament and your integrity in responding to these questions and i really hope that america is watching today because if they are they've seen the perfect example of what the temperament of a judge should be thoughtful balanced and very very patient thank you mr

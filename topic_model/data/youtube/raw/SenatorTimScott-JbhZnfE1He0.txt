joining me now republican senator tim scott of south carolina senator at the reagan library last tuesday you brought up supply chain this crisis and yet the administration keeps doing things that makes it worse what are your thoughts on all of this you know it just tells me that they fundamentally misunderstand the american economy without any question we should focus on bringing home our resources onshoring not offshoring we should look for ways to develop millions of new jobs in the areas of energy and cyber and technology we should focus ourselves on states like south carolina where we have a high-tech manufacturing hub we're bringing and producing more things here at home and then selling them other places we brought otis elevators a few years ago home from mexico to florence south carolina so there's a way for us to create a robust free market system here at home senator do you think the minister you think the administration doesn't understand the economy or economics or there's a higher calling in in the sense that climate seems to over oversee everything that they do and even if it means higher gasoline prices higher home heating prices even if it means seeding all of the technology that we've created in this country as long as they can drive to that goal it seems to supersede everything for them well charles there's no doubt that the esg focus of the left is harmful to our environment to our long-term viability as a nation and our competitive edge in a global competition think about what you just said the truth is that we are simply seeing jobs exported for our from our country not not because the competition is better someplace else but because of the environmental concerns being raised and that means that the people who are most vulnerable in this nation people living paycheck to paycheck now have fewer options higher prices and a more bleak outlook the the consequences are dire for our folks and frankly we should do better if you really want to take care of the environment create the jobs here at home where we have an epa not in china where they have agreed to zero control of their emissions but here at home yeah by the way rare earth really ain't that rare we just won't drill for them here i wanted to discuss your bill the employee rights act of 2022 to protect independent contractors franchisees entrepreneurs really anyone seeking flexible work options because some are saying this is an anti-union bill well certainly it is a pro-worker bill not so much an anti-union bill the truth is that when you look at the left's approach to the future of our employment they want everyone as a part of a union this bill says right-to-work states like south carolina and 26 others they get to keep their laws it's creating higher wages more employment and a higher quality of life the left their approach is looking back to the past while ours is looking to the future what do you make on this union topic uh these wins against the most woke companies out there starbucks amazon some people are are complaining about the tactics that are being used well there's no doubt about i remember back in 2011 when i took on a fight with the nlrb to make sure that the boeing employees in south carolina had an opportunity to work at the type of environment they wanted they said let's stay right to work but if you have election after election after election you just wear down the employees that is not the way to engage in a free market system if you want to be a part of a union you should not be forced into it you should give be given the option and i love our right to work laws around the country they actually produce a healthier environment for our employees across the nation

yes ben sass is the guy who now has the freedom works endorsement because they were endorsing shane i have never seen freedomworks do this before they came out i've never seen any organization do this before they came out and said we were wrong we found some new information and they switched their alliance and their endorsement to ben sasse midland university president i'm thinking about not holding that against him ben sasse welcome to the program hey glenn thank you uh for having me on and for the charity about not holding my current job against me i did i said i'm thinking about it i do have some questions that was the seat that woodrow wilson has what makes me what what assure me that you're not going to turn into a i know better than everybody else um kind of woodrow wilson progressive um and a guy who doesn't have the experience with the free market system help me out uh amen it's the right kind of skeptical question our founders would relate to uh i'm a college president because uh i'm at 130 year old school that was going bankrupt and i do turn around stuff so my background is actually a private sector and uh being in my fifth year as college president my hometown is because this 130 year old really special school was closing and we had a crisis that was big enough that we could actually fix some things and now we put kids first and we've gone from the brink of bankruptcy to uh being the fastest growing college in the midwest right now so we and what why is that what did you do to turn it around what should be done with our university systems and our and our educational systems well first of all uh students who are our customers ought to be at the center of the institution and whether or not they're actually learning is what the school exists to do we don't exist as a jobs program for whoever's just those among us who've historically been employed there so when i when i got to midnight we had 45 majors and minors but 84 percent of our students majored in only about seven departments so we had 38 departments that were economically unviable we had some departments that had more professors than kids you don't need to be a math major to realize that doesn't work so we had to end tenure at our school which of course is a situation that exists all through the us government i mean yeah that kind of inefficiency is is probably costing us hundreds of billions of dollars a year that's absolutely right and as importantly as the economic waste is just the cultural rot uh that happens in an institution where you lose sight of who you exist to serve obviously there are important research functions uh at a number of large universities but my school is a teaching college uh we're called midland university because we have some master's level programs we have an mba and whatnot but we're a teaching institution and so if you're not teaching kids there's something wrong with the institution where do you stand on common core i'm totally opposed to common core i read my constitution and i don't see any responsibility for the federal government to be raising my kids what about the state wanting to do the same thing man you know the state just says we're just going to do this as a state yeah i mean i think it's even common core in general or just education common core in general in education yeah no i'm i'm i'm opposed to common core because uh it was defined as if it was going to be a voluntary state-based program nebraska is fortunate we're one of only nine states that haven't adopted the common core but ultimately it's going to become a weapon of political correctness for the federal government to force uh certain standards uh on local communities that are going to be about political correctness and the agenda the left okay your um your opponent leveled some pretty well first of all let me start with this are you have you been friends with um um uh what's his name uh grover norquist for a very long time and do you have an event with grover norquist tonight no i i don't have any event with grover norquist i don't i i i didn't get to hear your interview um but i heard there were a whole bunch of crazy charges leveled i just got a bunch of text messages as i was dialing into your we asked him about the about uh freedomwork switching their endorsement because he's aligned with mcconnell and karl rove and he actually said that you are the karl rove alignment yeah he said he has nothing to do with um karov has nothing to do with mitch mcconnell um and said that you are actually taking money from dci which is uh bloomberg's uh organization so you're getting money from the godless bloomberg you know i i don't know what all this uh what all this stuff's about that he says um but the reality is there's one candidate in this race that is okay no no i didn't let him get up no no i didn't let him get away with the but you know what this is all about nebraska bullcrap either so i i'm going to hold you to this are you taking money from bloomberg i i don't know mr bloomberg i don't i don't know his entity i've never met him you don't so you don't know what dci is uh there's a firm in nbc that i've know some people who work at um i don't get any official money from dci now do you get any con support from dci uh there's somebody who works at dci who's from my hometown who's a campaign contributor to me yeah i don't know i was trying to understand the accusation was it he's saying that the same organization represented bloomberg or what bloomberg owns this organization do you have any idea on this one i don't i don't know what to look at it seems like it's still like a real boogie man a person who works at dci has contributed to your campaign then is that what you're saying i think they have sent out emails okay okay so tell me about your relationship with karl rove he says karl rove is helping you yeah there's just no truth to it at all i mean i worked for president bush twice uh for two years each and carl obviously worked for the president at that time and so i know carl but he didn't have any connection in any way to my campaign and do you do you think that what karl rove is doing um currently is is good for the republic or bad for is he a good witch i think we probably use the word witch too much in american politics i i do think right now that there is an important battle going on for the soul of the republican party and one side of the republican party believes in a constitutional system of limits where life has lived in the private sector and another side of the republican party is pretty content like the democrats are which is cc get bigger and more and which is carl on you know i've as you know uh glenn my wife had a near-death experience when i worked for president bush we had a brain aneurysm and so there are a lot of people uh that i worked with in the bush administration and i just don't spend a lot of time uh talking about individuals many of whom have been kind to my family so i don't spend a lot of time on the interpersonal piece but at the grand philosophical level what this battle is about in the country right now is about whether or not we're going to pass along the system of american greatness to our kids a lot of the republicans are a part of the problem all right so tell me about this because you did have the brain azure i'm going to give you a pass on that one i think it's kind of weasely but only kind of weasely um i mean because you can comment on his organization and that's not a personal attack and you decided not to take me up on that yes go ahead yeah i mean you you know what i believe glenn which is that i want to grow the conservative movement i want more pro-lifers and more second amendment and more tea partiers and constitutional conservatives and more small business people i want to grow the movement i want i want to win the majority in the senate i want quantity but i also think that quality is at play in this moment we are not winning the next generation look i'm not washington here's what i mean here's what i'm trying to get to i'm not trying to get you to say something bad about a friend you know or not a friend but a guy who was friendly to you and helped you maybe he is a friend i don't know um but there are people that i know that i like but if i'm in the situation that you're in i need to be able to say look he's a friend he was nice to me but he is on the wrong track right now that's what i'm looking for if you can't make the decision on i mean i mean glenn i think you know uh there's a reason why i'm being targeted in this race by the by the republican establishment okay and it's and the wrong side is the side that has lobbyists call you up and say we're going to support the other candidate in the race uh because we think he would play ball and we don't think you would play ball well they got that right the one thing the lobbyist class is absolutely right about is that i would not play ball good for you i think that when six of the ten richest counties in america are suburbs of washington dc that problem is not just because the democrats are in charge but because the kinds of republicans we elect want washington d.c to be in charge okay i don't want that and the founders couldn't relate okay here's the biggest charge that he leveled against you that that actually has some sticking power should it be true he said when it came to obamacare you said that that was an important first step no for heaven's sakes it's total nonsense i said that health care in america is broken and what we need to do is have a national conversation about how we fix it and the problem is that we already had too much government not that we had too little i did not say that obamacare was an important first step i said having a national conversation about what needs to be fixed is and the way you fix it is in the private sector okay he's pretty good you know um ben i um uh as i said to him you're not on hostile territory here people are frustrated and people are just looking for people who are just plain spoken um and and uh it's sometimes hard to find your way through the weeds i will tell you that we've watched both of you guys um and uh we'll support either one of you guys whoever wins but i believe in divine providence and i believe that people can hear if they listen with more than their ears if they have eyes and they have ears and they listen through their heart they will know the the promptings of what is uh what is right how is your soul been you know i'm a committed christian and i believe i'm a sinner and uh jesus is my hope and redemption so i feel pretty good about my soul but not because of me but because i believe in what christ has done for me so it's good okay ben anybody else have anything before we leave well we should probably give out my website of course of course we have to do that wait now let's see now that sounded pushy hang on just a second edit that out of the show but we're live okay hang on just so i wish there was some with pat gosh ben if there is there any way that anybody who likes what you just heard could support you is there like a i don't know place on the information super highway or something well what up what a providential question that i uh been for nebraska.com v-e-n-f-o-r-nebraska.com folks can hear more and this afternoon we're actually going to be announcing so we'll uh we'll break a little bit of news with you here that governor sarah palin and senator mike lee are both coming to nebraska to uh to campaign with us and to tell the story of american greatness and what we need to do to pass it on to our kids so we're going to be rolling that out this afternoon as well i think that is well there's no reason to do that now but um because you just did it but that's that's fantastic and i will tell you this the one thing that was really quite confusing to me with freedomworks is uh uh is mike lee mike lee has a great gut on him and is really one of the most humble soft-spoken vicious defenders of the constitution and i know because i've talked to him before he's like you know hey what do you think about such and such and he'll be like i don't know i haven't spent 14 days with him yet talking to him about the founders and uh he is very thorough and getting his endorsement means the world um because i know i know mike lee and i know who he is and to have his endorsement speaks volumes ben thank you very much i appreciate it thanks glenn good to be with you today

hi this is congressman luke tomorrow with another edition of the blaine buzz thanks for joining us this week let me just mention to you a little bit this week about a situation that occurred recently there was a internet uh video that went viral with regards to a lady in china who was being forced to have an abortion and child was seven months along now this is in conjunction with the one child policy that china has and um while it's an abomination we are actually supporting this in 2008 there were 9 million forced abortions and there was a fund called the united nations population fund that we here in the united states are supporting since the president took office there's 145 million dollars with taxpayer funds allocated to this fund despite the brutal nature of these abortions and the forced nature of them with the ladies of china so i signed on to a letter that you know raises awareness of this situation i've signed on to a bill they would defund the money that would go to this group you know as you well know i'm very supportive of pro-life issues i've been again this term been endorsed by the right to life folks and to me it's a very big it's a very personal issue and what each of you is i'm trying to tell you what to do i'm saying is that this is an issue that when you force some people to have abortions against their will that is taking it another step beyond what we do in this country which is allow abortions but i think it's something that we need to stop don't need to support especially with our tax dollars and just want to make you aware of it i think if you you know video i won't look at the video it's out there on youtube but i think you need to be aware that those situations are there again it's an effort by us to make you aware of a lot of different issues that are on our plate things that we address every day issues that come before us and let you know what our stances are so with that look forward to talking to you next week take care

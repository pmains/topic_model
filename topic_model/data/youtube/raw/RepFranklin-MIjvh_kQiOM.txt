thank you mr speaker and thank you ranking member comer mr speaker i rise today in opposition to this legislation and the on block package particularly amendment 29 this amendment would continue democrat attempts to federalize elections my colleagues on the other side of the aisle like to call us republicans seditionists yet here they are again attempting to violate the constitution and our democratic republic by injecting the federal government into state elections i'd like to remind the democrats that article 1 section 4 of the constitution reads the times places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislatures thereof not by congress our country is struggling with out of control inflation supply chain shortages rampant crime and a crisis on our southern border yet democrats are focused on violating the constitution for their own political gain when h.r 1 was passed earlier this congress we had assumed the democrats were done trying to take election powers away from the states as it turns out they were just getting started mr speaker at what point are we going to start focusing on the real issues facing this country at what point are the democrats going to realize that america doesn't want out of control spending open borders and rampant crime the founding fathers were clear that states are the primary managers of elections we must address the real problems facing american people and stop stripping states of their constitutional authorities without a yield back

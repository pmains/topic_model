mr. president senator from Connecticut thank you very much mr. president I'm mr. president the house recently passed a piece of legislation called protecting Americans with pre-existing conditions Act the substance of this legislation would prevent a trump administration rule from going into effect that would allow for states to license the kind of insurance plans that Senator Baldwin was referring to these are plans that do not cover pre-existing conditions nor the essential health care benefits I'm going to offer right now a unanimous consent request to proceed to the immediate consideration of this bill I suspect it will be objected to and after an opportunity for Republicans to object I will speak to the merits of this legislation so let me start with a request to bring this legislation that will protect people pre-existing conditions and the essential health care benefits to the floor my motion is as such if as if in legislative session I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of calendar 90 HR 986 protecting Americans with pre-existing conditions Act of 2019 that the bill be considered read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate is there objection mr. president the senator from Tennessee mr. president reserving the right to eject section 1332 is the innovation waiver that it is part of the Affordable Care Act passed by the Democratic majority that act includes protection for pre-existing conditions using the flexibility granted under Section 1332 does not change anything about pre-existing conditions so it's misleading to the American people to suggest that it does this is another Democratic attempt to make it more expensive to cost more for what you pay for health care out of your own pocket by taking away flexibility from states to find a less expensive way for you to afford health care at the same time not changing the pre-existing condition protection that are provided by the Affordable Care Act this is the latest attempt to do it but the boldest attempt to raise the cost of your health care is Medicare for all which if you have insurance on the job is 181 Americans 181 million Americans do would take that insurance away from you I object objection is heard mr. president Thank You mr. president again I shared in senator Baldwin's disappointment that we can't move immediately to this legislation this isn't a political game these are individuals all across the country who are relying on us to make sure that they are not subject to the abuses of the market relying on us to make sure that we don't return to the days in which insurance companies could prevent you from getting health care simply because you are sick return to the days when you bought an insurance product and then it didn't turn out to ultimately be insurance let's be clear the waiver that the president has allowed States to take advantage of would absolutely would by definition of the rule allow for states to waive the pre-existing condition requirement the rule itself says that the innovation that happens at the state level does not have to comply with the essential health care benefits requirement it says in the rule that you do not have to comply with pre-existing conditions requirements that's the reason that they are so cheap so I'm at a loss as to why we have Republicans on the floor saying that pre-existing conditions will be protected under this rule that's not true the rule says that states do not have to comply with the pre-existing require it says that states do not have to cover essential health care benefits that's why that's why these junk plans are attractive because they aren't actually insurance and they are only insurance for people that are at the time very healthy we've got to get on the same page here we got to be reading from the same script the fact of the matter is the definition of the rule allows for protections for people with pre-existing conditions to be discriminated against I'm sorry that we weren't able to bring up this piece of legislation because health care insurance should be health care insurance and what we worry about is two things first that by allowing for the marketing of these junk plans you're gonna have all sorts of people who today aren't sick jumping into those plans coming off of the plans that protect people with pre-existing conditions the people that are gonna be left behind on those regulated plans are people who are sick people who have pre-existing conditions and so you're all of a sudden bifurcating the insurance market you're gonna have a market for people that are currently healthy and then you're gonna have a market for people who are sick or who have ever had a pre-existing condition and you don't have to be an actuary you don't have to have taken classes in health care insurance economics to know that when that happens rates skyrocket for people who have a pre-existing condition for the millions of people around this country who have had a serious diagnosis over at some point during their life and so as you sell these junk plans there is no way but for costs to go up and that's on top of the increases we saw last year last year insurance companies priced in the costs of Trump administration sabotage they priced into their premiums the attacks on our health care system from the Republican Congress and in many states we saw insurance plans pushing sixty percent forty percent in some cases eighty percent increases in premiums and now on top of that for sick people for people with pre-existing conditions the rates are going to be even bigger because of the flight of those without pre-existing conditions into marketplaces set up specifically for them the second thing we worry about is that these junk market themselves as insurance but they aren't here's a list of things that I would generally consider to be covered under my insurance plan if I bought an insurance plan if I hand it over a check to the insurance company I kind of think that if I go to the emergency room I'm not gonna have to pay for it out of my pocket I'm thinking to myself well you know what if I need prescription drugs they're gonna cover some of that well if I'm have a mental health diagnosis doesn't insurance cover my head as well as the rest of my body these are the things that I would assume that insurance covers but these junk plans don't cover these things junk plans do not cover trips to the emergency room junk plans often don't cover hospitalizations they don't cover prescription drugs almost none of them cover maternity care your checkups might not be covered under a junk plan preexisting conditions will cost you more contraception isn't gonna be in lots of these plans they don't require you to cover lab services or pediatrics mental health isn't gonna be in many of these junk plans rehab services if you get injured you're not gonna find those in some of these plans and if you have a chronic disease there's nothing in the law that requires treatment for those to be covered and so all of a sudden the things that you thought insurance cover don't cover it and you've been paying a premium for years and then when you finally need access to the system it's not there that's what these plans can do that's what the the law and the Trump administration rule allows states to license as insurance and that's why we're on the floor today to ask to plead for our colleagues to bring legislation before this body either senator Baldwin's legislation or representative Custer's legislation that has already passed the house that would stop these junk insurance plants from being sold all around this country which will trick many Americans into believing they have insurance when they don't and will dramatically raise the cost of care potentially in many states for people who have serious pre-existing conditions I'm not surprised at the objection to both of our unanimous consent requests nevertheless I am disap and we will continue to be down here on the floor for as much time as it takes to try to rally the whole of this body to protect people with pre-existing conditions to fight back against the sabotage of the Affordable Care Act and the health care system by this president hopefully one day we will be successful I yield the floor

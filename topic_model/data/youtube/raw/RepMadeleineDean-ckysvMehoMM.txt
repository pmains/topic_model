i'm always glad to see you my friend so let's get into this what do you make of what uh congressman clyburn is suggesting get the prospect of impeachment through the house wait a while let joe biden get things accomplished then bring it to the senate because as i understand it you and about 250 other lawmakers are calling on the president to be removed from office i mean is it even realistic to approach it realistically speaking with only 10 days left until the inauguration it's good to be with you alex uh as usual even under these extraordinary stressful circumstances and so first let me just reach out and offer my sympathies to the family of brian siknik who died in the line of duty 12 years a capitol police officer so my sympathies go to him and i also understand that an off-duty police officer has died his name is howard living good and so my sympathies are with his family in terms of the timing and what we will do uh i have called for the uh use of the invocation of the 25th amendment i wish the vice president would step up and do his duty uh and i think that could be the most honorable thing he could do and it would be an important part of his legacy to invoke the 25th amendment but that looks uh like that will not happen at this point i also believe the president should resign so those around him should pressure him let him know his time is up he has disgraced himself and this country he should resign but in terms of impeachment i'm with jim clyburn our whip we will in the house impeach this president again i am a co-sponsor of the uh the article of impeachment that will be introduced i believe tomorrow in it the article is about incitement of insurrection i can't imagine that you and i are talking about this but that's actually what has happened uh and i think it is a very fitting possibility that we would wait and not send the articles the speaker would not send the articles over to the senate until things have stabilized and the new president is inaugurated yeah congresswoman you mentioned your condolences to the family of officer brian siknik and i just want to tell everyone right now what we're seeing will keep this up is a procession they are reportedly removing his body from where it has lain in the wake of the atrocities committed on wednesday and it is going to be moved now to a funeral home and we were told by vaughn hilliard that there were off-duty police officers both from capitol hill police as well as d.c metro police that were all called to come and do what they're doing right now pay this very somber tribute to him uh they're really in the shadow of the capital a place where he gave his life work for the last dozen years or so and ultimately ended up giving his life uh during that horrible insurrection on wednesday uh if vaughn is able to join us and tell us a little bit more what we're seeing uh we're welcome to bring vaughn on to do that but uh in the meantime uh congresswoman as as we oh we do have vaughn okay vaughn a congressman if you just stand by just for a moment and join us as vaughn tell us what we're seeing here yeah alex you can hear the church bells ringing here this is a procession we're on independence avenue and constitution avenue i just want to remain silent for a moment alex capitol hill officer brian seknick passed away five days ago his remains are being transferred from the medical examiner's office to the funeral home we're told as you can see law enforcement were called here over the last hour the thousands of them as i look up and down the road as far as i can see during this procession here i want ronnie our photographer if it could to to take a step back and show the crowd that is gathered here this was not put out in any form of a press release or were publicly put out there but this is a sunday afternoon in washington dc and usually a week before inauguration day but january sunday would look a lot different than this one alex officer signing was the one officer who was beaten to death the investigation is still underway as you've noted but he was here defending the capitol grounds when the capitol police were clearly over manned on wednesday other officers sustained injuries officer sicknick joined the capitol police force in 2008 you can hear folks clapping now folks on bike folks running folks walking [Applause] um this was an officer that joined the force back in 2008 here defending the capitol for the last 12 years he was previously in the air national guard served multiple overseas deployments i think for washington dc you now see a law enforcement presence that you frankly didn't see just five days ago there are now more than 6 200 national guardsmen just 10 days out from inauguration day and you see capitol police here joined by metropolitan police appointment virginia maryland this has been a tough five days here in the washington the nation's capital alex and what you just watched was again officer brian sicknick 42 years old heading to the funeral home here five days after he lost his life here on the capitol grounds yeah very sobering very emotional okay vaughn thank you for that i appreciate it i'm glad we were able to show our viewers in real time exactly what was going on there as i bring back congresswoman madeline dean it is so hard to watch this and when you think about the violence on wednesday the desecration of our seat of government on wednesday the injuries on wednesday the deaths on wednesday there are those that worry about impeachment proceedings that there could be more outrage among these extremist groups of the president the supporters of the president are you worried about that i thank you and vaughn for bringing that dignified moment it's hard it's hard and it didn't have to be that way i am angry it did not have to be that way and so while i'm certainly worried about more violence i am not worried about more violence as a result of us doing our job and impeaching this president the violence was brought to us incited and the fuel lit by this president so i fear there will be more violence i do not think it's connected to our duty to do our job and forever impeach this president and hold him accountable at least in the history books and for all future would-be leaders though i worry about violence i certainly do and i call upon republican leadership and vice president pence to say we bear some responsibility for this and we call upon all of our supporters to stop you know you have personally good reason to be worried you were in the house chamber when the angry mob stormed the capitol we're going to bring an image that shows you that day in a gas mask i mean describe those moments what that was like for you it was very strange i was preparing for my own remarks on the pennsylvania challenge and i went up to the gallery to hear the arizona challenge tried to go back to my office in canon but was blocked because of a bomb threat in canon so i thought probably the safest place for me is to stay in that gallery as we were in the gallery and i was standing near dean phillips he and i kept saying shame just shame how could you make these false arguments how could you do that and with that we were all told in some ad hoc series of instructions number one please take your seats number two would you please prepare to either kneel on the ground or lie down on the on the ground with that i started to plan and i don't know whether it was a good plan but i went down to the front row of the gallery and used that front wall of that gallery uh as a shield and lucille roy allard and i were there and others and we used that as a shield and we hollered at others who we saw standing veronica escobar in a beautiful white jacket i said get down get down and so with that they said would you please get your gas masks out and we helped one another open the gas masks and then finally they said and you have to recognize we weren't watching tv we didn't know what the crowd looked like yeah we were inside and uh finally they said uh they have breached the rotunda they are in the rotunda put your gas masks on and await further instructions it was a terrifying moment yeah but again i didn't know how many i thought maybe a handful of people had gotten somehow in i didn't know it was hundreds i didn't know they would know their way to the speaker's office or whip clyburn's office on the third floor i didn't know people were going to die it was terrifying i i i can imagine and as you think about going back to work i mean how safe do you feel do you think enough preparations are being made are you pretty confident that this disaster that we saw befall the capital on wednesday will not be repeated i hope and pray and we're all on our caucus calls in every conversation we're having with leadership uh asking for assured security of the capital and the capitol grounds because remember who else was there dedicated staff were there of course these police officers the capitol police were there this didn't have to be that way this should have been a high security event with a safe perimeter i have a hard time getting into that capital if i don't show my pin or my credentials but of course they were overwhelmed so do i feel safe not yet do you i'm very worried for staff you know as if to just add fuel to this concerning fire we've heard about the capital physician alerting members and staff that all of whom sheltered together in that large conference room on wednesday you may have been exposed to someone with coronavirus have you been alerted were you in that conference room yes that was our we were moved first to rayburn building and it was not a secure location and then we were moved to the ways and means building uh hearing room uh and it was despicable uh most of the back left side of the room uh was filled with republicans huddled together many of whom were not wearing masks they were offered masks they were asked to wear masks it was despicable you can imagine i kept my distance i'm glad you did congresswoman madeline dean um i'm glad to speak with you that was a tough one though i'll see you again do take care thanks thanks alex yet another historic day for senator elect rafael warnock a live report on what just happened in atlanta coming your way next

mr. president what I really wanted to come to the floor and speak on today is the issue that has consumed more of my time and energy and my time in the Senate than any other and that is the state of our nation's finances as a member of the Budget Committee and the Finance Committee I wanted an opportunity to speak about the looming convergence of several important fiscal deadlines the government's ability to continue borrowing money so-called debt ceiling a little bit of an oxymoron some said that ceiling is simply going ahead and authorizing payment for bills that have already been incurred that more on that later obviously must be raised this fall and the budget year runs out on September 30th at the end of this month meanwhile the White House continues to talk about working on comprehensive tax reform this fall even though at least to date my colleagues on the other side of the aisle the Senate Republicans are making it pretty clear they're not going to actually do a major tax reform because they're going to have to rely on a more modest approach an approach that will only require 51 votes that ends up sounding me like what we may end up coming from the majority would be more of a tax cut and simply tax reform in mid-july president Trump told an interviewer quote after health care taxes are going to be easy well we'll see making the numbers work getting the incentives right making the appropriate trade-offs rather being as easy as the president says comprehensive tax reform last done in 1986 actually is more like solving a Rubik's Cube how this body chooses to act in the face of these deadlines the debt ceiling the end of the budget year and tax reform will tell us a lot about the fiscal priorities of the House and Senate leadership and the priorities of the current administration in responsibly addressing America's long-standing fiscal challenges so even though we're just back from let me share with you what I believe are some very hard truths first non-defense discretionary spending made up only 16% 16% of our 2016 budget by contrast mandatory programs Social Security Medicare in particular made up 39 percent in total 63 percent cuz there are other mandatory programs included and on a going-forward basis Social Security and Medicare will make up 51% of spending growth over the next ten years over half of all future spending growth an automatic pilot the truth is the first our truth is we cannot dramatically boost military spending cut taxes invest in infrastructure and leave our two largest spending programs Medicare and Social Security untouched in any type of fiscally responsible way that means we'll have to make dramatic cuts and the truth is wherever those dramatic cuts come from the non-defense discretionary sport spending that means programs for people who work for low wages or otherwise struggle by all of those programs will be on the chopping block for example in his fiscal 2018 broad budget resident proposed eliminating funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission in my mind this is the height of hypocrisy the president did extraordinarily well in parts of my state that are part of Appalachian he promised a renewal folks who used to work in the coal mines well his first budget instead of offering renewal and hope slashed one of the most successful long-term bipartisan supported programs the Appalachian Regional Commission that has invested millions in communities throughout Appalachia over the years as well the president's same fiscal 2018 budget completely eliminated a program that helps struggling families heat their homes during the cool coldest months of winning again all those cuts come out of the non-defense discretionary spending which in English really means education support programs roads R&D all those programs will be subject to cut within the current budget fiscals outlined here are some additional facts our national debt is approaching 20 trillion dollars and debt held by the public as a percentage of the GDP is the highest it's been since we emerged from World War two the federal government spends more money than it collects in revenue I work in the only place in America where occasionally people high-five each other because the deficit on an annual basis got down to four or five hundred billion dollars nor the place in the world will operate with those kind of economics by 2029 every dollar of tax revenue will go to programs in effect on automatic spending those mandatory programs I mentioned earlier like Social Security Medicare Medicaid all good programs but the truth is if we don't look at those programs as well for reform we don't understand that we need to also invest in roads and infrastructure and other support programs that means by 2029 every dollar we spend on those programs for road education research and also defense will be borrowed money the truth is we have a very inefficient and outdated tax structure let me be the first to acknowledge that and acknowledge that the goals of tax reform are efficient better efficiency more transparency those are goals I can endorse it hasn't been updated in more than three decades truth is I think on both sides of the aisle there's bipartisan agreement that we need tax reform I think we can all agree that we have a backwards tax system matter of fact in many ways we have the world's combination of worst we have anacs-- credibly complicated tax system with nominally on the business side the highest corporate tax rate in the world yet if you look at the revenues that we collect and I'm not talking about just business taxes but individual taxes as well if you look at the revenues we collect as a percentage of our overall economy where would you think America lands if you listen to many we think America must be the highest tax state in the whole world well if you look at the 34 industrial nations that make up the OECD the United States of America state local and federal taxes combined we are 31st out of 34 I hear many times colleagues on the other side of the aisle for example complimenting Germany and other countries with some of their systems around training or infrastructure investment I'm not suggesting we move to their tax systems but they raise percentage of their GDP 5 6 7 8 % more of their GDP in taxes than we do I'm not saying we should duplicate Europe but if we are going to compare apples to apples we actually have again the world's combination of wars the most complicated system yet we raise at the bottom of the barrel in terms of revenues and the fact is because and it may be clear there is blame on both sides of this this 23 dollars of debt did not emerge overnight this has been growing for 50 years so both political parties there are plenty of responsibilities and the challenge right now is not only our annual deficit which was the subject of a lot of discussion when the deficit was over a billion dollars but in sense even though the deficit is down what we have to grapple with now is that the accumulated debt so even though those of us who may not have been here for decades we have to bear the responsibility of those who went before us the accumulated debt in our country is 20 trillion dollars now we've not felt the full effects of that debt because since 2009 we've had the advantage of record low interest rates but actually seen from the Fed and as we've seen from many people on both sides now who are encouraging the Fed to go ahead and raise interest rates that luxury of not having to deal with the debt service of our accumulated debt those days will soon be behind us so what does that mean well it means that when not if but when interest rates go up financial terms what's called 100 basis points in English what's called 1% when interest rates go up 1% the federal government will be charged an additional 160 billion dollars a year in annual interest payments just on that accumulated debt a hundred and sixty billion dollars additional debt service for every one point rise in interest rates if you saw a spike in interest rates three or four or five percent which we saw an earlier times in our country I don't think that will happen would it basically bankrupt the federal government the truth is even that relatively minor 1% increase in interest rates and that additional one hundred and sixty billion dollars in debt service and that payment comes before we pay Social Security before we pay our military before we pay for roads that comes right off the top five hundred sixty billion dollars is more than we currently spend on the Department of Education and Homeland Security combined and that's not an obligation that we can avoid playing and as I mentioned here's the truth fiscal discipline should not depend on who sits in the White House fiscal discipline should not depend on who controls Congress the truth is many of us were involved in the so-called Gang of Six that advocated the simpson-bowles plan a number of years back not perfect but would have gotten us out of this challenge the truth is every day every month every year that we wait to address the structural imbalance the problem only gets worse and the tools that we have tools that we have in plain old balance-sheet terms I was a business guy longer dive minute in politics you got to either raise revenue or cut spending means that the cuts that will have to take place well the reforms that will require to be take placed on our entitlement programs or the amount of revenues will have to be raised only makes it more difficult and as I've said neither party comes with this issue of the deficit and the debt with clean hands and frankly memories in this town conveniently be short so in the coming weeks as we head toward the possible convergence of the debt ceiling government funding tax reform government shutdown here's what I had urged my colleagues to pay close attention to first the White House and my Senate colleagues should avoid using rosy scenarios just to make their proposals look fiscally responsible when there aren't over the next decade the Congressional Budget Office Congress's official scorekeeper and we acknowledge again no matter who's in charge everybody likes to blame the CBO but they are referees the CBO has said that they expect our GDP growth to average a little above 1.8 percent per year I hope we can do better but that's what the referee says the Trump administration budget is based on seven straight years of 3% growth now that's great aspiration but any responsible business would not base their assumptions of their budgets on a going-forward basis rejecting our official referee the CBO and in effect plucking a number out of the air why do they do it well those rosy and unrealistic economic assumptions allow the administration to claim a fictional three trillion dollars in additional tax revenue over the next 10 years that's the differential in one point two percent of additional growth in seven years straight the administration in their proposal then uses this fake revenue to cloak additional tax cuts in spending cuts under the banner of fiscal responsibility that's wrong that's irresponsible and no responsible organization or business would take those actions second the administration cannot shift costs to others and then claim it as savings look no further than what the Trump budget does with federal programs for the poor over the next decade it calls for slashing more than six hundred billion dollars from Medicaid that's just within a budget that doesn't include the additional cuts to Medicaid that were proposed in their ill-fated health care reform truth is Medicaid as a former governor aware I'm aware of this real-time Medicaid is a partnership between the federal government of states so a six billion dollar cut at the federal level has a direct impact on state medicaid responsibilities it simply squeezes the balloon forcing the states to either dramatically up their share the cost of Medicaid or dramatically cut back services third the administration claims their tax reform plan will pay for itself and stimulate so much economic growth that it won't add to the deficit this is maybe the most serious claim of all made by the administration there's a basic problem the truth is at least what the Trump proposal was put out so far really has very little to do with comprehensive tax reform instead it's a two-page wish list of tax cuts a wannabe of every interest group that would like to get their special deal in the tax code further advanced every time we promised tax cuts will pay for themselves it hasn't worked out let's remember that Ronald Reagan's 1981 tax cut provided short-term stimulus but then deficits ballooned and President Reagan had to raise taxes in 1982 and 1984 likewise president george w bush's tax cuts in 2001 in 2003 provided that quick sugar high but ultimately had little impact on growth and instead the Bruce the Bush tax cuts produced large deficits the trillions and trillions of dollars moving us from a budget surplus on an annual basis that he inherited to the point when President Obama came in that efforts were approaching a trillion dollars a year forth paying for tax cuts through deficit spending is a really really bad idea it will make reaching any responsible fiscal goal that much more difficult also studies show that tax cuts that add to deficits are worse for growth over the long term than those that are paid for and actually can reduce growth over time so any lawmaker who says they support not paying for tax cuts should also have to explain why they think adding to our national debt a national debt that already stands at a record high a national debt that's already a twenty trillion dollars a national debt that when interest rates will go up which they will will end up sucking out 160 billion dollars a year in additional payments on an annual basis just for 1% increase in interest rates why that kind of adding to that already over the top threat debt level is a good idea in fifth it will be foolish to try to balance the budget by shortchanging investments that actually strengthen our economy and our competitiveness over the long term the budget proposals that we've seen from the administration and the House Republican leadership takes a meat cleaver to a couple of the key areas that actually government should be investing more in research and development education workforce training and infrastructure as a former business guy is somebody who invested in more businesses created public companies was an it was a venture capitalist for more than almost two decades I looked at businesses and I based my willingness to invest whether they had a good plan in terms of investing in the workforce investing in their plant equipment and investing in staying ahead of the competition for a government that means Workforce investing in education investing in plant equipment that means infrastructure staying ahead of the competition that means investing in research and development well let's put it like this I would never have invested in a business that spends less than 10% of their revenues on those critical infrastructure to make responsible investments either the truth is the Trump proposals would take our investments current investments in education infrastructure and research and development way less than 10 percent of our total revenues finally mr. president we can achieve fiscally responsible and bipartisan tax reform I would actively look forward to working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle on these reforms there's no area I've spent more time on I think I bring some something there table as both a former governor and more importantly perhaps to somebody who's built businesses for more than two decades I would also strongly suggest that nothing could help our economy more than a bipartisan agreement on a responsible path to making sure that we don't simply salute when our deficits only four or five hundred billion dollars a year but then when we actually start to bring that deficit down those are challenges before us in many ways the outlines of those challenges we'll start to see this month I look forward to actually trying to move the ball forward on these very important issues with that mr. president I yield the floor

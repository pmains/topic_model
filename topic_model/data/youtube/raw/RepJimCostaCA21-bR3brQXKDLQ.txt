Mr Speaker I also rise to support the Elijah Cummings lower drug cost Act now Americans want Congress to tackle issues that they care most about and spiraling drug costs are one of the most important issues passing HR 3 lowering the drug costs act now will help lower prescription drug prices and hold drug companies accountable for the unfair price hikes that they are impacted with prescription drugs in the United States we all know are four times higher than what they charge for the same drugs in many other countries these soaring cost of insulin as one example is way in which we see gouging and quadrupling over the last decade diabetes is an epidemic in our country affecting over 30 million people in the United States and costing Americans more than a hundred billion dollars a year to manage in Fresno County one of the counties I represent in my district in the San Joaquin Valley it's estimated 68% of the adults between the ages of 55 and 69 have diabetes these Americans need insulin to manage their condition but these high prices are causing them impossible choices the question is are do they pay for medication or do they put food on their dinner table making sacrifices that are simply unacceptable Democrats are committed to putting health care of American people first and stopping this unfair practice so far this year we have sent multiple bills to the Senate to reduce health care costs and prescription drugs silence silence is the only answer we get from the Senate tomorrow we will pass another bill HR 3 the lower drug costs Act now and this aims to stop drug companies from gaming the system unfairly and raising prices on America families that's what we're trying to do this bill also builds on the Affordable Health Care Act by adding ten billion dollars a year for expanding community health centers which have been instrumental in my area throughout the country and increasing health care and access to health care in rural America and my district four hundred thousand people would benefit if we pass HR three and it is signed into law my constituents who rely on prescription drugs are depending on us to act to ensure that medications are affordable and I intend to do that by voting to support this legislation it will also require that Americans save over five hundred billion dollars over the lifetime so now is the time to act and it's the time for the Senate to do their job I yield the balance of my time

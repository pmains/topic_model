Thank You mr. chair and miss Gustavson congratulations on your nomination is important position in the last paragraph of your written testimony I was listening carefully you say the role of the General Counsel is to advise the client agency to manage its litigation program and to best use the tool of litigation to accomplish the mission of the EEOC I believe in that mission and if confirmed I would do my best to fulfill it how would you describe to me that mission of the EEOC that you believe in the mission of the EEOC is to maximize compliance with the laws that the EEOC has the jurisdiction to enforce title 7 the Equal Pay Act the Age Discrimination Employment Act the Americans with Disabilities Act jeanna all of those laws and if I were confirmed to this position it would be my goal to enforce all of those laws over all of the country and I would be looking at both the breadth of the statutes and the breadth of the country and trying to find good cases that could be brought in all of those different areas based on your lengthy experience as an employment lawyer do you ever see a circumstance under which an employment action taken against somebody because they were LGBT would be consistent with the mission of the EEOC as you understand it I'm not sure I understand your question is there ever would you repeat it for me if an employer takes an action against an employee because of their LGBT status do you see that as consistent with the mission that you have pledged to fulfill senator Kaine I would like to see workplaces where people are judged based on nothing but their ability to do their job their jobs I mean that's that's the way I think that it should work so and this is in the matter of a of your personal opinion having been a practitioner in the field so you would agree with me that someone should not be able to be discriminated against because of their LGBT status correct I don't know what case you have in mind I know there are minute I'm not I'm asking I'm not asking about case okay I'm asking about your commitment as you described it yes my workplace where people are judged based upon the work that they do and they cannot be discriminated against for purposes of this question because of their LGBT status my commitment is to enforce the law and as the Senate is aware the law is in flux in this area we have you know I feel like I'm putting in a stand yes or no question to a very complicated issue what do you think the law should be we have jurists all over the country well-intentioned very intelligent jurists we're coming on these issues and and wrestling with them and writing lengthy opinions and lengthy dissents do you have an opinion having practiced law in this area for your entire professional career whether someone should be able to be lawfully discriminated against or not because of their LGBT status I would like to see a workplace where nobody has judged based on any factor other than their ability to do the job do you have an opinion about whether someone can be discriminated against based on their LGBT status and that that would be consistent with or in violation of the title seven laws I would have to see the facts of the case and the law that we were trying to enforce and I would compare the facts and the evidence I guess let me let me give you a facts in here someone is terminated purely because the employer concludes that they're LGBT and does not want to have them at the workplace for that reason do you believe that is consistent with or inconsistent with the laws of this country and the mission that you pledged to fulfill in your written testimony well it looks to me like the way the law is right now it depends on what circuit you're in and it would be very nice if we had a simple decision either because the Congress had made it clear to us in the statute or because the Supreme Court made it clear to us in a decision I understand that there's a split in the circuits I understand that there's a split between current EEOC practice and a position being taken by the Department of Justice in an amicus brief that they filed in a case what is your personal opinion about whether someone being discriminated against is in accord with or violating the civil rights laws that you are pledging to fulfill I don't think my personal opinion is relevant because if I get confirmed to this I guess I think I get to decide whether it's relevant you're asking me to vote for your conference I understand I understand but I'm just saying I think that if I am confirmed it will not be true enforce my personal opinion on anything but rather to apply the law and enforce the law and this way will you agree with me that the law should not allow someone to be discriminated against based on their LGBT status in workplaces in this country I am not in favor of that kind of discrimination but I think Congress has the right to pass the laws that it believes that the people want passed we have government by the consent of the governed and I think that Congress has a right to figure out what it is that the governed want and to pass those laws and whatever they are if I am confirmed I will enforce them I I understand that but as somebody who's practiced in this area I suspect you have an opinion and well no further questions thank you

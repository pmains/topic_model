thank you so so very much I thank the gentlelady for yielding and just want to say that there is no one in this Congress who works harder who puts in more time and trying to find a way to come back and to eradicate poverty than barbara Lee it is my pleasure in my privilege to work with you every day I have learned such a so much from you and I just want you to continue to do the people's work and I appreciate it Mr Speaker I rise to address a topic that many of us know far too well and that is poverty I see its impact on the people of the 11th congressional district every day my district has some of the nation's most impoverished cities the overall poverty rate is twenty-eight percent one out of 435 congressional districts in the United States of them out of the 435 congressional districts in the United States my district is one of the top 20 poorest districts in America nearly 200,000 of my constituents live in poverty I see and talk to poor people every day mothers and fathers without jobs families with little to no access to healthy food or adequate housing and children yes mr. speaker children who are in overcrowded classrooms with outdated textbooks poverty is the source of our nation's most persistent sinama kish ooze it permeates our entire society and has victimized too many Americans for far too long we don't need another committee hearing on hunger or poverty to tell us what we already know we know that the problems we know what the problems are and how to address them my colleagues have I have been proactive in finding solutions to eradicate poverty in this the wealthiest country in the world I have introduced bills supporting initiatives to feed children and families fought to protect safety net programs and insisted Congress develop policies that create jobs that pay a living wage the majority in this house has not been a willing participant some members believe that if you don't work you're lazy others believe that poor people are looking for handouts let me be clear mr. speaker none of that is true the people I have spoken to are not looking for a handout they simply need a hand up a job to take care of their families and pay their bills the dignity of work is what we all want we must put aside politics and pass policies that give everyone a fair chance at the American dream when we do not work together our constituents suffering to quote FDR he said and I quote the test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little we must act now I thank you and I you but

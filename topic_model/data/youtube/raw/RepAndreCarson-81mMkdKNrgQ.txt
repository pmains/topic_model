Andre Carson my brother from another mother so good to see you sir chairman my man there's a Washington says in training day my man my man my man you already know good to see you there brother I'm trying my situation right here we are here we are there we go yes sir how they yeah Indianapolis you know we we have our mayor and governor and of course the delegation we're working with our public health officials our state legislators our city councilors so we're we were practicing social distancing we've had unfortunately a few deaths statewide and a few in my district and we've had many infected but especially in the urban centers and in the densely populated parts like Indianapolis and up north and Gary and Fort Wayne and Evansville but unlike Brooklyn which has a greater population I know you guys have been navigated a lot we appreciate your leadership there brother no I appreciate that brother you know the challenge that we have here in Brooklyn is that we've got 2.7 million people in the borough alone as the borough if we were a city we'd be the fourth largest city in the United States of America and as you know the density challenge is one that's significant very close proximity to each other is part of what makes Brooklyn special with a lot of kinetic energy but in the context of a pandemic it creates particular concern which is why you know we continue to urge everybody to to practice social distancing this virus can impact everybody I know initially there were some theories circulating on the net that African Americans were immune somehow it's probably at 19 sure and that was a responsible rhetoric that was propagated and lives have been lost as a result and so we have to sure as you've been doing and you've been leading the charge my brother and making sure everybody understands this is a virus that impacts everybody original gauntlets of race or region or religion I agree that's such a phenomenal point you know I saw some of those reports and as much as you and I both appreciate coming from the african-american tradition in our wonderful melanin unfortunately we too are afflicted with this and as you know chairman there are a lot of underlying health issues that we have and systemic issues that make us much more vulnerable you talk about institutional racism you talk about the lack of having access to care you talk about folks with hypertension folks with high cholesterol for folks with asthma folks with diabetes all struggling with their existing conditions while trying to fight colvett is a tough challenge you know I unfortunately lost a cousin last week to koban he was 64 years old two days later chair his mom passed away so this thing hits home and I pray that under your leadership and the leadership of the Democratic Party and the rest of us who are fighting on the ground we can get the message out as we work on this cares to package which we've been talking about how heavy it is in terms of infrastructure but but what are your thoughts chair in terms of other things that people may want to know that you're working on boss yeah well I think it's important coming out of chairs one which was 2.2 trillion dollar relief bill that you worked on we worked on together we were able to pass with tremendous leadership from Speaker Pelosi and the house Democratic caucus working with our friends in the Senate as well as the administration and folks on the other side of the aisle that those direct payments are beginning to hit this week and that's important and those who already have direct deposit information on file should have already received or will be receiving that $1,200 direct payment assistance if you are an individual who makes up to $75,000 and of course if you are a married couple you receive $2,400 in your direct deposit account as long as you make up two but not more than one hundred and fifty thousand dollars for those who have not traditionally received a refund from the IRS or traditionally filed taxes of via mail as you have been doing one it's important to communicate that you can speed up the receipt of your direct assistance if you go to irs.gov and then look for the portal that applies to non filers provide your direct deposit information and you will accelerate the receipt of your check and that's very important I think for for all of our folks to understand and to take advantage of that opportunity which we all put to make happen no that's so that's so great chairman what are your folks saying who happen to be small business owners who may not have 500 employees who may only have two or three employees or who may be self-employed who may be an aesthetician or who may be some of our friends in the entertainment industry what are your thoughts in terms of the questions that they asked as it relates to government yeah this is the big piece and so we authorized 349 billion dollars in the context of the paycheck protection program to make sure that small businesses individuals or companies that have 500 or less employees can receive assistance to make it through this storm now that that that spans a wide range you've got mom-and-pop shops at the lower end of that range you just articulated that Andre and then you've got companies with hundreds of employees medium-sized companies that traditionally have the pre-existing relationship with financial institutions and one of the things that we found is that many of our women-owned businesses are minority-owned businesses or mom-and-pop shops are smaller veterans own businesses are having a more difficult time accessing the relief from the paycheck protection program and that's why though Mitch McConnell went to the Florida Senate last week and indicated that he wanted to pass an additional 250 billion for the Small Business Administration through unanimous consent we objected because our view was yes that additional funding is needed but they gotta be guardrails sure you have to make sure that funds are set aside for the businesses the mom-and-pop shops the women-owned businesses minority-owned businesses that are on our commercial corridors I mean you go to you go to any any any traditionally african-american neighborhood in the country you gonna find an MLK Boulevard absolutely oh the business is on MLK Boulevard come on so we want to ensure that their guardrails that are in place in that regard and that's one of the things that we're fighting for in the context of the legislation we've said of the 250 you need to set aside 125 billion for Community Development financial institutions little company can get the money one question for you you serve on the Intel committee and I think for a significant period of time people have been concerned that a global pandemic could it could present real challenges to the health and well-being of the American people and to national security can you speak a little bit about what we need to do moving forward to be better prepared for the consequences of this type of pandemic that's a phenomenal question you know one of the things that we're wrestling with in the intelligence space is how can we hold public forum that enforce private forms and work with public health officials in preemptively sifting through these these these viruses or pandemics in a way that protects our national security but also informs our hospitals and forms our health care leaders in a way that doesn't alarm the system but in a way that at least gives us some comfort because on one end you always have threats from other countries and as our technological environment is changing very rapidly our defense environments changing very rapidly we know that we're no longer fighting in the same way with thousands of soldiers we're fighting through drone usage we're fighting through biological warfare and so this raises additional questions about how how do we vote how do we vote on these important legislative matters and we look at one line of voting as a as a way to resolve these issues and I'll leave it up to bright attorneys like yourself to sit like what keeps me up at night brother Hakim is the the encryption issue so we want to have a system that is encrypted and protected but we don't want to have a system that is so impenetrable that were unable to catch child molesters sex traffickers people who are working through black-market networks as well and it's there there are some constitutional concerns as you know and that we have to sift through but there has been a coalescing of the minds particularly I see heads and those of us in the legislative intelligence space about how we can meld together and get past jurisdictional issues and bring together Public Health officials along with intelligence experts and sifting through these matters to prevent future pandemics to be as grave as this one has been I mean this is why you such a bad brother you can spit hip-hop lyrics and talking about national security back to back so we appreciate your range brother I've always appreciated your range now thank you you raised the issue of the voting and we got the congressional voting piece not and then we've got the democracy in the context of the upcoming general election in November and so like most they say on the purple tape and when was talking about blue and cream let me feel and what are your thoughts for the 90 you know so what's interesting and I want to hear your perspective on this what's interesting is that my friends our friends on the other side of aisle are objecting to the notion of a universal access to mail encoding I don't really understand because if we need to social be distance in order to flatten a curve being packed up into crowded polling sites is the exact opposite of protected Public Health do you have an extra for why our friends on the other side of the aisle seem to object to the notion of universal mailing voting in the primary election my suspicions are chairman is that this is a another form of voter suppression and fear I would like to see it I think that it would be a safe a safe methodology I think it would be a safe way but you know there are others who are sowing seeds of doubt and raising the point well younger people have not and are not a reliable voting bloc and so they have served that younger people particularly younger people who tend to affiliate with the Democratic Party won't be as enthusiastic or disciplined enough about actually sitting down in mailee men you know their their ballot or their vote I might to get your thoughts about it but it but but i but I also think my instincts tell me that this is done out of fear and a way to control the electorate they they're overestimating their they're overestimating their ability to galvanize their building block and defeat Democrats come November but that's my sense you know I mean I think instincts are right on it's troubling in fact I know a few weeks ago President Trump himself said on Trump TV when I one of these typical interviews your end up that you know we can't have mobile mail-in voting Republicans will never win an election that's an absurd proposition sure mail-in voting doesn't exist in jurisdictions where Republicans have won this is a partisan issue this is a public health issue context of making sure that Americans can both contact themselves and exercise the franchise and one of the things that we fought on a battlefield together around it restoring voting rights as a precious American right and for the life of me I've never been able to understand why the current Republican Party has abandoned its roots in such a phenomenal way voting in the past was never a partisan issue until the Republicans decided that we are going to make voter suppression an electoral strategy brilliant brilliant he's 65 he passed the Voting Rights Act it was phenomenal leadership from dr. King and of course signed into law by President Lyndon Baines Johnson but the Voting Rights Act has been reauthorized I think an additional four or five times thereafter and every time the Voting Rights Act was reauthorized it was signed into law by a Republican president feminie Richard Nixon of all people 1975 Gerald Ford 1982 Ronald Reagan 2006 George W Bush what's wrong y'all I mean the same the Democratic things right I mean look at your own tradition we asking y'all to act like Democrats act like Republicans in terms of voting so we don't have to continue to push on that piece you know we included 400 million for nationwide voting by mail in ks1 and with great leadership from Nancy Pelosi Black Caucus we're going to have to push to do more in cash - I agree I agree and we appreciate your leadership being at the forefront in the midst of conversations you know I thought I thought my daily commitment to calls was great but I hear you on most of those calls and you have your own calls as to why but I think you have doubled a burden my brother yeah well listen I appreciate are you making yourself available we got a couple of minutes left to chop it up no please found that you know increasing our outreach through different means has been incredibly important in terms of trying to to communicate with our constituents in this environment and you've always pioneered in terms of Facebook and Instagram and Twitter in terms of electronic communication and been ahead of the curve and certainly these are vehicles that now serve us even more making sure that we check in with each other hold up we share thoughts and ideas and perspectives I'm interested and and your views as we start the negotiations around kids 2.0 yeah what you think we need to do to continue to provide relief to the American people either on the public health side or on the economic side that's a great question I think on the public health side I think we have to look at having a series of capital infusions go to places like Brooklyn Indianapolis the West Coast the south and really focus on our community health centers in a broader way we attempted to do it with the cares Act I think we could expand it I know you've been a part of those negotiations I would really like to see us concentrate on senior care facilities we know that seniors are most vulnerable for contracting COBIT 19 on the other side I'd like to see our criminal justice efforts ramped up what that looks like in terms of the negotiations you're involved with with having monies going to not only the Bureau of Prisons but to state incarceration facilities to help our prison population even flatten the curve because they too face vulnerabilities being that these in these facilities are very transient and and and lastly those small business persons who are impacted who are self-employed those those folks or even employed folks will concern about extending the payment Protection Act from eight weeks to maybe 16 weeks I think those are the those negotiations that progressives have to have with New Democrats along with Republicans in terms of making sure we're being fiscally responsible but also making sure we are pinching pennies to the point that we're still hurting Americans in the long term yeah I mean that's absolutely correct this is an extraordinary moment so it's going required extraordinary intervention and a lot of the things that you laid out have to be front and center in terms of what we communicate and we also have to look at the reality that the numbers from an unemployment standpoint continue to get worse not better and the longer the social distancing takes place the the more we're going to need to look at strengthening and bolstering unemployment insurance system perhaps beyond what we've initially done now we added an additional $600 on top of what a state traditionally does to weekly unemployment insurance me encourage everybody who's a displaced worker to take advantage of the unemployment insurance system that has been strengthened by care as one but that was extended in terms of the additional six hundred plus dollars through July 31st it may be the case that we're going to have to go beyond that we also I know this is important to you in the city of Indianapolis have been saying that state and local budgets have been hit hard yes particularly in places like New York City New York State which is ground zero the epicenter of the corona virus pandemic at the moment cities like Indianapolis and Detroit Chicago other places are being hit hard it will be hit hard and these budgets are going to be hurt and when the budgets are hurt it's the african-american and Latino communities the low-income communities traditionally disenfranchised communities that get hit even harder I mean you know we talk about this a lot on the floor that dad if the african-american community or if America I should say it's a cold we've often said the african-american community gets a flu Oh suffering from a pandemic realtalk that means that they have the american community and others are being hit hard by a potential catastrophe absolutely we saw that that state and local government doesn't collapse in the midst of all of this and that's another important piece in terms of what we're trying to accomplish that day we've got a few questions though some folks have shouted out at us I got my man Wayne Williams I had with me we keep it aka Boy Wonder we're keeping the relative distance but let me see what was written out here a question from our v8 backseat and I said that's an interesting handle right there my man can we can we ask for absentee ballots in our states in other words I think he is emphasizing the point that we were talking about which is the American people should be in a position where everyone who wants to vote by absentee ballot in the context of the November election can vote by absentee ballot we're not at that place right now in part because traditionally elections in terms of how they're being run are being run at the state level even in the context of federal elections but the elections Clause of the Constitution provides for the federal government to actually make a decision as to how federal elections are going to be run and what we've been saying is that for purposes of the House and the Senate and the presidency and this is a critical election we got to make sure that everyone who wants to vote by absentee ballot and can't vote by absentee ballot I agree what are your thoughts because we know we we chop it up regularly and folks don't know they were actually neighbors what what are your thoughts about this notion that younger people are an unreliable voting bloc and not only are they unreliable in general elections but forget about them utilizing absentee voting yeah no that's a very interesting question and traditionally based on the numbers young people do not vote in the volume that older Americans vote and and that's been a long-standing problem now you'll see some increases from time to time the first Obama election was an example of a significant increase in people voting and Barack Obama of course you were early supporter Obama in the Congress I wouldn't I was in a state legislature but also endorsed them in my first year in the state legislature when he was running in 2007-2008 and that was an inspirational campaign a lot of young people came out but traditionally you're right now this should make it easier to be able to vote but one of the things that we got to figure out is in some states the ballots are automatically sent to every single registered voter yeah but in other places like Ohio you have to make the request for an absentee ballot now that 10 or franchise seniors and people who don't have access to the technology necessary to make the request with the download a request form printed out then send you find a stamp and you know this thing can go sideways if we don't put the guardrails in that data that are needed you know as we and as we approach the 30 minute hour I'm going to be respectfully your time you working hard on behalf of people uh Indiana so I appreciate you checking in with me and I look forward to when we're back together durability but we we exchanged some lighter moments around our mutual love for music know that hip hop in particular as we were watching in the battle between the RZA and DJ Premier play on Saturday so I'm gonna get your perspective on that let me just say yes we're talking about covet 19 yeah but music has always played a traditional role in helping us to get through tough times that's true and at this particular moment this is a tough time for everybody and the inspirational quality of music has certainly come to the aid and comfort of folks and so we appreciate that we shed a moment as we were observing the RZA and DJ Premier going back and forth side I'm interested in your observations of how that old went down yeah man you know I'm like you I'm a big fan of primo and RZA and primo was was coming with the knives he believed he was coming with the biggie reservoir out with the wool catalog and I said oh man this is intense this is intense if so many inputs man you know I'm like ah as soon as you start sleeping on one the other hit you with the guillotine you know I mean so then he broke up with the purple tape RZA and then primocane with with the ten crack commandments it was a whole it was a whole nother level and you know interesting because their catalogue is so long that even somebody at classics didn't get dropped into the back before so for instance with primo he didn't he didn't drop any up razor blades with a Hoosier and my man Teddy rally babyface and Teddy rally you have the architect of New Jack Swing and you have the architect of some of the greatest songwriting this this country has ever produced that's going to be dope but people are talking about other battles man and but with the Debora supremo who I mean devil is a backpackers heaven right there bro yeah I was waiting for resident drop dates on the 500 oh I'll be so simple you know so long that was a great hip hop moment a great moment but for all of us you know as people are struggling to deal with this very serious issue so I appreciate you brother and appreciate the work that you're doing on behalf of the people that you represent in Indianapolis appreciate everybody on the check-in today on straight out of Congress IG live session tonight I think we're gonna try to keep going as long as we are operating remotely continuing the struggle for the people thank you for your leadership your future is bright dear brother and I'll be supporting you along the way appreciate your brother thank you thumb prints one

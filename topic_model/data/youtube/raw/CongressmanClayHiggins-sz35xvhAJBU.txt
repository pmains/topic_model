Congressman clay Higgins is beginning his fourth turn representing the third congressional district in Louisiana serving on a couple of key congressional committees Homeland Security uh the oversight and accountability committee and the congressman will start this morning on the on the homeland security side of things of the headline here in town hall the house of GOP is moving forward with another priority filing articles of impeachment against the homeland security secretary Alejandro mayorkas do you support that effort yes sir we've been discussing that for quite some time I've had personal interactions with the secretary and I've implored him to to resign rather than drag the nation through his impeachment I have articles of impeachment that that I've been working on for about a year and we'll introduce those after the Committees are are populated and we move into regular business but but yes sir we do support his impeachment in a nutshell what are the key reasons you're calling for the secretary's impeachment without going into the Articles themselves and which I'm sure you understand we're keeping that close for now but basically the federal government is responsible for securing The Sovereign International borders of the several States this is this is clearly a constitutional requirement the executive branch is empowered to perform that mission and maintain operational control of our Sovereign borders and secretary mayorkis is the executive that has been confirmed by the Senate he's the secretary of the executive department that's responsible for executing the policies of this Administration so he's he's responsible for either successfully executing a policy and agenda for the president that works and and fulfills his his constitutional obligation to secure our Sovereign Borders or it wants it's recognized that those policies are failing then it reflective of his oath he must make correction so any reasonable man would would look at our Southern border and understand that that secretary mayorkas is certainly should be aware that we have a dissolved sovereignty down there as he's responsible for that so he either has to fix it or or be impeached in the in the previous Congress 117th you were the ranking member on the border security subcommittee of Homeland Security um will hasn't been determined that you will chair that subcommittee under the 118th and if so what are your priorities there congressman yes sir my my Republican colleagues on the steering committee will make that final determination I do expect to be the chairman of the border security subcommittee and we most certainly have a very aggressive agenda laid out I'm again I'm not going to go into the details there until the Committees are populated and and we actually move forward but but the bottom line is that our nation suffers from extreme failures of this executive branch to execute a reasonable and effective policies across our Southern border that's the that's the arterial bleed sir you and I have discussed that before our nation faces many threats and that that fall under the jurisdictional authority of the homeland security committee and and yet the most uh the most significant threat we face is the the dissolved sovereignty at our Southern border that's the arterial bleed we must address first Congressman clay Higgins with us until 8 30 Eastern this morning we welcome your calls your questions at 202-7488 000 the line for democrats 202-748-8001 for republicans and for Independence and others 202-748-8002 President Biden is just back from the meeting in Mexico with the Mexican president also the the the Canadian Prime Minister as well ahead of that the president uh for the first time visited the border and also um announced some new some new measures that the administration was taking on border security what was your reaction to what the uh the president had to say both there in terms of El Paso when he visited and later comments on the border uh Congressman Higgins yes sir well you know we're glad that that President Biden has finally visited our Southern border is one would have thought it would have happened long ago certainly as president but you know any most Americans would have presumed that that as vice president and Senator and an elected official for over five decades one would think that he was he was well associated with uh with with the challenges at our border as the this entire generation has unfolded however Todd dismay we we discovered together as a people that our president had was didn't know anything about the Border they'd never been there so we're glad he went and I think that that his visit was was predictably staged and sort of scrubbed and cleansed but I don't know why anyone would be surprised about that this this president is certainly he operates within a a very controlled scripted realm his Handler's you know make sure that so this trip to the Border was was reflective of that ongoing that's his habit and his interaction with Mexico and Canada was was was more interesting because some some policy was announced that that allows us to dig a little bit deeper into what his vision might be for for our relationships with Mexico and Canada moving forward with particularly Mexico because they play a key role in working with America to help us re-secure our Sovereign border and I personally welcome President Biden's interaction and his and that of his senior staff as as we look for Immediate Solutions to the human and drug trafficking that's been pouring across our border since he's been inaugurated as our president Congressman we have calls waiting for you so we'll get to them here we'll go first to our Republican line Robert in Charlotte North Carolina go ahead morning Congressman um I want to change slightly change the subject on a topic that the Senate Homeland Security committee has extensively studied and that's this uh uh alleged influence peddling of Hunter Biden and connection with President Biden to China Ukraine and Russia New York Times today has a story a lengthy story it says Hunter Biden's Tangled tail comes front and center which I found highly ironic given the fact that before the last election Miranda divined the New York Post wrote extensively about 100 Biden's uh involvement and I actually wrote a book called the laptop from Hell which was censored by Major newspapers around the country and social media this this article uh what I'm really concerned about is has the Biden family are have they done business with China to the point where China has something over the bidens and based on the policies of the Biden Administration it seems like we're afraid to confront them on the issues that the last Administration was very aggressive in confronting them and I was going to get to try to get your your thoughts on the hunter Biden Joe Biden influence peddling issue all right Robert yes sir well I'm I'm one of the senior Republicans on the oversight committee and I I I'm very much involved in the investigations that are moving forward that the oversight committee will lead and some of the things that will reveal to America as we as we uh move deeper into our hearings over the course of the next months and two years some of those things will be shocking stunning to America and the the Biden crime family is is basically what people are going to have to get used to talking about a lot of this uh data is yet to be publicly revealed we as investigators in the oversight committee myself particularly I'm focused on the suspicious activity reports that that have been thus far concealed 150 suspicious activity reports were filed on the the Biden organization the Biden crime family I call it um over the course of a very short period of time and in your audience those those that know what a suspicious activity report is that they're quite rare and some folks can live their entire life moving a lot of money around through businesses and Investments and never have a suspicious activity report filed by a bank the Biden the small group of the bidens including Hunter and and Joe the big guy Biden at 150 SARS filed 148 of them have been concealed from us and we're going after those and we will get them it is no telling what they will reveal so as an investigator we look for very pure evidence evidence that that that any reasonable man will see that this is untainted unbiased evidence and there's a Pandora's box of of unknowns within those SARS we're going to find them so sir I hope you're satisfied with that with that that answer because it's reflective of our focus and our attitude and the professionalism with which we will pursue our investigations on the oversight committee or we'll go to Jay in Walnut Mississippi independent line I would like to like to say that something like every time we have a election the Democrats keep saying that they gonna cut uh Republicans going to cut out uh Social Security they're going to cut out Medicare and you know I'm a older person I'm uh a lean conservative I used to be a blue dog Democrat but there ain't no blue dogs in the Democratic party now so I wish you would just look these people in the face today and say that y'all not gonna cut out Medicare and Social Security thank you now I'm happy to speak to my beloved Elders across the country we will never allow your Social Security earnings to be cut or reduced reflective of what you've paid into the system and earned in fact I'm a very vocal supporter of the Social Security Fairness Act I I pushed very hard on that bill in this past Congress the closest we ever came to bringing it through the floor for a solid vote the bill had over 300 co-sponsors and yet we could not force it to the floor for a vote just so America's to clarify it requires 218 yes votes on the house floor to pass a piece of legislation so one would think that with over 300 co-sponsors the Social Security Fairness Act would have been brought to the floor what wouldn't pass what would that be what would that bill do what would that bill do Congressman that would reverse the existing laws that sees a large portion of alternate retirement income that many Americans in in many of the sovereign states have earned uh retirements from from State systems that were not Social Security so they earned both the understanding paid into the social security system at at some points in their life and earned that according to that formula but they also earned a retirement say as a police officer a fireman or a teacher right in many of the sovereign states and according to the current law one half of the of the other retirement say as a cop if you earn a thousand dollar retirement let's say the current law seizes half of that so my retirement will be injured would be reduced by 500 and therefore Americans that are planning their retirement sometimes a very very unfairly um subject to seizure or some of their own retirement so not only do I promise American Elders across the country that Republicans would never allow your income through Social Security to be reduced we we further promised that if conservative principles are are allowed to be pushed through Congress in the Senate signed into law by any President we will restabilize a social security system so that it's its stability is never threatened and will introduce and pass laws like the Social Security Fairness Act that would reverse existing legislation that currently penalizes many many americ millions of Americans so yes sir I promise you solid all right we'll go to Falls Church Virginia and hear from Matt on the Democrats line well it's definitely interesting to hear a solid member of The George Santos Republican party who works with lies and half truths to talk about his policy you know yes of course for the elders you're not going to cut their social security but for the rest of us under the age of 65 you're going to destroy social security for us because you have not had planned to keep it in structured place you you just I I don't want to talk about social security though I want to talk about Senate uh secretary mayorkas though the purpose of impeachment is to try officials who have committed High crimes and misdemeanors what you're talking about is you disagree with his policy that you think is a failure that is not a high crime or misdemeanor that is the policy Works differently than you would like you don't talk about why are these people coming to America currently you don't talk about the Republican and some democratic's policy towards Venezuela that destroyed their economy and now all their people are coming to our country you don't talk about the petty disputs we've supported in Nicaragua who have totally decimated their economy and uh um cause their people to feel like they have to flee the country in El Salvador we don't talk about how America is the Bitcoin capital and the president of El Salvador has gone big on bitcoin and semi-distrolling their economy there we all the things that we do in this country have effects outside of us and you just want to deal with the results of those things you don't want to deal with the sources of all these people fleeing to their countries here okay Matt well like Matt we'll let you go there and let the congressman respond I hope you feel better Matt I'm glad I could be here for you hope your rehab is going well um you might not want to talk about social security but you did good sir so let me tell you you're wrong we we most certainly have a plan it's very detailed plan to restabilize Social Security and we most certainly will not Crush as you call it I think that Social Security plan and income of of Americans under 65. but perhaps you're not interested in those facts they're hidden in public data do your research next you talk about in mayorkus impeachment and you make broad presumptions of what my articles that I have not introduced will contain let me say that the articles of impeachment that I introduce when I'm ready to introduce them will have very specific impeachable acts enumerated so keep watching good sir you're going to be okay we'll make everything better on to James Huntsville excuse me Carla in Wayne City Illinois Republican caller hey there good morning how are you how are you today um my thing is is I love you you and Mr Kennedy are my favorites as far as quotes um my question is is that we have I seen the Omar shift and it's well well being not allowed on committees which I love that idea but you also need to uh think I'm tired I I can't say I'm tired I'm just trying to figure out um the whole situation of Democrats thing about abortion their logic and why people are thinking the way they're thinking that maybe that somewhere along the line that our our society has lost their morality but I think that uh Nancy Pelosi's still in charge of the democratic party no matter what anybody says it's not contain Japanese okay Carla Congressman uh you the house passed a couple of abortion related measures yesterday what was your view on those bills I'd supported them wholeheartedly of course and I'm solid pro-life American and I make no apologies for that that our our nation has has suffered a generational spiritual injury over the last 50 years with millions and millions and millions of babies slaughtered in the womb and we will gradually recover from that as a people but we we must accept responsibility for what we've done to our most innocent our most vulnerable children of God in the womb slaughtered by the millions and numbers I have is 96 million so as we move deeper into the the era of recovery for our nation regarding life and the sanctity of life in the womb in America will will have the opportunity to embrace responsibility for what we've done each of us on our own Journey with and spiritually we we will we will deal with the lives that that we've lived including whether or not we have supported the murder of innocent and children in the womb and and it's a clean slate right now for us for the future as we move uh deeper into the into the protection of Life era of America both legislatively and and I say again on a deeper level spiritually the good lady mentioned that that her her concern regarding the Democrats their policies and who's in charge let me say that and I believe Madam speaker Pelosi has effectively passed a torch to leader Jeffries I think that that he most certainly reflects the ideological perspective of the majority of Democrats elected in the House of Representatives they're quite a socialist party now it's I have Democrats and liberals in my family of course I love them and respect them but I also recognize that that that were quite diverse in our our beliefs on what we think is right for the future of our country and what what our core principles support can be quite different so the Democrat Party and the Republican party as represented in the House of Representatives your house the house of We the People reflects the uh variance of ideological perspectives that you see Across America yet we're bonded as one because this is an anointed Nation America will will always find a way forward as long as our relationships and our interactions are built upon love and respect then then we'll find a way forward let's hear from James in Huntsville Alabama independent line Mr Higgins I hope you don't say that you haven't seen the video of Mr Ron green who was killed in 2019 in your state even before Mr George Floyd was killed in LS Payton it went all the way to the top office and one of the officers said it was awful but lawful and also doing the situation the man was handcuffed Shackled picked him up by Checkers drug him on the ground are you going to push that the nation get to see this video and witness what happened have you talked to Mr Kennedy about it it's in y'all statement y'all should bring this to the Forefront that's my question are you gonna push that the nation get to see this video thank you and thank you for the question sir if I may respond I've been watching that case from the beginning I'm a I'm a brother of The Thin Blue Line and I've been a cop for a long time I'm still a Louisiana state post-certified peace officer I maintain that certification I have since 2004. I was a street cop for a long time and it there's there's no room in the Brotherhood of The Thin Blue Line for violation of civil rights in fact our oath is to uphold and protect the the constitutional rights and freedoms of every American and and what happened in Louisiana in that case is something that I have indeed been watching very carefully uh support full and deep investigation the investigation itself has some very sensitive data I respect the decisions that are made regarding release of material as the prosecutions and investigations move forward into what happened at that time and I do I do think that that had I been the governor at the time I would have pushed for the a faster release of information and data and a deeper uh more public investigation however I was not the governor of our state and nor was Senator Kennedy nor was my friend the Attorney General Jeff Landry John Bel Edwards was our governor he's our Democrat Governor and that that incident that horrific incident happened at a time when when a reasonable man would look at the timeline and say perhaps it was political motivation from our governor as to why that that investigation was not deeply revealed just prior to his Israel election so yes sir I support full reveal in that investigation Congressman clay Higgins of Louisiana as we said is beginning his fourth term serving that state congressman thanks for being with us here this morning on Washington Journal yes sir thank you for having me God Bless America will be okay

Thank You mr. Speaker I rise today to urge a vote on HR 962 the born alive abortion survivors Protection Act this bill would require doctors to provide medical attention to children who survive an abortion attempt unfortunately HR 962 is needed more than ever with the passage of a radical law in New York State state that essentially legalizes infanticide that law allows abortions up to up to and even after birth and in safeguards that protect babies born alive after failed abortions similar bills are being debated right now and stays like Virginia where the governor spoke of making newborns comfortable while doctors and patients decided they to die we have to stand up against this radical legislation to protect the rights of all infants this is not a partisan issue it's simply what is right to do Congress must pass the Boerner live abortion survivors Protection Act and I urge this speaker of this house to schedule a vote as soon as possible

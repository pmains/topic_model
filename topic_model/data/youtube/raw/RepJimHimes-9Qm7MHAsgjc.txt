I am joy my congressman I'm he's a member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence and want to get right to it your take on what you've seen play out today I know you've had some briefings today on the Intelligence Committee what do you know at this point what do you make what's played out well it's obviously gratifying that the the two individuals who are front and center and the attack on the on the office are no longer with us and you know you got to give the French credit for tracking them down pretty quickly but it's still a very tense moment you know we've got a lot of questions that need to be answered you know first who else is involved and is there the possibility of follow-on attacks you know that's something you don't really know until you've had an opportunity to really look at the networks and of course not that that process needs to continue we have some indications you know we don't have a lot of clarity but we've got indications that these guys were pretty well trained you know looks like they were trained by Islamic extremists we're going to need to pull that apart who else was associated with that process because of course those are people that we're going to want to find and prevent from doing anything anything else what distinguishes this if they did go to Yemen to Syria and receive that training and then came back to France what is the red flag that raises for you in terms of a u.s. lawmaker and the security threat here in the United States well you know obviously the the main concern it raises is primarily for those people who have folks that have gone over to Syria to fight and have those either EU or US passports and we know that there are those people and so this is kind of what we worried about in terms of people going over to fight in Syria getting some skills and this looks like it could be one of those situations again we don't know but this looks like it could be one of those situations you know we've known for a long time that something along these lines could happen you know the Syrian conflict it's not like Afghanistan it's happening on Europe's doorstep and of course it's not that hard to get from Europe the United States so this is all worthy of a lot of coordination and thought on the part of our security services have you all been briefed so far on the notion whether or not these guys did this on their own or whether or not they were ordered by a larger organization al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula some other group to carry out what's taking place over the last few days you know at this point we're piecing it together this is very much a live case and I think that we don't know anything definitively at this point but that's obviously a you know of real interest because it has been some time of course since I you know these networks what we know to be AQAP or or Al Qaeda and Yemen it's been some time since they've been actually able to successfully pull something off outside of their area so this is this is going to be a real subject of inquiry in the coming days and there's been a real debate here in this country about the capabilities of the US intelligence community and and some proposals to to rein in for example the ability to monitor both phone collection that sort of thing how do you think France is going to impact the debate that takes place here as to what the CIA the intelligence community the NSA can do going forward versus what they've been able to do up to this point well I think there's no question you know when we're reminded by how awful terrorism can be and how close close to home it can be that changes the weather a little bit around and frankly I hope it doesn't change it too much you know the idea that we always an constantly have to be sacrificing our civil liberties in favor of security that's what that gets way overblown of course we've gone through that and the very wrenching discussion about the Senate terror sorry the Senate torture report you know these these don't always have to be either or arguments but no question that not just the you know issue of you know what can our security services do and not do is going to be front and center this is going to put the discussion I think in the coming weeks about whether the Department of Homeland Security should be fully funded how it should be funded whether it should get caught up in an ideological battle that's going to change the weather around that discussion as well about you guys could have as soon as next week as what we're hearing from the Republicans yeah again and I think I'm more than a week ago the idea that the Department of Homeland Security should be used as a political football looks a lot different today than it did a week ago all right jim himes congressman of democrat from connecticut also member they tell this committee mark will send it back to you

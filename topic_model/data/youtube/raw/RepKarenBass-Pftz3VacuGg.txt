well thank you thank you very much uh let me just welcome everyone to the telephone town hall this evening i want to thank you for joining us i know that you watch the news and you know what happened but you know me i always want to bring you up-to-date information and tell you what happens behind the scenes so we spent all day on friday and into oh after midnight working to pass this legislation so we voted on one bill which is the infrastructure bill that we're going to talk about now and the other vote we took was a procedural vote so we didn't actually vote on the human side of the infrastructure we voted on the roads and bridges and highways and we'll talk about that in a minute that's what we actually voted on the procedural piece for the human infrastructure where you look at housing and child care and family leave and all of those other programs that we desperately need the procedural vote basically said we approved congress to take an official vote on the package this is something that we do routinely for every bill it's called a rule you have to vote on the rule before you actually vote on the bill we voted on the rule that said by november 15th we will have a second bill and that will be the buildback better build the human infrastructure part of the uh legislation which i'll talk about in more detail in a minute that vote will take place november 15th but what we passed was absolutely historic and if you just think about the last five years do you remember when trump was president every week he had infrastructure week and he said that he was going to pass this historic infrastructure package but it never happened it never happened beyond a press conference we never even had a discussion about actually passing legislation but this is what happens when you change administrations and when you have a president biden and vice president harris we actually got it done and i will tell you that as long as i've been in congress and i'm in my 11th year now we have been talking about passing a bill for infrastructure well we have two very special guests with us tonight and before i introduce them they are leaders in the los angeles area and they are going to tell us specifically how this bill is going to impact los angeles and improve all of our quality of life but let me just tell you a little bit about the bill that will be coming up on november 15th this bill is critically important to the los angeles area so i mentioned that one of the things that the bill provides is child care the bill provides money for family leave the bill provides a lot of different resources in terms of human resources human infrastructure to make sure that life is better i'll go into more detail a little bit later about what else is there but one key feature of the bill is housing and i want everybody to know that we are very fortunate in the la area to have maxine waters who chairs the financial services committee the financial services committee and i want you to know that i saw the congresswoman in action chairing the financial services committee also gives her the authority over housing i saw her in action fight for housing to not be cut out of the bill you remember originally they had talked about a 3.5 trillion dollar bill and it got cut down to right now 1.75 housing could easily have been eliminated from that bill but if it wasn't for the leadership of maxine waters and many other members of congress that money could have been cut out we will get a hundred and fifty billion dollars in affordable housing investments this is going to be critical for us as we deal with the homelessness issue because 7.2 billion is provided for individuals and families who are at risk of homelessness and it also provides money thousands and thousands of uh vouchers for uh home for people who need uh homes and also a billion dollars for rental assistance now one of the problems that we've had in our area of course is that there's people who are on the streets who are homeless but there's also thousands of people who are at risk of homelessness so this bill provides resources to address that and of course this is one of the key areas in our country it also provides home care for older americans and people with disabilities i mentioned child care it extends the child care tax credit and i hope that many people on this call are receiving checks every month the child tax credit and pay attention to your mail because we're going to be sending information out about the child tax credit very very soon that should be hitting your mailboxes because we want to make sure that everybody that is eligible is receiving their checks already and so when this bill is signed by president biden those checks were due to end at the end of the year but this bill when it is signed by the president will extend those checks for an entire other year and this can make a significant contribution to reducing child childhood poverty the bill also strengthens the affordable care act and it helps people with medicaid and medicare and so this is just a very very significant bill now of course after november 15 when it is passed i will do another telephone town hall to make sure that everything that i just said actually stayed in the bill i do believe it will but you know what happens in congress sometimes late at night things can change and so to make sure that that doesn't happen uh i will do another telephone town hall with you so right now i want to introduce two very very special guests stephanie wiggins is the chief executive officer of la metro a lifelong trailblazer and champion of equity and inclusion she is the first african-american woman to lead the agency she oversees the third busiest transit system in the u.s and serves as the lead transportation planning programming and financing agency for the 10 million residents of la county our second guest is david levitique he is the deputy executive director of stakeholder engagement for the port of los angeles which together with the port of long beach just think about this accounts for 40 of the container traffic into the united states that means everything that comes in the country from overseas 40 percent of it comes in our area so in march of last year he worked alongside the port executive director to assist in getting critical personal protective equipment into the hands of health care workers and he continues to build relationships with public and private sector partners to enhance port operations so i want you to join me in welcoming them and i want to ask our ceo stephanie wiggins to talk about what we passed in congress and how we are going to see the impact of it in the los angeles area i might add now the bill that we pass goes directly to president biden's desk it had already passed the senate so this is law the only reason the president hasn't signed this bill right now he will sign it next week is because a number of members of congress are in scotland for the climate conference and he wants to do a rose garden signing because again this is a historic piece of legislation so stephanie wiggins tell us how it's going to help us in los angeles thank you representative bass it is a genuine pleasure to join you tonight to talk about how this new bill will impact metro or actually as you said law practically and it truly is historic i also first want to thank you for your leadership on this bill because i think we all agree that it will modernize america's infrastructure and in particular our transit infrastructure let me be clear how significant your vote and leadership has been this bill is the largest federal investment in public transit ever ever it's a game changer and it will be a game changer for la uh before i uh share some brief specifics i would be remiss if i didn't acknowledge your decisive leadership in reforming la's local higher rules and how you worked with president obama and now with president biden to allow metro to hire people locally for local projects being built in their communities we thank you for your efforts on that congresswoman because this infrastructure remember uh in the title was jobs local hire is jobs we know that for every billion dollars that is invested in public transit approximately 50 000 jobs are created so this big news is bigger than big it is a game changer um your vote is a once in a generation vote on an infrastructure bill it the impact to la metro and the constituents in the 37th district is significant one it's doubling the size of our capital investment grant program to 4.6 billion dollars so what does that mean for la that means we'll be able to build more transit projects to serve the 10 million people in la county this funding will directly expand mobility choices not only for the constituents in the 37th congressional district but for residents across la county by expanding our already growing rail networks so why is that important a recent study found that in the la region a car allows for 17 times more access to destinations than transit so we've gotta build out a rail network this infrastructure bill will actually help us do that it will also increase funding for bus and bus facilities by tens of billions of dollars what does that mean for la well over 80 percent of our riders ride the bus the buses are the backbone of our congestion relief efforts so this infrastructure bill helps l.a purchase zero mission buses it will help us establish the electrical infrastructure to operate these new vehicles it also includes federal funding expand programs that ensure that the air we breathe is clean for our communities and this money will also be used by the ports and david could talk about that even more but helps secure zero emission trucks as well so we also see 18 billion dollars identified in this bill for state of good repair that really helps keep our existing bus and rail fleet working in great condition there are also new programs and there's really literally dozens congresswoman of new and better funded programs in this bill that will deliver much needed resources to la metro for years to come and last but not least i'm incredibly proud that with the full support of you and the administration if not all if not most of these programs are gonna focus on equity with the justice 40 initiative and so this is a welcome step and the first of its kind by the administration to ensure that at least 40 percent of all the federal funding benefits disadvantaged communities so as the u.s department of transportation starts working on deciding how to apportion out this funding you can be sure that la metro will be working with your office the white house and the department of transportation to make sure we are getting our fair share of the funding thank you and thank you so much i really appreciate that now we would love to hear from david levitique good evening thank you congresswoman for inviting me to participate in this town hall and i want to echo what stephanie said this bill it's a game changer for transit but it's also a game changer for ports ports for many many years if not decades has struggled to get dedicated funding to to support our infrastructure it's unique we talk a lot about multimodal infrastructure and what does that mean the port is a transit gateway for cargo so we accept ships and move cargo from ships onto trains and and from ships onto truck and then all that cargo travels through the region and so getting investment dollars to the specific types of infrastructure that support freight movement is critically important and if you need any more proof into how important that is just look at the at the nightly news and the the stories about major port gateways around the world being congested and experiencing unprecedented levels of disruption uh ports are busier than ever we have seen because of the coven 19 pandemic shutdowns and the increase in goods increase in goods consumption that was further supported by stimulus funding and people staying at home and ordering things online we've seen a extraordinary increase in volume since summer of 2020 we're moving close to a million cans of uh containers of goods a month we're averaging around 900 000 we actually had one month where we moved a million in one month and that represents a lot of efforts by terminal operators and the longshore workers to move cargo but we're still packed to the gills and one of the ways we need to get out of that is sema is getting dedicated infrastructure investment so the bipartisan the infrastructure bill has dedicated 17 billion dollars to ports that's water infrastructure and it's landside infrastructure so we see a terrific opportunity with over two billion dollars over five years being dedicated to the port infrastructure development program where we see that going here in in the la trade corridor is going to projects that are going to support and alleviate the congestion we see so we have in mind for example 80 80 acre site on the port property within terminal island that'll pack as a support facility to accept empties right now there are empty containers sitting on chassis those are the wheels that the containers sit on in local and surrounding communities throughout the entire region those need to go somewhere so this infrastructure funding can go to go to create facilities like an empty depot an 80 acre empty depot at the port that will take these containers out of the communities free up chassis so those truckers who are struggling to pull containers out of the terminals have access to the equipment and can bring more cargo out and relieve the congestion you'll see those those shifts in anchor begin to come down so we long term we think this infrastructure funding is a huge game changer because it's going to give us the ability to invest in facilities that will allow our our system to flex as we experience cargo surges like the historic cargo surge we're currently experiencing we also think this funny can go towards workforce training centers and making sure that we have an adequate number of warehouse workers or truckers uh that we are reskilling and upskilling and helping workers transition as we introduce zero emission equipment whether it's zero emission drainage trucks or zero emission cargo handling equipment so this we think that this bill is gonna help this uh funding is gonna help us uh with bricks and mortar investment help create a more efficient system and more importantly make sure that this system that moves so much freight is also driving creation of jobs in surrounding communities so we're really excited about it really excited you're giving us the opportunity to talk about how important it is for us thanks so much well and thank you so much you know one of the things that i believe all of us have seen which is when we go into stores you see empty shelves or you see products where you have to wait for i mean in in uh david isn't that how we are directly experiencing what is happening with all of those ships out there that's right that's right i think that the the cargo that is on these ships in the water or in the terminals these are the everyday products you see on store shelves but also 25 of the cargo coming through the ports of l.a and long beach are going into the manufacturing supply chain so this is also uh important uh important commodities that are inputs into things that american businesses are making for export we've seen exports suffer as a result 24 of the last 25 months we've seen a decrease in u.s exports and that means that's those are opportunities those are u.s jobs and economic opportunity that is being missed and one of the things that was really critical was that we get this bill passed and moved some of those ships uh because of christmas coming up and because of the real demand we're gonna have so hopefully some of those ships will be able to be unloaded and those goods distributed into our stores around the country and especially in our area so thank you so much i do want to um refer some questions to our two guests and one question that is asked i will actually answer unless our guests want to uh chime in about it uh lola from west la is saying she heard a lot about how the underground piping is old and will it be addressed in the infrastructure bill you know i didn't have on a guess specifically today to address that but you are right that was a major part of the legislation you know we all saw the problem in flint michigan a couple of years ago with the lead and the pipes but i'm sure you're aware that is a situation that is happening around the country because the country's infrastructure has been neglected uh for so long and so um how that directly impacts la though i'll put a pin in that and get back to you we will find out the answer but the basic question that money is included in the bill and so anything that's included in the bill there is a share of it that comes to los angeles um this is a question for you miss wiggins this is from scott from west la he wants to know how the infrastructure bill is specifically going to affect individuals in west los angeles well one of the opportunities we have with the infrastructure bill is to complete projects like the purple line subway it also will help create new jobs we have a need to fill jobs namely construction related jobs but also other types of jobs whether it's engineers planners we will be hiring up to support delivering the planning and delivering of these projects as well as the ability to build more projects that were identified in measure m so look for new opportunities and new transit projects and better bus service that will occur in west la as a result of this bill passing will the bill also allow us to convert you know and maybe this is not an issue for metro maybe it's the school district but convert some of our buses uh so that they are electric and um do not use diesel absolutely congresswoman school buses are explicitly identified in this bill so there is funding in this bill to convert school buses to zero emission buses um thank you very much lynn harvey from west la wants to know why we are taking a vacation instead of staying in dc to complete the voting on the bbb bill it seems the more it's delayed the less likely it is to impact the voters and more likely to lose the midterms i just have to tell you you know oftentimes it's reported in the news that we're on vacation i couldn't even tell you when the last time i took a vacation was when we are not in dc we're not on vacation dc is recessed which means we are not voting but staff who do the actual writing of the bills trust me are working around the clock on the bbb bill to have it ready for when we get back you often hear members of congress and other elected officials talk about bills they write we don't actually write the bills staff write the bills lawyers write the bills and so that is what is taking place now the reason we take a recess is so we can come home and meet with our constituents and on that note i want to mention to people i am very anxious to go back to having physical town halls town halls in person and i know that beginning today the requirements that if you're going to go in and have a gathering you have to show that you have been vaccinated and so i did have a poll question and wanted to ask constituents that are on the line would you be interested in me holding a in-person telephone town hall maybe when we talk about the next bill maybe we do it in person in addition to a telephone town hall so i would like to know if you are interested in a physical town hall press one for yes press two for no would you be willing to attend a town hall now of course bringing your vaccination card showing us that you have been double or triple vaxxed uh would you be interested in attending a town hall and if you would be i will be more than happy to do that i will tell you that a lot of the questions that are coming in the queue are really about the next bill and not so much about this bill so i am going to look for some questions that are about this bill and we will save your questions about the next bill to the extent that i might know the answers i will let you know but you should know that that bill is still being worked on and so i can give you general answers but we don't have all of the answers uh just yet i can tell you though the answers around housing is done and that section again was led by congresswoman maxine waters she fought to make sure that it was not eliminated when the bill was reduced from 3.5 to 1.75 so emily from culver city oh i just lost emily from culver city's question emily from culver city uh wants to know about why we why democrats are aren't blocking and calling out the republicans and standing up for themselves why don't the democrats fight i will tell you that this is a really tough question for me because i've been feeling this emily more and more myself especially in regard to the filibuster because it seems like if as you watch the news it seems like that there's two people in control of the senate right now on the democratic side and that's mansion and cinema and i think that one of the problems that we have here is that the senators are in office for six years and i happen to believe that um cinema and mansion just got reelected so i think they are betting that by the time they come up for re-election again that uh nobody will remember and everybody will be so concerned about them as maintaining democratic seats that that's all that they will care about so i happen to think that we do need to change the filibuster because i think the existential question of our time which is voting rights uh if we don't change the filibuster i don't believe that um the republicans are ever going to vote for democracy uh and let me say uh dan wants to know what is being done to strengthen our power grid there are constantly power outages in my area well i certainly hope that this bill will provide some relief there because strengthening the grid is absolutely a part of uh what was provided uh in this bill and so hopefully you will see some differences there al from culver city is talking about the minority business part dbe disadvantaged businesses utilization on construction projects and will that be encouraged it absolutely will be encouraged and it is a part of the legislation and i will say having a president who is committed to equity is going to make sure that that is a part of how the money is distributed but you know it's one thing to put it in the bill it's another thing to keep your eye out and to make sure that it's absolutely implemented and that is something that we have to make sure of um one person wants to know whether or not there's going to be help mrs jackson wants to know whether or not there's going to be help uh to uh in for historically black colleges there is protest going on in howard university with the students sleeping in tents not because they're homeless but because they're angry that their dorms are in such disrepair that they're sleeping outside when we do pass the next bill there will be money for historically black colleges and colleges uh in general one individual was asking about homeless veterans and whether or not there was resources for homeless veterans well again that is in the next bill but what i can tell you about is what we were able to do a number of us were able to do uh your members of congress from this area uh myself included we all were at the va several weeks ago with the va secretary and um we were there pushing the secretary to do something around all of the veterans that were sleeping outside on san vicini boulevard and so the secretary basically threw threw a hammer down and said he wanted this cleaned up and so i know you know that the sheriff came along and our sheriff we can have a whole telephone town hall conversation about him so we won't go into that right now i think his motivation was different but um i i did just arrive in los angeles literally just landed two hours ago but it's my understanding that the veterans have been moved into housing and are no longer on san diego so i hope that is accurate i will make sure that i drive by there though while i am home which is just uh for a few days but again one of the reasons why we recess is so we can come back in our district and we can have meetings exactly like that i'd like to ask our guests if there is anything else that they would like to add please tell us about what is going on in metro that maybe doesn't have to do with this legislation but how things are progressing on some of the major projects that impact the 37th congressional district this week well i would just like to share with the constituents about a new program that our board launched last month and that is our fairless program for k through 14. so it is a free metro fare on metro as well as participating transit for students we think it is a big step forward into providing fairless for all low income but we are delighted to have partnered with a number of school districts including lausd to provide this benefit to when all of the schools participate over a million students and then it also extends to all our community college colleges in la county so very excited to share that news for more information all you have to do is call your administrator at the school or at the school district to find out more information about our go pass program that's what we're calling the new fareless program for k-14 wonderful wonderful david levitique yeah just a quick update um as you know we've been working really closely with the biden administration to provide immediate relief on the supply chain issues that we're facing here in the san pedro bay ports uh beginning with uh secretary buda judge hosting a round table back in july we've been in constant contact with the administration and we stood up a program called accelerate cargo la where we're working with those name brand retailers congresswoman that that that uh we all rely on for our christmas goods so to make sure that they're getting their cargo out of the terminals and into uh onto store shelves um that is a program we stood up back in uh back in september and we're helping to fight truck power find the equipment necessary to get cargo out of the terminals and uh we're in constant contact with uh with the presidential port envoy john porkari making sure that these very uh operational issues basic blocking and tackling of getting cargo out of the terminals getting empty containers loaded onto ships back to asia we're making sure all that's happening and we're getting a good response from our from our supply chain partners um we initiated a fee to uh to encourage and uh to penalize uh cargo owners who keep cargo dwelling in the terminals for too long and we've seen a tremendous response when we announced the fee there were about 94 000 containers on our terminals today there's roughly 85 000. so we are seeing that number come down and we're hoping that's going to free up terminal space and you'll start seeing the number of ships reduce as well but we're still seeing a huge consumer import surge consumer driven import surge so we are predicting that you're still going to see elevated volumes through much of 2022. on a separate note last week the port of los angeles adopted a new program where we're going to collect funding and we're going to dedicate that funding to the deployment of zero emission freight trucks operating in and out of the port we're hoping to partner with the federal government and the state government to and uh and metro to transition all the freight trucks that call out of the port into zero emissions rage truck by 2035. thank you so much i really appreciate that and uh miss wiggins i actually have another question for you if you have any updates about metro links on crenshaw and hyde park sure well we're getting closer working with the contractor to reach substantial completion hope to reach substantial completion by early next year and in fact we're going to um accept the project in phases so we'll have a partial substantial completion before the end of this year and then full substantial completion after the new year so what is substantial completion that means that that's the point when the contractor is completed with all of their work what work do they have left to go because i recently went out there and toured the crenshaw line they're just doing a lot of testing there are 8 000 different types of tests that need to be completed and all need to pass in order to ensure all the fire life and safety elements are working properly before we take over the project from the contractor that's what substantial completion will allow and once we get substantial completion then we do our own a training of our operators that will last about four to six months and then we will open up crenshaw so we're getting closer it's taken longer that we've wanted but we want to make sure we deliver uh the type of quality infrastructure improvement project that the community deserves so we're getting there and thank you thank you thank you i want to thank our special guests for joining us here this evening stephanie wiggins the ceo of la metro and david le batik the deputy executive director for stakeholder engagement for the port of los angeles we really appreciate you joining us this evening and i hope that you won't mind when we call you back again because we love getting up-to-date information to all of the constituents so thank you so much for joining us very very very welcome i would now like to ask another poll question if you are joining us tonight from a cell phone and you would like to receive alerts from our office by text please press one and we will send you alerts the type of alerts we will send you will be about events coming up if we're having town halls or if there is breaking news that impacts the congressional district 37 so press one if you want to see receive text messages from us and press two if you do not and i will tell you that on our first question about having an in-person town hall that was overwhelming so we will figure out how to do it safely we will ask everyone to bring their vaccine cards and we will give you an update and i will say that we will have a town hall when we are assured that the second bill will make it to president biden's desk uh let me respond to a few questions in the queue and i mentioned that most of the questions in the queue are about the next bill and we will save all of those questions and we will get back to you because we do uh have your contact information but most of those questions are about a bill that is still in process and so we will answer to the best of our abilities but there was one question that said what about all of this infighting between the democrats and why can't we all get along and stand together like the republicans well i will admit it was a little frustrating this last week waiting to get the bill passed but i think a lot of fire has been uh pointed at the progressives but let me tell you that both sides the progressives and the moderates at different times held up the bill for different reasons the moderates at the beginning of the week decided that they did not want to vote for the human infrastructure bill until they knew exactly how much it was going to cost now that annoyed a number of us because they could have made that request a long time ago but they made it at the last minute literally the day before we were going to vote on the bill the progressives were holding out because honest and truly they have lost faith not in the president and not in the speaker but in the senate and in specifically mansion and cinema they lost faith that if we voted for the human infrastructure bill in the house and sent it over to the senate that it might not pass and i might remind you that i'm a little sympathetic to that considering i led the effort around police reform and we passed the george floyd justice and policing act twice out of the house only for it to linger in the senate it is not dead it's just sitting on somebody's desk over there chuck schumer's desk i guess waiting for it to come up for a vote so what you have is the democratic caucus the democratic party is extremely diverse in every single way and including in terms of perspective you talk about the republicans standing together but if you remember a few years ago the republicans were doing as much infighting as we were the difference is when trump became president because he has turned the party basically into a cult everybody marches in lock step but not for a good reason they march in lock step out of fear and prior to january 6 they used to be afraid of a primary somebody running against them but i want you to know that after january 6 my colleagues who are republicans have told me that their fear now is for their safety because things have become so violent when they decide to take a different position and my colleagues that have been brave and voted for impeachment and voted you know against trump and have been speaking out against him i want you to know that they suffer threats on their lives all the time so that is it for our call this evening i want to thank you all for joining we will do another call and soon as the next bill passes and we are assured that it will make presidents biden's desk stay tuned we will have an in-person telephone i mean we'll have we'll have an in-person town hall meeting which will be the first one since 2019 we are slowly but surely coming out of this and i certainly hope that the thousands of you that are on this call today all have received your vaccine and are doing well thank you very much and good evening

back with us now congresswoman nancy mays from house oversight congressman it's great to see you so it looks like you know the republicans say that democrats it's great to see you the republicans are saying listen democrats are running rough shot over us they're railroading us but it looks like top democrats nancy pelosi and chuck schumer are doing the same to house moderates that's how they feel this is a tremendous fight that's breaking out inside the democrat party it's led by house democrat pete defazio also senators joe manchin chris kirsten cinema they're they're all in a fight so can they get anything across the finish line it doesn't look like it unless they do it through budget reconciliation which is how they force the 1.9 trillion dollar so-called covert relief package earlier this year and quite frankly i think chuck schumer is taking a a note out of nancy pelosi's playbook you've gotta you're not gonna be able to see what's in this infrastructure package the spending until after it's passed i don't know how you can debate an infrastructure bill that hasn't been written it doesn't exist and forget human infrastructure i'm going to call this ghost infrastructure and we hear you i mean we hear you loud and clear i mean they're trying to blow out the size of government in the biggest expansion in about a half a century even democrat economists like jason furman who worked for under president obama says this this all this money is not needed and now republicans are saying to democrats with all of your spending with your push to go it alone without us and our votes you're on your own we're but we will not vote with you to raise the federal debt ceiling because you're blowing out the debt so it seems like senator mcconnell is seeing the infighting in the democrat party in us and how split they are and is really taking them taking it right to them what do you say well it's enormously problematic because the inflation that we have right now democrats are literally making the cost of everything go up inflation has tripled since the start of the year the consumer price index for the first half the year was 5.4 percent the largest spike seen in our country since 2008 when we had the recession and in order to make the the trillion dollar infrastructure package actually work they've had to pile on another 3.5 trillion dollars in spending to get socialists like bernie sanders and aoc on board with an infrastructure package now i got to tell you back in the state of south carolina and i'm assuming states across the country they don't know how to spend all this coveted relief money which is why there's two trillion dollars outstanding covert relief funds i would we could do a trillion dollar massive trillion dollar infrastructure package by using what's left over without raising taxes this could all be done in a bipartisan way but the socialists are driving the agenda yeah we hear you now they want four trillion in spending if the infrastructure deal doesn't come through i mean we're already at already in the first six months it's equal to what obama spent during his entire term and what they want now and if you know they have to deal with the debt ceiling first uh it expires at the end of the month they have to tackle that first before they do these other bills and it seems like there's so much infighting they can't even get democrat votes to get rid of the filibuster i don't know how they're going to get their act together you know to take it across the finish line and the other thing is they don't have a mandate it's 50 50 split in the senate it's a it's the lowest margin of you know leadership for the democrats since world war one in the house i mean if 90 000 votes went the other way the republicans would be running the show it just seems like they don't have their act together right now no they absolutely do not and i was actually going to say that this is this is not a mandate on this kind of big spending and a trillion here a trillion there is only going to make inflation work worse and inflation is taxation because we all pay for it we're at the grocery store or we're getting gasoline just getting everyday normal products and services and the other thing is that the election november as you said the senate is divided 50 50. the house has the slimmest majority since world war one this is a mandate on working together in a bipartisan way but so far it's been all talk they want to talk about working together but they're not actually willing to do it and look at what's happening with the criminal justice reform bill down in the senate then under tim scott trying to lead the way and it's just not working this is a time for us to work together we can look at the violence happening in this country that you previewed earlier in the program i mean we've got a lot of work to do to heal our nation it can be done if we have some people with common sense up there but it's very much lacking i'm telling you we're looking at the earnings conference calls with big companies like unilever fastenal conagra pg e general mills congresswoman they're saying yeah and this is eating into our profit margins their input costs and we have to raise prices and that's these companies are warning about that we're not seeing stagflation but they're warning about about it congresswoman nancy mace it's good to see you thanks for joining us we'll have you back on again soon

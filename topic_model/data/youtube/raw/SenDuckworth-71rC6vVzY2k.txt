miss Renee McManus you know the veterans small business enhancement act was recently passed into law last year allowing veteran owned businesses to be eligible for GSA surplus property senator Kennedy and I worked very hard to make sure our veteran owned businesses have access to the program with help and support from the dedicated staff at SBA my office has been hearing from veteran owned small businesses eager to take advantage of this new program can you provide details on how implementation will proceed specifically what SBA in coordination with the GSA issued general implementing rules before establishing memorandums of agreement with each state agency or will SBA and GSA begin to get those anyways drafted and finalized now what we are I don't mean that's this is not a pejorative statement but what we're waiting on at the moment is for GSA to establish and set the parameters for or the program we will then be working with them very closely and I'd look forward to coming back and talking with you about here's what we're looking at what how do you think we can improve that I would really appreciate your input when we're ready to do that okay thank you let's hope that it moves along yes I think that's such a great it's such a great program thank you I've heard from countless small business owners across Illinois that one of their biggest challenges continues to be access to capital and the need for technical assistance from the federal government to help them compete with major corporations that's why I'm developing legislation that would enhance SBA microloan program which helps meet those needs particularly for women veteran and minority-owned small business and low-income entrepreneurs I think we agree it is an important program and I was really pleased to see president Trump request increased funding for the program in fiscal year 2019 can you explain why the administration believes the program is important to the small business community well it's one of our fastest growing loan programs as well and I think it does that and with the technical assistance and working closely in the communities I think we are developing more and more of those small businesses so it's it's really that connectivity and I'm really pleased to see how well it is and well it is doing and we want to continue to focus on it great thank you I agree that you know that's one you might be interested to know that the average loan is about $17,000 the microloan program that goes a long way doesn't it does to go a long way when sometimes people need 500 to start or a thousand to start so that's about the average loan that's fantastic I I can't think of a better time to enhance the program and my legislation would my draft legislation would increase micro loan intermediaries loan portfolios per year and overall and authorized increased technical assistance funding just as you mentioned the importance of technical assistance I think this would serve as a continuation of the success for SBA has had with this program would you support my forthcoming legislative proposal that builds on your progress to further increase intermediaries loan portfolios so that they can take on more we can give them more money that they can loan out more loans to more businesses I would I would certainly look forward to working with you on that thank you and also the level of technical assistance increased technical assistance funding as well throughout the country I really think it's wonderful that that you are supporting this program and actively I'm championing for it I know across Illinois for example small businesses are ninety-five percent of our employers in our state and so the vast majority of people in Illinois worked for small businesses and should they not be successful we certainly would not be accessory as an economy for a state line so thank you and thank you thank you available to discuss this you bet you know two out of three net new jobs in the private sector created by small businesses thank you so that's we need to take care of them and help them grow thank you

Ament joining me now a Democratic congresswoman Karen bass of California she's a member of the Foreign Affairs and Judiciary Committee it's always good to see you congressman thanks for joining me here on a Saturday you have all reaction to what transpired at the White House with the president meeting with that North Korean official and then announcing summits back on well III think that he sees the summit almost as the goal because the Korean leader hands him a big envelope he gets excited by that he comes out and says that you know it was a very good statement I don't think it makes much sense and it just makes me wonder what will actually happen in this summit I think the sad thing is though is that world leaders know how to play President Trump and I'm sure there'll be a lot of pomp and circumstance maybe they'll even be a big parade and it's no telling what he will agree to the idea that we would start negotiations with the summit that really should be at the end I don't know what we're actually going to get out of this his goal is the complete denuclearization of North Korea and I don't believe there's any indication of that from the North Korean leaders at all well I guess the the definition of what denuclearization means on both sides needs to be more clearly spelled out but the president told reporters the human rights abuses were not discussed in the oval office yesterday with his North Korean official how big a deal was that but then think about at the same time are you not willing to at least consider that the issue of human rights has already come up in other talks and that it probably would come up on June 12th well I absolutely think that it should come up on June 12th but again I think the problem is is that we don't really know what is happening here because it's not clear at all that there is a strategy to this process the president on the one hand says it's completely denuclearization on the other hand he says that this summit is just the beginning so I think from the vantage point of the North Korean leader he's won already he got a major victory by having the president even agreeing to the summit and who knows what will happen maybe there will be - maybe there will be three summits I think it really raises his profile and his stature in the world and I'm referring to the North Korea leader non-residence ruff do you do you believe that the president is spending Camp David this weekend solely focused or at least mostly focused on South Korean at least something can come from that North Korea pardon me I know what you meant it would be helpful if that's what he was doing but we know that Trump really doesn't put much into preparation at all so I hope that he's there I hope he's preparing for the summit but who knows all right and interestingly ma'am as all this is going on we have the Wall Street Journal reporting that US officials are an early talks for a Trump Putin summit right so no date or location on that now in fairness President Obama and Bush they met was put in the first six months of their administration so the fact that this president would be following that precedent what 17 now 18 months into his despite the cloud of the Russia investigation of his head would you allow him for that well I mean I don't think that there's really any comparison between the two we know of all of the difficulties that the country has faced with the relationship with Russia and so to me though the concern that I was raising about the North Korean leader is similar with Putin the president I believe likes to have summits he likes to have the pomp and the circumstance what is the content what is the strategy behind even having this at this point in time all right I want to ask you about in addition to your work on the Foreign Affairs and Judiciary Committee's I know you're also a member of the over criminalization task force so I want to get your reactions yes Harden of dinesh d'souza this week I mean well first of all want to play for you what D'Souza said in an interview yesterday let's listen to that mm-hmm the president said Dinesh you've been a great voice for freedom and he said that I got to tell you man to man you've been screwed he goes I've been looking at the case I knew from the beginning that it was fishy but he said upon reviewing it he felt a great injustice had been done and that using his power he was going to rectify it sort of clear the slate and he said he just wanted me to be out there to be a bigger voice than ever defending the principles that I believe in I just think that it's so sad I think of all of the people who are languishing in prisons all around the tree people who are serving life sentences for nonviolent drug abuses and that's who he chooses to pardon he is using his power as party to pardon which none of us can really question because it's in the Constitution he's using it to serve his own individual purposes and I think that's really sad does Congress have any oversight at all to avoid what is perceived as an abuse of this power well you know it would take a change of the Constitution I certainly introduced legislation many months ago to prohibit the president from pardoning members of his family but really it would take a constitutional change and I think that this is a power that he could use in such a constructive way and it's so sad to see him using it just for his own individual purposes he's trying to send a message he's trying to send a message to all of the people who are under indictment and under investigation that you know don't feel you have to cooperate whatever you say don't worry I will pardon you down the line and I think that that's a despicable use of presidential power I want to also get your reaction to the president using his weekly address today and once again attack Democrats for not funding his border wall here it is they don't want border security for two reasons number one they don't care about it number two they're afraid it's going to make me and the Republicans look good and they don't want that that comes before our country they've blocked every effort to close deadly loopholes to keep out vicious criminals and to stop the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs reaction to that especially after the backlash the administration is facing for losing hundreds of undocumented children well you know I mean I I think that again he just uses issues of immigration and race to gin up his base but I actually think that this administration has committed one of the most egregious human rights abuses that I could think of in recent history and that is the idea of separating parents from their children you know may was national foster care month the foster care system is supposed to protect children from abuse and neglect we don't have enough foster homes for children's who really need to be removed right now and so to misuse this to punish parents I just think is egregious the other thing is is that science has proven that there is long-term damage to separating parents from children and the idea that he would use the system that way I just really think is egregious so you have all of the children that we don't know where they are that were unaccompanied minors that I think is shameful and we need to go back and find those children and then you have the policy of children who have come here with their parents to punish the parents to separate them away one of the things that scares me the most is that I think that some of these parents might never find their children again and what does that say to the world that this would take place in the United States of America that is heartbreaking for sure democratic congresswoman Karen bass from California thank you so much for your time we'll keep an eye on the primaries this Tuesday thank you so much thank you

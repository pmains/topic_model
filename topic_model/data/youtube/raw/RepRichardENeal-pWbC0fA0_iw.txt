so in one month we have taken the entire revenue system of the United States without hearing from one expert witness without having had one public hearing without using any precedent and change the entire tax system of the country tilting it clearly to the people at the very top and when they say as they certainly will well we've been doing hearings for five years we never had one hearing on this legislation not one we did not see testimony from one witness in the conference committee we got to offer opening statements with no amendments there was no chance for any input on our side more than anything else this is a missed opportunity this was a missed chance to take a system that we all know to have fallen in to competitive failure across the globe but instead they decided to go it alone so here's the way you want to think of this for those of you who are following this debate they are borrowing 2.3 trillion dollars for the purpose of cutting the top tax bracket from 39 6 to 37% and calling that middle-class tax relief they are doubling the exemption on the estate tax to 22 million dollars and calling that middle-class tax relief they are eliminating the alternative minimum tax for people at the very top and calling it middle-class tax relief by the tenth year of this tax proposal 83% of the benefit accrues to the people at the very top of our economic system that is not in dispute and they say things like well in five years we're going to correct this measure then they talked about the idea that somehow this was about simplicity when you get in the phase ends in the phase-out you're all going to pass out for trying to read this tax proposal the complexity that they add to the system is unparalleled all to secure a tax cut for people at the top so here we are in the holiday season and they're telling us by the way that if we just borrow this money that everything's going to be fine what did they say about borrowing when Bill Clinton was president what did they say about borrowing when Barack Obama was president they lecture us day in and day out in an unyielding manner even though the economic performance of Clinton and Obama outweighed the two Republican presidents in between so here's the game plan for the holiday season on your credit card you know what the holiday hangover is people who out and use their credit cards and they figure out all year how to try to pay for it it's gonna take you more than 10 years to try to pay for this all about the spurious notion that they guarantee economic growth as the president said by the way that's going to exceed 6% 6% they're telling us that these stock market's gone up because of them even though it's going up since March of 2009 they're telling us now that this is going to spur unparalleled economic growth even though the economy has been growing for 88 straight months all on the credit card for the American people mr. speaker this is the worst piece of legislation that's come from the house in the 29 years that I have served here and I yield back the balance of my Symes expire

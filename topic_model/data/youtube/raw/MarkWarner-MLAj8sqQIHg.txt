we we've we've been in contact with the guard and with the air force on this issue it's my hope with this new data that's come forward with the air force's own answers with the information from boeing about the charcoal filter actually making the problem potentially worse that we'll see again some conclusion from the tag and from the air force to get this issue resolved very quickly for captain wilson again so that if pilots or flight surgeons feel there's a problem that there is a culture that says we want you to come forward with this information because at the end of the day uh this plane is not going to be part of our national defense if pilots one don't feel safe or two if they're up there and not able to function because they can't get appropriate oxygen

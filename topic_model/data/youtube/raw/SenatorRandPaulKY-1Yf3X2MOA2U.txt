today we'll be considering the nomination of anthony blinken to be president biden's secretary of state the problem i have with this nomination is that for decades now we've been at war in afghanistan the war is now called the forever war people lament that it goes on so long and people say how could it possibly keep going on 65 to 70 percent of the american people 65 to 70 percent of american veterans veterans who served in the theater say the war is enough we should end the war in afghanistan how does it go on we've got a new president are things going to change here's the problem why do the wars continue why do the wars in syria and libya and somalia and afghanistan continue because the more things change the more they stay the same mr blinken has been a full-throated advocate of military intervention in the middle east for 20 years we're fooling ourselves if we think we're going to get a new policy we're going to get more of the same in his hearing i said to him the problem isn't that we don't compromise or that we don't have bipartisan consensus the problem is we have too much bipartisan consensus for war for 20 years he's advocated for military intervention he advocated for the iraq war as did the president president biden was also an advocate of the iraq war now later on they say well the war wasn't that great of an idea but we were lied to by george bush and the intelligence and i'm willing to admit there's some truth to that but there's a bigger lesson here the lesson is that regime change doesn't work that you often get unintended consequences and you often get the opposite of what you think you're getting they said we must go to iraq to topple saddam hussein because he's a terrible dictator well yeah he was a despot a dictator an autocrat you know wreaked havoc on his people probably gassed the kurds many different horrible things and yet when it was gone what did we get we got a power vacuum we got more terrorism we're back in there 10 years later because the government's non-functional and what's the final result iran is stronger what's everybody talk about iran iran iran why do we worry about iran well because we toppled their biggest adversary we used to have a balance of power between iraq and iran despot on one side desperate on the other but at least a balance of power but who is iran's best ally now iraq think about it iraq is allied with iran iraq has also allied in many ways with russia as well as us but they've also asked us to leave they're like oh thanks for freedom but y'all can take off now but who supported the war president biden anthony blinken we're back where we were 20 years ago now like i say there's some retrenchment there's some backing off of the position but i don't hear from either president biden candidate biden or from anthony blinking that regime change is wrong now if it were wrong you would expect there was a learning from the iraq war and they would say okay now when we're in charge we won't do the same but it turns out when we had an obama administration with blinken and the other military interventionists in a supposedly progressive administration we got more war they went into libya but once again the same sort of idea the idea that regime change works and that we will topple this terrible dictator gaddafi and out of the mists out of the embers out of the fire will arise thomas jefferson the thomas jefferson of libya will take over and freedom will reign didn't work out so much so mr blinken in his hearing admitted as much he said well maybe we overestimated the possibility that there would be rivals to replace them you think but see this is sort of the expected pattern of the middle east the middle east doesn't have this thousand-year english tradition of trying to control central power dating back to even before the magna carta but even 350 years ago the english had a revolution trying to restrain the power of the king 250 years ago we had our revolution to further restrain the power of the king we have this long-standing tradition but in the middle east there's just more of this tradition of tribalism and so you have an iron fist but when you get rid of the iron fist it's replaced by another iron fist or nothing by chaos so in libya you get rid of gaddafi supported by president obama vice president biden anthony blinken you have the toppling of gaddafi but what did you get chaos more terrorism it's unclear even who we support whether we support the current government the u.n government or general haftar who we support the middle east is divided arms are flowing in on both sides and like we always do we fan the flames by shipping arms to everybody in this in the region as well it didn't work so mr blinken acknowledges yes we we underestimated the possibility there would be a rival government or a rival faction strong enough to rule libya well yeah so did they learn their lesson no about this time or a little bit later they decided we must go into syria so they spent about 500 million dollars 500 million dollars to train about 60 fighters they did in a remote area of syria and they got them trained they spent their 500 million and they sent 10 of them into battle they were all captured or killed in the first 20 minutes 500 million to train 60 million of the so-called moderates but guess what the same holds for syria that held for iraq that held for libya that now holds for syria guess what another despot but who are the people fighting against the despot the most fierce fighters in syria all along were al-nusra and al-qaeda the more jihadist the more vicious and violent and the better the fighters were were there doctors and lawyers and academics and people who want a secular form of government sure but the people out there fighting and the people winning the battles were the jihadists so there was always the danger if you get rid of assad we get another jihadish regime so we have to think through the the policy of this but blinken and biden both supported the iraq war it was an utter failure they admit as much they supported the libyan deposing of gaddafi and war then they acknowledged well maybe it wasn't bad but then they don't take any learning or knowledge from that and say maybe we shouldn't go into the next one syria and yet they went into syria and what lincoln's response is should tell you a little bit about the danger of what we may get from a blink and a senate criteria of state he said the problem in syria was not doing too much but doing too little he says what we really should have done is gone in with full might if we had to put a hundred thousand troops in there like we did in afghanistan and like we did in iraq if we didn't if we were to use sufficient enough force we could have toppled assad but in the end he said we didn't do enough so the lesson to blinken and biden this administration isn't that regime change doesn't work it's that if we're going to do it we need to do it we need to go bigger we need to go all in i would posit that regime change doesn't work that we should not support evil regimes if they are despots or dictators we shouldn't arm them but i'm not for toppling every one of them either because i'm not so sure what you get next so how would this be in the real world saudi arabia has shown themselves to be an autocratic anti-woman anti-modern administration that would actually kill a journalist and dismember him they were rewarded by the previous hit administration with arms terrible idea but what would we do if there was a rational realistic more of realism in foreign policy we would not topple the government of saudi arabia but we might not sell them arms i think that would be a reasonable thing we also might not sell them arms because they were committing atrocities and killing civilians in the war in yemen but if you look back at the war in yemen the obama biden administration did not have very strong opposition to the war in yemen they do now but in the beginning they didn't and so the supplying of weaponry and bombs and smart bombs to saudi arabia occurred under the obama biden administration and then was it uh was continued under the trump administration so we have to ask ourselves we have so many unintended consequences how will we ever you know make things different now our founding fathers envisioned something different our founding fathers envisioned that war should be difficult it was james madison who said that the executive branch is most prone to war and therefore the constitution with studied care vested that power in the legislature to declare war was to be split between the house and the senate and by a majority vote to declare war we don't do that it's passe oh that's an anachronism some say and when anthony blinken is asked about this when he's asked about a use of authorization of force he's asked do you need it and this is when he was working for the obama bible administration he says oh we would welcome discussion and debate and advice from uh the senate but you know we don't really need it he's not alone in this this isn't a democrat republican thing this is most of the foreign policy establishment in both parties particularly once they work for a president will tell you they really yeah they'll listen to your advice oh we really welcome you coming down please come down we'd love to sit down have tea but really don't tell us what to do we can do whatever we want on an article too and you think well gosh that sounds harsh it sounds like you're describing blinking as some sort of john bolton yeah there are similarities but there are similarities between both parties when they get to the executive branch that they don't think they need congress's permission this is a real problem so some in the senate have tried to narrow the definition of where war would be and i looked at their narrower definition last time and i said well yeah you'd narrow it from the whole world to 24 countries i don't want to be at war in those 24 countries either think about it we have more military action in africa right now than we do in the middle east so somalia mali all throughout africa we got troops we had four soldiers die a little over a year ago in mali and it's like people were like we have 800 soldiers in mali no one even knew people in the armed services committee were like we have 800 soldiers in mali and yet that goes on without our permission without a vote of the people's representatives without consulting the people at all just goes on and on and on so my opposition of mr blinken to be secretary of state is not so much because i oppose the administration it's because i oppose the bipartisan consensus for war if we're ever to end these wars we're going to need to not keep nominating the same retreads who have gotten us into these wars so i will vote against mr blinken because i'm against war i'm against war that's not declared by congress i'm against war that is executed primarily by the president i'm against them doing it without the permission of the people so i will oppose mr blinken's nomination i don't think i'll get many people from the other side it's difficult to vote against nominees of one's own party but i will say that if we're ever to end war we need to have a real discussion in this body about when we go to warm whether or not we have to declare war and we have to talk about whether our involvements have worked in the middle east whether or not there's unintended consequences and instead of saying oh it's just george bush's fault it was faulty intelligence yeah yeah that's that there's some truth to that but it's really about regime change it's about the idea that we know what's best for everyone else and that by putting a new regime involved in a country in the middle east somehow it's going to be better it usually turns out worse so mr president i hope my colleagues will today consider voting against mr blinken because i think he's more of the same thank you

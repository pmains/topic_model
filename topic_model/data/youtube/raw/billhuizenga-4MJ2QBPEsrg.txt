thanks for doing this and bill Huizenga second District of Michigan and I'd show you my kids like Nan's but I've got five of them in it'd be really small on that screen but not nearly as small as it would be if it was shillings family with what 11 all right Bobby just ten just ten all right we had a good start here but you know it's it is it is interesting I came out of the state government as well from the state of Michigan Michigan has had a downturn like no other has been many ways been the leading edge of what the United States had to go through and we had this exact same requirement in our in our Constitution we need to go back in and I can tell you having done something called a reverse appropriation that is not a fun thing to vote on when you've when you've given money out to a department you've had to take money back that is not fun but it's those tough decisions that we needed to make unfortunately Washington is not willing or able to go do that and I equate it's sort of like the 500-pound guy that walks into the donut shop for his daily two dozen donuts and we think by ordering a dozen and a half instead this week or today we're on a diet and we're going to you know have a have a weight loss program here we're not changing our exercise plan we're not changing any other habits and it's crazy to think that that that's going to be successful well that's sort of the same thing here in Washington we continue to spend and continue to spend and we nibble around the edges and we're not getting after those things that we know are the true drivers of our debt which are the long-term entitlements as well as those short-term programs and now I've had a chance to talk to a number of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and I find there's a couple of different categories of them one those that support it and I commend them I think they're they believe they're going out and doing the right thing there's another group that believes they truly truly don't have a problem I call them the debt deniers they really don't think we have as big a significant problem as I believe we do and I think as most of the country believes we do and then you've got those that had been talked about earlier those that just seems are clearly clearly and plainly just playing politics they were there they were voting for these things they'll talk about it on the campaign trail but when it's time to put their money where their mouth is literally they're not willing to go do that because their focus is not on the future their focus is on this next this next election cycle and that's the kind of hypocrisy and the kind of a behavior that needs to be exposed and I believe that the American people are going to hold those people accountable in these in these coming years so we appreciate all those that are supporting it and we want to encourage our colleagues that's still not too late we can go pound a few few heads and knock a little common sense and hopefully but it's really up to the American people to make sure that their voice is being heard thank you

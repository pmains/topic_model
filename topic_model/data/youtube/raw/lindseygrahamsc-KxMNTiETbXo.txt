South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham came to Myrtle Beach today Republican groups hosted at the coastal Carolina's Association of Realtors before taking questions from locals the senator shared his plans to fight the Affordable Health Care Act and stalling Iran's nuclear interest he's also covered local issues like offshore energy and off the coast of South Carolina there is a lot of oil and gas there for the taking do it in a responsible environmental way with a buffer to protect tourism but that will be one of the big priorities I hope of our delegation senator Graham is up for re-election next year and he has opposition within his own party

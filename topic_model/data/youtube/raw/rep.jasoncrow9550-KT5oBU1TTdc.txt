when i first came to congress uh in 2019 i wanted to make a priority of mine uh bringing together uh several passions the first passion being tackling the climate crisis uh the second uh being uh securing our national defense and doing right by our men and women in uniform and making sure that we were prepared to address uh what is in my view uh one of the the world's if not the world's biggest national security threat having in uh well into the 21st century and that is the climate crisis which we know is not just a um a threat magnifier that magnifies existing threats but it's creating new funds every day so that's the reason behind the sustainable power initiative was to uh engage with stakeholders administration officials uh and uh think tanks and elected officials and others to identify ways that we can catalyze the incredible work that's already being done by dod in this area which as we know has been a leader in the federal government for many years on climate and energy resiliency so uh with that i would like to just introduce i will run through all the panelists here and then we'll open it up for folks to make some opening remarks from each of you to kind of talk about your areas of focus and what you're doing on this area and then we will proceed to framing questions we'll try to answer some questions about what are the next steps because the first round table was focused on installation resiliency the second on operational energy and then the third is really to take both of those components into tied in locally to colorado and identify what we need to do legislatively or otherwise to make sure that our installations in colorado our military communities in colorado uh are secure or resilient and prepared to address the threats and the challenges that we're gonna face in the next decade beyond uh so with that uh we're very proud to have uh senator michael bennett uh the uh the senior senator from colorado uh who's been in the united the states bio here because everybody knows thank you thank you but i will say as somebody that's known for being a pragmatist as one of the the finest legislative minds i think in the united states senate uh that has a very large portfolio of pragmatic bipartisan bicameral bills uh as somebody who like me uh is a uh unabashed uh uh policy wonk that loves to dive deep into the policy of issues and we take great pride in that michael so really great to have you thank you jason i i as i listen to you describe this effort i uh in part was thinking uh uh what a great uh congress person you are for having thought of doing something like this and then having done it and then i started to think about what a lame senator i am for having failed to do something like this so i really appreciate your including me it's actually given me a really good idea i think and i uh am grateful for everybody who's on the call i'll be or on the on in the meeting i'll be brief uh here at the outset because i really want to hear the discussion but i was once asked by somebody this was this is how she phrased it in a town hall she she said to me michael or she she's a senator or whatever she said can western democracy solve climate change and i said to her wow you've just asked me the most existential question that anybody's asked me in a really long time because in that question was what you could hear the concern that this enterprise this democracy this republic may not be up to the challenge of dealing with climate change that the broken politics of washington might not allow us to to create a result and one of the things i said to her i won't give you the whole spiel but one of the things i said to her was your question is such an important one for this reason if for no other reason and that is that for for us to solve climate change we need a solution that will endure we need something that uh will last from administration to administration and today's you know politics in washington that seems like a lifetime for something to exist think about what's happened with healthcare over the last 12 years and how politicized it becomes and i put my ideas for in for two years the other side rips them out i put them in for two years the other side rips them out uh that's not a way to govern the country generally but it certainly isn't a way to deal with the climate crisis because we need a solution that will last and and the example that i often use for people is when you think about the way in which the cold war organized our thoughts it wasn't that we didn't make mistakes we did make mistakes we made mistakes in the name of prosecuting that but we also kept our eye on what we were trying to do and every president knew what their job was with respect to the soviet union and the transatlantic alliance even if there were differences between democrats and republicans and we we won that war over the course of 50 years not two years uh not two years at a time and so i am always looking for opportunities in climate to try to build an unusual coalition that will endure so i've spent a lot of time as a member of the agriculture sec committee with farmers and ranchers across colorado trying to enlist them in the climate effort even if they're voting for the other party as a way of trying to create a a solution that will endure and i believe this is exactly what you're trying to do here with dod i mean dod has an incredibly important role to play on the merits but it also i think can help reduce the partisan nature of the politics around climate and i and i and i and i it's been amazing to see the progress that's already been made and i think if we look at this through a national security lens um it's much more likely that we will travel a far distance so with that i i'll just say again thank you jason for letting me uh uh come on and i'm really anxious to hear what others with a lot more expertise have to say yeah thank you senator bennett i appreciate those uh introductory remarks uh next we have uh joe bryan who's the uh senior climate advisor for the department of defense or who i like to refer to as uh the dod's climates are i'm very excited to have him prior to being an engineer advisor on climate to the dod joe bryan served as a deputy assistant secretary of the navy for energy starting in 2014 under the obama administration after leaving the administration mr bryan joined the atlantic council as a senior fellow and founded muskwell orange llc a clean energy consultancy in recent years mr bryan has ridden and testified numerous times on climate change clean energy in the military uh joe over over to you uh thanks congressman crow and uh thank you senator bennett i really uh um appreciate your your kind of high level view there senator it's uh and i think i think you're right about a couple you're right about a lot of things of course that's what uh that's important to say but you're right on this issue too and that i think one of the ways in which we can contribute the department of defense can contribute to this dialogue is to is to talk a lot about how our climate solutions align with our mission objectives for the department of defense in the military so um this is an incredibly important issue it's uh i appreciate the opportunity to join the discussion today and i look forward to hearing from from folks who work in different segments of the economy and who are out at uh for example uh colonel campbell out of buckley really interested to hear uh hear his thoughts as as congressman crowell mentioned my name's joe bryan i'm the uh on the senior advisor to the secretary of defense and the deputy secretary for climate and the most important thing to mention probably is that the fact that my position even exists is a evidence of the priority that this issue uh priority place this issue holds for this administration and and for the secretary and the deputy secretary in the entire department of defense and the important point is that that's that's with good reason um secretary austin said pretty clearly that climate change affects everything that the department does and that runs from um you know resetting the geopolitical landscape as we think to the arctic and our competitors uh and other places in the world where where things are are shifting and climate is impacting how we're going to relate to the world and how others are going to relate to us it's creating demands on the force whether they be humanitarian assistance and disaster relief demands or whether they be as a congressman you alluding to the the injection of uncertainty and and dislocation of people around the world creating uh opportunities for instability and for uh malign actors to take advantage of some of these events and then the thing that we've we've we're i think we're gonna talk about a bit about today is is the impact on our installations there's both a long-term impact of climate on our installations and impacting our readiness ability to train our ability to do our job and then the acute impacts of climate on climate events on our immediate ability to support the mission and that's that's a really major threat given um given how critical our uh installations are to our four deployed forces increasingly so and to and to the mission so um the uh as senator uh bennett uh mentioned you know we're looking for places in which our national security objectives are aligned with with our climate objectives and when you look at things like energy efficiency really aggressive energy efficiency when you're looking at things like distributed generation uh that doesn't require logistics support things like solar when you're thinking about things like storage and the increasingly important role that plays not only for our facilities but for our platforms all of those things are absolutely necessary for the mission there also happening to be good for the climate so we see a lot of alignment and what we need to do for for the department just to do our job and what's what happens to be good for the climate so i look forward to the to the discussion today with everyone uh at the table and appreciate again senator congressman you for uh for for leading on this we uh i think the country appreciates and certainly the department of defense appreciates it because this is the discussion we need to have uh thanks so much and i look forward to the the discussion thank you mr brian uh next i'm going to go to our post this morning uh we're sitting in the conference room of buckley air force base and aurora uh in uh the best congressional district in the state of colorado um lieutenant connor campbell is the acting commander of the 40x 460 mission support group buckley garrison colorado uh which is a fancy way of saying he's responsible for the tenant units and the operations of the base and making sure that all of the trains run on time and things happen smoothly on the on the insulation which is no easy task to be sure uh so your responsibility is leading a 150 person group and providing administrative personnel support with over 14 000 personnel and 97 units in four major installations in the united states space command as well as well as other units and agencies in the front range area so it's not just buckley but it's the broader uh region as well uh colonel campbell is a two-time graduate of the squadron uh two-time graduated vibrant commander you were sponsored twice what uh we're trying to say i need more coffee his first command was the defense logistics agency energy as the commander of dla energy japan and the second command was the 35th logistics readiness squadron so certainly no stranger to energy issues to be sure and i i said on the readiness subcommittee of the armed services committee so i i look at all the installations around the globe uh but frankly um i'm very proud that buckley is as like to say my installation installation that i'm uh most proud of and the work really begins and ends for me with buckley so colonel campbell thank you for hosting us and for your work and if you like uh have a few uh only remarks uh thank you congressman crowe senator bennett thank you sir for being here uh yeah so i feel woefully underdressed in the resume department as i sit here uh among all you uh wonderful people and unfortunately i wasn't the first two panels but uh as congressman crowe pointed out uh you know my first comment in japan uh with dla energy japan uh was a big eye-opening for me and from a strategic and operational perspective uh when it comes to our dependency in fossil fuels and and kind of those strategic impacts when it comes to the warfighter so i've always had kind of a passion for energy uh since then however being here at buckley for the last uh it's only been 11 months since i've been here um you know energy is we always talk about energy and we talk about energy resilience and and how we can be better uh prepared to support our national zero-fail mission so uh so it's critical for us here how we're gonna move forward in the future uh and i look forward to the discussion on the panel and uh i've got a few thoughts but uh i just want to say thank you for letting me part thank you colonel campbell thank you for for hosting this picture hey next jackson congressman congressman sorry um alice i apologize it's michael i i have to vote so i'm going to abandon you i may come back but i just want to let you know and colonel thank you very much for all you do it's good to see you sorry about that thanks all right uh alice jackson who's the president of excel energy colorado uh miss jackson is uh previously was the area vice president of strategic revenue initiatives uh leading the company's revenue growth strategy from 2013 to 16 she was the regional vice president of rates and regulatory affairs and excel energy for those who don't know and covers not just colorado but many states in front of the western region minnesota and other areas and frankly is doing an incredible thing in the state of colorado in terms of uh really increasing the renewable energy portfolio i see uh alice you have the wind uh the windmills behind you but uh really helping the state meet its renewable energy portfolio standards uh and being very aggressive in its innovation and of course we're sitting here on a base you can't talk about energy uh military installations without talking about where that energy comes from and it's in so many cases it's coming from the civilian providers the utilities and we have to take a holistic view of that so uh alice thank you for joining us if you have any intro uh remarks would love to hear it yes so good morning good afternoon depending upon where you're based um you know happy to be here for the conversation today i'm sorry to not be there with you in person in the conference room unfortunately i am down in the houston area we had a family emergency so i'm helping out my family right now but um yes excel energy does serve eight states in the central us uh we were the first utility in 2018 to announce an aggressive uh carbon reduction plan to achieve a zero carbon system by 2050 with an interim target of hitting an 80 reduction across all eight of those states uh by 2030. uh we like to say it's not a competition but here in colorado we're leading the pack inside of excel energy and i'm excited to say that not too long ago we filed a plan that would actually achieve an 85 carbon reduction from our 2005 levels by 2030 and remarkably and looking at that we believe we can deliver reliably uh to our customers roughly 80 percent of their energy um coming from renewable resources so that's quite a change and a step forward both nationally as well as in colorado and we're very excited to look at that and then the last component of it is around affordability we believe we can do all of that in delivering those resources to our customers for less than two percent over less than the rate of inflation uh increases every single year uh so that is something that we're really excited to continue exploring um as well as looking at you know beneficial electrification and evs and so electrifying other sectors there are a lot of pieces of the puzzle here it's incredibly complicated but we're excited about the future thank you mr appreciate you joining us uh next is dr jim white who currently serves as the dean of the college of arts and sciences at cu boulder his research focuses primarily on global scale climate and environmental dynamics in 1989 dean white started the instar stable isis isotope lab at cu boulder which is a world renowned at this point and doing much of the important uh research in this area in recent years his research has helped to show that large climate changes tend to occur in the national system as abrupt and rapid shifts in mode were probably driven by internal adjustments in the earth climate system rather than slow and gradual adjustments to changing external conditions such as the amount of energy received from the sun i understand roughly a third of that but most important most importantly uh dr white a long time friend and mentor of uh the uh the far smarter crow in the crow family that is dr desiree uh crow uh at the university of colorado as well so dr white thank you for joining us thank you thank you so much congressman thank you it's i'm honored to be here this is a great group um normally when i talk uh about climate change and sustainability it's to the people that either really want to hear me or really don't want to hear me so i'm this is this is uh this is a lot more fun um i i got to do something about that bio by the way it's it's got to be cleaned up and and sanitized um i've been a climate scientist for about 40 years now and i've got the flat spot on my head from banging my head on the wall and the doors to prove it i've done a lot of work with ice cores a lot of work on trying to understand how climate change is something i won't talk about today is abrupt climate change which is one of the more existential threats that we face um i did want to point out that i'm here representing not only myself but the university of colorado boulder bragging points congressman the university colorado boulder is the number one university in the world in publications in the environment sustainability and in citations of those publications so the front range of colorado is a known global nexus of climate change research and sustainability i would also point out that we it's not just on the physical sciences but we have a lot of expertise in the realm of economics policy i've been working recently with some national leaders around the country on the topic of democracy and climate change which i think is a really fascinating one and and uh something that really we should dig more deeply into as time goes by thank you for being uh for having me here thank you doctor i appreciate all you do uh next uh i would like to introduce uh kelly nordini the executive director of conservation colorado which does uh much of the stakeholder engagement work and bringing folks together in the state around this issue and others uh you've been at the forefront of the conservation policy for over two decades now kelly and played a pivotal role in the conservation movement and efforts to advance clean energy portfolio standards and just transition issues in the state as well uh prior to that you were chief of staff to the speaker of ohio state house deputy after governor ritter as you've long been involved with the government and helping guide our elected officials which we appreciate very much and now is leading uh the largest environmental organization in the state of colorado so kelly thanks for joining us yeah thanks that's a very nice way of saying i've been beating my head against your political wall for almost 30 years so i will see your uh 40 years dr white and raise you politics um i'm really honored to be here what a what a great group um you know from excel's leadership to colonel campbell and of course our elected officials were very appreciative um to have senator bennett and congressman crowe leaving on this issue and ceo we worked closely with um and you know just really happy we we talk about the leadership story in colorado and the outsized world that plays nationally um given the type of state that we are a fossil fuel producing state that also has a long history leading on clean energy and climate um and at this moment in time this intersection of state leadership combined with the federal partnership um you know this is a generational moment in time to meet this challenge and we're really excited to be a part of it and to see you all pushing forward and leadership on things like the american jobs um plan which we think is so fundamental um to winning this fight so thank you for having us thank you kelly thank you and last and definitely not least and i've saved the best for last a very long time friend of mine uh not just a leader in this area but somebody who uh the core family has filmed for a very long time and can do the great work as christine burr who's this senior policy advisor for the colorado energy office uh and as the senior policy advisor for the office you provide resources and support for communities across the state to reach their clean energy goals for a more sustainable future to help them meet their portfolio standards and make the transition uh in her current role she also serves as the regional air quality commission uh or serves on the air quality commission as a member of the office of just transition advisory board uh prior to the energy office he served for five years as the mayor of lafayette and led the expansion of the city's renewable energy portfolio and sustainability goals and environmental education so christine thank you so much for joining us well i am just thrilled to be here what an incredible group and i won't take long because i think the session is going to be very interesting um as a former mayor i think you know we know a lot of this work is happening on the ground level and local government and it's a really exciting place to be because certainly you know even when we look at what's happening here at buckley it really the leadership comes from within as well and so really excited to have conversations with you about that um as alice had mentioned and we're very proud of the fact that our six largest utility companies that provide 99 of the energy in colorado are going to be 80 renewable by 2030 which is extraordinary so there's these big pieces that we're sliding into place with our greenhouse gas pollution reduction roadmap which is sort of a sector by sector uh reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and of course renewable energy energy efficiency beneficial electrification all the stuff that has already been mentioned plays a huge part and i think resiliency is the end result and so it's it's it's like you know the triple bottom line when you do things for the environment you get clean air you get better public health outcomes and resiliency which is great it's energy security so i'm happy to be here today thank you christine really really appreciate all of you let's kick it off this is meant to be you know more more conversational but i wanted to start with some framing questions and i'm going to direct the first to dr white actually just to kind of set the context for what it is we're dealing with here and to localize this issue uh dr white you've been researching as you mentioned uh the climate crisis climate change uh for uh four decades now uh so i don't think there's really anybody or that not many people more in the world that understand the trajectory and the trends kind of what's happening here than you do um what can you tell us about what's happening in colorado you know we are sitting here at a base that has um some cannot fail national security missions that our country relies on we have more of those to the south in colorado springs we have six major military installations or uh um facilities in colorado that houses some of our most important national security assets so what what risks and what are we facing in the next decade here well uh let me just preface my remarks by saying i teach a 16-week course on energy and climate change so we could we could do this for a while congressman crow i'm not going to do that what i am going to do is hit some highlights uh and a lot of material that that both joe and alice could could easily cover themselves um i will tell you that i'm going to sound like a really depressing person um and and but i want to tell you that i'm i'm not i'm very optimistic i think this is a problem that we can solve that human beings are um really fundamentally adaptable and intelligent and if we put our minds to it we can actually solve these problems the important point being we've got to put our minds to it i just want to highlight a few local and external and what i call existential threats while i focus first on colorado i do want to point out that what happens unlike vegas what happens in the rest of the world does indeed impact colorado so we have to pay attention to that our number one problem in colorado is water scarcity and the fact that we are our climate is drying um one of the truisms and climate change in the northern hemisphere is if you look south you can see what's coming your way and the aridity of arizona and new mexico is is on its way and that impacts industry including the military it impacts agriculture it impacts residential use it uh precipitates state-to-state conflicts that we are currently as you all know uh dealing with and they're just going to get worse a subset of water issues is water seasonality we're now seeing more rain than snow and that creates a problem because snow is a reservoir that we in colorado use it's a free reservoir we're going to have to be thinking about building reservoirs and one of the key problems in colorado is as soon as you say the word i want to build a reservoir you get things thrown at you um we also are facing probably the second biggest problem in colorado is tied to water and that is fires there's a great deal of ecosystem damage there's a great deal of economic damage from tourism and health impacts as well the front range air here in colorado last summer was really bad and is probably not going to be a whole lot better this year and that's not just colorado wildfires but all the western wildfires that bring smoke our way um weather extremes um are a serious problem we're facing more droughts uh more heat spells ironically in the middle of more droughts we're also facing larger rainfall events larger snowfall events so the extremes and in a warmer climate with more energy in the atmosphere you tend to have more more of the extremes we've as we found out this this past spring um we're also looking at a world in which the cold air that's normally bottled up in the arctic is now freer to sag south um particularly in the shoulder seasons in the in the spring and the fall and that leads to unusually cold outbreaks that can strain our energy systems as we saw with with what happened in texas and then as i said it just doesn't stay in texas a lot of the costs got passed around um in in a quite unusual way from from a consumer point of view um a lot of ecosystem changes that are that are difficult to deal with uh pests and diseases that are now out out working and out competing the the ecosystem that is really a 50 year old ecosystem the as the climate changes pests and diseases can change faster that's true in both natural environments but also in agricultural environments um heat related health impacts including death from an energy point of view alice can talk about this but you know our infrastructure is built around a past climate and that's a problem in terms of of summer cooling demand heating demand during the shoulder seasons in particular in colorado we have a very robust oil and gas industry and as we think about transitioning away from oil and gas we have to think about the the impacts that has on colorado from a human point of view also an economic point of view taxes jobs etc and i think a big question is what is the best use of the remaining reserves that we have and i will put in a pitch for the military right there um as alice can tell you we are blessed in colorado with wind solar hydro geothermal there's there's we are capable of being one of the renewable energy capitals in the country and uh exploiting that just makes a lot of sense uh from a from a carbon point of view but also from it from an economic point of view um i'll just point out also that the uh the as i pointed out earlier the infrastructure that we have in this state and probably within the military as well is built around a past climate just a couple of examples for you one is storm drains so when we have very large rainfalls we've built a storm drain system that was built around a certain maximum size or expected maximum size of rain let's say the 20-year rain or 30-year rain that's as rainfall events gets larger our storm systems get our storm sewer systems get get swamped more and more often and many of them um go through our sewer systems and then that gets bypassed and dumped into creeks and lakes etc um i well i i chaired a uh a national academy committee several years ago and i'll always remember this we had someone i wish i could remember his name from the navy come in and talk to us about unexpected problems and the unexpected problem he pointed out was that as sea level rises you can't sail aircraft carriers under bridges anymore which i thought was you know a really excellent illustration of just how orthogonal you have to think when you think about climate change you get used to a certain situation and then you realize oh that doesn't work anymore um i did want to mention some external threats uh that that uh i certainly joe can talk about as well food security supply chain issues whether you make beer or whether you make computer chips there are problems there um resource security one of the examples that i use in class that my students research is lithium do we have enough of that stuff globally are we secure in our supplies of lithium if we want to make a lot of batteries um some of the larger problems that we face sea level rise uh which is a huge economic challenge here in our country and around the world but also a problem of refugees as well where we're we expect that the number of refugees will be in the hundreds of millions and not just the millions that we see today and that's going to be a problem for sure for our military um there's also problems with excessive heat in the tropics so even if sea level resident wasn't rising and it is the ability of people to live in the tropics and to grow crops etc in the tropics is declining as time goes by i've spent way too much of my life in greenland underneath the snow drilling ice cores so arctic change is a something that's very near and dear to my heart a lot of geopolitical issues here um love to sit down and talk joe with you at some point about this because you know the the the challenge that for example russia faces to the united states this is something that we have to say out loud and we have to deal with um and also as the arctic begins to warm up and dry out a little bit massive wildfires we now we now have something called ghost fires or zombie fires that they start one year and even though there's snow and cold they manage to smolder in the peat underground and then re-erupt as the uh when when the weather warms up again now this is new we we've we've not faced something like that before so these are real problems that that impact the quality of the air that impact colorado externally by impacting the environment by impacting refugees etc and finally i just want to finish up on on existential threats because i i would be remiss if i didn't talk about this um the the current denial of reality when it comes to climate change is a real problem because climate change is very simple physics and the fact that we cannot the fact that you know i 40 years ago i was unable to convince people using science that climate change was real um is is i think a real problem um i have to look my kids and my grandkids in the eye and tell them we screwed up we didn't get the job done um there's also the question of can we can we act can we pivot without public support and i think that's a real issue that we have to face as i pointed out the threat to democracies is very real and we have to we have to take that problem very seriously and then finally i just want to wrap up with um we have tools but we lack we have consistently lacked the will to use those tools for example we can dr white if i could if i could stop you there because we're going to get a little bit into the tools with with uh mr brian i'm going to make sure that we're reserving enough time for the other folks in our apologies a sobering assessment for sure and we certainly have our work with us in every respect thank you uh uh mr brian you know on that point it's a good segway uh into um the role of the dod here and i know uh there's a there's a tool called the defense climate assessment tool that the department has rolled out to try to better understand the impacts of climate um would you be able to just describe you know how that tool works and how the department is assessing the potential impacts and gathering information and how that's going to play into um you know the master planning process for colonel campbell and other folks in installations like buckley and around around the world sure uh thanks uh thanks congressman and and dr white appreciate that overview you know it um we i like to think about climate change as uh as creating a supply and demand problem and that it's demanding a lot more mission from us and it's cutting our ability to supply the resources necessary to meet the demand so we got the lines going in the wrong direction uh and and the uh kind of gap between those two things is risk and one of the things congressman that we need to do if we're going to address risk is we need to identify what that risk is and i think that's what the defense climate assessment tool helps us do it's it's kind of a first step assessment that takes a look at takes a bunch of data geospatial data looks at a particular facility or installation and allows us to identify risks around five or six key areas drought flood you know heat a number of a number of kind of thresholds and allows us to take a first cut at what the threat uh climate's going to pose to that particular installation the mission that's housed there uh it's not a it's not the end all be all what it is it's a is a tool that we can execute quickly and relatively cheaply that allows us to inform what ends up being really important things like installation energy plans to uh to mitigate the risk that those uh that those climate factors are going to pose it allows us to inform our master planning process which says okay if we're going to face these climate risks and we have these energy systems in place and we know they're going to be affected what does our master plan need to look like what do our buildings need to do what our energy systems need to do so it's a fundamental piece of building a resilient infrastructure for the department of defense and installations like buckley and around the country you know the uh and we've we've kind of the tool has been around for a bit uh but what we've done is we put some urgency to our ability to assess kind of enterprise level risk uh using the d-cad tool so the secretary as we talked about earlier participated in a uh in a climate leaders summit that the president put on a couple weeks ago and in that summit the secretary committed that every defense installation in the country will have uh completed at least an initial assessment using the defense critic the defense climate assessment tool by uh by april of next year so that's pretty aggressive goal we're going to baseline where we are which is really important and then we're going to get after things like uh some of the technologies and and and mitigation measures that can help improve our resilience for the critical missions at places like buckley that the colonel campbell can certainly speak to so that's a it's really a tool we're going to use to to to baseline where we are and to inform some more extensive planning and resource allocation that we know we're going to need to do to address some of the threats so that's that's where we are on that uh i i actually don't know if tom i had uh um uh whether colonel campbell whether uh buckley has completed the tool or not i i i should have probably checked that sorry congressman that's bad work bad staff work on my part of not checking that before i got on the call sir i know that i know our civil engineering squadron had started started working on it yes yeah so every base is going to run through this process uh it's run out of a part of the department of defense it's it's something we're committed to so uh again it's it's a it's a fundamental building block of our ability to assess our enterprise level risk as well as a specific specific risk that faces particular installations and and congressman i know this is something you've been focused on for a long time so um look forward to working with you on that yeah thank you mr brian appreciate that very much and there's a follow-up that i on that that i was going to go over to miss jackson but before i do i want to go to uh miss burr and then change gears just a little bit because uh i know uh miss berg has been a long time wear as many hats as i know but one of one of the most important is the impact of public health uh and of course it's impacting um our health particularly in colorado and we can't have a strong national defense and we can't do the things that we do here people are not healthy and we see asthma rates increasing uh we we continue to have uh increased number of non-ebay entertainment days in colorado so i'd love to uh have you just touch on where you see that trajectory going in terms of the public health impact what types of things we need to be thinking about oh my goodness well for any parent that had their kids at home during the pandemic i think what really triggered me was the wildfire season the sort of threat multiplier that was sort of an illustration of that where i have a four and an eight-year-old and i didn't want to let them outside and i sure as i didn't want to be in the house with them all day but it was scary right because the sky was black and as a parent as we look at what you know i even think today what how did that impact them in that time period because we did go outside you know and so um i think the public health side of it it's not just air quality it's also rates of depression right it's mental health and this is not this was training ground covered 19 is training ground for pandemics and as the weather warms up the ozone you know everything exacerbates uh the temperatures and the air quality so as we know we're in a non-attainment frozen in on the front range and we're working diligently to figure out okay what are all the mechanisms by which we can incentivize local governments and other jurisdictions to really think solidly about their role what do they have to play when it comes to transportation smart growth let's look at infill instead of building out in the countryside i mean all of it's really tied together so yeah i think it's scary to be honest and you know as as mr as dr white had mentioned this sort of lack of understanding of the connectivity we all play when it comes to you know climate change and you know climate deniers and there are local level electives in this state that say oh it's not it's not happening it's not real so we are seeing it in front of us in colorado i mean i i you know we don't have the sea level rise in the same way right that's really visible in places like miami where the king tide is around but by god we have a ski industry that's a multi-million dollar ski industry the outdoor recreation industry is also a huge employer and so when we look at the vitality and innovation that we need to come up with we've got all the tools you're right we have the tools and i think we've got a really motivated legislature and we have you know a lot of bills that have come through but i always go back to the local level government and how do we support them because it takes a lot of staff capacity technical expertise and money so we're like crossing our fingers we've got some really great like i think is significant amounts of money that we can give to local governments because they're the ones they're on the front lines when there's a health epidemic when there's a fire when there's a flood as we saw in 2013 so i i i think we all understand the connectivity to public health and i think there's a lot of fear around what's going to be the next big thing right so thank you thank you christine appreciate that um so picking up uh what mr brian just mentioned in terms of the connectivity issues and infrastructure issues and dr white mentioned the issue that uh our infrastructure is not infrastructure that's designed to meet this challenge in the evolving climate uh which is a perfect segway in uh into you jackson who's you know really uh leading the way and managing the organization that is trying to solve that infrastructure challenge at least from an energy perspective i know we've had these conversations before you know the biggest challenges is moving moving energy from where the wind is blowing and where the sun is shining to where it's not uh but also base low uh and you know tropical storm yuri and other extreme weather events have really highlighted the vulnerability of the grid and if we had a similar event in colorado uh you know there's only a limited number of time a limited number of days installations like buckley can operate uh if the if the grid goes down and that would be a major major problem for the country so i love your thoughts on where we are in infrastructure what you see is the biggest challenge is to build the infrastructure we need to adapt no well thank you representative and i would agree with you you know infrastructure is a constant focus and it's something that utilities not just excel energy is looking at very closely on how do you maintain the reliability of that system and the deliverability because we're transitioning very very quickly um you know colorado really is the tip of the sphere when we're talking about transitioning from you know dispatchable resources to the variable energy resources and those are not located in the same places that's why along with the plan that we have before the commission right now looking at the 85 carbon reduction we also have transmission infrastructure that has to be built out in order to deliver those resources reliably from the eastern plains of colorado back to the load centers and it's not just for us it's not just for excel energy and the customers that are connected to our system it's also for the rest of the customers and the other utilities across the state because transmission quite frankly is open access so anybody can connect their generation resources to those facilities in order to be able to get that energy back so you have to build a strong backbone resiliency i'm sure is something that you talk about a lot on buckley's air force base it's something i know we talk about with you all from an energy perspective it's something we have to look at which means we also have to keep other types of generation resources available until we get to zero carbon based disposable resources because i don't know about you all but i still haven't figured out that that that the red bat phone that i can pick up and call and say hey can you move those clouds aside can you make the wind blow longer can you make the day a little bit longer and the sun stay up so we have to get creative battery storage is part of the solution and something that we're investing in but we need longer duration um and that's not just for colorado um as you mentioned uh you know we are blessed in colorado uh we have 300 days of sunshine which means we have solar resiliency we have high wind speeds on our eastern plains as dr white was mentioning which means we have better output coming from those wind resources you go to other states in the country and they don't have that same blessing uh and so we have to figure out how the technology advancement that needs to happen between now and 2030 2040 is something that we have to consider very strongly um and just like wind resources were more expensive 15 years ago than they are today these technologies are out there but they're really pricey for customers so we need help in figuring out how do you install those how do you keep the cost reasonable for customers so that we can get the supply and demand curves to do what they do in technological innovation and move them forward to lower those costs for customers so representative pro one of the things i like to mention um and i know you and i have spoken about as well is really around not just the communities that are impacted by the air quality but the communities that are going to be impacted by the transition um and so particularly looking at some of these rural communities where we have coal resources that are closing how do we help them continue the resilience of just the fabric of their lives and that is something that we're talking about with a number of different departments at the federal level right now on figuring out how do we redevelop particularly in colorado the hayden community how do we reinvest in that location so that we're looking at the long-term future whether that's tax base for jobs and the resiliency of the system in that part of the state it's incredibly important for us to pay attention to those as we continue to move forward and figure out ways to once again make those investments maybe even in new technologies and help lower the overall cost and burden on those communities and the general electric based customers but yes there's much investment to be made i think it's a testament to where we are in the state of colorado that even though winter storm yuri did impact us all the way up to the front range you know we hit some of the record high or record low highs um you know in the denver metro area as we went through that event we had no interruptions uh you know on our system because of failures of the infrastructure which is i think a really important piece but that also goes back to the resources we had on the system and how do we make sure we have those insurance policies in place uh to be able to deliver what our customers need whether it's the air force bases manufacturing facilities or people staying comfortable in their homes so there's a lot of opportunity here many conversations to be had that i would encourage all of us to continue to focus on how do we help even those communities that we're transitioning uh particularly over the next several years and then double down the focus on technology because we need to figure it out in order to continue to drive um that zero carbon future thank you ms baxter as if you knew i was gonna go to the kelly next with that last comment because uh as kelly knows really well um none of this gets done without a coalition without bringing people to the table to help get it done uh and uh and uh miss mordini is no stranger to that so love your thoughts on how do we as we do this work and make this transition how do we build that coalition and bring the folks who are going to be uh impacted by that to the table and make sure that it is adjustable yeah and thank you congressman for for raising that and i think those are the two things that i wanted to add to the conversation because um i'm not going to try and science or any of you all uh but i think there are two important pieces that we haven't really talked about and that is um the public and specifically communities of color and happily um i was really happy to hear that dr white is optimistic it's always good when someone with his knowledge is optimistic that gives me some hope um and so is the public um the public has really turned a corner on climate change i've been following this research for 15 years and it's been a long time that the public has believed in climate science and frankly the military as a validator in that is one of the most important proof points we see but what we've seen is in the last three years or so and this is true nationally not just in colorado the public has turned the corner on emergency and they no longer see this as a problem that might impact their kids or their grandkids depending on how old they are but they see it in their lives right now and it's particularly weird weather that's how they think of it and wildfires that are bringing that home and so we see two to one support um from the public for action on climate change almost every single public policy we test that addresses climate change support for and they want to see their elected officials take action within the next year two to one support for that um that is unheard of in the political work that i have done for a long time to have that level of support across the board including the colorado's largest voters which are unaffiliated voters and also majority republican support so while we have some elected officials who may be in denial the public is not and they are very clear about where we want to go and where they expect leadership to take us um and i think the other thing that we see in this is that all the things that dr white described those are going to fall most unfairly and with the most burden on communities of color um and we see it right now um people dying at disproportionate rates um in communities of color and so uh we were very happy to see that president biden um and i know congressman crow you're supporting this and senator bennett with the american jobs plan are really looking at a 40 commitment um to equitable use of the resources there to make sure that those communities not only face protections but also benefit from this transition there are massive benefits to this transition coming if we can do it fast enough and so i think the american jobs plan is a really important piece we really have two core values as we go forward on this the policy that we need to do needs to be enforceable if you run out the clock the time for just kind of see if it all works out and see if thing people will do things voluntarily we've run out the clock on that so policy needs to be enforceable to hit these climate targets and it needs to be equitable and happily there's strong public support for that and so i think the leadership that you all are showing the leadership from excel from the base from our elected officials the public is there with you you just have to stay the course and get it over the finish line against what is a very small and increasingly isolated um set of deniers thank you kelly i appreciate that um colonel campbell going to you you know uh mr bryan really set to set the table at the dod level in terms of the the d-cap the assessments you know uh assessing the situation uh you're responsible for buckley uh you know major uh miller translations have to go through a master planning process i think it's every five years and and that master plan has to look out ten years i believe get to project ten years and one of the things that um both dr white and uh mr brian mentioned was was water right and there's an attitude in colorado and in the west that whiskey's for drinking and waters for fighting and there's very few things that are more contentious than water in the west and i uh led along with congressman lamborn and i did a bipartisan water a bill last last cycle that actually passed with broad support an armed services committee to help us assess water issues uh in the west including buckley so looking at you know 10 years out how do you think your water needs and then you can touch on electricity as well but water in particular uh with a growth trajectory for buckley uh whether or not that's part of the master planning process uh thanks sir and yes we do we do look at water we do look at electricity i since i have been here i've not heard issues with uh potential growth or concerns of water consumption or lack thereof um but again i've been here a lot of months so so as we go through that process um yeah obviously as the climate changes and water becomes scarcer um then could it affect buckley yeah absolutely um i think for us right now i think electricity is more kind of a sailing point on how we how we support this alluded to right that our national mission that is zero fail and so so the interest in how do we support that how do we have redundancy uh because i would tell you that uh one of the things that is powerful and uh but but how do we do that and exile has been a great partner for us uh and i know we've had discussions i had discussions this week actually with uh the aerospace van facility uh here in colorado uh to talk about power because it's kind of we have to team up we have to come together to do that um so we do have a power uh gap i think for redundancy and resiliency where that comes from uh but also we've you know if you look at buckley there's there's a lot of land within the fence and i don't know if it's been really addressed yet uh and i apologize i just didn't have the corporate knowledge on the power situation as far as resilience and renewable energy what are we going to do how are we going to get after but i would tell you why why can't we you know have uh yes we would love to have an excel substitution on the installation absolutely that would be great because that would be a win for for the folks in your district because we would have to they would no longer have to share a substation with us we'd have our own dedicated substation so that would give more power back to your constituents but the other part of that is why are we looking at micro grids why are we not looking for solar farms why are we not looking at wind um and again there's always a mission we have to look at if it interferes with the mission then that's that's an issue um but but i haven't heard that talk in the 11 months but like i said we've got a lot of land on the east side of the base and so so is it possible that we could have you know use the visit program right our community infrastructure partner and and have that partnership with downtown the industry to come out and look at that and would that be a viable solution and then long-term 10 years down the road sir if you look at that where are the storage capacity batteries going to look like in 10 years and if if we have a solar farm in the battery better and we can store power not only can we use that to subsidize a substation which we would really love excel we would love that on this switch but but uh should we use that solar power and storage capacity as a subsidy to that or you know to help that and then does that then give us a capacity by 2030 to start getting off of fossil fuel vehicles getting onto electrical vehicles and then looking at how do we get infrastructure put in place by dsa or charging stations so that it's not you know so costly to the dod so i'm sorry i've been answering your water questions very well i'm just not that well versed on any water issue well we'll give you a one at least one year to get your feet on the ground before you dive into the water battles right well thank you colonel i appreciate that i want to be respectful but this was a great uh opportunity to come together and i know many of us could talk about this for days on end because there's just so many facets of the challenge but we will stay on time always argued about that uh so thank you to all of you for doing this this is a huge challenge and it's one that we have to get right uh there's just no other option uh too much is at stake and depending on it uh and i appreciate the leadership of everyone here helping us gather the information understand the problem uh do the research uh try to put that into effect uh build community coalitions uh secure our national defense development infrastructure and actually deliver the energy that all of you do and i do want to give a quick shout out to the team emma uh connor um rebecca veronica uh on team crow that helped put this together there's a lot of logistics moving parts and uh of course none of this happens without a great team making it happen so really appreciate that

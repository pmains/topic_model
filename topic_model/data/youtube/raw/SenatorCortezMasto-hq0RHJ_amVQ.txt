Thank You mr. chairman thank you for rescheduling this important hearing it's clear there were systemic failures of institutional culture that led our national amateur sports programs become a hunting ground for predators facilitating the appalling abuse of hundreds of children and young athletes it is absolutely critical that this body and the American public has the opportunity to hold to account the people responsible for these egregious failures it is equally important that we do not lose sight of our obligation to demand and implement reforms that will make real change and it is clear that the witnesses before today rightfully are no longer in a position to institute these needed reforms mr. Chairman I respectfully request that this subcommittee hold additional hearings with the new leadership of the u.s. Olympic Committee USA Gymnastics and other national governing bodies to provide continued congressional oversight to ensure that these institutions are fulfilling their legal their moral and ethical obligations to athletes their families and the American senator that is absolutely our intention for a hearing in the near future thank you I appreciate that mr. chairman last month we heard from several former Olympic athletes and I was struck by how many of them said that they felt that there was no one at USA Gymnastics to whom they could safely disclose the abuse they were suffering without fear of retaliation in fact miss race Minh and a miss dancer even noted that the so called athlete representative was a member of the team that decided which gymnast would compete in elite competition so miss fame in your opinion was there anyone in USA Gymnastics whose sole responsibility was to monitor the health safety and well-being of gymnast Thank You senator in regard to the athletes well-being safety I feel that it was absolutely everyone's duty my responsibility the athlete representatives responsive each and every individual coach it's everyone's responsibility in terms of the absolutely there is a definite conflict that was something that Deborah Daniels in her review noted that that that is certainly a conflict with the athlete representative also serving on the selection of teams and that was something after Deborah Daniels reviewed did come out we immediately changed that and brought on a second athlete representative that is solely there for the athletes needs and the cares and the communication do you think that in reform that we should be looking at athletes advocates that are specifically there independent of any oversight of us OSI or ng B's or anyone else and they're looking for these out for the specific goodwill excuse me the health and safety of the athletes themselves yes absolutely and do you think that would have benefited in the past and we would have had been able to protect these children much earlier much sooner yes I do and so that was lacking so let me just say this I also have concerns that not only did the administer USOC the governing boards and everyone else there failed these kids I've heard them you and I've had conversations in the past with them and heard the hearings but there was a lack of opportunity for them to even come forward to talk to anyone that they felt safe and one of the concerns that I have is the financial incentives the structure that's set up with you SoC and some of the governing boards so miss fame can I ask you this were you eligible to receive bonuses as part of your compensation during your respective ten years ten year within the USA Gymnastics not on the athlete performance now so yes you were eligible for bonuses yes and what was that based on it was based on the yearly review your performance alone yes was it based on an athlete obtaining medals no eating in any manner whatsoever no was there anybody within USA Gymnastics that had a bonus compensation package that was based on the success of an athlete fee they were privately contracted yes so yes there were some that had bonuses based on the success of an athlete not on the athlete but based on the success of the USA team and when you when you say success what does that mean a gold medal silver medal bronze medal what does that mean yes so they the bonus incentive was in essence if the USA team succeeded in getting in a medal and those around certain individuals would get a bonus so yes for example if if USA Gymnastics and it was also for the coaches of the individual athletes there was a bonus structure I believe I I'm sorry but I did not do the financials if there was depending on the be and the athletes also received the financial regarding there's just a it's called a bonus structure okay and and that's what I am trying to get to the bottom of if anybody received any financial compensation based on the success of an athlete really that would somehow inhibit their ability to look out for the best interests of the athlete and so what I'm hearing you say today that there's potential that some compensation was based on just that that an athlete's success somebody would obtain financial compensation if you know I don't want to if you know I I would I would rather at least do some research and respond to you in writing thank you you talked about reforms any additional reforms that you can suggest to this committee because I think the focus really now is to change that culture it is not just about education it is about changing a culture to protect these young athletes for the future so that God forbid we never ever see this type of systemic failure where we are actually a breeding ground for predators that are grooming not only these young athletes but taking advantage of them and financially exploiting them as well so let me ask you do you have any thoughts and additional reforms that we can take I felt immediately - even before anything was in any sort of written policy to quickly make as many changes as possible to help the safety of the athletes when we traveled internationally for the pack Rim Championships in Colombia we this is the first time we had a team a chaperone there and incorporated the parents in a whatsapp messaging system and they were a part of every step of the way as well as eliminating any one-on-one situations with the transportation policy from when the athletes landed at the airport to attending a training camp as well as instituting as many recommendations as quickly as possible from the Deborah Daniels report it was something when we traveled internationally to have what was called an athlete's recovery center that had massage tables something out in the open and making all of those changes that was the number one goal I was hoping for for a new training facility that was the best or top notch in terms of safety medical as well as security and nutrition and athlete development it was phenomenal and I think that's the very least that all of these athletes deserve thank you I know it's my time is up Thank You mr. chair

the White House once again blamed Republicans for skyrocketing prices price of oil is about 40 percent higher today than when Biden first took office joining me right now is North Dakota Senator Kevin Kramer he's a member of the armed services banking Veterans Affairs and environmental and Public Works committees Senator it's great to see you thanks very much for being here what do you say to Karine Jean-Pierre who answers Edward Lawrence with it's the Republicans fault well every day Maria that I watch her do her briefings I have some admiration for the fact that she's willing to stand out and talk talk to people who know a lot more about what she's talking about than she does and and still go to work all of that said economics 101. I mean that's what we're talking about we're talking about basic economics and to even still call that bill the the inflation reduction act knowing full well that what it did is fueled inflation demonstrates how desperate they are and but for talking points she couldn't talk at all I'm afraid anyway good on Ed to ask the question I spoke with your colleague Joe manchin on Sunday and he continues to say that the inflation reduction Act is reflation is reducing inflation and that it's a security an oil security bill and it's not a green agenda Bill what do you say well it's exactly a green agenda build there's nothing in there for oil I mean nothing in there that would help oil the the reason oil right now is so high price of course is because the administration and this President specifically has has made it more difficult to drill we should be we should be at about 15 million barrels per day in the United States of America we should be selling a lot more abroad to our friends in in Europe we should be the price maker not the price taker this spread between WTI and Brent could be avoided by the United States by the WTI being really the the index that that the world watches and I know there's going to be some um you know some bringing the bringing those two indexes together but really we we could be producing for the world that they should have be able to rely on us not have to rely on enemies and Frenemies if you will for for oil supply but it also raises the bigger point and that is this anytime Energy prices are high inflation will be high energy goes into everything we produce everything we manufacture everything we grow everything that's shipped you know everything in the supply chain Maria really inflation is largely driven by the price of of energy yeah and that's why this whole of government approach toward this climate change agenda is so troubling and you know I think the American people are on to this because now the Biden Administration apparently is quietly revising a federal database that now says that the number of unused and approved oil permits is actually less than six thousand uh 700 not the 9 000 as the president keeps touting you know he keeps saying and when he blames oil companies for the high price of oil it says oh it's we've got 9 000 leases out there and the oil companies aren't doing anything with it well I actually asked the chairman and CEO of Chevron Mike worth about this in December watch what he says about this so-called 9000 leases watch I don't know anything about this 9 000 lease number I I don't know where it comes from uh we don't have anything even approaching a fraction of that uh when we get a lease it just begins a process where we have to acquire a number of permits and as you know Senator your state is a an oil producing state it's the permitting process that is stopping uh more flow because of all of the bureaucracy and new regulations that Biden has put in place isn't that right that's exactly right particularly when you're talking about offshore and onshore you know Federal leases which North Dakota the heart of the Bakken is is federal land even though most of the Bakken is not fortunately for us but Mike worth as you know is not prone to exaggeration at all he is right down the middle guy and and gets it but this issue of applications for permits to drill on federal lands they have slow walked that to the point where you can hardly afford to go through the process plus you have many steps in the in the federal bureaucracy besides the Bureau of Land Management you end up with the Corps of Engineers EPA in some cases the United States Department of Agriculture if it's if it's Forest lands or grasslands and they have a lot of ways to slow this thing down but even on the the lease issue they're wrong the state of North Dakota was just in federal court last week or the week before suing over the um you know the the leases the the legally obligated leases that the that the uh the president has held up for for many quarters now so um they're talking out of you know well really I'd say both sides of their mouth except they're just basically telling lies yeah really interesting what has taken place all right Senator I want to get your take on your bill you have a fair access to Banking Act that you have been introducing and you know the Florida Bankers Association uh is pushing back on this Bill here's what um Alex Sanchez the president told me he says the bill by Senator Kramer requiring Banks to bank certain industries is wrong and troubling a bank should Bank customers based on its risk or business profile not on an order of the government we're going from one extreme to the other putting banks on par with Chinese these Banks where the government tells the banks who and who they should not bank so Senator what do you want to say about that because I think your intentions were to stop this industry from blowing off fossil fuel companies which of course is what the Biden Administration is trying to do but does this go a step too far please uh weigh in on what Sanchez is saying yeah I think Mr Sanchez is probably reading it just a little wrong my bill doesn't require anybody to bank anything what it does is it prohibits Banks from categorically discriminating against legal Commerce by industry groups in other words you can't just say we will not Bank anything any utility that uses coal generated electricity we will not will prohibit lending to a gun manufacturer or an ammunition uh you know sales a retailer because of the this one industry that's out of favor but it's legal Commerce and remembering these Banks aren't exactly on their own these are FDIC insured these are taxpayer-backed institutions and so they have an obligation I think not to to bank everything that I want them to bank but to do exactly what Mr Sanchez says and that is take a risk analysis loan by loan application by application not just kick an entire category out because there are disfavored uh you know group or disfavored industry by liberals well thank you that is a really a princess to that it makes total sense to say you can't just pick out the gun owners the groups the lobbying groups the you know the the fossil fuel groups and say we're not going to bank that whole group that that's different Senator we appreciate you explaining it and thanks very much for being here this morning always my pleasure thank you Maria all right we'll see you soon Senator Kevin Kramer joining us this morning in Washington

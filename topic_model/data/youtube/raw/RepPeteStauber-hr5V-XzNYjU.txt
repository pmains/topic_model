so to the four witnesses this is a map of Minnesota that says that a great part of Minnesota is covered I don't this map to me is not accurate there are there are places that are that say it's covered I know I've been there's not covered and so I think the the the accuracy is so important and that's why you bring from your business experience that rural mentality you bring part of the equation and part of the answer and I think a big part of the answer because we know that I'm not concerned so much in the metro or urban areas of the big places in Minneapolis or st. Paul or Rochester maybe or even in the center of Duluth which is a biggest city in district 8 in Minnesota the concern is you have the ability to help augment the map when it's wrong and and bring some solutions to us and I'm just before my time runs out I just want to tell you how much I appreciate your being here and that it matters your experience you have just as much knowledge and experience as some of the bigger companies and we need that and our goal is to invite you into that process as you said missus or the accuracy matter so and my time's running out I've run over Thank You mr. chair and I yield back

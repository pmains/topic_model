thank you mr chairman uh i appreciate your appearing here today thank you for joining us mr mosher i want to ask you a straightforward question based on your law enforcement experience at the treasury department if an investigator was forced to choose between investing or excuse me investigating an illicit finance case involving cash or digital assets which do you believe most would choose and why thank you for the question senator lemis i think there's no question and this is comes from time at the department of justice and also being the head of enforcement at ofac um it is far far faster to get to the critical point that you need to dig deeper with cryptocurrency given the nature of the public ledger this is for several reasons one you have a public immutable ledger so if you take the example of when ofac designates an address in within hours mathematical heuristics from chain analysis trm elliptic all these tools out there are quickly building out all the public ledger networks that are associated with that address through co-spending and other relatively mathematically certain ways of at least knowing what the association is in the fiat world you see an address and for the next three years you do mutual legal assistant treaties and hope that you get something back you guess what regional banks might be involved based on the customers you think it's going to be and send subpoenas and hope that they come back and then you manually try to associate addresses with entities it's it's just exponentially faster thank you um mr is it levin or levin um senator i respond to either but it's eleven eleven okay thank you chain analysis found that approximately point one five percent of all digital asset transactions were related to illicit finance in 2021 is that correct yes 0.15 yes the united nations recently estimated that money laundered in the traditional financial system is between 800 billion and 2 trillion in u.s dollars a year so how does that compare with uh digital assets thanks senator so just to put the like for like comparison it's important to look at the percentages as estimates and so you know in the traditional uh financial sector and the oecd and imf and others um you know estimate somewhere between two to five two to five percent of world you know financial flows are related to money laundering and illicit flows you know comparing that to the 0.15 when it comes to uh cryptocurrencies so clearly cryptocurrencies have a smaller uh illicit use than fiat currencies yes that's correct okay now is is mr chobanian online oh excellent uh i have a question hi mr giovanni and i i so appreciate your being here i want to ask you about the record sums of money that the people of the world have donated to you crane using digital assets over the last few weeks how long did it take for you to set up the infrastructure to begin accepting donations and how long does it take for the ukrainian government to begin to use those donations thank you so the setup was about 10 minutes uh the the the hardest part was to actually put the addresses on the twitter through because we had to go through the bureaucracy of who is in charge of a twitter account of ukraine and in terms of usage the uh the minute the crypto landed on these addresses the government could use them so immediately no bureaucracy here so how long and how burdensome would it have been for you to accept donations using traditional forms of payment from other countries including wire transfers um if i can remember and recall correctly i think it took a national bank about ten days to uh post the iban and the the rest of the correspondent address is needed to wire the money into ukraine so digital assets have made an important difference to the defense of ukraine is that true i can answer it differently uh we actually received the first humanitarian aid on the second day after received the first crypto so we spend it immediately and next day the goods were in ukraine less than 24 hours is that the answer that is the answer and i i'm so pleased you were willing to take the time to be us today with us today because well a lot of attention has been paid here in congress to uh whether the russians could use digital assets to evade sanctions there's been very little attention paid to how much the existence of digital assets have benefited the ukrainians in being able to get badly needed supplies so i'm deeply grateful to all of our witnesses today thank you very much mr chairman i yield back

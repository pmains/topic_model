Americans deserve to have a tax code that respects and rewards hard work the current system though is failing middle-class families and stifling economic growth for too many people it's difficult to make ends meet let alone protect a lifetime of savings the tax cut plan proposed today stays true to our goal of giving Americans more take-home pay and unleashing job creators and innovators if we can deliver on these tax cuts I believe we're going to give a jolt to the economy the likes of which we have not seen in more than a decade so I'm eager to roll up my sleeves working nights upon if necessary working weekends if necessary to get this bill to the President's desk

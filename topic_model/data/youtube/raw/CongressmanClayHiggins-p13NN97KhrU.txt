all right let's welcome in our panel of lawmakers Louisiana Congressman clay Higgins and North Carolina Congressman Dan Bishop who are both members of the House Homeland Security committee gentlemen welcome to the show Congressman Bishop I'll start with you because we had James Rosen just mention it there we had the ranking member on the house Intel committee Congressman Jim Hines he was on Meet the Press yesterday talking about he originally got this great briefing about the first initial spy balloon but since then it's essentially been crickets listen to this I have real concerns about why the administration is not being more forthcoming with everything that it knows there may be reasons for it but and maybe it's because I'm in politics and so spend a lot of time talking to folks in grocery stores and Town Hall meetings you know in an absence of information people will fill that Gap with anxiety and other stuff so I wish the administration was a little quicker to tell us everything that they do know Congressman are you satisfied with what the White House has been forthcoming about Lindsay I think they could say more probably they need to get I think the uh the Administration has been caught flat-footed with the entire situation if you kind of put two and two together you it appears they're starting to look for things with the technology they have available that they've not been looking for before I've not received a full briefing I've received some secondhand information but but I I think that yes I think the American people are going to sort of uh you know be inclined to flights of imagination until the administration explains what we've uh encountered and what sort of intelligence or what sort of threat to the Homeland they represent and in due course I expect our committee to be briefed on that as well Congressman hagas where is the line because obviously some of this stuff is Intel and you know where's the line between what American people should know and trying to keep our information secretive that should be secretive I mean I think about kind of the stuff that's happening around us all the time we don't know about to keep Americans safe well the Biden Administration Sterling needs to be more uh aware of the American citizens need to know on the on the basis of what has already been made obvious by the Americans uh own observations and by media reports the Dubai Administration continually leading from behind America needs to be reassured that our airspace is secure and and President Biden has not has not managed to reassure this early in my constituents and and likely uh you hear the same story across the country it's it's it's not intellectually sound who believe that that American Military might is incapable of securing American airspace against balloon it it's insane to think that that we're having this conversation right now I mean the Japanese bloated thousands of balloons across the Pacific in World War II this is not a this is not a new thing but it seems to be that that that that that President Abiding and his senior people are responding politically as opposed to strategically uh and that and that's that's the biggest uh complaint and you know Congress we should be briefed directly not not through the media and not by uh by press conference yeah I couldn't agree with that one more I will say Congressman Bishop at the end of the day obviously China's paying attention to this we don't know where all these other UFOs are from specifically we do know the first balloon was a Chinese balloon but how concern should we be about the Optics that this shows Congressman Bishop to China and what they are how they're seeing us handle this right now well certainly as to the first balloon Lindsay and I wouldn't be surprised if we learn as to the others China is testing the United States probing our ability to control our own Skies to otherwise defend ourselves and we need to be aware of that we need to be concerned about it we need to be more Vigilant I think we need to have some after action consideration of why the military didn't you know has been tolerating or sort of letting things like this slide under the radar so to speak but we have similar problems those Clay is well aware on our Southern border if we have thousands of of sorties flown by drones every six months and uh and tens of thousands and and we have not seen the Department of Homeland Security you know fundamentally take those things down representative Higgins and I've been asking questions about that for some time and we'll continue to to so I think we can't afford to have these kinds of uh sort of a porous uh defense for the United States Homeland and everybody's focused on it now let's see what the administration has to say about it in due course yeah everyone is focused on we've had so many members of Congress dozens actually um speak up because DirecTV has dropped Newsmax from his channel lineup Congressman Higgins I just want to get your standpoint on their behavior well you know that negotiation largely has to happen in private between the the top guys at Newsmax and uh ATT DirecTV I would like to see them come to the table in a reasonable Manner and and aren't out there problems and I encourage them to do exactly that and I'm doing what I can back channel to make that happen but but the larger picture is that we are very focused on responding to the internal threat to First Amendment rights of expression that where we have witnessed the conservative voice be oppressed by big Tech so I'm I'm hopeful that that's not the case here and I'm encouraging uh the the top Executives at ATT and DirecTV to come to the table with Newsmax and and get them properly paid and back on the air we appreciate that Congressman Bishop I mean 13 million homes now don't have access to Newsmax have you heard anything from your constituents being concerned oh yes I've heard I've heard a great deal of of people who are DirecTV customers and they're extremely upset about losing that access my household has been a DirecTV customer and I had occasion to tell someone myself in Washington just a few days ago that unless that situation resolved I won't be a customer any longer I've got to hear I've got to be able to have access to Newsmax it's an important voice uh in the daily public dialogue and and so as clay said I agree looking forward to this getting resolved well we appreciate your voice on it and your concern and for being our viewers as well thank you for your Insight uh into this Bible and I know many people the Americans are concerned about it so we'll have to have you back as soon as you have more information but thanks for your time tonight thank you Lindsay yes ma'am

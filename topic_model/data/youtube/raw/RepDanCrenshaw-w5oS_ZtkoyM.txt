we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we old we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw welcome back everybody greatest podcast ever um i am here very honored to have uh sema verma with uh sema thank you so much for being on my pleasure thanks for inviting me on the best best podcast ever it is the best a lot of people say so um but that's not what we're here to talk about we're here to talk about medicaid mostly we'll talk about some medicare too but i know your ex your expertise is certainly in medicaid and um it's a hot topic for a number of reasons uh let me let me tell the audience a little bit of your background and why you are so uh infinitely qualified to be speaking on this subject uh you were you were the administrator of the centers for medicare medicaid services which is cms from 2017 to 2021 longest tenure in modern history i wonder why that could you just take the job longer like you know what is uh everybody's does everybody just burn out of that or what goes on there yeah no i don't know i mean for me i just wanted to get a lot of stuff done and so you know you need time to be able to do that most people are probably you know year and a half two years since the average tenure yeah and you oversaw a budget of 1.3 trillion dollars which is a third of the federal budget um health insurance programs for over 140 million americans and managed over 6 000 employees it's a pretty intense job so you see those kind of numbers maybe it's it's not so uh it's not so crazy that there's high turnover um before that you're the architect of the healthy indiana plan uh served as a healthcare administrator under both governor mcdaniels and governor mike pence in indiana so um we're going to get into some details i think on medicaid policy but like not not everybody listening to the podcast has some uh wonky policy background and cms uh you know myself included i'm learning but uh we need to start from the beginning what the heck is medicaid and why is it designed the way it is how did it how did it originate what was the intent of it when did it originate how does it differ how is it different from how other countries approach it and what are some of the variations between states so maybe let's just start with real broad strokes so basic programming everybody's probably heard more about the medicare program right which serves elderly people over 65 well the same time that medicare was created medicaid was also a new program at that time and the idea was to take care of what i would say the medically needy the aged blind disabled population so um the poor age-blind and disabled population so as you can imagine you know folks that are paraplegics or severely disabled medicaid is is the pair that usually steps in for those individuals over time we've seen this the medicaid program grow and grow it has now grown to pregnant women um also with through the chip program its children's health insurance and then with the affordable care act it's now also taking care of adults as well it is a joint federal state program so whereas the medicare program is run entirely by the federal government this is a joint program and depending on the wealth of the state um they're contributing funds towards their population or their medicaid program so in some states it may be 30 40 and in some cases it's as high as 50 percent and that's a really important point because it's jointly funded by the state and federal government where the federal government is matching what the state puts into it and so you have a joint management of the program um because of its structure this is a real important point you know you put in one dollar you get three so over time you can imagine states sort of looked at this as wow this is an opportunity to bring revenue into into our state um and it's grown it is now the number one or number two budget item in every state so it's a massive program it's become really expensive and as it's grown you've seen the federal government respond to that by having more and more oversight of the program yeah that's for sure so every state manages its own program within some parameters set by federal law right and you guys the regulatory body and cms and it's grown to the number one number two budget in america fundamentally what it is though it's a reimbursement program it is reimbursing so so a patient or a person because it so it used to be a patient and it's important to distinguish between these two terms it used to be a disabled person that's how the program was intended it has become you know because it's easy for politicians to promise more more things so well what if we get kids on it what if we put um our impoverished population on it uh we have this program where we're giving things away so let's just add more people to it and um turns out there'll be our voters afterwards anyway that's the cynical side of me thinking politically but that's how it's evolved over over time and so it's evolved from being from disabled patients to just being persons uh on it and it's a reimbursement so a person is is enrolled in the program uh and and then they and then they get a network of doctors associated with that who actually will take medicaid dollars not all doctors do because it does reimburse less than what they would otherwise get from insurance so that's and that's a problem we might dive into here or it's a problem i don't know if it's a problem it's a fact it's just a it is a fact we must deal with um and it's and so and then medicaid agrees to reimburse for those services now that's a that's a sort of uh government reimbursement model fee for service model is there how do other countries do this a lot of people talk about that the medicare for all group calls you know looks to canada and the uk is their sort of favorite the uk is more like a giant va um canada is more like a medicare for all maybe you maybe agree disagree with that and then a lot of european countries have a lot of mixes of all of these healthcare plans just maybe talk us through you know how we ended up with that with that situation is it the most optimal um how does it compare to other countries what can we learn from other countries and how can we modern how can we let's talk about modernizing our own system sure so i mean if you think about it to some degree we have a single payer at two ends of the spectrum over 65 right governments paying your bills and for very low income and vulnerable populations the government's paying your bills and i think that's an important point right it's kind of a health financing organization right as opposed to somebody that's really thinking about outcomes um what i think medicaid has lacked is accountability in the program right i mean states can just spend right there's no accountability in terms of the quality or the outcomes are we actually improving somebody's health are we actually making a difference are we just sort of paying the bills without any expectation of outcomes um and i think you know the points that you made are spot on which is that medicaid has become it's a pretty cheap program and the reason why it's inexpensive is that they don't pay the doctors very well or the providers inside the program it's usually considered the lowest payer so you have a lot of providers out there that say we can't afford to see a medicaid patient it doesn't really meet our cost model so then all of those people that are on the program they have access issues and so we know you know some data's been out there that says 30 percent of doctors won't even take a medicaid patient and so that becomes problematic for those individuals because where do they go access is limited um and i think that's a really important point as we are talking about putting more people on this program to some degree you're really hurting the disabled people and the people that it was intended for because now there's you know fewer doctors for people to see and so i think one of the things that we haven't quite built into the medicaid program is the quality and the accountability you've seen some states trying to build that in at the provider level there you know a lot of states are now contracting with private organizations and things like that to run the program to build more accountability but i think at the end of the day taxpayers have to say what value are we getting out of the medicaid program right we're spending all this money it's crowding out funding for schools and infrastructure and all these other things we're spending this money what are our citizens getting you know are is their health being approved um do they have access to care is it good quality care i think that that's one of the structural changes that should happen in the medicaid program so i mean i think democrats would just say well why don't we just make reimbursement uh payments higher and and then and then solve that problem that way of course that's that seems to that that's something that might happen with medicare because it's entirely funded by the federal government because it's a mix of state and federal and states do have to have actually think about a budget the way that the federal government should but does not um is that what prevents it from spiraling from the from those prices the states control the rates and they can pay what they can afford to pay and so a lot of them which you'll see when state budgets you know and as you know they fluctuate there's good times and bad times but during bad times a lot of states will say we want to cut the medicaid reimbursement rates um and so that's usually their lever and there's not a lot of not always not saying all the time there's not always a lot of creativity about how do we increase quality um how do we reduce costs yeah and when you're adding more people and you're expanding when people say expand medicaid what they mean is they're just adding more people to the population that's enrolled in the program and um and so an already an already finite number of doctors who will tech take medicaid becomes even harder for those patients to access those doctors right and let me give you another example and this really played out with covet so what most people don't know is that you know we talked about medicaid's coverage of the age aged blind disabled but the disabled and aged population many of them are served in nursing homes or long-term care facilities medicaid is actually the number one payer in nursing homes and long-term care facilities and we saw how you know how difficult it was for nursing homes during covid many people died unfortunately and it really brought the issue of quality in nursing homes right and a lot of that came back to you what you hear from nursing homes is they're operating on these razor thin margins especially those that are serving large numbers of medicaid populations they can't afford to attract the type of workforce that you need to be able to ensure that you're adhering to all those infection control practices and so that lack of investment by medicaid into reimbursement for nursing homes i think had a big impact on what happened with coven so so yeah and and it's easy to say well we should increase reimbursement but that that because of the the cost sharing with states that would have to come with the raising of revenue from the state level too right and and you know states are all i think it's important to say it is the number one number two budget item so you're competing against education and infrastructure and safety and all those different things for a state i mean they're struggling to pay for it what i think is also really important is the economic outcome outlook for medicaid is very concerning because you have the baby boomers that are that are aging and they're going into nursing homes and nursing homes are the most expensive wine item you have and so that you know the projections by 2030 2050 is that the expenditures for medicaid can actually double by that point if you look at the medicaid actuaries report you know this this program is only going to get more expensive and so one of the arguments for expanding medicaid is that you get people access to care that they otherwise wouldn't have maybe they don't get it through their employer so we're talking about the individual market here and as a result they uh they get preventative medicine they get more access and so don't have long-term health issues so we save money in the long run does that does it really play out that way does that matter i don't think that we have long-term studies right that being said i mean clearly um if you're sick you have a health issue having health care is going to be better for you to be able to have that access to preventative care um if you have a chronic disease i mean if you're sick definitely having medical medical care is better for you and having access and being able to choose providers that are going to give you high quality care is important i think the issue with medicaid and medicaid expansion is that you know from where i sit there's value to people having health care my question is is medicaid really the best way to to take care of these individuals is it the best program medicaid was built for the age blind and disabled a lot of the policies are geared towards them in terms of cost sharing you know we can't maybe expect a quadriplegic who's not working to make a contribution towards their their healthcare they don't have those resources somebody who is an able-bodied individual maybe they are working it's it should be a you know a different set of dramatic rules it's two different populations and i don't think that medicaid was necessarily designed for that population i you know it's i think that and i think this creates some societal resentment too the the idea that you know you work hard for your job you work hard for for your private health insurance then you see somebody who's able-bodied but but can you can use medicaid when that was intended for the disabled and again it doesn't mean we're not looking for ways to to provide access to care through for the impoverished let's call it the able-bodied poor because i think there's some societal value in doing so the question is how we do it and um and so okay so then let's talk about that a little bit and and modernizing it uh talk to us about the the discussions and and what these and let's define the terms of of value-based care versus fee for service and what the current situation is with medicare and medicaid and how maybe we would like to see it if you had all the power in the world and you could wave magic wands well and you know you bring up a good point because i do think there's still societal value to ensuring that people have access to health care right and we've all heard some of the horror stories of people that are uninsured um but if we look at the underlying issue the underlying issue is affordability that's why people don't have health care because they can't afford it and so when i always get concerned about when i hear about proposals that say well let's just expand medicaid or expand coverage because all we're saying is let's throw some government money at the problem and as you know okay you'll solve that problem for those people but if healthcare is just getting more and more expensive you're just moving the problem more and more people are going to have to go on to government-run healthcare because the costs become are still high and if you're not able to lower them ultimately you know more and more people aren't going to be able to afford it so i think it's very important that we focus on how do we lower the cost of care and that was something um when i was with the administration the trump administration that's what our focus was because to me if we start solving some of the underlying problems in our health care system and what's driving up the cost then we're going to actually improve accessibility and affordability you asked about value-based care which i think is a really important part of a solution going forward right now the more the way most payers most providers are paid is what we call the fee for service system right so you go in and you your labs and you see the doctor you get um an x-ray or surgery and everything's paid by you know everything that you do so i mean you can kind of think about it there's a perverse incentive right because the sicker you are and the more services you need um the more uh the the health care system the more money that a hospital is going to make so there's an economic incentive to do more in a value-based system we say let's turn that around and let's pay you to keep me healthy and to keep me out of the hospital and so instead of just paying you for everything that we do we're gonna assess the relative risk of the patient and give you you know essentially a budget or amount of money to manage so you know now you can see some investments and hey it may make sense for us to um send a nurse out to your home or for example covet's a great example cms just moved to say you know for some people that haven't gotten vaccinated we'll actually send somebody out to your home and give you your shot because you know it may actually be over the long term more cost effective to do that than to have you hospitalized for covid so it actually has the provider thinking about what innovative things can i do to keep this patient healthy um so if you're paying somebody a fixed amount they may say you know john over there uh is is homeless and we need to figure out we had it how to get him into a home because that's actually contributing to why he's always showing up in the emergency room three times in a week and so it really has providers look at the whole person and think about how do we keep this person healthy they're now incentivized to lower costs and it's not just about cost they are actually paid for better outcomes if they can show better quality um they're paid for that so you know i think this is something that's been a bipartisan issue it's it's been the obama administration the trump administration even the bush administration people have been working on this concept and trying to implement it where we pay providers differently i think that has a real promise of better quality better outcomes and lower costs for the country working out for a long time but we're not there yet was the private insurance industry closer to that do they talk the same conversation they've been doing a lot of it um you know in my view it's probably not moving fast enough medicare is very influential in the space they've been working on it i think it i think as a country we need to accelerate it because a lot of providers don't want to do it a lot of it's voluntary and so you know quite frankly for providers it may be more comfortable maybe easier to be in a fee-for-service system and so i think unless we start pushing at it with our public programs as well as our private programs we're not going to see the type of momentum we really need because if you think about it you know in terms of controlling costs in this country we're not going to ration care right you don't want to say well we're not going to provide this we're not going to find out like a lot of socialized um countries that that have socialized medicine that's sort of their response right we're going to ration care you know you don't get to have um you know this surgery or this treatment so these are alternatives um to that type of approach to lowering costs yeah and it's important to note that in the fee for service system it it does it it does create a situation where yeah you can say that you have access to a doctor but that doctor can only see so many patients right and they have to make and they and they're gonna and they have to choose between a medicaid patient and a full price paying patient they're always they're gonna have to choose that full price paying patient just for their own and you can call them a bad person all you want it doesn't change the fact that they have expenses too and you know the alternative very very very well be um that doctor just doesn't go into practice at all right and then you have even less doctors you know it's it's a what covet brought what i thought was interesting about covet statistics was when we were all freaking out about icu bets around the world how many icu bets do we have per capita like everybody knows that statistic now and um we have a lot more is the answer we have way way more per capita than all these other developed countries you know uk canada and that's because we just you know we pay a lot more but we also have a lot more it doesn't make it perfect um but but getting you know making it more perfect would be for instance going to this value based system i kind of um i want to talk more about that and how that relates to direct primary care but let's talk a sticky subject in texas uh the texas medicaid expansion it this is a hard one to to unpack uh you'd probably be really well suited to um help us unpack it help the audience understand what texas does differently with medicaid we are not an expansion state and um and so democrats just say well you're just leaving money on the table because obamacare said they would reimburse 90 and we're like well it's still 10 that's still a big it's still a big chunk of change but you know that's a hard argument to to debate because it does feel like free money now of course it's not but that's a that's a bigger subject about federal debt um and they say it's just money left on the table texas does it a little bit differently though through 1115 waivers could you help us understand what exactly that means sure so a couple things the term waiver just means like we i think you sort of reference that the federal government has these rules and if you want to do something different outside the rules you you come and ask for a waiver waivers are very common pretty much every state in the country has some type of a waiver in so texas used to run the state used to run the medicaid program a long time ago and then they went to manage care where they actually contract with private entities to run the program and that move actually created a lot of savings and so texas sort of said to the federal government well you know we still want to keep that money in our system we're providing you know better care lower cost quality we want to be able to keep those dollars in the system and so they created what we call uncompensated care pools so these aren't necessarily people that are you know on the medicaid program but we know because texas is a is a border state right they have a lot of undocumented individuals coming in um people come into the emergency room and hospitals by law are have to treat whoever comes into the emergency room so i think it's important to know texas has some very unique circumstances and those individuals may or may not be on medicaid so they had a lot of uncompensated care so texas said to the federal government can we use the savings that we are you know gleaning through these managed care programs and can we create uncompensated care pools for our hospitals and we can you know pay them because they're seeing uninsured individuals and um and and medicaid's also not a great payer so can we also provide um some additional funding to them so that was sort of the deal um that texas has had and because of that you know it's possible that texas has said you know we're not interested in medicaid expansion because we have these uncompensated care pools that are helping to pay for our uninsured when it comes to medicaid expansion i'll be the first one to say you know to me it's a state decision every state has to assess their situation what they think is going to work best and part of that assessment is the finances of it right with the uncompensated care pools it's a fixed amount texas knows exactly how much money they need to put into the program to draw down those federal dollars in a medicaid expansion it's kind of a one-for-one whoever signs up you have to pay for it right it's a it's an open-ended entitlement right so if 100 people show up you got to pay for that if it's a thousand people that show up you have to pay for that when you also do a medicaid expansion you're also paying for emergency services only for the undocumented as well so it's a it's a big financial consideration for states how are they going to pay for it and how are they going to pay for it over the long term because by having it you may actually increase the volume or encourage um you know some more spending in this area so that's why i think it's it's a tricky issue and texas is different from other states because they have had these uncompensated carefuls yeah that's interesting and is that um are you familiar with harris health and the sit how it works here um and that's that's sort of our low income health care system at the county level there's lbj hospital it's you know primarily for for low income it's it i don't know if you know much about that program if you want to describe how the medicaid dollars sort of fit into that yeah i think that's part of the low the uncompensated care pools my guess is that's how they're getting funded right um you know the money is is is flowing through the uncompensated care pools to the to the county level to be done and i think that's right you know it's it allows these hospitals to stay afloat to maintain quality of care because they're seeing medicaid patients for sure but they're also getting that additional money and that's different than 340b program right the 340b program is a drug program it's basically giving for those institutions that are taking care of a lot of low-income medicaid uninsured individuals the federal government gives them discounts for the medications that they provide so you know for a safety net provider they're taking money from a lot of different areas some of it comes from the uncompensated care pool drug discounts medicaid so their funding comes from a lot of different places um okay so back to value-based care and i'm a big fan of of trying to transition us to um a system where the patient is empowered with these dollars you know i always point out that look let's agree that people need health care the same way that we agree that people need food and uh but we what we don't do is say hey go grocery shopping and then go to the checkout counter and some third party will will build a grocery store be billed by the grocery store for whatever you take out that would be a weird way for us to deliver food uh instead we give people basically a voucher in a form of a food stamp now food is obviously far less complicated than health care but but it but the incentive structure could be the same empowering the patient with with dollars and you know looking at ways to have the money follow the person similar to um past programs with with disabled people and looking at ways to uh we're looking at ways legislatively to transfer that over to primary care i think everything hinges on primary care when people talk about oh we don't know who our doctors are everything's so confusing it's because america has basically lost their relationship with the primary care doctor a lot of people just don't even know who it is like do i call if i'm sick do i call a doctor do i call my insurance company like how does this even work it's very confusing system because you got to make sure the insurance approves approved and all this so um direct primary care is something i i tend to like a lot it works pretty well in the houston area it's expanding quite a bit um and it's it's essentially a subscription just for the audience you know what it is it's a subscription um based model where you have a doctor you pay that doctor on average about 75 a month so we're talking a cell phone bill we're talking a gym membership and that's total access for primary care a lot of lab work you know there's things included in that it's not necessarily insurance and it needs to be distinguished from that uh for for you know breaking your leg or getting a bad car accident i mean different different treatments are are not held under primary care but is there a way um or do you foresee a future where we eventually start transitioning those dollars to the people so they can choose and then it's not just because i philosophically like the idea of choice it's because that's how you make the market work better and uh and keep costs down um and and while also keeping quality up there's a reason for it it's not just ideological yeah i think that i agree with you i think direct primary care um is a great model and it's actually very consistent with value-based care right so if you think about actually during my tenure at cms we created new models um where we would pay primary care doctors and just take what we call total risk total cost of care um and so it's the primary care practitioner that's sort of in charge they're coordinating your care and we gave them incentives to try to lower that total cost of care they obviously had to meet you know these objectives around quality so i think these models where we're paying more to the primary care doctor is really important and and very um promising what's interesting in the private model in the private market with direct primary care which i think is fascinating and i love this part of them is they also have built in a lot of price transparency right so you may come in for a subscription your general subscription but then they'll say if you need lab services or you need this this is what the cost is and i love that model right because you're picking but you also the consumer is cost conscious because they can see what everything is going to cost um that's why you know we work so hard on price transparency with the trump administration and really pushed in some landmark regulations because i do think that patients have to be a part of lowering costs and improving quality it's it's bringing those market-based principles where people are choosing providers based on cost and quality i think that concept of direct primary care absolutely people should be thinking about that for medicaid right i mean not why not give a capitated payment to a primary care provider and do that through medicaid unite there are some models out there if they want to say maybe north carolina they've done some of this and they've actually had great results um because they developed that relationship with the patient they understand some of the other social determinants like we talked about you know whether it's housing or food or some of those other issues where the doctor's relationship with the patient is deeper and they have a better understanding and a better way of managing the patient's care yeah and is there is there a vision that we can get to i think republicans have to offer a vision for health care right and then don't use uh scary things scary terminology like repeal and replace because that makes people think right that sounds like a bat to the system because it maybe it was um you know i think we need to provide a vision that's simple and easy for people to understand and then an honest 10-year glad path to that system right legislative legislatively speaking um and again i you know i'm just kind of bouncing ideas off you here but you know i think that vision should be patient empowering the patient with those dollars through an hsa account i'm oversimplifying things drastically of course empowering patients patients who cannot pay for it otherwise through an hsa account means tested and allow that patient to buy into a direct primary care provider of their choice you know go go on that app go on an a app and put in your zip code and you can choose and then that primary care provider is your quarterback and the need for a quarterback cannot be overstated who you know that doctor helps you then choose your insurance what's the right insurance plan for you and and then the third thing would be to you know how do we talk about the really catastrophic care i mean i think like 85 of of america's healthcare health costs are for chronic illnesses chronic care the the the nursing home costs that you talked about i guess that would be all kind of falls into the same category because age i suppose it's a chronic condition it's not going away um so you know the reinsurance models uncompensated care models at the at the state level seem to be a good model to deal with those costs and also which keeps premiums down on the uh on the private insurance side that's complicated but like i don't know that it's easier to i don't think you can simplify it much more without being dishonest no and and i think those are i think those are some reasonable and great proposals you know what i think that i think there was sort of a messaging or communications issue during the the debate about health care in in 2017 right a little bit that's maybe an understatement but you know it's like i kept like we're not against health care we're not trying to take people's health care away right i mean we just hate it we just hate all this health care we don't like the structure of obamacare right and we said yeah it's taking care of these people but it's actually increased the price prices have gone up 100 200 in some areas of the country so you've helped these people but now you've made health care worse for these folks over here so um you know to me i think this country has to solve the cost crisis in healthcare one of the things that i think is really important is putting patients and doctors in charge you know that's important in terms of decision making the other piece of it is we have to we have to bring back the free market to health care you know the the free market or market-based principles for every other sector has brought down um cost and improved quality that to me can happen in healthcare but we have to be able to make some of the changes to have that happen first off is price transparency you know if people can't shop around for healthcare when they don't know what things are going to cost they don't know what the quality is the second thing is we have to make sure that there is fair competition in our country um around health care services you know medicare pays more to hospitals than it does to a surgery center for the exact same procedure and some of that's warranted because hospitals have a higher level of acuity in terms of the patients that they serve and they have more regulatory requirements um but you know if you think about a doctor's visit you know if you're in a hospital hospital outpatient visit medicare will pay more to the doctor because they're in the hospital outpatient versus just a normal doctor's office and what we've seen is the formation of a lot of monopolies across the health care system where hospitals are buying up physician practices those are the kinds of things that are contributing to increasing our car our cost of health care look at drug pricing you know we've seen and it's the issue in drug pricing is the part d program in medicare works really well premiums have gone down every year at least the time that i was there but in the part b program the government's saying we're paying for the cost of drug plus a percentage so there's an incentive for drug prices to go up so i mean i think it's a broad-based look at the policies that we have especially in the medicare program that are that are decreasing competition so we need to empower patients with information cost and quality so they can make better decisions and we need to create a framework of competition in the in the marketplace um so that providers are delivering as you said value-based care better care lower costs and patients are making are empowered to make decisions based on those two factors and maybe we'll continue down this this thread because we haven't really talked about medicare but if we're talking about drivers of the debt medicare is number one by far away yeah medicare together yeah the health care costs in general uh are primarily what's driving our debt social security obviously a problem too um but it's it's not a runaway problem also mathematically much easier to solve if we just make some mildly hard decisions uh much harder to solve the the healthcare problem because you do have to fix the price problem first and and there's like and i think what the left misses in this debate is you can you can fix the price problem by by price setting which which other or socialized medicine countries do sure you could but then you'll have no more things things in this case meaning new drugs uh more doctors more hospitals new innovation new new uh medical devices because what would be the incentive to even make those things and um and then you know they might they might flail and say well the government will make it and it's like no no so stop um it won't happen yes nih does provide a lot of funding but people don't realize that funding is for basic research and then that basic research takes billions of dollars to to commercialize and so you know a lot a lot of things swept under the rug in the in the in the nice sounding medicare for all debates medicare for all fundamentally just price settings like that's how you control medicare medicare is the price it's a price setter that's what they do instead of letting doctors compete on the basis of cost and quality right and that's the way to relax and and i don't know where i'm going with this ramble but well i'm trying to set a stage here uh for for people listening and then ask you okay given given this this runaway costs that are occurring even with the price setting um you know because the price setting is still like you said it is still a percentage so that incentive is in there to keep hiking up prices um how do we modernize medicare is it the same discussion of value-based care that we're having with medicaid that's that that's that's exactly what i think the way medicare does price setting and you know as the administrator i was there for for almost four years and every year we put out a set of rules and say you know this is how much we're going to pay for these services and when i would get the memo it would say non-decisional because congress is actually built in increases into these programs every year so it's like every year we're going to increase what doctors are getting or hospitals getting so it's like you have this fee structure and then it's built in these increases instead of letting the market dictate what the costs are going to be this is why i think it's important again to go to value-based care right because if you go to value-based care we are now paying doctors um based on what they produce or or their cost and quality you know if you're going to go pick a doctor um don't you want to know who does the best job at the at what price i mean that's that's how we make decisions about everything else in our lives don't we want to be able to do that in healthcare i think if you move to that system where you know a doctor can say okay well i can do open heart surgery and it's not going to work in every case right if you're in an emergency that's not going to work but you know a lot of health care isn't just delivered in the emergency room so it could be um you know if you have diabetes or some heart disease the doctor can say i'm gonna manage your care this is the cost and these are the outcomes that i produce that i think actually puts you know it's bringing market-based principles to healthcare then doctors are competing on price and they're competing on quality i was yelling at my dogs but i muted myself no worries it could have been uh so joe biden wants to you know he's not a medicare for all guy but he says why don't we but a lot of democrats who who don't go full medicare for all say but we should expand medicare for all by changing the the age um from what is it 65 down to 55 or 50. i mean there's really no limiting principle to what they're saying and like cynically i think it's just forever they just want to keep going but what would that do if today you said it's 55 what what challenges do we face well couple things the first most important thing i think for every american to recognize is we can barely afford the public programs that we have today right we just had a good discussion about medicaid number one number two budget item in medicare you know you have the medicare trustees that look at the finances of the program we all pay taxes throughout our lives to pay for medicare as you know and they look at the numbers and they're warning us a couple years in a row medicare will be insolvent by you know it's changed the date it's gotten closer and closer i think the new dates 25 26. that's right around the corner so you know medicare's a great program it does a good job of serving the people that are on the program there's definitely some issues with it but my first question is to people that say that is who is going to pay for how are we going to pay for this as a country we cannot afford we're barely affording the program that we have right now so that's why i think it's important that we have to solve the underlying issues in healthcare what is driving up the cost if you start to solve that healthcare becomes more affordable and then people don't need the government to step in and pay for their care because it's more affordable so i think those solutions are you know they're half baked because all they're saying is let's throw more government money at the program let's pay for these people's health care but it's not solving the problem of why health care in america is so expensive it's a very dishonest offering of services with the implication that there's no trade-offs which is a just a classical populist uh political tool and i think i think generally like i think the right is flirting with populism in a bad way but the left has always done populism and uh that's what it is what does it mean it's just hey i'm gonna tell you what you're feeling which is that somebody's hiding these nice things from you and if only they weren't so corrupt we could just give it to you and that's sort of the implication with this hey you know what we could do is just make make the age different i mean come on guys um like as if there's no trade-offs there's always trade-offs so okay affordability would be one would there would there be a would you would you see a similar problem that you've seen with medicaid which is you continue to expand the population it makes yeah that's more difficult i think the other thing and like i said i i was at medicare the longest um one of the things i think it's really important to note with the medicare program it's a government program and i'll give you when the government's running things things take longer innovation takes longer you know a great example of this is telehealth right at this point we've all heard about how important and valuable telehealth was during the pandemic and i think people appreciate that it could have a role to play in healthcare people in rural areas mental health services so telehealth wasn't new right it was always out there um but guess what the medicare program didn't pay for it they only paid for it in rural areas just for a few services and that's a great example of the limitations of a government program now for where i sat i could see that it was a great idea but as the administrator did not permit me to provide um telehealth services that's the limitation of a government program it means that everybody's weighing in congress is weighing in the public is weighing in innovation for people that are going to be served by medicare is thwarted so you put more and more people in a government program you're talking about delays innovation technology new cures and treatments um if you think about you know the the private sector innovation that we've had or the innovation that we've had in healthcare it has come from the private sector the more people that you are putting on to medicare i feel like we're gonna we're gonna have a dwindling of that type of innovation that we see in healthcare that has come from the private sector and i think people should understand that when you're on a government program things take longer you know your access to new technology um you always hear people complain about in a great example as like a a colonoscopy if they find something during your colonoscopy and they treat you that's not covered by medicare you know all these like little idiosyncrasies that cannot be fixed because they require an act of congress or they require the agency to go through rule making process so you're talking about your health care becoming super bureaucratic and i think that's a risk you know medicare the the innovations and the great things that we've seen in medicare they didn't start with medicare they actually they started in the private sector and then they came to medicare we in medicare look to the private market to bring innovation you start putting more and more people on the medicare program you are bringing innovation in healthcare you know you're slowing it down and you are delaying people's access so that's another you know concern that i have you have the government making decisions about your health care um rather than the individual and you get that rationing and some of these horror stories you see from the uk um when somebody's refused care that that wouldn't really that wouldn't happen here um yeah and and there are some things like i'll give you some examples of you know there's some new tools coming out um where you're able to use some really cool apps with your healthcare technology well we can see that these things have real value to the patient but the law doesn't allow us to provide coverage in medicare because law can't keep up with the pace of innovation in our country yeah and that gets to a frustrating um permitting process because for all the innovation that happens here what we often see is it it has to be outsourced in a way you know it has the experimentation the the development has to happen outside the us because our laws cannot keep up with the innovation and so while we do have access to a lot more cutting edge um drugs and cutting edge you know biomedical devices it does seem to me that we could do better uh that that fda approvals are unnecessarily ridiculous i know you're not i know you weren't in charge of the fda but you know it does seem to me that the point of the fda was to approve safety and and when did it become wanted to change from improving safety to also assessing whether or not a drug or device is effective in the way that according to the standard that we set um stem cell is a really good example of this where where it's you know stem cells can be used for a whole number of things it's a it's a pretty simple and cheap way to do things um but it's really still hampered by the fda approval process which uses it as a drug uh instead of what it is which is your own body's cells being re-injected into you so um the thing we get in the way of of our self sometimes but whose fault is that it's the government's fault well and and you know you bring up an interesting point people sort of focus on fda and oh this is taking a long time you know after they get approved by the fda the drugs are available in the medicare program but a lot and then you actually have to agree to pay for it and we have to agree to pay for it so you can imagine how long and sometimes in the medicare program um it can take years for something that's been approved by the fda to be available to medicare patients so i mean it may be available in the private market you know great example of this was some of these uh cgm continuous glucose monitors people had access to it when they had their private health insurance but then when they got to medicare they had to give that up it wasn't actually covered in the medicare program because medicare hadn't really kept pace so i think that's a that's another point with you know the government running a lot of our health care if everybody's on a government program nobody would have had access to those you know glucose monitors that were available in the private market so it's just i think that's something you know that people should keep in mind when we talk about putting more and more people on government programs that's also you know a risk um in terms of access to innovative treatments and therapies yeah i mean whether it's our va system which is entirely government-run right or or our medicare system medicaid system these these live off the backs of private innovators and private health care that's where you that's where you're getting the innovation from you know in medicaid a lot of the states have gone and said we want a private healthcare company to run our program because they're going to actually do it in a more efficient way medicare advantage is an example of that right we see great results with medicare advantage where the medicare program is run by private companies and they compete you know side by side with the traditional program um and what we're seeing is this big increase where more and more people um that are on medicare they're choosing to get their health care through medicare advantage which are private health plans versus having the government run their care maybe we can end with that because the the um the the listeners ears are hurting with all this wonky talk about that gary wonkey i'm gonna apologize for that i'm trying to keep it no no no it's good i i think if people for people are looking to understand the subject better this is a great episode but uh but i was going to ask for a layman's explanation of medicare advantage sure so medicare advantage is these are private health plans humana united and they basically say you know we'll take we'll we'll get you know kind of a premium like which is what you pay and for health insurance and we'll manage your care so essentially your health care is being run by a private company versus um the government running your health care program the other thing is medicare advantage you know we talked a lot about value-based care so medicare advantage is value-based care they have a premium and they have to manage your care and that's why you're seeing medicare advantage plans making investments and keeping people healthy you know we made a lot of changes to medicare um we said hey you know what if you want to provide home-based care or put a ramp in somebody's home um you know give them meal service after surgery you can do that medicare advantage because we're giving them a fixed sum of money and then they have to manage the patient's care and we're seeing just a huge sore in the number of people going to medicare advantage and during um president trump's administration we saw medicare advantage premiums go down by 34 you know we changed the regulations and in some areas of the country those decreases were 50 and 60 percent um and premiums going down explain the premium structure to me uh a little bit because it it it's kind of similar to what i was talking about before when i laid out sort of three steps to envisioning healthcare differently direct primary care uh through direct and everything through an hsa but direct primary care um a premium support model for insurance and then a reinsurance model for your more catastrophic cases that are just in the millions of dollars that you don't you don't want to put on the rest of the risk pool um medicare advantage is kind of step two so how do so who sees the does the patient does the medicare patient see the premium or does only the government know what the premium is how do you and how do these things plans compete yeah these plan these plans are competing on the basis of premium right so it's it's just like in the private market where you're making decisions about how much do i want to pay out of pocket versus how much i want to pay in premium every year we have open enrollment and you know plans put up there you know here's what we're offering here's what your out-of-pocket expenses are and here's the premium so every year there's competition so the paper but the patient is the one seeing those differences in costs and choosing and then they're making their their decision obviously we're contributing that the federal government we're helping pay for the premium but the patient is also making a contribution as well so and i love that model because it's very consistent you talked about direct primary care right where you're paying a fixed amount it's the same thing in medicare advantage you're paying a fixed amount you're getting all your health care and these plans are competing for our seniors based on cost and quality okay how is that different from the aca and how and how that structure is set up so why did the aca cause premiums to skyrocket so much even though medicare advantage causes them to decrease because in obamacare you are still subsidizing uh plans in a marketplace so in the affordable care act that's the individual market right so not the employer you know you get a lot of people get their health cares are employed a lot of people go buy their health insurance on their own so the affordable care act really focused on that individual market and in a lot of states like i can tell you i'm from indiana and the way that they structured their market is they took out the high risk people they put them in a high risk pool and the government subsidize it with the affordable care act they put everybody together the high risk people and the low-risk people and that's why premiums went up in lots of areas of the country um and so you know in terms of why the premiums went up it's that mixing in the medicare advantage program we already that's like a group of people where we already knew what their health care costs were and you've got the high-risk people and the low-risk people so in that case it's sort of already accounted for um but in the obamacare market it mixed those two groups together which is why you you have that increase yeah that's why so is you know for the third category that i talk about whether it's reinsurance is it better plan reinsurance at the state level or or high risk pools because they both they're both going to end up doing a similar thing right they're they're different flavors um of each other i i think that has worked really well if a lot of what we did during the trump administration is we had our state empowerment waivers a lot of the states that exercise those waivers are not medicaid waivers but they actually developed reinsurance polls and across the board they saw premiums go down so actually during the trump administration premiums in the individual markets started to go down year over year so we're actually seeing that decrease because of a lot of regulatory changes um that we made okay i think everybody's brain is full in healthcare and the important point there's no there's no silver bullet right well an honest discussion about this stuff uh involves quite a bit of complexity and i get really frustrated with all the demagoguing that generally occurs with the healthcare debate um what are you doing now are you uh are you enjoying a little bit of time off i am i am working with some private equity firms that are obviously interested in health care and i'm on a few boards so you know it's nice to kind of work on that private side and and see you know how companies are trying to be more innovative and deliver health care better um and a lot of the value-based principles you're talking about that's exactly you know the companies that i'm working with they're trying to promote those concepts um you know through primary care through insurance so um yeah it's a different you know it's almost like the issues are the same but you're just wearing a different hat you're on a different side of the fence um so yeah it's i'm i'm i'm enjoying it i don't know what comes next people sort of say what are you gonna do next i'm like i'm just dealing with what's in front of me yeah that's a good call well sima thank you so much for the very informative discussion uh i think everybody's smarter appreciate appreciate being on great to see you thank you for all your help and your leadership i appreciate it thank you i appreciate you

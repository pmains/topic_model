I don't know what do you say here's the thing I was at that same that same rally with all these students and and what she said what that grieving mother said is the most powerful message that everyone needs to hear and it's them everyone it's the message that I've heard from PTA moms and school board members it's the message that I heard at that rally from two girls who came up to me and and said that they were in the school that one of them said they said we need action we have to do something one of them said i sat there as my friends and watch my friend's face get blown off her friend said that she she was underneath someone else who bled out who died on top of her how how much more of this but you're on Capitol Hill right you're on Capitol Hill I mean let me just speak for so many people who have been yelling at the television yelling at members of Congress how nothing has been done right right and you know what they're right they're right and I join them in their frustration and their anger they're absolutely right to be angry here's look this here are some things that we probably ought to start talking about right let's go I can tell you all of the things that's basic steps that we can take to make sure that everyone gets a background check in to make sure that if you're too dangerous to fly you should get a gun that's all true when she did and passes but you know what else you know what else you know what kind of gun this gunman is ar-15 is now I know what kind of gun is always used in these an ar-15 assault rifle what are you gonna do about it it's a weapon that's made to kill the maximum number of people what are you gonna do about it well it went until 2004 it was illegal to manufacture or down them illegal and that wasn't that didn't come from crazy left-wing liberals President Reagan thought that that might help dry up the scourge of these guns that wreak so much havoc I don't understand why in this discussion that we're having why we continue we aren't we advocate for the simple things without any response from my colleague the speaker will not bring a single bill for debate we have to focus on the big things like making sure that guns that are made to kill the maximum number of people cannot be used that way the speaker today really honed it on mental illness which is absolutely germane to the conversation I'm not I'm not dismissing that but you know I just in reading everything that I have from it from Republicans mental health mental illness hearing it reading it in a trump tweet today I mean you have this mother screaming at the presidents who did take time today to try to be the consoler in chief and spoke directly to the camera to try to talk to kids so that he wants to make them safe but there I heard no how I heard no specifics I heard no mention of gun laws right which makes this mother angry and she is she is right and everyone is right to be angry the fact is we have to deal with the mental health crisis in our country we and and we must I don't want to demonize people with mental illness and make this all about them we have to provide access to treatment and care for people with mental illness that's true but the fact is how many more shootings is it gonna take for your colleagues to get it together and fix something I had it before I left DC yesterday I had so many of my colleagues come up and grab my shoulder and and grab my arm and and express their heartfelt condolences and I and which I'm late it's lovely and I believe them and today they were gonna have a moment of silence on the House floor but you shouldn't have to have something like this happen in your own district to people that you know and care about and represent for it to matter to them it's not political it is not politicizing this issue to talk about ending gun violence the only people who are politicizing this issue are the people who are looking for reasons not to have the conversation and there is simply no excuse next week I've from all of the people I've been talking to they want to come together we're going to try to bring together the entire community in a way that will at least focus the nation's attention on this issue past the first couple of days we can't afford to let this just become another statistic this is one of the worst mass shootings in our country's history and it happened in one of the most wonderful communities everyone needs to care about that when are you gonna get the President to talk about it because we talked about Las Vegas forgive me Congress really fired up we talked about Las Vegas 58 people I believe is the number 58 people were killed you watch that White House press briefing which I do each and every day and they kept asking these reporters when are you gonna talk about it we had a whole conversation about bump stocks when are you gonna talk about it now is not the time now is not the time when is the time congressman right the time is today the time was yesterday the time was years ago at after Sandy Hook the time was years before that after Columbine it's always the time it is always the time to talk about preventing casualties to keep people safe to prevent shootings and one last thing some of my some of my colleagues some of our friends in the Senate went to the floor they spoke passionately about how much they they express their their grief their condolences and I again but to have that conversation and to work as hard as so many of them did to tie themselves into knots to avoid even using the word gun that's shameful it's not it's not just a person who walked in off the street and and murdered all of these kids it's a person who walked in off the street with an ar-15 and shot all these kids to death that's what we have to come to terms with it's vital that the conversation that the debate and that the pressure the maximum pressure from everyone who cares starts right now congressman Deutsch I appreciate all that I've got one more question for you because I want to play some sound this is from a public defender defending this this this shooter just fed into us Alice listen to this together children didn't lose to say that thank you okay come back come back did you connect again yes so I mean listen these public defenders are they live in the community you know it is their job to defend individuals such as the this suspect this man facing 17 counts of premeditated murder but it's not often you see someone get emotional like that work actually I take that back where were we five minutes ago yeah you and I both and and it's okay it's okay it's okay it's okay it's okay to be emotional that mom I can't imagine her grief the couple that I talked to a little while ago who lost a daughter they were speechless the kids who were impacted have so they they feel so deeply that something has to get done yeah it's okay for us to be emotional it's the only way that something will happen it's a motion that shouldn't just come from those of us who are standing in the shadow of the school where this happened it's the emotion that we should all feel for all of the people who take their kids to school every day and after events like this wonder if their kids are gonna come home that emotion is what's going to drive this process forward yes and I just I think I just think about that mom I think about that mom who has to go back into her daughter's bedroom and pick out clothes to put on her daughter for her funeral you know these are the things we don't talk about but it's all those little details it's everything just walking through what these parents are going through at a time like this that is just so unnecessary congressman Ted Deutsch I appreciate you and your candor and

congresswoman before we lose you i haven't heard much from conservatives cheering the road decision about increased resources for state foster care systems right and i know you recently took dozens of former foster youth to visit capitol hill my understanding being that they'll be shadowing congressional lawmakers sharing their experiences right is it a stretch to assume that these visits have taken on and added dimension in the aftermath of the court's decision on row well yes absolutely because you're talking about our most vulnerable population children in the child welfare system and this is a tradition we've been doing for the last 10 years and what we work with with the young people is we tell them how to strategically tell their life story in a way that educates lawmakers and we've been able to make significant changes in the in the foster care system legislative changes and you know in our city one of the issues that we're dealing with is the fact that we have 50 000 people a night who are sleeping on our streets who are homeless and children in the child welfare system is a whole category of people who are sleeping on our streets when they turn 18 or 21 we just cut them off and of course after a few months they wind up uh unhoused so what we do in congress is work to change the system so that they don't fall into homelessness in the first place that's how we work with the young people and we've been able to make significant legislative changes over the years all right thank you congresswoman karen bass

joining us from Washington DC with more reaction US representative Lance Gooden of district 5 thanks so much for joining us this morning congressman let's be thanks for having me let's begin with the impeachment this week and the acquittal for the president your reaction well first of all this was not a surprise we expected this but this has been the greatest week for a president Donald Trump I think since he took office politically on Monday night Iowa was a total disaster for Democrats Tuesday was a fantastic State of the Union speech probably one of his best ever Wednesday we had the acquittal Thursday we killed the top leader of al Qaeda Friday we had wonderful jobs numbers come out it doesn't get much better and Ted Cruz was absolutely right I believe the voters are going to punish Democrats the party that has overreached with this impeachment and you'll see that November congressman there are some Republicans who have questioned the call between the president and the Ukrainian president but they say it was not an impeachable offense what is your reaction to that yeah it absolutely was not an impeachable offense and in fact if you go back to the day that Nancy Pelosi stood and announced this beginning of the inquiry she did that before she even saw the transcript of that call had she just waited one day she would have had to join us and saying this is not impeach Abul the only Republicans that that split with the president this week were Mitt Romney Mitt Romney's a sore loser he's been mad because he lost the presidential race and he's a never Trump er I am not surprised that he voted to along with impeachment and to remove the president from office but this is just more of the same from Mitt Romney but Republicans are more United than they've ever been more than anyone around Washington that was here before me has seen in a really long time and we're very excited about what's to come in 2020 congressman what sort of tone do you think the president will take now after he has been acquitted well you guys beat what Republicans and Democrats would be able to get together on some things before November or do you think is just a way to the election at this point I think we're on a highway to the election at this point the president is going to continue to try to deliver for the American people but it's so difficult to do anything around here as long as Nancy Pelosi Xin is in charge this past year nothing got accomplished except the US Canada Mexico trade agreement that was in late December at the last minute we don't expect any real progress to happen as long as Democrats are control which is why our efforts are focused on taking back the majority you asked a question about tone I suspect the president is going to keep doing what he's been doing and that's fighting because the other side continues to fight they don't plan to let up they're playing to win the president's playing to win and this president has won since he got to Washington and I suspect will do the same in November congressman do you believe this is completely the fault of the Democrats you said that nothing can get done while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is in charge you do think that there the Republicans have no blame in this when it comes to getting things done and working together I think that she took this House of Representatives off a cliff in September when she care I think it was October I've lost track of the dates at this point but whenever she late September October when she came out and said we're going to impeach the president when she went back on what she had said from day one and that was impeachment should be a bipartisan exercise she said impeachment is bad for the country those comments that she made back in March of 2019 still ring true today and the Democrats move forward with a non bipartisan a very partisan impeachment against this president and they are absolutely at fault there the reason that nothing has been worked on because they have focused all of their efforts on impeachment and it has chewed up so much time and money of the American people and it really doesn't matter what I think or what the media thinks of what matters is what the voters think and I think on November you'll have an answer to your question about whose fault it really is congressman the president has been acquitted and I think the impeachment whole you know ordeal will help them in some areas but what about some of the congressional races in Texas particularly in congressional district 32 where we're looking's are trying to wrestle the seat away from Colin all right how does does this whole process impact that suburban Dallas district well I think anytime this president has been on the ticket a Republicans have done well two years ago was a bad year for Republicans and no matter what happens in November in 11 months or 10 months there's no way it could be worse for Republicans than it was in the last election cycles so to answer your question I think things are going to be great November I think the swing district seats like the seat that's currently held by Colin are at as you mentioned one down in Houston that flipped those are absolutely in play Republicans are going to be working to take those back because they're key to reclaiming the majority but I think the president being on the ticket will help turnout will help the electorate the Republican electorate especially that perhaps slept in 2018 to get out and vote and I think the American people are sick of this impeachment business I think it's really left a stain the speaker likes to say it's a scar on the presidency forever I think it's a scar on their legacy and I think they'll pay for it at the pulse is taxes more of a battleground today after all of this or less of a battleground and I'm talking statewide sure I me personally I don't think it's any more I think we got kind of a skewed election cycle result in the last cycle the it was bad nationwide for Democrats we had a very unique and strange Senate race between Ted Cruz and baito there are various theories about why that race was so close that I won't get into you have your theories and I have mine but it was a very unique Senate race we're not gonna see that in this race the Democrats don't have any good candidates John Cornyn has done a great job leading through this impeachment that his supporters are very pleased with him I don't think you'll see the action in Texas that you saw two years ago and also because we have the presidency going on there wasn't a whole lot going on around America in terms of sexy Senate races and the baito Ted Cruz race was one of those races that just drew special attention to Texas we saw a special house State House election down in the Houston area the Democrats said this is going to be our big win we're gonna take the seat back from Republicans the Republicans swept so I don't think Republicans are taking Democrats lightly in the next cycle but I don't think we're running around with our hair on fire thinking the end of the world is here congressman thanks so much for being with us safe travels back here to Texas

with us now is the senior senator from the state where this happened Virginia's Mark Warner senator the Virginia Beach police chief said today that he didn't believe any other kind of gun legislation would have prevented this the weapons were purchased legally and he entered the building in a legal manner but we do know former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords organization that rates gun safety and violence says every 10 hours in the state of Virginia someone is killed with a gun is this something your constituents just have to adjust to well Margaret first of all we're all heartbroken about what happened in Virginia Beach 12 victims 11 of them public officials since they worked for the city and thank God for the police officers who rushed in and took down the shooter or chances are there could have been more deaths and we're still not sure what motivated this shooter I've been in touch with city officials and the governor and there may not have been anything with this specific case that could have prevented it although obviously additional mental health assistance would be would be critical but we've got to recognize that this just doesn't happen in other civilized nations at this level of violence and while it's too early to talk about what specific actions I do think there are to be some kind of lowest hanging fruit like universal background checks that might not have done anything in this particular case but might prevent some future incident particularly in terms of identifying somebody that might have mental health issues in terms of their ability to obtain a firearm I do think there are certain areas where we could and should come together in terms of action what about suppressors apparently the shooter had one on his weapon and that muffled the sound so that victims couldn't run and hide I think that's an area that there ought to be a legitimate debate I've I have felt that we ought to take steps against assault wipe Oh assault weapons the suppressors I'd like to hear what the legitimate reason is in term either self-defense or hunting why a suppressor is needed but again there may not be any single item here but we can't become in a sense callous about the fact that whether it's the number of folks in Virginia that are taken out by firearms or the numbers of mass shootings that have taken place already this year you know the basic underlying fact is this just doesn't happen in other nations at this rate and I think we all are and said put some of our politics aside and and sort through how we can find some common action to prevent some of these actions in the future you are the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee we heard from the special counsel this week for the first time we heard from the attorney general about the Muller report is there any question in your mind that the counterintelligence probe involving the Trump campaign was not legitimate absolutely not absolutely not this was a appropriate actions taken by the FBI taken by some of our intelligence community matter of fact if they had not acted it would have been the height of irresponsibility there was evidence of Russian intervention whish candidly in many ways the Obama administration had done more to get this message out and one of the things I I know there was lots of back and forth on the obstruction issue but what I hope Americans would remember from the Moller presser this week was where he started his comments and ended his comments which was that America was attacked by a foreign power and chances are they will be they or others will be back this is the same testimony that the FBI director Christopher Ray again a trump appointee made a few weeks ago before Congress and it is the height of irresponsibility that Congress has not acted to make sure that our elections in 2020 are more secure I would argue there are three things we could do next week when we this week when we come back first we ought to go ahead and pass bipartisan election security legislation to make sure for example that there's a paper ballot trail after every vote there's been no Florida there's been no floor time a lot second we ought to put some guardrails on social media so there's not an ability for foreigners or other entities to create fake accounts and manipulate our whole political debate and third even if we accept the fact that Muller's said even though they're 140 plus connections between Russians and Trump officials it didn't rise to the level of conspiracy we ought to say on future all federal elections if there is a foreign entity trying to intervene there ought to be an affirmative obligation to report that to the FBI I want to play for you a soundbite from our Jan Crawford's interview with Attorney General bar when he was talking about the president's characterization of some of the investigators you don't think that they've committed treason not as a legal matter right well you have concerns about how they conducted the investigation yes but you know when you're dealing with official government contact in intent is frequently a murky issue I'm not suggesting people did what they did necessarily because of consciousness arias motives sometimes people can convince themselves that what they're doing is in the higher interest the better good they don't realize that what they're doing is really empathetic 'el to the democratic system we have they start viewing themselves as the guardians of the people that are more informed and sensitive than everybody else is there a possibility that as the Attorney General suggests all of this was born out of a misguided sense of justice and what is wrong with raising some of the questions that he has about the standards for decision-making 17 US intelligence agencies confirmed the fact that the Russians intervened in our elections our bipartisan committee the last bipartisan effort on the hill looking at this issue reaffirmed unanimously that the Russians massively intervened if we had not acted if our intelligence community and law enforcement had not acted they would have been irresponsible and candidly mr. Barr has very little credibility with me and I think the vast majority of candidly not just Democrats but many Americans because he time and again is not acting as our Attorney General but as a personal advocate for Donald Trump the Attorney General is beginning this investigation though India's the counterintelligence probe I have at it because facts will confirm what the intelligence community and law enforcement did was right we as as the Intelligence Committee have looked into the beginnings of this investigation again I will restate what I said earlier if law enforcement and the intelligence community had not started an investigation when they had evidence of Russian interference they would have been it would have been the height of irresponsibility since you have oversight in your committee role of the intelligence agencies will you receive any kind of update from the agency Chiefs I know Adam Schiff on the house side has asked in a letter for regular updates are you going to get those we are continuing to ask for regular updates and one of the most important items that we can receive and we're in the process of obtaining these documents what was the counterintelligence evidence not the conclusions that Muller put out but the evidence that Muller received for us to finish our job we need that evidence but can you unequivocally say politics played absolutely no role in influencing the decision makers when they opened and conducted this counter I saw absolutely no evidence that politics played any role and again if law enforcement and the FBI had not opened an investigation when they had as much evidence as they did of Russian intervention they would have been irresponsible matter of fact one of the ironies is I believe Barr and Trump have repeatedly criticized the Obama administration for not doing more to get the word out before the election North Korea reports out that their top negotiator and four other officials have either been removed or possibly executed for the failure in Hanoi can you confirm that I cannot confirm it today but I'll get a brief this week and so whose briefing we will get briefed from the intelligence community but it's a guinea if true it is a remarkable further evidence of how trakone ian and extreme the Kim regime is and I think again this president's notion that he has built this personal relationship with this murderer because even if these individuals have not been murdered we know the Kim's I believe cousin or uncle was murdered by anti-aircraft machine in a in a brutal brutal way it raises real questions whether the so-called personal connection is going to lead to a safer world senator Warner thank you for joining us today we turn now to Republican Senator John

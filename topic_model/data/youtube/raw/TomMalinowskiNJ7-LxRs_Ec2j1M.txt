  GOVERNMENT IN EXILE IF PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY WOULD HAVE TO FLEE  KYIV. THAT ACCORDING TO WESTERN  OFFICIALS TELLING CNN. LET'S TALK MORE ABOUT ALL OF  THIS. JOINING US NOW, CONGRESSMAN TOM  MALINOWSKI. A FORMER SENIOR DIRECTOR FOR THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL UNDER  PRESIDENT CLINTON, AND A FORMER  ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HUMAN RIGHTS UNDER PRESIDENT  OBAMA. CONGRESSMAN, GOOD TO SEE YOU  AGAIN. WE'RE LOOKING AT UTTER  DEVASTATION. IT'S JUST HARD TO PUT INTO WORDS WHAT EVERYONE IS WITNESSING IN  UKRAINE RIGHT NOW. BUT WHAT ROLE DO YOU SEE THE  U.S. POTENTIALLY PLAYING AND  MAPPING OUT A PLAN FOR PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY OR AN EXILE GOVERNMENT AS A WHOLE. >> I THINK IT'S TOO SOON TO TALK ABOUT THAT. OBVIOUSLY WE SHOULD BE PLANNING  FOR EVERY CONTINGENCY, BUT RIGHT NOW, AS DEVASTATING AS THESE  ATTACKS ON UKRAINIAN CITIES ARE, I THINK WE ALSO HAVE TO KEEP IN  MIND THAT THE RUSSIANS ARE  EXPERIENCING ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE DIFFICULTIES AS WELL. YES, THEY CAN LOB ARTILLERY AT  KYIV AND KHARKIV. IF THEIR TROOPS MOVE FORWARD  INTO THOSE CITIES, THEY'RE  MASSACRED. THE UKRAINIANS ARE GOING TO GET  BETTER AND BETTER AT HITTING  THEM BEHIND THEIR LINES, HITTING THEIR SUPPLY LINES. MEANWHILE, THEIR COUNTRY'S  ECONOMY IS CRASHING EVERY SINGLE DAY, WHICH IS GOING TO MAKE IT  HARDER FOR THE RUSSIAN  GOVERNMENT TO SUPPORT THESE  TROOPS OUTSIDE THESE CITIES. SO I THINK WE'RE SORT OF IN A  RACE AGAINST TIME. IF THE UKRAINIANS CAN CONTINUE  TO HOLD OUT, WHICH THEY ARE  DOING BRILLIANTLY WITH THE  WEAPONS THAT THE UNITED STATES  AND OUR ALLIES ARE GIVING THEM,  AND THE SANCTIONS ARE GIVEN TIME TO REALLY BITE, I THINK WE MAY  BE LOOKING AT A VERY DIFFERENT  SCENARIO FROM RUSSIA THAN THE  ONE THAT WE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED  A FEW DAYS AGO. >> SO IT IS A RACE AGAINST TIME, BUT WE HEARD FROM PRESIDENT  ZELENSKYY TODAY. HE NEEDS MORE SUPPORT NOW. HE SAYS ANY COUNTRY THAT IS NOT  OFFERING THAT SUPPORT  IMMEDIATELY IS COMPLICIT IN THE  KIND OF KILLING THAT'S TAKING  PLACE. SO WHILE THE U.S. HAS PROMISED  MORE ARMOR AND IS WORKING IN  CONCERT WITH POLAND, POLAND  WOULD TRY TO SUPPLY SOME  MIG-29s, OLDER AIRCRAFT, CAN IT  COME SOON ENOUGH? I MEAN, YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT  THE CHALLENGES RUSSIA HAS BEING  ABLE TO MOBILIZE. THAT MEANS THERE ARE CHALLENGES  IN TRYING TO GET THIS EQUIPMENT  IN COUNTRY, TOO, RIGHT? >> YES. AND, LOOK, WE DO NEED TO DO MORE OF IT. I THINK WE ALSO SHOULD NOT  DISCOUNT THE POWER OF WHAT WE  HAVE ALREADY DONE. PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY'S JOB TO ASK US FOR MORE EVERY SINGLE DAY,  BUT HIS TROOPS RIGHT NOW ARE  DOING A VERY GOOD JOB, AND THIS  IS VERY GRISLY, BUT THEY'RE  DOING A GREAT JOB KILLING A  LARGE NUMBER OF RUSSIANS WITH  THE ANTI-TANK WEAPONS AND THE  OTHER WEAPONS THAT ARE ALREADY  POURING INTO UKRAINE RIGHT NOW,  COURTESY OF THE UNITED STATES  AND OUR NATO ALLIES. WHAT MORE CAN WE DO? ABSOLUTELY, GETTING THEM THESE  RUSSIAN-MADE PLANES FROM EASTERN EUROPEAN ALLIES WOULD BE  HELPFUL. UKRAINIAN PILOTS CAN USE THOSE  PLANES, NOT JUST TO DEAL WITH  RUSSIAN AIRCRAFT. THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY THE BIGGEST  PROBLEM, BUT ALSO POTENTIALLY  RUSSIAN ARTILLERY AND ROCKET  FIRE, WHICH IS THE MAIN THING  THAT IS DEVASTATING UKRAINIANS  RIGHT NOW. I THINK WE NEED TO GET THEM,  AGAIN, THROUGH OUR EASTERN  EUROPEAN ALLIES MORE EFFECTIVE  AIR DEFENSES. AND SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE DON'T  TALK ABOUT AS MUCH FOR SOME GOOD REASON. WE NEED TO BE GIVING THEM  REALTIME TACTICAL INTELLIGENCE  ON THE BATTLEFIELD SO THAT THEY  CAN USE THEIR ARTILLERY MORE  EFFECTIVELY TO COUNTER THESE  RUSSIAN UNITS THAT ARE SHELLING  UKRAINIAN CITIES. THOSE ARE THE PRACTICAL THINGS  THAT WE CAN AND SHOULD BE DOING. AND AT THE SAME TIME, THERE'S  MORE WE CAN DO ON THE SANCTIONS  FRONT. I WAS VERY HEARTENED TO HEAR  SECRETARY BLINKEN TODAY TALKING  ABOUT A COORDINATED EFFORT TO GO AFTER RUSSIAN OIL EXPORTS. THE U.S. BANNING RUSSIAN OIL IS  SYMBOLIC, BUT IF WE CAN GET OUR  ALLIES TO WORK WITH US ON A  PLAN, THAT WOULD BE -- THAT  WOULD BE FURTHER DEVASTATION TO  THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY. >> WE KNOW THAT THE TALK OF THE  NO-FLY ZONE IS REALLY OFF THE  TABLE AS THE U.S. AND OTHER NATO ALLIES ARE CONCERNED. LET'S TALK MORE A LITTLE BIT  ABOUT THAT PLAN NOW THAT THE  U.S. IS SUPPORTING IN TERMS OF  POLAND SUPPLYING FIGHTER JETS TO UKRAINE. THIS WAS -- THE PLAN THAT THE  U.S. WOULD ACTUALLY BACKFILL  AIRCRAFT TO POLAND IN SO DOING. LISTEN TO WHAT THE U.S.  AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N. SAID THIS MORNING ABOUT THAT POTENTIAL  PLAN. >> WE HAVE BEEN IN CLOSE  CONSULTATIONS WITH THE POLISH  GOVERNMENT, AS WELL AS WITH OUR  OTHER NATO ALIES ON THIS ISSUE. WE HAVE NOT IN ANY WAY OPPOSED  THE POLISH GOVERNMENT, PROVIDING THESE JETS TO UKRAINE, AND WE'RE WORKING, AS YOU NOTED, TO SEE  HOW WE CAN BACKFILL FOR THEM. >> COULD U.S. JETS BE PROVIDED  TO POLAND AND THOSE NATIONS? >> WE'RE STILL IN DISCUSSIONS  WITH THE POLES ON THAT ISSUE. >> BUT IT, TOO, IS AN ISSUE OF  TRAINING, RIGHT? THE UKRAINIAN PILOTS ARE TRAINED ON, SAY, THE MIG-29s, PERHAPS  NOT ON THE MORE -- THE LATEST,  YOU KNOW, U.S. JETS AVAILABLE. TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE. SO THEY ARE GOING TO NEED PLANES THAT THE PILOTS ARE READY TO  FLY. DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HOW  MANY UKRAINIAN PILOTS MIGHT BE  AVAILABLE TO FLY ANY JETS THAT  MIGHT BE DONATED? >> I THINK THEY HAVE THE PILOTS. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A HUGE  NUMBER OF PLANES. YES, THESE WOULD BE RUSSIAN-MADE AIRCRAFT THAT THE UKRAINIANS ARE ABLE TO FLY RIGHT AWAY. SO THIS IS -- THIS WILL BE  HELPFUL AND NO-FLY ZONE IN  CONTRAST WOULD BE, I THINK, THE  HIGHEST RISK AND LOWEST REWARD  OPTION THAT WE HAVE. HIGHEST RISK BECAUSE IT WOULD  MEAN A WAR BETWEEN THE UNITED  STATES AND RUSSIA DIRECTLY. LOWEST REWARD BECAUSE A NO-FLY  ZONE WOULD NOT ADDRESS THE  ARTILLERY, THE MISSILES, THE  ROCKET FIRE THAT IS COMING FROM  THE GROUND. NOT FROM THE AIR. AND IS CAUSING THE LARGEST  AMOUNT OF DEVASTATION ON  UKRAINE. IF WE ALLOW UKRAINIAN PILOTS TO  FLY PLANES THAT THEY'RE FAMILIAR WITH, THEY COULD USE THEM TO GO  AFTER GROUND TARGETS AS WELL. AND THEN LET'S KEEP ON PROVIDING THE STUFF WE ARE ALREADY  PROVIDING THAT IS HAVING SUCH A  DEVASTATING AND LETHAL EFFECT. DON'T DISCOUNT THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT WE'RE ALREADY DOING. >> AND THOSE PLANES IN THE HANDS OF UKRAINIAN PILOTS ALSO  POTENTIALLY GOING AFTER THAT,  WHAT, 40-MILE CONVOY THAT SEEMS  TO BE EITHER IMMOBILIZED OR  STUCK OR SLOW MOVING. >> POTENTIALLY. I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T WANT TO  GIVE THEM TACTICAL ADVICE FROM  OUR STUDIO HERE, BUT, YES,  THEORETICALLY, THEY COULD GO  AFTER GROUND TARGETS WITH THOSE  AIRCRAFT AS WELL. BUT AGAIN, THIS IS WHERE THE  U.S. PROVIDING THEM WITH  TACTICAL INTELLIGENCE AND A  REALTIME WAY, WHAT'S ACTUALLY  GOING ON IN THE BATTLEFIELD  WOULD ALSO BE -- WOULD BE VERY,  VERY HELPFUL. >> ALL RIGHT. >> AND THEN IN THE SCENARIO,  IMAGINE A SNARE GLOW WHICH, SAY, A CITY LIKE KYIV IS TOTALLY  SURROUNDED AND CUT OFF. IT'S NOT YET. WE ARE STILL ABLE TO GET AS FAR  AS I KNOW, SUPPLIES IN THROUGH  THE GROUND. I THINK WE DO ALSO NEED TO BE  PREPARED TO THINK ABOUT  SOMETHING LIKE A BERLIN AIRLIFT  WHERE WE ARE HELPING THE  UKRAINIANS FLY IN SUPPLIES,  HUMANITARIAN SUPPLIES, FOOD,  MEDICI

When our congressman
took a party-line vote that would have canceled
health insurance for thousands of Virginians,
I knew I had to run. Healthcare affects everyone. Making it into a partisan battle
makes things worse. Whether it's protecting Medicare
and Social Security or keeping our kids safe
from gun violence, we can stand by our values and work together
to get things done. I'm Abigail Spanberger. I approve this message because I'll never put politics
ahead of what's right.

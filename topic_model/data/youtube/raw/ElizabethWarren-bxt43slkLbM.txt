hi everyone I'm senator Elizabeth Warren and this is my dog Bailey say hi Bailey gets you everybody and my sweetie bruised and we've been getting a lot of questions from kids about what's going on during this coronavirus and so Bailey and I thought we answer these questions together right bales come on let's give it a try hi leo I know it's hard not being able to go to school and I'm sure you miss her teachers and I'll bet your teachers miss you too but right now there's something happening all around the world with a virus and it's little little tiny you can't even see it don't even Baylor could see it it's little tiny and it gets down people's throats and their noses and down in their lungs and then if they sneeze or touch themselves it gets on their hands and the thing about it it's when somebody's got it it's really easy to give it to the next person and the next person and the next person and when they do some of those people get really really sick so while that's happening it means that we have to do everything we can to keep from getting sick and the best way to do that is forced to stay home and not be around a lot of people and touching a lot of people's hands and faces and that sort of thing so I know it's hard to be at home all the time and not be with your teachers in your school and your friends but it's really important right now and I'm so glad you're doing it it's also important over and over wash your hands stay inside and if you do go outside wear a mask it really makes you look cool I miss my friends because I would normally be in a group with them would just be writing you drop we would play with each other I just give them a hug I can't do that because schools are closed and you can't leave so that's a good question Shila the government can actually do a lot number one is the government can make sure that there's enough money for the hospitals and doctors and the nurses to be able to have everything they need to keep themselves safely masks and gowns and to help treat people when they get sick like ventilators and other kinds of help that they need the second thing the government could do is it can help people who lose their jobs in the middle of this crisis and the third is government can plan that means it can really lay out so here's the idea on where we make sure that the people who most need medical help will be able to get it and places where the economy needs the most help can get it the government can be a good planner the way I think of it is government is what we do together with each other it's how we watch out for each other and take care there are more questions coming and you can send your questions to Bailey and I are glad to answer [Music]

Mr. Speaker,
The threat of foreign interference in our election is real. Our intelligence chiefs are unanimous that
Russia views the 2018 elections as a target for additional interference. 2016 wasn’t the first or the last time they
will try to meddle. Yesterday, President Trump finally acknowledged
meddling and vowed to guard against it saying quote, “we won’t allow that to happen.” But Mr. Speaker, actions speak louder than
words. And time and time again, this Administration
has proven unwilling to confront this threat. • We learned this week the State Department
is not using any of the resources they’ve been given to counter election interference. • U.S. Cyber Command Chief Adm. Mike Rogers
said the President has not granted him authority to disrupt the Russian hacking operations. • And we’re still waiting on the Administration
to impose the sanctions on Russia passed by an overwhelming bipartisan majority of Congress. This isn’t a theoretical exercise. Americans are already heading to the polls
in states like mine, Illinois, where early voting began this week. I urge the Administration to get serious about
this threat and support funding for the Election Assistance Commission and resources for state
election officials on the front line of this battle. This is not a partisan issue, it’s about
protecting our democracy.

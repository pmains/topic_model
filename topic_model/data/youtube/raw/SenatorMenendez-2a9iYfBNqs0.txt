[Music] thank you mr chairman i want to thank you and the ranking member for holding this hearing uh as a chairman of the full committee i appreciate that uh chairs and rankings who preside over nominations hearings one of the fundamental responsibilities that we have to move nominees forward and i appreciate those of my colleagues who have fulfilled that duty during this work period congratulations to all the nominees and your families who are with you this hearing comes at a time when human rights and fundamental freedoms face numerous challenges in our hemisphere and champions of democracy are needed now more than ever in nicaragua daniel ortega has become what he once fought to overthrow a ruthless dictator his disdain for democracy and decency are attest to the international community as we confront the rising global tide of authoritarianism in el salvador president is wielding populism and new digital tools to perpetuate a cult of personality even as he undermines el salvador's democratic institutions at an alarming rate if confirmed the leadership of each of the nominees here today will be indispensable to confronting the challenges and forging new opportunities for the united states and latin america and the caribbean and let me take a point of personal privilege to briefly recognize deputy assistant secretary heidi fulton ms fulton was a pearson fellow in my office from 2009 to 2010. the contribution she made during her time with us including helping draft the first version of what would later become the oas revitalization and reform act of 2013 that came into law were a testament to her decades of experience in latin america in the caribbean i'd like to take credit that all of the successes she's had since then as a result of her time with me but it's her incredible abilities and we're glad to see her being considered for the ambassador to little hawaii mr rodriguez nicaragua has been in a state of crisis since april 18th of 2018. that was a day the anti-government protest triggered a years-long wave of repression that has killed 329 people injured thousands and condemned 190 political prisoners to arbitrary detention in conditions amounting to torture the ortega regime has no shame they have jailed expelled harassed political opponents former lawyers business partners representatives of the catholic church they have shuttered organizations that feed and shelter nicaraguans they've closed eight of the country's universities they've attempted to withdraw from the organization of american states all while cozying up to russia they've even kicked out mother teresa's missionaries of charity nicaragua is on the path to becoming a totalitarian dictatorship we often talk about how to respond to crisis instead of investing more in prevention our renascent act which was signed into law last year lays out a framework for u.s policy but we need to act now so if you are confirmed what steps would you take to mobilize a robust international strategy to prevent the onset of a deeper humanitarian crisis in nicaragua thank you senator if confirmed as you point out we really need to mobilize voices from across the region and around the world to call out the human rights abuses to call out the undemocratic um actions that the government of daniela ortega is taking and we need to call for the immediate release of the 190 political prisoners that you mentioned if confirmed i commit to working with u.n human rights council uso oas excuse me our partners in europe and canada to seek their voice and their action in the form of sanctions to join our efforts to uh to to highlight the abuses and to isolate the regime of danielle ortega let me follow up with uh uh something that senator rubio raised our renault said act lays out congressional guidance on suspending nicaragua from the capitol dr trade agreement um and i know it's a powerful tool the same thing with el salvador but we entered into these agreements with a universal concept of who we were entering into nicaragua certainly does not fall in that category at this point in time what steps will you take to implement what the law says and do you commit to keeping this committee informed on a quarterly basis on the nature of russia's deepening cooperation with nicaragua yes senator i commit to to keeping the committee informed uh in addition if confirmed sir i uh commit to adding my weight to the full implementation of the renaissance as i mentioned working with ustr and others on the captain dr question continuing to implement the act in terms of holding officials in nicaragua accountable for the human rights abuses we recently sanctioned another 23 individuals under section 353 thanks to the renaissance that is a new capacity that we have and we're taking full advantage of it again senator if confirmed uh i will work with our interagency com uh colleagues to maximize the pressure uh both through renaissance and all of the tools at the same time i look forward we need a strong voice there mr chairman i have the indulgence of the chair for another minute um mr duncan i was a little surprised at your response uh to senator rubio about president buchelli's popularity hitler was popular putin is popular in russia it doesn't mean that because a person is popular in their country that in fact we don't press extremely hard on violations of human rights and democracy are we agreed on that we are indeed agreed on that senate uh so we have an increasing challenging situation in el salvador one that threatens both the future democracy and the country in bilateral relations with the united states over the last two years president buchelli has presided over a number a number of alarming setbacks for democratic governments undermining judicial independence intimidating opposition lawmakers by using security forces to occupy the legislature negotiating political pacts with gangs regularly attacking journalists and media outlets and in addition to these actions buchelli has also repeatedly used his network of twitter trolls to attract and to attack and threaten not only government critics within el salvador but also united states officials including my colleague in the house of representatives congresswoman norma torres it's amazing what he is doing directing against a member of the united states congress and former ambassador gene manz so i want to hear from you do you commit to prioritizing these issues and discussions with president buchelli and senior officials within his government yes senator i do make that commitment to you uh and i must tell you that i think the the exchange with regarding representative torres was absolutely unacceptable and i would certainly be happy to make that clear to the salvadoran government what other steps do you believe the united states needs to take to prevent further democratic backsliding in el salvador senator i think uh first of all i agree with you there have been a number of developments in el salvador over the last two years that are concerning when it comes to the strength and the health of salvador's democracy i think we have made judicious use of the various sanctions tools that congress has given us to highlight some of those problems whether it's the removal of the supreme court magistrates in the constitutional chamber the gang truths that you referred to or other acts of either corruption or acts that tend to undermine democracy and i think we need to continue using those tools uh appropriately uh judiciously but we need to keep using them to send the message that el salvador's best future lies on the path of democracy all right mr chairman thank you for your indulgence if i i just may i will have a series of questions for the record i don't want the rest of you to think i i have no issues for you i do but in deference to my colleagues who are still here i'd like substantive substantive underlined responses to them before i consider putting you on a business meeting agenda thank you very much

joining us now to talk about his vote to impeach the president for the second time new jersey democratic congressman tom malinowski congresswoman thank you for taking the time to talk to us thanks so much what's your attitude right now is this a sad day for you somber day for you it's been a sad and somber day for all of us for the country after this horrific event of january 6 an attack by a mob on the united states capital set upon us i believe by the president of the united states it wasn't lost on me as we were standing in the house chamber today voting that we were in exactly the place that was attacked surrounded by the capitol police officers whose lives were also endangered one of them died trying to defend us and there's no question in my mind as late as it is in the trump presidency that a statement needed to be made that this is something that can never be tolerated again in our country and we made that statement today in the most bipartisan impeachment vote in american history speaking of republicans i wanted to ask you if you saw the remarks from leader kevin mccarthy saying that he believes the president does share culpability for what happened he actually went out there also and said that there is no way that this was antifa why not join with the republicans together on something like censure to send a message to the president and future presidents all right well i i would censor him but but if if impeachment is not about this if this is not an impeachable act a a president inciting and encouraging a violent attack on the united states congress to prevent us from doing our jobs we might as well write the impeachment clause out of the constitution what's it there for if not for this so you know censure is is for for much less offensive acts than than this and a number of republicans including the number three republican leader in the house of representatives liz cheney agreed with us it seems as if mitch mcconnell uh might even agree with us and you know the sad thing is that that a number of my republican colleagues i think would have voted yesterday on impeachment if not for the fear that they have about the safety of their own families who have been threatened by some of these same people so i'm i'm convinced it was the right thing to do i want to ask you about that further i want to dial down on it we're talking about not a fear of losing a career or losing a primary you're saying that you have colleagues living in literal visceral fear of some sort of mob targeting them yeah well we were just targeted by mob and remember the the the mob the riders who came into the capital yeah they don't like democrats and yes they were screaming about nancy pelosi but the people they were specifically there to pressure were republicans they were chanting hang mike pence like this guy mike pence was loyal to president trump four straight years and one day he follows the law he reads the script in the constitution for certifying joe biden and trump supporters are now saying hang him and so these republicans are feeling that and many of them have gotten death threats at home i'm kind of used to that they're not used to it they're saying look we didn't sign up to this we don't we i i can understand that fear and you know for me the fact that there are members of congress afraid to impeach because the president has mobilized a movement that is threatening to kill them is in and of itself a reason to impeach the president how can we have this in the united states lastly i wanted to ask you about your colleague congresswoman mikey cheryl she's alleged that there may have been some members of congress who possibly were working with people who were taking a tour of the capital january 5th you signed on to a letter along with 30 other members of congress asking for more information what have you heard about this do we know specific members of congress who were taking people around in the halls and sort of giving them a guided tour of the place the day before the insurrection i don't believe we know which members of congress invited these tours in we know that there were tours there were groups of people who looked very much like they were there for uh the the rally or riot the next day and who knows it may have been something innocent it may be just members of congress uh taking in their constituents and giving them a tour of the capital or it could have been something much much more sinister uh actual collusion helping uh the the men who would lead that that riot the next day to kind of case out the joint we don't know all we're asking for is an investigation because we do need to be absolutely certain that there were no members of congress who were involved in this um we know some members kind of encouraged it rhetorically there were members of congress who spoke to the rally that morning uh one one of whom congressman moe brooks of alabama will be censured i believe by the house in a resolution that i'm leading um probably next week or the week after because he basically told the rally goers march on the capitol take down names and in his words kick some ass so we're looking at that if there was more um substantial collusion we're going to get to the bottom of it but we need to investigate all right congressman tom malinowski thank you very much for joining us thank you so much

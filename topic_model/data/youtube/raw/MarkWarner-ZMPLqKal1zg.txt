dave and senator mark warner is on a three-day tour of southwest virginia he's made time for us to be in our studio this afternoon thanks so much for being here thanks for having me what brings you to the area well i'm down announcing uh 800 000 grant for southwest virginia to continue to promote tourism arts culture outdoor recreation and i got to tell you i'm down for the race yay we're glad to have you listen let me turn to the presidential election while you're here traditionally we have been a red state but four years ago virginia voted for obama is this state really up for grabs this year i think the state is up for grabs i think it's going to be very close i know the president's got some real problems in southwest virginia he's doing better in eastern virginia and northern virginia i tell you this much i'm supporting the president but i also am awful tired of all the negative ads i i wish we wouldn't be spending two billion dollars on tv tearing each other down that money could be used for improving 81 or scholarships but uh hopefully we will get through this election as we've gotten through all the others and we can get back to solving our country's problems particularly the debt and deficit i'm glad to hear you say that i think a lot of people agree with you now let me ask you about health care it's a hot button issue right now if mitt romney does take office and that is a possibility can he repeal that or does that has to go through congress well that's that's the thing that's kind of craziness about uh the political campaigns you know the president on their own can't repeal health care and you know even if mr romney is successful and even if the republicans take the senate they're not going to get 60 votes in the senate so it's not going to be able to have uh the health care reform repealed what i've urged is there's a lot of things care built that need to be changed there's some good things and some bad things let's work in a bipartisan fashion to actually fix what needs to be fixed and let's make sure we really focus on more transparency and pricing around health care and bringing health care costs down at the end of the day that's one of the big things driving up our debt absolutely let me ask you about cole i know you were visiting the coal fields in buchanan county um with obama and the epa accused of wanting to shut down some of the plans he's a democrat you're a democrat what's your position on this well my position is that coal has to be part of our energy mix i actually voted against some of the epa regulations i thought they went too far i do think we need a full energy portfolio coal natural gas oil nuclear solar wind all of the things because it makes no sense for us to continue to spend billions of dollars buying oil from countries that don't like us i would hope though that you know one of the challenges cole's got is not only regulations but it's actually cheap natural gas as well and my hope is that we also look at some of the challenges around natural gas as well so that we don't end up simply transferring from one source of dependency to another right let me ask you this we have a big concern for all of us concerning medicare but i think particularly our older generation is worried about how long it's going to be around is prior is uh privatizing it a good option well i don't think we ought to privatize medicare i think we need to maintain the promise of medicare but there are going to have to be some changes in it we're sitting on 16 trillion dollars of debt at this point unless we get our country's balance sheets fixed we're going to be really up the creek and there's not going to be a democrat only answer or republican only answer we're going to have to raise some more revenues we're going to have to change our entitlement programs like medicare and social security to make sure that when you get to the age of medicare and social security it's going to be there and that's going to require a bipartisan action i've been working actually with the both tennessee senators both republicans on a 4 trillion dollar debt reduction plan that would have tax reform entitlement reform i hope whoever's elected president we get the first on the agenda and i know that debt reduction is high on your list of priorities absolutely there's nothing that would do more that would help jump-start our economy and get a lot of the money that's sitting on the sidelines investing back in job creation then making sure that we could show that washington is going to get its balance sheet right thank you so much for

thank you mr chairman ms lee um congratulations do you think the united states constitution should be interpreted according to how people understood it at the time it was adopted thank you for the question senator with regard to the interpretation of the constitution um should i be confirmed as a circuit judge i'll be bound by the supreme court and second secretary i know that i know that and i'm not going to ask either of you i know you've been coached um the trump white house coached the republicans when they were nominated always carefully say you're going to file a supreme court preston i stipulate that i'm asking your opinion your judicial philosophy not how you're going to rule on the case so let me rephrase it do you think the united states constitution should be interpreted according to how people understood it at the time it was adopted thank you senator i don't have a a personal judicial interpretation philosophy apart from what you're going to be on the united states court of appeals if you're confirmed and you don't have a judicial philosophy about how the united states constitution should be interpreted well senator i in in terms of how i would be interpreted i'm going to be bound by how others have said we that the circuits the judges interpret it and so yeah but we don't decide cases using algorithms and just take all the united states supreme court cases and put them in and and they haven't addressed every issue very few cases get to the united states supreme court let me ask it again do you think the united states constitution should be interpreted according to the way that people understood it the time was adopted and if you don't that's cool some don't many don't what how do you think it should be interpreted it's a very simple question for a court of appeal nominee well um thank you senator i i think that the question actually is a little more complicated the the supreme court no it's not it's about as basic as you can get it's it's it's con law 101 i think i'm not trying to be disrespectful but and and i know both you know the thing now but with with all presidents republican and democrat is to coach the nominees but you're going to be on the court of appeal and confirmed and i'm asking you how do you interpret the constitution i oh i'm sorry i'm done i'm sorry no no i'm sorry senator no i think certainly the interpretation of the constitution has to start with with the text and to the extent that that's not to the extent that that's unambiguous that's what we work with but in terms of whether or not when there's lack of clarity and and uh there's a need to look to something else um i do think that in fact the president gives us a lot of examples let me try it again the problem may be mine the united states constitution do you think it should be interpreted according to the way that people understood it at the time it was adopted or another way i think there are many circumstances where it should be interpreted according to uh what people thought at the time it was done when well for instance in the case of heller the supreme court applied original meaning to determine uh the the scope of the second amendment right and so when shouldn't we apply original meaning i think when there are supreme court presidents that apply something uh have applied something in an original question i i'm sorry when on a on a situation or a right or a privilege that and i'm sorry to have to interrupt you but we have so little time um when do you under what circumstances do we not interpret the constitution according to the way that people understood it at the time it was adopted there are circumstances where the supreme court has not interpreted the constitution explicitly in that fashion and so i would always as a manager i would what example are you thinking about um well there are times in the context of uh judging what is cruel and unusual punishment under the eighth amendment where the supreme court has looked to that's a good example look to prevailing norms in in terms of uh interpreting let me just i got 15 seconds left i'm sorry let me try it again you get a constitutional case there's no precedent on it so you've got to interpret the constitution and i think i understand your testimony to be that sometimes we interpret the constitution according to the way that people understood it at the time the constitution was adopted and sometimes we don't how are you going to proceed how are you going to decide which of those philosophies you're going to to use on a particular case thank you senator there's no precedent i i think that when there is not uh i think the circumstances where there's not going to be either uh controlling or at the least instructive precedent from the supreme court or from the second circuit i think is is fairly rare and so i can't say in the abstract well if this is the philosophy that i would apply because again i'd be driven by what the precedent says and so i can't give you a specific judicial philosophy i'm way over listen i'm going to send you both a letter i can't vote for you if i don't know and i didn't get a chance to talk to you mrs ross i can't vote for you if i don't know how you're going to what approach you're going to use to interpret the united states constitution and i don't believe for a second you both haven't thought about it you couldn't have gotten through law school without thinking about it so i need to know what you think about it okay thank you for your time and i'm sorry i didn't interrupt no

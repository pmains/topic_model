well North Dakota Senator John Hoeven does not want to hear that Republican on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and Senator how are you good morning to you couple couple simple and basic questions make your final pitch why is this right for America feel we're setting the bill up right now even as we speak but look this is about energy it's about jobs it's about economic growth and it's about national security through energy security and that's why the American people overwhelmingly supported well the president says he'll veto it what is that veto mean senator it's hard to believe as Josh earnest himself said now we're perplexed because the president's held this project up for over six years all six states on the route have approved it Congress has approved it with an overwhelming bipartisan majority in both the House and the Senate and the American people support it so clearly the president is you know he's responding to special interest groups uh-huh is this the end of the line for Keystone then senator certainly not we'll try to override the veto we've got 63 votes in the Senate right now we need to try to get four more we're working on that we can't override the veto then we'll attach it to another bill that we think you won't veto okay so you have what your four votes on the Senate right at last count I think you're about a six to ten votes shy of the house to at my home again this is this is not veto proof is it no it's not but we're not that far away they had two hundred and seventy plus votes in the house we're not too far away and we're only for short in the Senate but again we can also attach it to other legislation that I think he may not want to veto such as it could be another energy bill it could be an infrastructure bill or even maybe an appropriations measure okay and when would that happen well we'll see i expected he'll veto it very soon here we'll talk to our colleagues in the house as well as our colleagues on the other side of the aisle about a veto override and then make a decision as to we go that direction or in fact attach it to other leg okay what will stand by on that you know canada did their deal in 2009 that was six years ago you've been waiting this long and it looks like you will continue to wait at which begs the question as to whether or not this pipeline will ever be built what do you think of that you know well because we need the right mix of pipeline rail and road to move energy safely and cost-effectively and because we're producing more energy and we're working with Canada we're creating energy security for this country we're bringing prices down at the pump and you know when the president vetoes this legislation OPEC wins it puts them back in the saddle because it hurts our ability to produce more energy here at home and work with Canada and that's why the American people support what we're doing not just this pipeline but building our energy future in this country why are environmentalists against that because they're mainly against fossil fuels they want to transition all the new fuels and I'm for all different sources of fuels but we have to compete out there and we have to make the allow this new investment in infrastructure and new technologies that help us produce more energy more cost-effectively more dependably and with better environmental stewardship jumbaye we're doing at john bainer mitch mcconnell say it's purely political I don't expect based on your answers here that you would disagree with that oh that's absolutely right and again let's do what the American people want and they want energy security they want us to build this infrastructure and produce more energy here at home not continue to depend on OPEC well let's see if the Keystone lives to see another day senator thank you for your time out of North Dakota John hoping with us today thank you thanks Bill

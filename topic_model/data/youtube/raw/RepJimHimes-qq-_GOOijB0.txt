what you see behind me is the michael morano bridge it carries six lanes of 95 between new york and boston and through the state of connecticut it collapsed in 1983 killing three individuals and just devastating the quality of life in the economy for this community it's an abject lesson in what happens when we don't invest in our infrastructure immediately in front of me is a bridge which carries the amtrak and metro north tracks between new york and boston tracks on which too many of my constituents have been delayed and their safety put at risk because of under investment in the infrastructure which makes this country work for too long we have broken the tradition of our forefathers by not investing in those things which allow our economy to grow and to thrive and which allow our people to do well in the next 17 days i will visit the 17 towns of my district pointing out areas where investment will actually lead to the creation of jobs and lead to better quality of life for everybody here we don't want a repeat of the mianis river bridge and we want to make the investments that will allow for jobs to be created and people to be successful here in the 4th district of connecticut you

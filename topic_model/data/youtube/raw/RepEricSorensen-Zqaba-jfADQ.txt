OBJECTION, THE GENTLEMAN FROM ILLINOIS IS RECOGNIZED FOR ONE MINUTE. >> THIS PAST SUNDAY WE MARKED THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF ROE V. WADE. I REMAIN OUTRAGED BY THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION TO RIP AWAY THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO SAFE AND LEGAL ABORTION. ALREADY STATES HAVE IMPLEMENTED ABORTION BANS, LEAVING WOMEN DESPERATE TO ACCESS REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. THANKFULLY STATES LIKE ILLINOIS HAVE ACCESS STILL AVAILABLE. IN THE WAKE OF THE SUPREME COURT'S EXTREME DECISION, I'VE HEARD FROM WOMEN ALL ACROSS CENTRAL AND NORTHWESTERN ILLINOIS, MOTHERS AND GRANDMOTHERS, WHO ARE DEVASTATED THAT THEIR DAUGHTERS AND GRANDDAUGHTERS WILL GROW UP IN A COUNTRY WITH FEWER RIGHTS THAN THEY HAD. I TELL THEM THAT I WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING FOR A WORLD WHERE EVERYONE HAS THE FREEDOM TO MAKE THEIR OWN HEALTH CARE DECISIONS. UNCLE SAM HAS NO PLACE IN A DOCTOR'S OFFICE. FINALLY, TO THE WOMEN IN MY DISTRICT AND ACROSS THIS GREAT NATION, I'M WITH YOU. AND I WILL FIGHT FOR YOUR RIGHTS AND THAT YOUR FREEDOMS ARE PROTECTE

thank you I let me just add you've heard from my colleagues first of all thank you to leader Pelosi and Schumer thank you to all of you for being here today and your commitment and let me just say because people ask me what would you tell the dreamers and these families in your state I would tell them you belong here because that's what this is about we have all met with these members these kids these families in our communities they are not numbers they are not graphs they are real people that are contributing in our communities and I will tell you to a tutti every single one of them that I have met with they are working hard they are putting themselves through school they're paying for it they are going home to help their parents with their jobs they are committed to doing everything that they can to be integral part of our communities and they are not getting recognition for that let me just say this these kids are phenomenal and the ones that I have met with are too afraid to even tell their story because they're afraid to come forward they're afraid that when they leave that home that day when they come home their parents may not be there I don't know about all of you but I did not grow up that way and why why would we put kids and families in our community who go to our churches who are in our grocery stores who are in our schools who are our neighbors and our friends why would we make them live a dual life why would we treat them differently what we are doing here today is saying enough it is time to pass the DREAM Act it is time to talk about the benefits of immigrants in our community I am here today because my grandfather and great-grandfather's came to this country and had the courage to come to this country and my story is no different than anyone elses so why do we shut the door behind us it is time to keep that door wide open it's time to pass this act and let me say one final thing which I hear constantly there are over 12,000 12,000 dreamers in Nevada alone and they contribute over 500 million dollars to the state of Nevada in our economy you've heard the statistics that if we are to deport them and their families we're gonna lose a billion dollars billions of dollars in this economy that's why the business is supported in my state and across this country that's why the farmers that's why the cattle ranchers you name it across this country support passing comprehensive immigration reform and keeping these families here but let me let me throw this out here because this is a misnomer and this is not a true fact the dreamers here are contributing to our economy and they are not depressing wages and they are not taking away others jobs I'm telling you that right now and we've got proof in Nevada alone in Nevada alone not only did a Republican governor pass legislation to allow dreamers and these families to have a driver's license to get to their jobs we passed a lot to allow them to become teachers in our communities because we know we have a teacher shortage across the country that's what this is about so it's time for President Trump and those men that I hear on TV to really show heart and work with us to pass the DREAM Act it is time to stop the discrimination the divisive rhetoric there's no room for it in the White House there's no room for it anywhere and it is time to move forward I cannot thank you all enough for being here and thank you to my colleagues across both both houses of Congress we are gonna get this done and we are not going to stop fighting until we make this happen so thank you for coming here today

that would help us do that right now I'll yield to mr. Pascrell the ranking member for his opening statement Thank You chairman Riker for holding the hearing today and I want to thank mr. all in mr. Citroen mr. Owen is the executive assistant commissioner correct me if I'm wrong the office of field operations US Customs and Border Protection thank you for being here today and Robert citron who is vice president of network operations in the US postal office so you're at the heart of what we're talking about today so thank you both every day in the United States 115 Americans lose their lives to opiates we're trying to attack the problem from every direction possible in 2016 my home state New Jersey alone experienced 2056 lives lost to this epidemic the New Jersey turned Jones office predicts that the number this year could surpassed 3,000 one of the ways that synthetic opioid said make their way into the United States is through the mail fentanyl and Alesi synthetic opioid that is extremely deadly primarily comes from China fentanyl is frequently sold online shipped to the United States in very small quantities making it hard to detect these sellers are incredibly easy to find online and there's evidence of multiple fatalities in which the victim received fentanyl to the mouth from China ports of entry are a critical juncture in the flow of synthetic opiates just across the river from my district in New York City the Postal Service receives international mail at one of these five international service centers the Postal Service receives an astronomical volume of mail handling an estimated 275 million international packages in one year given this high volume of international shipments more data is needed for international shipments to much synthetic opioids at the ports of entry before they enter our country and devastate so many of our communities to address the vulnerability I was proud to sponsor the synthetics trafficking in overdose prevention or the stop act with my friend congressman patty berry and we miss him ranking member Neil of the entire committee this bill would require the Postal Service to transmit advanced electronic data to Customs and Border Patrol on international shipments into the United States this information typically includes the name the address of the shipper the recipient as well as the contents of the package what CBP identify shipments that may pose a risk they can place a hold on the shipment notify carriers that a package must be presented for examination this data will help CBP identify and stop the shipments of synthetic opiates coming from China and other countries around the world I understand that CBP and the US Post Office have some concerns with the stop act as it currently stands but I'm confident that we can work on a bipartisan basis to adjust these concern maintain a robust mechanism that ensures that the CBP in USPS are held accountable for collecting data on international shipments the Postal Service and Customs have already put in place a pilot program that has made great progress in the transmission of this electronic data the program began in 2014 I believe at JFK International Service Center in New York and the Postal Service was able to secure data from foreign posts on certain international packages CBP then targeted a small amount of mail each day for the Postal Service to locate and provide to CBP for this inspection I understand that in 2017 the CBP and Postal Service expanded the pilot program entered bilateral agreements with several foreign posts including China which accounts for nearly two thirds of international mail in the United States in 2017 Customs and Border Patrol seized more than 1,100 pounds of fentanyl this rate doubled over the year before however in Office of Inspector General report found in 2016 that under the pilot program the Postal Service had only presented around 80 percent of the packages targeted by CBP for inspection and the majority more than 60% of international packages received by the Postal Service had no advanced electronic data associated with them much of the data it did receive from foreign post was low-quality we also know that private carriers like UPS FedEx are already required to provide advanced electronic data but have separate requirements and receive only around one-fourth the volume about packages as the US Postal Service is my hope that with the continued progress of the pilot program and subsequently with the stop act passage we can address the remaining vulnerabilities within the system itself again I thank you both for being here today and insert it back to our Chairman Thank You mr. Pascrell today we're joined by two witnesses the first witness is mr. Todd

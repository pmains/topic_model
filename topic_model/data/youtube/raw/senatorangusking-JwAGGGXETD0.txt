jim let me uh let me start off on that or i should say congressman sorry um i think one thing the pandemic has taught us is that the unthinkable can happen a few have told us all a year ago we'd be wearing masks and it would be we'd have a large part of our economy having severe difficulty all the things that are happening it would have sounded like science fiction the unthinkable can happen and that's really what we're talking about here and i think one of the problems that our commission tried to attack head-on was the fact that's been alluded to today and and the prior question to mention this in terms of the the financial sector the energy sector the target is mostly in the private sector so the continuity of the economy the planning has to engage the private sector we have to determine what are the crucial elements what are the crucial sectors that need to be functioning no matter what and how do we ensure their protection i think this is one of our most important recommendations this is one that's in the senate bill i don't think it's in the house bill and hopefully we're going to be able to pull it through in the in the in the conference committee but uh we we've we've really got to be thinking about and and uh you know an announcer prevention is a is a pound of cure i mean we've got to be thinking about how to how to react when the unthinkable happens and if if every if everybody's pointing at one another and there's no uh plan on the shelf uh we're gonna be it's gonna be infinitely worse and take infinitely longer to recover so i think this is one of our most important recommendations and overall i think one of the most important insights of the commission was the extent to which we had to really forge a new relationship we have to think in a new way about how we relate uh how the government and the private sector relate in terms of sharing intelligence sharing uh attack data cooperating talking to allies i mean it's it's really a a very comprehensive approach to this and and i think that's one of the significant insights that we bring to the table in the report thank you mr chairman

you must speak I rise today to highlight yesterday's Democratic steering and Policy Committee hearing on the failure of trickle-down economics and the war on poverty the hearing highlighted the daily hardships faced by more than 46 million Americans we know that too many families struggle to buy healthy food pay rent and access a good paying job I was very proud that among the witnesses at the hearing all of whom were phenomenal was my constituent oakland resident violet Henderson who shared her personal story of overcoming poverty and after leaving unfortunately the criminal justice system after being thorough she gave us her story told her stories she's a phenomenal individual raising her two children and is a student she succeeded against overwhelming odds her story is a powerful of resilience and dedication which so many struggling Americans have its peak it should be a call to action for members of Congress to help more people like violent with supporting policies that will end poverty yet our Republican colleagues continue to promote harmful cuts to critical safety net programs despite knowing that these cuts would push more families over the edge and the record of members on speaker Ryan's so called Task Force on poverty opportunity and upward mobility Spurs are just as bad if not worse time and time again they voted to cut lamp he wrote higher education funding Pell grants and weaken affordable action programs I ask unanimous consent to insert violet Henderson's record testimony into the record

given the events in the last couple of weeks in financial markets leading the administration is secretary yellen do you think she needs to recuse herself from this well i don't know if she needs to recuse herself but what i want to see from uh secretary ellen is a little bit of uh caution and deliberation and not a lot of overreaction to this the broader markets are are are doing just fine obviously there was volatility with respect to reddit fueled trades on game stock and other amc and other uh equities but that's actually as a result of the advent of zero cost trading and the democratization of access to the capital markets that's not a bad thing and i think what you're seeing is the market's actually functioning fairly well with market discipline setting in both uh with the hedge funds we're learning a lot about uh zero cost trading and the influx of day trading and what that means for their short positions it means that short squeezes are very possible and i think there's market discipline that will set in with these hedge funds and professional wall street professionals on the other hand i think a lot of the day traders and the small investors are learning about capitalism learning that fundamentals matter learning that earnings and valuation matter and that on the downside of this rally as as investors get in too late in the rally and as they get too far away from valuation there is a big risk associated with that too so the market is actually working of course it's appropriate for the sec and congress to look at whether or not any laws have been violated from a market manipulation standpoint but to me at this point doesn't look like any illegal activity and certainly doesn't look like any systemic risk

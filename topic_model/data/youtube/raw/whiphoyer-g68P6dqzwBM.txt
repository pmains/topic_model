judge Dingle John the third Jennifer Gabriel Romi Robin Jim jewel it is hard at this point in time after three extraordinary speakers not to be redundant and I'm sure I will be John Dingle was known by all of you here there's nothing there for that I can tell you about Jane done John Dingle that you don't already know we know of course John Dingle like all of us was not perfect none of us are but we know how very very good he was we know that as what that is why he kept getting re-elected to Congress more than any person in the history of our country elected to do the people's work in the people's house and what an extraordinary record he achieved in the almost 60 years he served John Dingell made a profound difference on behalf of millions of his fellow citizens and indeed people around the world he was fair-minded but as has been said and all of you know he was tough very tough many have known his fierce and biting judgment many too will recall as has been said his gentle soul he was intolerant of evil intolerant of injustice intolerant of malfeasance and incompetence and made sure everyone knew it at the same time he was an advocate and fighter for tolerance Jim Clyburn you know that like all of you I saw his great strength his peak and his extraordinary extraordinary adoration of the lovely Deborah like you I saw him as a man of both complexity and yes simplicity a man who served so well his country his family his state his community the House of Representative and we his colleagues that's how all of us knew John Dingell when I first arrived in Congress John had already been there for over a quarter of a century and I had the privilege of serving with him for 33 years like many of the freshmen at the time I saw him as larger than life he was imposing yes intimidating he was as John Lewis said chairman John Dingell seemingly unapproachable at the time it made me think of an old country ballad sung by Tennessee Ernie Ford it told of a giant of a man who held up the buckling timber in a collapsing mind allowing all others in that mind to escape Big John that minor was called John Dingle was to us freshmen our very own Big John a larger-than-life figure who had raised up the institution of the house as a legislator and as a leader in our party as the years passed and I got to know John the man not only as an the Chairman and as it turned out he was approachable who knew he was I discovered as so many of you did as tender as he was tenacious and he became a dear dear friend Thank You Debby for allowing me to say a few words I never stopped looking up to him as a senior colleague even as he became my dear friend he continued to be Big John to all of us with whom he served and Big John was a master of the house as has been said on occasion he would unabashedly use his power as a chairman to cut through the confusion on an issue and impose his will when he believed it to be morally correct thing to do he once gambled a committee meeting to adjournment right before he was about to lose the vote declaring you may have the votes but I've got the gavel and more often than not he ultimately got the votes - John liked and respected every member with whom he served for having been elected by their neighbors to represent them in the Congress that is at least until they gave John a reason not to he never minced words he never held back sincere earnest determined courageous persuasive bulld indefatigable at times acerbic say Amen the voices you just heard are those who knew that personally and so many times of course gentle and encouraging the lobby showed those of us who were his colleagues was often tough love he loved us sometimes with soft words and sometimes with sharp elbows Democrats and Fred as you pointed out Republicans alike John handed out barbs as often as he handed out punch key those are polish doughnuts if I mispronounced it I apologize and how fortunate we were to have both from the biting letters he wrote to his pointed questioning of witnesses from his unyielding advocacy for legislation ahead of its time to his tweets so undeniably of their time deep inside the man we found an immeasurable determination to make the House of Representatives his state of Michigan and his beloved America a better place he used his time in the office to do exactly that John fundamentally understood what the House of Representatives can be when it's at its best he saw it as an engine by which representatives can transform love of country into the tools of justice and security and opportunity for the people we serve we all know the tools he helped fashion healthcare reform Medicare the Clean Air Act Safe Drinking Water Act Endangered Species Act Civil Rights voting rights support for all working families and in particular of course michigan's auto workers whom he loved and who loved him his respect and admiration for working people were manifested in his dedication to the men and women who build our cars and to the United States Auto Workers he was their steadfast champion and in doing so champion in the hopes and dreams of every working American the list of legislation shaped by his hand stretches as long as his unrivaled tenure early last week called and said that John wasn't doing so well so I got on a plane last Wednesday and flew to Michigan Debbie greeted me at the door in Dearborn she of course was the love of John's life their love of their love affair was an example of devotion and support john told everyone each of us I'm sure that Debra the lovely Debra her first name is lovely a lovely Deborah was his strength his steady hand and his most important visor inclusive and oh how justifiably proud he was that she was continuing the legendary Dingell service in the Congress of the United States I spent two and a half hours with John that late afternoon John brought low by age and illness was still the lion-hearted center of energy and outraged about the wrongs that he saw his sense of humor still intact his concern for the house and for our country was his fervent as ever we've talked for an hour about what was what had been and what should be he had a deep concern for the future of our country we expressed which he expressed in his last words for America in it he wrote this as I prepare to leave this all behind I now leave you in control of the greatest nation of mankind and pray God gives you the wisdom to understand the responsibility you hold in your hands a little later sandy Levin joined John and me as well as Debbie and John Orlando one of his closest friends sandy and John reminisced about so many of the Crusades pursued by the Dingell and Levin families and their allies I was amazed at the sharpness of his memory Sandy's brother Senator Carl Levin observed in 2005 that and I quote the story of John Dingell is the story of the hopes of the American people of the last 50 years and my church would say Amen again John Dingle indeed was a dreamer and thankfully for us he was also a doer before I left I kissed him on the forehead and told him I love you John and I knew I spoke for all of his colleagues as well he knew the end was there nearing I don't know that any of us knew it was 24 hours less but even if the threshold of death he was in command he was concerned he was ready for the next day the next tweet the next fight as Debbie said he was classic John Dingle and that is how I will always remember him our dear and loyal friend a great American a great member of the House and a very good and decent man Godspeed Big John [Applause]

well one of the big reasons that I'm delighted to be here helping Jim Hagedorn today is that I feel guilty that I didn't help him enough last time frankly if more of us would have gotten up and off the cut couches last time Jim would be our congressman today so I'm encouraging everyone to get up do their part become a real member of the Civic Society and help Jim Hagedorn become our next congressman you'll be glad you did

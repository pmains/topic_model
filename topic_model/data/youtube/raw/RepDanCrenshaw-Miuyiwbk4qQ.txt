we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw welcome back folks uh special episode today shorter one where i'm gonna start uh posting some of the hearings that we do give you an idea of what that uh five minutes of fame is like um you only get five minutes to question witnesses when they come in on any given subject and so what i'll use these little episodes for is we'll go ahead and play the the hearing um and then i'll i'll add some additional explanations on top of that and just to give you an idea of what we're talking about why we disagree where we disagree and where to go from here so this particular hearing was on the clean future act so this is the democrats um i would say legislative agenda to implement the principles of the green new deal but there's a lot of problems with it i lay out some of them in this particular hearing to have a listen thank you mr chairman thank you all for being here like i want to focus on costs and benefits and trade-offs policy making is about trade-offs necessary solutions and when you have a preferred solution in mind well that there's a large incentive to exaggerate problems exaggerate benefits associated with that solution and diminish the costs associated with that so there's a lot of things to cover here i want to hit the transition of jobs there's the supposed transition of jobs the reality is that this bill creates one job and that is a director of a task force that would have that would supposedly transition workers um to green energy jobs the the problem is this has already been acknowledged in this hearing that if there's no opportunity on the other end of that well these these government programs never work the washington post had to fact check john kerry using girl labor statistics data when john kerry claimed that the fastest growing jobs in america or some of them were renewable energy jobs here's the thing by percentage-wise that might be true but in reality when you actually look at the absolute absolute numbers it's only about 10 000 new jobs over the next 10 years here's the other thing these jobs on average pay about 20 000 less than oil and gas jobs this idea that we're just going to transition jobs is a myth it is a fantasy i want to hit on the buy clean uh program and this question will be um directed to ms dell just a quick question if the plane was implemented perfectly okay we didn't lose any industry let's say which of course is quite the assumption how much would we actually reduce carbon emissions thanks so much for the question the first thing i would say is that one of the most important uh aspects of biclean is that it has no incentive whatsoever to offshore production exactly the same standards are applied to overseas production please answer the question if we had an hour i would love to talk with you but please answer the question that i asked sure that's all i wanted to say um and so building materials uh in the us represent um a few percent of our total emissions so if we brought those to zero we might see an impact of a few hundred million tons absolutely okay so a few percent meaning three percent of u.s emissions well that depends very sensitively on how much money congress decides to spend on infrastructure let's say it's 10 all right let's say we reduce u.s emissions by 10 percent u.s emissions account for about 15 of global emissions this would equal about 1 decrease in global emissions which is kind of nothing practically speaking at a huge cost i realize you claim that there's no cost to this i i i notice you said that in your testimony too but you did not cite any references do you have any references now for why there would be no cost have you consulted with industry about this yeah so in my written testimony there are extensive footnotes which provide all the numbers um but uh i didn't say there would be no costs i said the cost would be very modest so this witness is a democrat witness she works with an environmental organization and i i like this exchange because it really gets to the crux of the debate which is about trade-offs and the the case that i make isn't that we don't need to reduce carbon emissions i am i i work on a lot of ways to reduce carbon emissions the the case we're making here is what benefit are you getting by the actions you're taking and at what cost now they make this claim that this is uh she says practically no cost um and and and that's just not true um uh you can talk to any industrial manufacturers because what we're really talking about here is manufacturing of of of materials like cement and steel and this this contributes um to carbon emissions of course uh it's it's a high-intensity production process to say that you can just uh radically change the way you manufacture these things is it's a it's a bit utopianistic thinking um it would certainly make us uh less competitive with other countries and probably ensure that we have to then import these materials uh from abroad in order to stay competitive um this would dramatically raise prices on things like highways um buildings uh everything we use uh to that we use these materials for so these are things you have to take into account um when you're making policy now if we were just if we were saving everybody's life by doing it then obviously that you know no cost would be too great but the thing is and this was the point i was making with her is well how much would you really produce emissions and she noted well they only account for a few percent of u.s emissions in the first place now you're not going to get to zero carbon um uh industrial production you know that was one point she made but that's just and maybe if you offset it in other ways which is which is how they get to that zero carbon number but that's a very very dramatic reduction in reality uh with some of the plans they're implementing you know you might decrease emissions there by a few percentage points as she noted and i gave her say hey what if it was 10 percentage points what if it was what if it was actually much larger even then you might reduce global emissions by one percent or less which really has no effect on on the climate um that's what we're getting at right it's a trade-off what is the cost and and what is the benefit um you tend to outsource jobs here we're outsourcing production and which by the way probably increases emissions vastly because when you outsource that production places like china they're already manufacturing with higher emissions than we do they just have less regulations in general less labor regulations less environmental regulations so it's more than just u.s jobs lost with that outsourcing it's also an increase in emissions that occurs this is the case we're always making when we talk about seeding energy dominance to russia and saudi arabia you know you can put our oil and gas industry out of business here and feel like you're doing something good for the environment but the reality is global demand for oil and gas resources this will still increases by about 25 over the next 20 years somebody's going to meet that demand and it's going to be countries that operate their refineries and operate their production uh in a much less clean way than than americans do i people have to realize that the holistic approach here you got to take everything into account that's what i was pointing out in that particular clip let's move on to the next one on plastic manufacturing where there's going to be a pause on new plants in the next three years honest question what what benefits do we expect from doing that is the benefit directed towards emissions or plastics recycling are we afraid plastics are going in the ocean what is the expected benefit uh so i was not invited to testify on the plastics title of the bill and does any other witness um want to answer that question okay well i'm going to say it's both right i'm going to say that maybe maybe my colleagues are expecting both okay so it's emissions and we don't like plastic in the oceans i don't like emissions i want to reduce emissions i also don't like plastic in the oceans here's the thing let's look at this study danish ministry of environment and food found that you'd have to use a cotton bag 20 000 times just to have less environmental impact than a simple plastic bag now look i'm a millennial i take that cotton bag to whole foods i do but i know i'm virtue signaling i know that it's actually bad for the environment um we need to acknowledge this reality in california you can't get a plastic bag here's the other thing if we're concerned about plastic in the oceans let's be honest you're in america your straw isn't going into the ocean it just isn't 10 rivers contribute to 90 percent of plastic in the oceans it's not your straw uh mr sunday my limited time left can you hit this this um this theme of the costs that are being ignored uh by this bill sure i think uh broadly speaking we see significant public intervention in marketplace you see a glut of the thing that the government's trying to buy and scarcity and high prices for the things that the market actually needs so that's been an underexplored aspect of all this if private companies uh management wanted to make a significant change that we would need to see some modeling some analysis uh some real extensive understanding of trade-offs uh before we would jump on that sort of massive shift in approach on the private side so um from where we sit in pennsylvania again we've done everything we should be doing in terms of air quality energy costs and manufacturing and we want to see those trends continue thank you and i uh yield back no time thank you mr chairman uh the gentleman yields back so what i was hitting on in that line of questioning was uh what's in this bill which basically uh bans new plastic manufacturing uh three-year paws on it and i asked a very simple question which nobody wanted to answer uh they didn't want to take the bait i guess but um the question is why right like why why do this um we we need to take a step back sometimes and think to ourselves okay what is wrong with plastic okay it doesn't it doesn't degrade um like a like a biodegradable substance would and so we view this as bad now it's only bad if it ends up in the forest or the ocean or somewhere where we don't want it where it's harming wildlife i think we would all agree with that plastic in the ocean drives me nuts i mean it really does um and so you know my goal is to prevent plastic from going into the ocean that should be our goal this doesn't meet that goal and it's not clear that it would uh reduce emissions either and uh you know for for the example i gave there was when you when you produce something that isn't plastic for a simple a simple product such as a a carrying bag well you actually end up with far more emissions um if you're not using plastic then the question is what do you use instead um look i i think it's a good idea for you to to to use larger water bottles um containers as opposed to single-use plastic bottles i can get behind that that makes sense maybe just refill your your your reusable water bottle container instead of buying a new one every time this this isn't the craziest thing in the world i'm not against that um but you can't just ban the manufacturing you still need these things i would have never had access to drinking water in iraq and afghanistan if we didn't have plastic all right it's plastic is synonymous with hygiene it's what allows it's what has allowed many people to make it out of poverty um any medical devices to be made modern hospitals in um and medical devices are are extremely reliant on plastic and so what now we're going to we're going to outsource that development uh to other countries and then have to import it so this is what you got to think about when it comes to trade-offs what are you getting out of it nobody could tell me uh in that in that in that point could they um and at least they didn't want to debate me on it so i want to break down how this actually works and how in america we we manufacture plastic and um and why this this bill is a terrible idea um american petroleum natural gas is which is already heavy heavily regulated for environmental concerns it's shipped to the is shipped to the houston ship channel which is the world's largest petrochemical manufacturing facility so this means american petroleum is broken down and then made into plastic pellets these pellets are exported all around the world these factories are regulated by american safety regulations american environmental regulations and american labor laws additionally because of the shale boom america has become one of the cheapest producers of plastic so we're producing cheap clean and fair trade plastic and we're shipping it to other countries for advanced materials like plastic medical devices the production is actually done in the united states but for plast for basic plastic goods um you know your common toy that says made in china on the back those plastic pellets they're shipped from here to china another or another country and then they're shipped back for sale in the united states that's how that works this bill in the name of reducing emissions proposes to put a pause on all new plastic productions so okay so what would that do it would shift production of plastic to other countries who don't have the cleaner natural resources china produces plastics with coal because they don't have natural gas other countries use nafta oil which is not as high quality as american natural gas and ends up leading to poor quality products so again for for high quality things like biomedical devices you're not going to want to use that so shifting production of plastic to other countries it just ends up increasing global emissions doubles down on the cycle of human rights abuses and hamstrings american leadership in clean manufacturing and of course again quality is a concern american natural gas based plastic is recognized as a global standard in quality so it's an honest question do we want our medical devices to use poor quality products we in the last year we we uh we had a big problem because too much of our our our medical industry was being manufactured overseas ppe um some kind of drugs uh things like that so you know in a time where we want to be buying american and producing things here uh we actually have to mean what we say and uh these these two ideas of simply feel good plastic man and um and maintaining our leadership in clean quality plastic manufacturing these two ideas are in conflict and again what are you looking for what is the benefit that you're looking for nobody could seem to answer that it actually looks like those supposed benefits would be made worse um by by outsourcing this um one unintended consequence of this also is that it would ban advanced recycling because the democrats intent is to ban fossil fuels whether intentionally or just um you know based on ignorance on on how much fossil fuels are used and everything that they own this bill puts an end to advanced recycling so houston-based companies are innovating way ahead of this bill they're relying upon one of the basic laws of thermodynamics energy cannot be created nor destroyed it can only be transferred or changed into one form or another plastics are made with carbon and carbon can be broken down again into other resources we have people turning plastic into new forms of energy but that's banned under this bill as well local company huntsman for instance i don't know if you remember peter huntsman on the podcast they take in plastic bottles and they make insulation out of it so there's so many there's also waste reformation transformation technologies out there where you literally create energy based off of waste and they can they can pretty much use anything so you know this this bill is just poorly written it contradicts itself um section 911 of the bill that sets requirements for how much recycled plastic has to be in a product but section 902 and 903 which make it harder for there to even be recycled plastic in products it's um it's bad it's it's it's it's really irresponsible policy making to be honest another uh contradiction which i didn't get a chance to point out in the hearing was um or maybe it was a different hearing i get them all mixed up but but uh a big part of um the democrats plan for infrastructure is building out broadband uh republicans agree with that of course we have totally different ways on how we think the most efficient way is to do it but it's worth pointing out that one of the democrats want to spend hundreds of another hundred billion dollars on laying down fiber optic cable to every home in america yeah that which is probably an inefficient way to get everybody broadband but but that's part of their plan but here's the thing you have to have plastic in the fiber optic cable uh to make it work so again very contradicting policy you know which is it do you want millions of miles worth of fiber optic cable or do you want to ban plastic which one is it um you know it just it just doesn't work another huge part of the clean future plan is is a massive amount of money for uh renewable energy the total on this bill is about 565 billion dollars there's elements of the bill that say you know 40 of the funds associated with renewables must be used to benefit environmental justice communities um whatever that means and look i they use this word a lot environmental justice uh i like to i like to counter that with talking about energy justice in a 100 renewable electrified grid um you don't have any energy justice because you have no reliability you're investing tens of millions of billions of dollars into inherently unreliable energy time after time we've seen this not work it doesn't work in germany where they've spent [Music] depends on the estimate you're looking at some say trillions sometimes it's 600 billion but they had their own form of a green new deal resulted in higher emissions per capita and they end up importing natural gas from russia to maintain the energy needs that they that they have so look this stuff doesn't work you've heard me talk a lot about the issues on the texas grid and one of the big problems we have is an under investment in base load energy that's gas coal and nuclear and um the more you invest in wind turbines even though it's a good investment because there's a federal tax credit that's very lucrative and we have a pricing structure at airco here in texas that that does benefit renewables over over more reliable base load energy so it'll continue to be a good investment but listen you're always going to have to be able to power your entire grid off of um or on demand and wind is never on demand sun the sun is never on demand we could talk about having enough battery power to store the energy when it's blowing and then and then and then use that energy when it's needed but look that's about four to six hours of energy um in modern batteries uh batteries do have a physical limit they're not going to get that much better it's not like microchips that just keep doubling in size every year that the same rules don't apply there are there are the the laws of physics still apply to wind capacity solar capacity and battery capacity they're not going to get that much better no sane person would agree that they are so that that that places some limitations on us and what i noticed in this bill was not a single investment in clean base load power what is clean base load power well nuclear for instance now nuclear is expensive there's lots of ways to make it less expensive we over regulate nuclear to an extraordinary degree we don't allow highly enriched uranium to be used in nuclear plants which would be much more efficient the the way we allow it to be used on nuclear submarines and nuclear aircraft carriers for instance and uh we're we've only just started to invest in next generation modular nuclear that has a lot of promise if we lose our ability to manufacture nuclear plants the chinese and the russians are going to take over the world with that they already are they're already selling their nuclear plants all over the world we are behind the power curve on this and this is how you get to zero carbon emissions while also providing energy justice to the people uh it's not just nuclear by the way uh we can invest in carbon capture technology that is proven to work it's a plant right outside houston that powers 5000 homes zero carbon natural gas powered plant that usually utilizes carbon capture uh to make it a zero carbon plant so like this stuff exists um there's really interesting uh technology on the horizon in the in geothermal right now geothermal is great if you're in iceland and your geology works well for geothermal but it doesn't work everywhere else um because of the advanced drilling techniques uh pioneered by the oil and gas industry there's some really interesting things on the horizon where you might be able to make geothermal work everywhere uh i mentioned waste wrap transformation or waste reformation plants earlier earlier as well they use trash to make energy um and uh these are they claim it's actually negative carbon so again there's it's not that we want no solutions it's that we want better solutions that are actually reliable and i question the intent of democrats on a lot of these uh policies it just it makes me think that they're either they either have a dogmatic religious adherence to the renewable sector or they're just so deeply entrenched in the special interest groups that provide lots and lots of money out of the renewable energy sector that they just they refuse to look at any other um potential solutions so that's why the clean future act doesn't make any sense hope you enjoyed it that was just just some highlights of what's in that bill and that hearing thanks for listening

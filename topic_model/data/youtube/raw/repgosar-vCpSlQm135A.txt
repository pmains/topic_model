well I thank the gentleman mr. Cummings you may have come in early that I want to address in the New York Times reported that the EPA unleashed a major lobbying campaign to rally comments and support for its new waters of the u.s. regulation you earlier went off on Lockheed Martin in regards to that at the application I have to tell you the EPA also disregarded the anti lobbying act and broke the law if you actually believe in what you were talking and preaching about I'd hope that you co-sponsored my removal of miss Gina McCarthy as EPA Administrator now back to those processes in here miss Richards I'm up here you're a CEO right yes sir so you do understand market penetration right well I mean I'm a non-profit CEO so but but you I mean you look at those numbers I mean all CEOs are looking at you know how they expand and and profit I mean you're obviously we don't profit so don't look tatics I don't actually look at how to profit but we do obviously look how to expand into areas particularly where there's understand unmet need okay I like that so your your market penetration in Arizona's different than your market penetration in New York State would you say I'm sure it is yeah you know there's three in Arizona and there's quite a few more in New York and there's a pretty good web of preventive services so I kind of want to go back in your annual report report said 117 point six three million in excess revenues for the year fiscal year of 2013-2014 that number has jumped eighteen point five million from its report in 2009-2010 I'd like you to tell me how you got the growth of those funds why we're seeing such a growth in those that profit well we're a it's not prom so let me just be pursuit really clear just in terms of terminology it's not profit it is actually it's revenue that we we use for services so so so an exam so would we agree that its excesses of revenue over expenses correct okay explain that right it's from fundraising that's what I spend a lot of my time doing and so there are areas of the country where we want to expand to your question about if you only have one health center in a state and you think that there's more need so we are involved currently in raising money and spending it just opened a new health center gave me a great answer I mean I can give you several examples to fundraise and I think that so but we fundraise specifically to expand service I understand so what are you looking to report in 2014 I'm sorry what's that so what's that number in 2014 I don't have all the mean we've provided I'm sorry thousand it's actually going up it's actually going up to 127 127 million in regards to us so there's an escalating aspect so you're pretty good CEO so you're looking at excess revenues over over expenses so that's pretty good I'm having trouble in all this in in regards to the fundraising application particularly when I look at these numbers the 80% reduction in prenatal care services the 54 the 7% reduction in cancer screenings preventive services the 45% reduction in breast exams on and on and on and on and by the way I was a dentist so I do understand Medicaid reimbursement rates they don't pay right correct okay so well I blogs on this they're lucky you're lucky if you get reimbursed your cost well and actually I would say since you since you do understand Medicaid as you know it's it varies in all 50 states and so we do raise money over expenses in order to supplement the faucet and Medicaid Services let me ask you a question with a with a mediator what have you been able to facilitate or a lump cost for the price of contraceptives is there a unit price that you've been able to lower down to get a price fixed and you give me that number I don't I know I actually don't and I don't report them to it's being reported by those numbers that it's about three dollars that you're paying for the average contraceptive actually I I really I don't want it's it's very much all over the map as you know and it depends on on the average and so it's not I I really actually well very only in current because right a profit Center because what ends up happening you're reimbursed by the federal government and Medicaid at $35 right so if we're truly looking at mediation and spreading the wealth of the pharmaceuticals when we get a break we ought to pass on don't you agree well as you now know don't you agree because I facilitates more services does it not miss Richards our entire focus is on serving as many patients as we can so your example is not exactly true coz what you've done now and the reason I can show this is if you've narrowed the focus what we end up happening is there's very few primary care Doc's out there because they can't afford to stay in practice so what you've done is narrow the scope of the practice so where there's profit centers you know is my time this is my time so don't interrupt it and so from that standpoint what you've done is narrowed that focus so that you're profiting off death because the numbers the way you're making that profit Center is actually off abortions and that's appalling to me so thank you very much thank thank the gentleman well now we're

era Congressman Jim Himes joins us a member of the House Intelligence Committee he was in today's Michael Cohen hearing so congressman harms Lanny Davis says the Cohen him third the false line about the Trump Tower Moscow time line is that your understanding as well that it was Cohen and not in fact the president's attorneys well understand I can't get into the specifics of what has been discussed and now the two days in which Michael Cohen has testified before my committee but remember that statement that is in question here the statement that was used by the special counsel to ultimately get Michael Cohen to plead guilty to lying to my committee was a deep and rich statement with all sorts of dates and and and and and people and and mentions and of course at the time as you know Michael Cohen was part of a joint defense agreement right and so it's not crazy to infer that a lot of people would have looked at that statement but obviously Michael Cohen when he gave that statement to the Congress he knew that that date was incorrect so any of the president's attorneys who reviewed Cohen's statement do you or does your committee plan on calling them to testify well at least the chairman said today it was a very productive day and I know this is frustrating but we want to keep the lord as well you can say the subject is as private as we get partly because by the way as a result of today's testimony the committee may very well call in additional people and if we call in additional people we don't necessarily want them knowing exactly what it was that Michael Cohen said so when the chairman said it was a productive day I think it's I think what he meant and I think what is fair to say is that we learn new things Michael Cohen said today that he brought new documents the Chairman confirmed that we saw new documents that pertained to to when Michael Cohen told the committee the Trump tower building had stopped being the project had stopped so we did see a lot of new information as a result of that new information we may very well call additional witnesses what do you have a sense of what the timetable of the investigation for the committee is I mean the plan you know to wrap this up in a matter of months or we longer well remember we started when we regained the majority when the Democrats regained the majority we restarted the investigation which then chairman Nunez had ended prematurely and we know it's prematurely because of course the special counsel subsequent to the closing of our investigation has charged any number of people it's clear that we were lied to and so what I will tell you Anderson is that we started with let's find out more about the lies that we're told to my committee that's of course what we've done with Michael Cohen and without betraying the details of what we learned today and last week there is an awful lot more for us to do associated with the lies that Michael Cohen told the Congress and you might fairly infer that those that has to do with the possibility that somebody along the way was looking to assist or or did assist in in Michael Cohen's crime of line to Congress so when we spoke with you last week we just learned that the House Intelligence Committee was going to request Allen weiselberger the Trump Organization CFO who's been there a very long time to testify can you say what the status of that is right now has contact been made have you gotten any response from him I don't know that what I do know and we said this last week is that it is it is it continues to be our intention to bring in Felix a door Felix aider of course being the individual who worked in the Trump organizations office had a relationship with Michael Cohen and obviously with Donald Trump I believe it is still the intention to have him in next week I don't know if it's an open hearing that was the original idea but that remains the next step for this investigation in the house and on the subject importance number one did you talk about them with Michael Kohn and number two if you did can you say if the issue of a pardon was first raised by Cohen's attorneys or the president's attorney yeah and I don't want to get into that I know that the press has been reporting a lot about that today and of course Michael Cohen hinted in previous testimony that there might have been some issues there let me just leave it by saying that the question of whether there were pardons offered to Michael Cohen is a question there's been out there for a long time and it is still very much out there and and I just wanted to ask you about what we started this broadcast with the New York Times obtaining six checks written from president Trump's Michael Cohen to pay off stormy doing it while in office in the Oval Office I assume do you think there is any legal or constitutional exposure there well of course there is I mean those checks are interesting because those checks and the fact that Donald Trump made a payment to reimburse Michael Cohen for paying off a porn star in order to avoid a story you know I know Rudy Giuliani is really interested in the question of whether that was personal or political I think anybody looking at that would say trying to stop a story that you had an affair with a porn star something that would certainly be material to Americans decisions on how they vote for president you know not only is that a big deal in and of itself but simply doing it is a violation of the law and doing it from the White House remember Bill Clinton was impeached in the mid 90s for lying about an affair but Bill Clinton didn't you know write hush money checks while he was in the White House so yes of course we're in a tough spot here because there is now very clear evidence that the the president may have committed a serious crime wall president of the United States and just lastly I've been thinking about something that you said last week on the program after Cohan testified in front of the committee you said the Republicans under your committee didn't do the sort of castigating of Cohen that we saw the Republicans in the House Oversight Committee doing which was an open hearing I wonder did that did that apply today did the treatment of Cohen applied to Devin Nunez as well yeah again I without getting into the details of the hearing of course the what happened these last two days with Michael Cohen behind closed doors could not have been more different than what you saw in front of the Oversight Committee with cameras running Republicans bringing posters out none of that happened in fact it was you know fairly boring procedurally and as much as question after question after question God asked the Republicans participate again I don't want to get into the details of what was said and done but the Republicans I think are mainly I think they understand they're in a little bit of a box because you know as they did before the American people saying Michael Cohen you have no credibility you're a bad guy you're a criminal and stuff well the sentence number two behind that is this is a guy who worked for the president for ten years and oh by the way was a finance chairman of the Republican Party so that

president now let me start today by congratulating our colleagues on the environmental Public Works Committee on which I serve on the Banking Committee the Commerce Committee Finance Committee who I also serve on the recent appointments of a house-senate conference to attempt to produce a final product for a multi-year transportation plan for our country I am a strong supporter as are many of my colleagues of investments in our nation's roads highways bridges and transit systems I've been that for 15 years as a senator for eight years before that as a governor and four years before that as someone who's focused on economic development job creation within the state of Delaware I am pleased on the one hand that after too many years mr. president of short-term extensions and transportation funding we are set to make rebuilding and modernizing our country's transportation systems a long-term national priority again God knows we need to however I regret that we still have and i still have deep concerns for how Congress has decided to pay for these investments for decades for decades we have a paid for our transportation systems our roads or highways bridges or transit systems through the use of user fees in the form of federal excise taxes in some cases on gasoline and diesel fuel they've support our nation's funding of our nation's transportation system for over half a century over 50 years and I believe that that approach reigns the fairest and most efficient way to fund transportation projects however since 2008 we have strayed from a user pays approach we rely instead on 75 billion dollars worth of budget gimmicks unrelated offsets and debt the prop of our transportation trust fund to pay for transportation investments and rather than write our course about the house and the Senate Transportation proposals rely on tens of billions tens of billions of dollars in additional budget gimmicks and unrelated offsets to fund this bill over the next six years that's not the right way to pay for our infrastructure I think it's wrong way it's not unfair in my view to ask the businesses to ask the people who use our roads or highways and bridges to help pay for them we've done that for 50 years we know how to do it it's a reasonably simple system I think it's a fair system we can adjust the Earned Income Tax Credit in order to in order to offset any increase in in the user fee cost and impact on on lower-income families because the this kind of increase in attacks could be seen as as not progressive but having said that that's not what we're going to do and we're going to do instead is do what we've done for last seven years and use gimmicks and things that have nothing to do with transportation to ostensibly pay for for transportation funding all that being said this is of course that Congress has voted for and despite my misgivings over the funding there's still much to commend in both the House and Senate legislation particularly in the authorization side that comes out of environmental Public Works and out of the transportation infrastructure committee in the house among the things I think are to support and into certainly preserving conference but I robustly funded Freight program competitive grants for major projects funding to reduce a dangerous diesel pollution and research grants to explore alternatives to user fees of the gas tax in to the diesel tax I hope that these provisions are retained in whatever bill emerges from the conference committee other provisions such as caps on investment off rate funding and rail and port water transportation projects and cuts to public transit funding north eastern states should also be dropped finally Congress will face the question of how to balance the benefits of long-term investment predictability with the urgent project investment needs around country while the long-term predictability is certainly important we must consider the significant unmet investments needs around our country and the huge economic benefit the transportation investments offer to America's businesses and families legislation would best serve our country by maximizing annual investment levels for all service transportation programs over a shorter authorization period and instead of having an adequate amount amount to go to pay for transportation improvements over six years I would hope that our conference would consider maybe using that same amount of money to spread it over five years or even four years we could use every dime of it and then some for the transportation needs of our of our country I just want to close I know this may be the last talk I give on the tenafly build a bunch of them on transportation not so much the authorization side of it but how do we pay for writing you had the transportation authorization legislation while not easy is the easy part of this job the hard left is figuring out how to pay for this stuff and for a long long time we have used a user fee approach the ash tax diesel tax done this I think since Dwight Eisenhower was president and since we were building din interstate highway system we last raise the gas and diesel taxes in 1993 it's been 22 years the gas tax today is 18 cents it's so worth after inflation about a dime the ax diesel tax about 23 cents last graves 22 years ago today it's worth less than fifteen cents the other across the gas thing about gasoline a couple days ago in Dover I think we paid just a tad over two dollars a gallon last week I'm told that there were close to 30,000 gas stations across America where people are filled up and paid less than two dollars a gallon for gasoline the less than two dollars a gallon for gasoline we see other price in a couple of my colleagues in a standard urban center Feinstein and I in this Senate others in the house of offered legislation to restore the purchasing power of the gas tax and the leaves tax not their increased by 25 cents through a half dollar a dollar so I've suggestion but simply raised it four cents a year for four years at the end of four years in 2020 I index it to the rate of inflation and we would generate from doing that something like 220 billion dollars he used for wrote I roads bridges and transit systems over the next ten years instead we're not going to do that we're going to take money that an increase in tsa fees ostensibly to protect people when they fly an airplane and we'll use that instead for roads highways bridges taking money that should go to strengthen our borders and particularly the border crossings where we have huge amounts of commerce moving in and out of our country into Mexico into Canada and instead of using it to bolster the the strength of those border crossings and make sure that they were able to detect drugs and other things that shouldn't be going across our borders we're going to take that money and essentially put in roads highways bridges found a new way to avoid paying for roads highways bridges transit systems of kind of a novel way by saying the Federal Reserve we're going to reduce their reserves by about 60 billion dollars and the Federal Reserve our central bank turns out they they have a large portfolio of investments and a lot of their investments they have actually Treasury securities during the course of the year the Federal Reserve from all of their investments aren't a lot of money and after they deduct their expenses from all the money that they earned interest income but they earn they turned that what's left over to the Treasury they actually remit money during the course of your not all at once but during the course of year last year federal reserve remitted something like half trillion dollars and then that interest income to the Treasury half trillion and so that's a revenue that enables the Treasury to reduce our deficit well what the house came up with this idea and the the idea was why don't we just reduce the Surrey chin and take 60 billion dollars out of reserves of the federal reserve and just use that for roads highways bridges instead of it being taken and turn over and do course to the Treasury to reduce the deficit some people do what's wrong with that we're doing this for transportation well well what's wrong with doing this for Homeland Security what's wrong with doing this for defense what's wrong with doing is for agriculture what's wrong with doing this for anything and this sets a i think a terrible precedent and invites future congresses to do the same thing to do the same thing and instead of us adhering to a policy that served as well for many years that those who use our roads highways bridges should pay for them we're resorting to gimmicks and kind of thing that we should be should just not deign to do having said that there is a good deal to like especially in the authorization language i applaud those who have worked on another's legislation appreciate the chance to help shape and form some of it I wish we're taking a different course with respect to actually paying for that for this work that needs to be done last thing I would say is this our friends at kenzie consulting been consulting for him international consulting firm have an arm of Mackenzie consulting called global global institute and the there that arm of Mackenzie reached out years I'll going we tried to figure out if we were to invest robustly robustly inner roads highways bridges our transit systems what kind of effect would have an unemployment in this country what kind of effect would have on unemployment in this country what kind of effect would it have on gross domestic product in this country and here's what they calculated they calculated it for truly to make the kind of investments that are needed not just like limp along kind of level almost like level funding which is woefully inadequate really robust investments is what we would do with employment in this country we would add to 1.8 million jobs in America 1.8 million jobs in America a lot of the folks long-term unemployed or people who wish they could be tied back again to do construction projects to build roads highways bridges and transit systems and they're sitting on the sidelines because we don't have the money to pay to hire them to build a lot of these projects and the Global Institute also of she tells us that terms of GDP robots transportation investments would enable us to grow GDP annually by one and a half percent and when you think about that GDP we're lucky in this country to get GDP up to three percent per year so are most developed nations but simply by making robots investments in our transportation system building America's transportation systems again rebuilding them we could expect to grow gdp by as much as one-half percent per year the level of funding that Cindy the legislation will be coming before us doesn't come even close to that not even close to that I think we missed an opportunity here I think we've missed an opportunity here one of my hearings today mr. president had a UH one of our witnesses quoted Yogi Berra and there's a funny quote by Yogi Bear who died earlier this year and I rejoined by telling one of my favorite Yogi Berra quote so it goes like this when you come to the fork in the road take it when you come to the fork in the road taking we've come to the fork in the road with respect to transportation funding and with apologies to Yogi Berra we have taken I think the wrong fork in that road without done mr. president I'll call it call it a day and nothi of the absence of a quorum

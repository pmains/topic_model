member of the january 6th select committee republican congressman adding adam kinzinger of illinois uh congressman thank you so much for being here it's always good to have you let's talk about enforcing subpoenas and what the committee is doing at the moment there are a number of current lawmakers that you're looking at and the committee has said that it will use all of the tools at its disposal to get those lawmakers to cooperate what exactly are those tools well i mean the first thing we want to do we have to do is to ask them to voluntarily come in and cooperate the expectation of course is that they will resist that they're trying to buy time and then we are exploring options we have after that there's certain speech and debate clause issues we deal with and and the role of congress is opinion members of congress but my expectation is that the force of law still applies and so if we get to the point where they're certainly not agreeing to come in voluntarily we'll explore those options and and i think it's been obvious from the committee's work uh that we won't hesitate to do that so you're not going to rule out subpoenas you're not going to rule out holding them in contempt of congress these are sitting lawmakers what about getting them off of their committees well i mean look i think it's a possibility i think pulling people off of committees on a whole house vote needs to be reserved for special cases like i voted for with marjorie taylor green for instance we can't have that kind of be the knee-jerk reaction to everything discipline should be handled obviously within the party but the republican party the republican caucus is not doing that but i'll say this whether you agree with the committee's investigation or not whether you agree with what we're doing we are represented by a legitimate vote of the house of representatives to be the people's voice to get information the american people deserve this information the history books written in the future deserve this information and we're going to make sure we move heaven and earth to get it this is not a partisan issue this is a non-partisan investigation the only thing partisan is whether you believe in democracy or you don't and those who believe in democracy should beg for the results of this committee to be accurate truthful and folsom given um that the committee sent a letter to sean hannity saying that we know you love your country we know you believe in democracy we're hoping you're going to voluntarily comply with our questioning the text messages from hannity to um the chief of staff warning donald trump not to go through with january 6. you've released those why are those messages significant to the committee it's significant for a couple of reasons first off the communication behind the scenes both during and prior to january 6. keep in mind we know that donald trump quote unquote this decisive president who's anything but was sitting watching television for about 180 minutes while this was going on uh the question and i think the thing that will get to culpability which i don't have an answer to yet uh the committee will get to is what did he know prior to this occurring was he simply a spectator and something that shocked him uh and indecisive obviously his oath requires him to defend the constitution to defend things like the capital and he didn't is that criminal and i think a lot of that will get to what did he know prior so a text message to a chief of staff that says hey call off january 6 seems to imply that maybe there was an understanding that something big was going to happen i personally said on january 1st that there was going to be violence on the 6th i don't know if i you know envisioned the occupation of the capital but that's going to be important what did they know prior what is your expectation on what the committee is going to find against the president of the united states where are you going with this questioning you're talking about hannity sending a text message warning him not to go through with january 6 and the implications of that i mean what's your expectation for when you find the results of this where the president is going to stand the former president well i'm trying not to go into this with expectations i want to let the facts direct the answers that's what the committee is doing i know i have a gut feeling because you know i lived that life prior i lived the whole area as we all did between the election and january 6 where you continue to hear some conspiracy theorists that have since become mainline talking about our ability to just simply overthrow the will of the people how january 6 can be this magic day we reinstate donald trump as president but we want to have the facts dictate that because this report and you know anything that comes from this committee isn't necessarily about convincing those that don't believe or reaffirming those that do it's about laying a bare groundwork for what needs to be done what we understand to ensure this never happens again because anytime you have violence or really any norm violated in politics that doesn't become a special occasion in the future that becomes the baseline activity so what's going to happen in 2024 and onward that's what we need to get to let's talk about the other white house aides that you might be talking to trump's former press secretary stephanie grisham is going to meet with the committee and nbc news has just uh confirmed that she's meeting with the committee tonight how many white house aides have you spoken to so far without a subpoena plenty um i i can't give the exact number i don't know if i know the exact number we've as you've heard interviewed over 300 witnesses i think this is the key to understanding is what we see is a little tip of the iceberg we see some of the activities above board you know the meadows stuff the ban and stuff but underneath the staff of the committee the members of the committee are extremely active in gathering information so let's say we never talk to president trump or we never talk to you know any high profile individual we're going to have people all that have a piece of that story a slice of different moments in time that we can put together into the bigger picture as we know how investigations go you know you put those pieces together and then you move up the ladder that's what we're doing and i think you're going to have continued cooperation by a significant number of people there are people that have gone quiet uh that also see the tragedy of january 6 and have no current re-election political interest in trying to push a false narrative like so many of my colleagues do do you expect to change anybody's mind in congress i know you're talking not talking about the broader public but any other republicans mind about what's coming down the pike for 2024 there's a lot of reporting out there i know you're finding out a lot of information in your committee uh that is not so reassuring for our democracy especially as we go to the polls in november 2024. it's really frightening um look a year ago i was much more optimistic about the uh impending you know recognition of of democracy being a threat i'm a little more pessimistic i think we will certainly and that's what i'm trying to do through my movement countryfirst.comcountry1st.com but what we're trying to do is to bring all that together but i gotta tell you you know is it gonna change anybody's mind probably not because honestly most members of the republican congress understand what happened on january six they're just not courageous enough to go out and tell the truth and so you put people like it's easy to demonize and isolate liz cheney and i we're willing to play that to do that because it's the right thing but i'll tell you if you put everybody on truth serum they'd agree with us the problem is um the the base voters are not having anybody tell them the truth and they're the ones that are going to be misled and abused as they have been for so long public hearings could happen later in the spring and in the summer who are you going to call who who is the public going to hear from what kind of witness if you can't tell me any specific names yeah i can't tell you specific names but it's this it's painting the picture and putting the story together from those involved at various levels those that are experts in some of these issues like when we talk about domestic radicalization i expect that we'll have some discussion on potential changes we need to be discussing about the electoral count act and changes that can be made to that because we've seen so many areas where there were linchpins on january 6 that weren't necessary but our goal here is to get the information and then put this out through these hearings in front of the american people free of spin free of conspiracy which we've heard so much of and tell the truth tell the story because i gotta tell you self-governance isn't easy you know we i think we're kind of raised believing it was easy because it was so ingrained but you recognize you have to have a base level of trust even between people that have nothing in common um in order to do it look i've made friends on the other side of the aisle that i don't agree with on things in politics but we agree on the defense of democracy that's the most important thing right now i know you want to talk to vice president pence there there is a consideration to asking him to come speak with the committee what about the secret ser secret service agents that might have been with him on that day or frankly the secret service agents that might have been with the president on january 6. oh yeah i think that would be important i think there's questions about you know the secret service having obviously a duty to confidentiality in order to be able to protect a president but i think anybody that has information we should hear from if we can recognizing of course that there are some of those limitations but again i don't think even all of that is necessary because the pieces of information that are coming together it's like a puzzle you can look down and see a bunch of pieces but when you begin to put it together it paints a real picture from start to finish not just january 6 i think actual january 6 is a symptom of a deeper problem the rot prior to january 6 and then the conspiracies that have justified it since january 6. that's to me is the bigger concern than even that awful day congressman adam kinzinger of the january 6th committee congressman thank you so much for joining us again it is always good to talk to you you bet take care

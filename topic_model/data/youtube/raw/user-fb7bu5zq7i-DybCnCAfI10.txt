INDIANA, CHAIRMAN MRVAN. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE GENTLEMAN FROM INDIANA IS RECOGNIZED. MR. MRVAN: I'M PROUD TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THE DIGNITY FOR SURVIVORS ACT, LEGISLATION I WAS PROUD TO INTRODUCE AND CLAB BRAT WITH CHAIRMAN TAKANO, CHAIRWOMAN LAWYER LURIA, AND MY OTHER COLLEAGUES INVOLVING THE TREATMENT OF SURVIVORS OF MILITARY SEXUAL TRAUMA. AND THE VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS, THE PARALYZED VETERANS OF AMERICAN, AMERICAN LEGION, WOUNDED WARRIOR PROJECT FOR THEIR ENDORSEMENTS OF THIS LEGISLATION. THE DIGNITY FOR M.S.T. SURVIVORS ACT SEEKS TO SUPPORT AND AFFIRM VETERANS WHO EXPERIENCE SEXUAL TRAUMA DURING THEIR MILITARY SERVICE AS THEY NAVIGATE THE BOARD OF VETERAN APPEALS CLAIMS APPEAL PROCESS. ACCORDING TO THE DATA, COLLECTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS, AN UNCONSCIONABLE ONE IN THREE OF OUR BRAVE WOMEN VETERANS AND ONE IN 50 MALE VETERANS REPORT HAVING EXPERIENCED SEXUAL ASSAULT OR HARASSMENT. SUCH TRAUMATIC EVENTS OFTEN HAVE LASTING IMPACTS ON THESE INDIVIDUALS' PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. PLACING M.S.T. SURVIVORS AT HEIGHTENED RISK FOR DEPRESSION, POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER, AND OTHER DEBILITATING CONDITIONS. DESPITE THESE CLEAR TREATMENT NEEDS, MANY M.S.T. SURVIVORS FACE SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTY IN ASSESSING HEALTH CARE AND DISABILITY BENEFITS FROM THE V.A. IN AUGUST 2021 INVESTIGATION RELEASED BY V.A.'S OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL FOUND AN OUTSTANDING 57% OF DENIED M.S.T. CLAIMS WERE IMPROPERLY PROCESSED BY V.A. IN PART DUE TO CLAIMS PRO PROCESSOR'S LACK OF M.S.T. TRAINING. MULTIPLE VETERAN SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS REPORT THAT THE B.V.A. HAS -- SIMILARLY ILL-EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH APPEALS OF DENIED M.S.T. CLAIMS AND THAT THE CURRENT CLAIMS APPEAL PROCESS HAS THE UNFORTUNATE POTENTIAL TO RETRAUMATIZE M.S.T. SURVIVORS. WHILE V.A. HAS TAKEN STEPS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, MORE MUST BE DONE TO IMPROVE THE CLAIMS APPEALS EXPERIENCE. SHOW COMPASSION AND SAFEGUARD THE DIGNITY OF M.S.T. SURVIVORS. I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION IN ORDER TO ENSURE M.S.T. SURVIVORS ARE NOT RETRAUMATIZED AT ANY POINT IN THEIR EFFORT TO OBTAIN THE WORLD CLASS HEALTH CARE AND DISABILITY BENEFITS TO WHICH THEY ARE ENTITLED.

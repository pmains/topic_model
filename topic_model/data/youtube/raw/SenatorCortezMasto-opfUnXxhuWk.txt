thank you for the conversation today and let me just start off because I think like senator Booker I'm trying to really understand and get down to what where we can come to agreement on this legislation which I think is so important that we pass it so so let me start here under Section 230 as it original as it's written now the federal government federal law enforcement has the authority to go in and shut down a website for sex trafficking correct I'm gonna open it up to anybody is that correct yes a federal government has the ability of criminally prosecute and so that's what they have now and that has not impeded any freedom of speech or the involvement of the Internet correct I'm gonna open up to anybody is that true I'm gonna give you an affirmative of that but all of it somebody else okay I haven't heard anything differently so what we're doing right now and what I understand is because the sex trafficking of our kids and adults is so prevalent like any other criminal law enforcement activity that occurs we are looking for the allowance of state law enforcement to also pursue and shut down these sites when sex trafficking is occurring is that correct general senator from my perspective yes I'm looking for the authority to do what federal prosecutors can do which courts are denying me right now I believe under this statute I should have the authority but it's been construed differently so the only thing we're doing is opening the door to now allow local law enforcement and state law enforcement to also do the same thing that the federal law enforcement has to do under this which is to shut down those sex trafficking sites correct that's the principle reason I'm here okay and that's why as Attorney General I signed on to a letter in 2013 to change the 230 CDA and that's why I continue to support it now I do understand with your concern with respect to section 4 I do think it is overly broad and the knowledge piece that we're looking for is already in the the USC itself section 1591 I mean general Viserys goodness better if we're gonna prosecute that mens rea and knowledge is already in the criminal statute and so that's what we're looking to do and i think that's the only piece that we're trying to do here is because under the case law that I have seen as Attorney General when I was pursuing these sex trafficking cases they're looking at two-thirty and the courts are interpreting that state law is preempted by federal law and we can't don't have this ability now there is so much sex trafficking going on and let me just tell you it this is this is a crime that is so prevalent and thank you mrs. ambrose for being a voice because it is not an easy thing for you to get up here and tell your daughter's story and your story is one that I've heard too many times in my state as Attorney General and this is an issue that we have to stop we have to stop it and it is not just for federal law enforcement to stop it it is for all law enforcement for state local to take action and that's all we're asking is that state law enforcement have that ability because it is so prevalent and so the goal we're trying to do is limit it to sex trafficking only so that there isn't the concern I hear and some unintended consequences that may occur with some of the agencies that I've talked to with respect to the website so mr. Goldman I've only got about a minute 26 left I understand you have concerns with states having that authority I ask why correct thank you so the question is why do I have reservation that state attorneys general enforcing the law there are two different issues in the bill one is the bill would authorize state crimes to be nearly enforced in addition to the federal crime there's some overlap between the two but now we open up the door to a whole bunch of new laws that have not been previously enforced against the internet community and those laws haven't been approved by the rest of the internet they've been approved by that state that state those states voters and the attorney John has been approved by dot state's voters so the effort to impose these other crimes on the rest of the internet creates the possibility that that State itself the people who aren't in that state are having the laws of the state applied against them in ways that they may not have had a chance to vote on so if we were limiting it specifically that the state can pursue an action for sex trafficking pursuant to 1591 that's gonna limit what they can do and the action that they can take would that satisfy your concerns that would certainly help make sure that we're now applying a single federal standard as opposed to a much more heterogeneous commute set of laws I appreciate that thank you I understand my time is up mr. chairman let me just say thank you this is such an important topic I've worked as a trainee general with my colleagues and now general visera trying to change this and many advocates in this room mrs. McCain and Nick Mick and so many others I think it's such an important topic and I so appreciate you having the hearing today

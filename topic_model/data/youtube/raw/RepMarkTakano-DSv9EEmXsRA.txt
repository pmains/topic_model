Mr Speaker I rise today to encourage President Obama to become the first sitting American president to visit Hiroshima Japan a visit to Hiroshima is not an apology on America's behalf it is a signal that the commander-in-chief of the world's largest arsenal of nuclear weapons appreciates their power and it sets an example for other world leaders to follow I did not fully grasp the horror of Hiroshima until I traveled there for the first time in 2002 only then that I develop a personal and lasting connection to the incredible destruction caused by nuclear weapons every leader who has the capacity to use these weapons should have that same experience and feel that same connection one of America's greatest strengths is the power to lead by example the president should use that power to lead the world to Hiroshima and away from nuclear weapons thank you and I yield back

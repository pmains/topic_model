now is the Democratic whip congressman Steny Hoyer of Maryland thank you very much for being on with us Joe take it away good morning hey stenny we've been talking this morning about a lot of things a lot of things to keep up with but one of the most disturbing is the news out that the president and the president's chief of staff general Kelly are berating and twisting the arms of the FBI director and their Attorney General trying to take pressure off of Donald Trump in the Russian investigation and trying to have a political purge of people that actually want an independent investigation first of all how concerning is that to you and secondly what can you and your caucus do to slow slow this sort of behavior down well first of all Joe it's very concerning ought to be very concerning to every American the underpinning of America is that we are a nation of laws and if in fact the president United States can pressure in law enforcement and as well try to pressure the courts and the Justice Department to skew the law to undermine the proper administration of the law then America is less safe less secure and less what America means to our people and into the world so that it ought to be very concerning you asked what we can do first of all we can raise our voices all Americans ought to raise their voice you've been doing that press has been doing that the public is booing doing that and we need to keep doing that and also we need to pose slayin that will further undermine the administration of justice and I would hope that we even have legislation put on the floor which would now I not undermine but would try to protect and would move towards protecting and mr. Muller in particular but also the sanctity of law John Heilemann John Heilemann I just want to ask you about about two people one the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee who allegedly recused himself from the rush investigation but now seems to be kind of running roughshod over the whole process and doing these kind of impress identity so I'd like to explain what you think's going on with debe Nunez and what his game is here number one and number two what what's Paul Ryan's role here and how can Paul Ryan tolerate that kind of behavior on the part of one of his committee chairs well he shouldn't and I don't know what recusal means if congressman Nunez is the example of recusal because as you point out he seems to have been continually involved in one way or another in the Russian investigation when he said he was not going to be and would step aside what can the speaker do the speaker can frankly ultimately remove him as chairman of the committee and at least at the very least assure that recusal means recusal recusal means not being involved refusal means not trying to influence what is going on with respect to the committee's oversight of what Russia's role was in the election and what danger they caused to us it's a very disappointing that speaker doesn't act or that newness has acted notwithstanding his pledge of recusal because I've been close to involvement with the White House let me just let me just be clear here congressmen are you or you would you'd be calling for the removal of Congressman Nunez from that committee is that what you're saying you asked what the speaker could know I'm asking you there right now would you call for his removal you think he's so inappropriately that's necessary I think to the extent that the congressman Nunez continues to involve himself in a investigation that he said he was going to recuse himself on yes I think the speaker if that continues should removing all right looking ahead to the State of the Union tonight Heidi you have some reporting as to what we might hear from the president congressman I spoke with an official who was briefed by the president last night on his address and to this point on the wall let's just play a little devil's advocate the president were told this group of officials that the 25 billion that he's asking for isn't just for the wall it's for ports of entry places of entry reinforcements along the northern border even prosecutors and judges and then you pair that with the reporting by Jacob Soboroff that you know a lot of this may not even happen because of eminent domain and the legal battles why not just give them the money just put it out there and you're getting a really good deal potentially on this citizenship for 800,000 dreamers who will be a great benefit to our economy well of course you're right on the ladder we believe that the wall itself to the extent that the president and continues to focus on building a wall it's not it not efficient would be very costly and won't accomplish the objective we are strongly in favor of making sure the border is secure we ought not to have people coming into our country who are not authorized to do so I think there's agreement on that across the board however we think what the president has proposed is a waste of money however to the extent that the president has shown some flexibility when I was down at the White House meeting he indicated I'm not talking about 2,000 miles worth of a wall which is a practical matter your report just showed would probably not happen in any event and probably couldn't happen so that to the extent that he's talking about alternative ways or to repair an existing barriers that's one thing and you that if that's what we're talking about and it's difficult to know what the president's talking about because he changes his mind pretty rapidly but if that's what we're talking about we certainly want to make sure that we not only protect the doc up protect these but the 1.8 million plus people that the president talked about in his most recent proposal which i think is filled with things that we will not agree to but nevertheless I was encouraged by the fact that the White House is now said it was willing to not only protect Dakka Dakka eligible but also give them a path to citizenship hopefully that's a step forward peggy noonan congressman good morning I thought Heidi had a great point this does or at least a week ago two weeks ago it looked to me like a historic moment where the administration had climbed down on daca and the dreamers and the Democrats were coming in and saying okay I'll help you build this wall or I'll free up some funds or at least assign some funds for the wall where does it stand now with regard to I know everybody's had their mind on on the drama with mr. newness and his committee and also the State of the Union this evening but then where does this go does the Democratic leadership meet with the president does the Republican leadership meet with the president do you all talk to each other how you gonna move this forward Peggy all of the above hopefully but as you know majority leader McCarthy and I and John Cornyn the whip in the Senate Republican and Dick Durbin the whip in the Senate as well the Democratic whip have been talking we met yesterday we met with general Kelly and Mark short of the White House we are trying to move forward to get an agreement as I said I'm encouraged by the fact that the White House issued a paper that adopted the premise of protecting not just those who signed up for daca but those who are daca eligible as well young people brought to this country they had no decision in that and have been productive in school and work in the military and are people that I think the overwhelming majority some almost 90 percent of the American public's that they'll to stay here they ought to be productive American citizens and so the president's willingness to create a path for citizenship in return for some of the things he asked for in that document some which we think are non-starters which undermine family reunification we don't think that's appropriate which undermines making available slots for those who are diverse backgrounds we think that's probably a non-starter but we're for border security and we're prepared to talk to the president and work with the president and yes to allocate some funds to make sure that the border is more secure congressman Steny Hoyer thank you very much for being on the show this morning thanks a lot

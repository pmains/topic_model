let's start telling the truth so that we can actually solve this crisis thank you i yield back members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the president rice did bring attention to the dereliction of duty by this president occurring at our southern border can we all stop pretending can we stop pretending that this administration deserves any benefit of the doubt pretending that it's a tough situation beyond their control pretending that this administration and frankly the entire democrat party have any intention of solving the border crisis should stop pretending as if this isn't purposeful because it is i mean when every single policy measure that you partake in results in more illegal immigration well then it stands to reason using the powers of deduction that maybe you want more illegal immigration let's also stop pretending that more than a tiny fraction of those illegally crossing our border have any valid claims to asylum whatsoever we all know it we all know that they are coming because it's easy and because america is a pretty great place we all know they were trained by their drug cartel handlers to repeat certain phrases that make them eligible for the asylum process so that they'll be given a bus ticket and maybe a court date which they'll never show up for let's stop pretending that this isn't just a giant scam a giant abuse of our well-meaning and generous system and also let's stop pretending mass migration is america's fault let's stop pretending to listen to outlandish claims of climate change causing migration or the tired old refrain of well it's american imperialistic foreign policy or whatever and so let's just let everybody in and let's stop pretending that this isn't getting exceedingly dangerous for us it's dangerous for our border agents it's dangerous for our border communities it's dangerous for the children being trafficked it's dangerous for everyday americans but our border communities crime is rising there's greater insecurity there's a spike in covid cases and migrants who i i thought my friends on the other side of the aisle claim to care about well they're paying thousands of dollars of smugglers to take them on an exceedingly dangerous journey that often ends in children dead stranded in the desert or in the rio grande the only people who benefit from all of this so the drug cartels they make money off human misery by using asylum seeking migrants to tie down border agents so that they can move their drugs with little to no risk these smugglers aren't just bringing your generic pot they're bringing fentanyl bringing enough fentanyl to kill every single american let's stop pretending that the democrats pro-open border position has anything to do with compassion or kindness there is nothing compassionate about ten cities nothing compassionate about children being trafficked there's nothing compassionate about firing american workers for not getting a coveted shot putting them out on the street while illegal immigrants fled into our country without even a covet test and then get treated to a bus ride or a hotel at the expense of the american taxpayer and then they probably get hired there's nothing compassionate about allowing hundreds of thousands of legal immigrants to cut in front of millions of law-abiding potential immigrants around the world people with actual asylum claims and real persecution are told well they're out of luck if they can't just walk across the border sorry about your civil war or your religious persecution we're out of space the system's just too clogged up now so let's stop pretending about all of it

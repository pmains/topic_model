environmental organization that's here in all 50 states and in 72 countries as we think about the inflation reduction act and the provisions that are in it that are designed and suited to tackling the climate issue we're excited to see many important pieces of that legislation achieved west virginia is a traditional energy state and we recognize that but we also recognize that many people in west virginia are looking boldly into the future of what west virginia can be and the provisions in the infrastructure reduction act that address the climate issue can also be a boon for west virginia as they bring new revenues and new technologies and allow west virginia to be true to its traditional energy state while stepping boldly into the future let me i'm going to clarify one thing if i can this is being zoomed live and we have people be there watching listening and they'll be calling in later on who couldn't participate brandon brandon dennison coalfield development based in the southern part of west virginia uh working to rebuild the economy chris deweese i'm a partner with subtle and stonaker cpa firm that has offices in west virginia also a small business owner owned greens feed and seed tim hogan's flooring and several other businesses in the community so here to discuss irs issues both focused on small businesses and and also the from the taxpayers perspective hi i'm tom krauser and i'm a business consultant with world headquarters in mink scholes west virginia and i deal mainly with the printing and graphics industries and i happen to be a columnist at the

to be here today thank you senator manchin i'm joe and i'll be later on my name is cecil roberts i'm president of the united mine workers i represent our union represents active coal miners retired coal miners laid off coal miners and disabled coal miners and we think this legislation speaks to all of those groups and we'll be happy to talk about that later thank you my name is toby rice president ceo of eqt uh america's largest natural gas producer uh we produce about six bcf a day of natural gas uh to put that in perspective that's about a million barrels a day of oil in uh gas form equivalent what we do at eqt is two things provide energy security to the world and also help arrest emissions and um certainly when you think about the energy the energy crisis that we're struggling with is a root cause of a lot of the issues that this world is struggling with and this world needs more energy and looking forward to seeing how the ira will help us bring more energy into this world good morning uh thank you for for having me here today senator manchin my name's alicia knapp i'm president and ceo of bhe renewables and i'm here representing berkshire hathaway energy which is the the whole owner of of bhe renewables and we have a suite of assets all of the above is really um where the definition of that i would say with our our energy assets throughout the us and in the uk and canada and so the the ira provides a lot of opportunities for to support the clean energy transition and we're really excited for all all aspects of it really from materials to deployment of clean energy and supporting a responsible transition to clean energy so thank you for the opportunity good morning senator great to see you um michael killian with equitrans we've been providing midstream services in the appalachian basin for 135 years and here to talk about energy security hey senator greg hoyer vice president of government affairs for diversified energy we are a producer of mature natural gas assets in appalachia just moved to what we call mid-continent which is louisiana texas and oklahoma we are also we also have a subsidiary next level energy which is the largest plugging operation in appalachia currently beginning to ramp up plugging and retiring assets in appalachia and beyond good morning senator my name is sam somerville i'm with northeast natural energy we're a west virginia natural gas producer headquartered here in west virginia all of our folks at workforce are west virginians and we're producing not quite what the eqt is producing but we just we're over half of bc for gas a day in west virginia first of all thank you all let me give you a little bit of a reason why we're here today but let me also give you the purpose of the inflation reduction act the inflation reduction act when we began negotiating again in april and no one even knew that i was talking to anybody and uh it came about and i'll give you a little bit of a background um when the bbb went down in december and it was just i tried every way possible just no way i could get there and then in a 50 50 senate just one senator makes a difference but all 50 really all hundred senators make a difference if they want to express themselves of what they think is best for our country and best for our states that we represent you have to respect that too but with that that happened in december and everything went cold for quite a while then we had the war uh putin's war on ukraine and when you saw putin weaponize energy the way he did it put a whole another perspective on what type of uh scenario we're in in the global and the global geopolitical unrest that we have so at that situation there i'm thinking you know uh we're in a different position we've ever been no one we were we were told uh as senators we were all briefed of the geopolitical unrest that was going on if you remember when the bbb negotiations were going on and i at one time i said why don't we just take a strategic pause and my reason for the strategic pause was three or three purposes i said first of all inflation we don't know what inflation but inflation is a killer it's it's it's a hidden tax that no one can avoid and it hurts the people that need help the most and i said that that i think that we see something coming that's not going to be a transitory and at that time they says oh it's transitory we've had 17 nobel laureates tell us it's going to be transitory well i don't know what they were looking at because what we the graphs we were seeing we were way off the chart as far as what we had for demand and employment and and and just things going off the charts so i says i don't believe that so let's take a pause and look at it next of all we said uh don't you think we ought to see what's happening with covet at that time we just had the cove at 19. and i'll never forget doug dr fauci came to us he said joe let me tell you one thing about a pandemic the only thing i can tell you for certain in history a pandemic is not one and done they've never been one and done there's going to be iterations of this that will continue on he said that i know and he says you ought to be prepared for that because if you throw all your eggs in one basket here and think you're going to take care of one vaccine and everything's over that's not going to happen so he warned us on that that's number two and the third thing i said the geopolitical unrest we had just been briefed a detailed briefing on what was going on around the world we were more concerned about china and taiwan because we knew the taiwanese with the chips and the things that the strategic that we all used very much in all of our high-end if you will high-end military that they were doing things that no one else in the world was doing they were using our technology but they had perfected it to the point that we were relying on them tremendously taiwan china could not do what taiwan's doing in the chip they can they can produce bulk chips but they cannot do the sophistication as needed for the high end use so we knew that and we thought that's going to be the catalyst for them moving if they were going to move on taiwan that would be so that was really of high concern at that time and xi jinping made every uh his whole thing is economic he you know he'll go to economic war with you he's not going to be as anxious as uh as putin is to go to just physical war we never ever thought no one gave us any indication there'd be a land war in europe nobody with all the intelligence we have no one ever thought it would get to that point and how it got to that point we have no idea what we do know basically after it started the 90 of the of the russian troops did not know they were going to war they knew they were going to an exercise in ukraine so when the when that convoy stopped 40 miles out and shut down they weren't they didn't have the provisions they weren't prepared they thought that basically they showed that much might and force coming in on ukraine ukraine would roll over just the way crimea did that's exactly what they were counting on and it didn't happen and so it shows it just goes to show you cannot judge anybody's character or what they might do and the result they might have and it's basically got the whole world rallied around them so putin continues to keep squeezing down the energy and he's going to continue to do that my biggest concern was this so when when the bbb was killed and then we were basically in limbo up until april and it started in april getting to the point to where inflation was basically killing all of us every person man woman and child in america and we have to do that and i said anything that we would do and i told leader schumer at that time i said chuck i said the bottom line yet one piece of legislation you could do and i think would be passed bipartisan would be the reduction the medicare medicare bill that we could basically let competition and let them not negotiate and we can save a lot of money to a lot of people and take the burden off of it we could put the 35 cap on insulin which we did we try to do it across the board with commercial markets too because it's still very profitable we got that thrown out at the bird bath uh they they my friends on the other side basically contested that we were hoping that they wouldn't but they did and that threw that one out but we did get something and it's the first time we made a positive move in that so i said chuck we can do that one he says i said but chuck we got a real problem of energy we don't have energy policy in this country and we're going to put ourselves in jeopardy to we can't ramp up when we need to we should be totally energy independent you've got to produce it and i said the bottom line is i'm watching i'm watching our administration talk about we're lifting the sanctions in venezuela who produces the most filthiest energy i mean there's no there's no checks and balance on them it just balls to the wall letter rip and so if you want to replace something shut them down then you have a situation with iran the most proliferated supporter of terrorists around the world and we were going to lift that just because we wanted their product in the market again i said absolutely no i won't have anything to do with that and then going back to where you have to cal tell the saudis and saudis will play us off with uh with china day in and day out and when what they sent they sent one hell of a signal that we picked up and all i don't know if you all picked up on this or not when they started receiving the one for payment for the oil that they were selling to the chinese it told you everything because the currency is the u.s currency is basically the federal reserve currency of the world but they didn't they bypassed it for the first time first time so told me they they put threw a shot out there at us what are you going to do so why am i going to cater to the saudis and next of all we all believe that opec has total control on what we import in our in our markets our biggest our biggest trading partner is canada 62 of our oil that we import comes from canada that we have to blend to make the gasolines that we need and the fuel products we need so i called i went up to alberta and saskatchewan and met with all the uh with the province leaders no one had called them when they were any more more fuel i called the permian base no one called the permian base no one went up to the north slope nobody we have the ability to produce 15 to 20 million barrels a day of oil and do it cleaner and replace the dirtiest filthiest product around the world we have that ability we have the ability in gas and everybody says well mansion just wants the mvp you give me another you give me another situation where you can within six months bring two billion cubic feet into the market that quickly and affects the pricing for everybody i said that's all i'm talking i don't care where it's at but i said we need to have two pass so that was the purpose of this piece of legislation schumer says well you're chairman of energy can you all can you work on something i said yeah chuck i said we're not gonna let i says we're gonna write the bill if you want me to work on it my staff will write the bill you're not going to write that bill and i said because we're going to have a balance i want to make the investments that we need for the new future technologies that we're going to be using down the road that's fine and we can do that but let's pick the ones we know to come to market we know the small nuclear reactors are going to work bill gates has shown an interest he's going to be coming to the state of west virginia he's going to be looking at the opportunities that we have and some of our shorter coal fired plants and seeing if there's a prob a possibility there we know that hydrogen works it's been technology has been proven for years we never spent any money to develop it we really haven't we spent if we spent the same amount of money for hydrogen that we did for wind and solar over the last 10 years you would have it very matured at this point in time so it's a catch-up we have there but we know these things work and we know that storage is needed for wind and solar wind and solar is proven technology now you need to be able to store it properly to have it more dispatchable so we put all of our interest in and what we've been working with with our in our committee for that purpose and we have a bill that we think was extremely balanced i wasn't sure that they would ever agree because of my friends on the far left the the environmental community was totally committed to dispersing and basically eliminating fossil well i don't need to show you the energy mix that we have up here generation mix and energy consumption there's no way you can get rid of fossil in any short period of time you can use it cleaner as you basically transition but it's going to be with us and you better do the best you can with it so i want to make sure they understood that i wasn't sure they were going to accept two paths either that was a tough one and um but when they saw we were willing to make the investments and we did production tax credits and investment tax credits we have our staff on and all the people that really were the intricately uh were intricate in writing the bill or on the zoom here so if we have them chime in sometime you all are the end users and you all see it from the market standpoint of what you can do everyone says well i wrote this bill about west virginia no i wrote this bill about basically the security of our nation so the people that thought oh joe did a great job because he killed the bbb i didn't kill anything i just couldn't sell it i couldn't go home and explain it i always said if i can't explain it i can't support it and i didn't think we could handle that piece of legislation so on this one i can now they're saying oh he betrayed us and he's gone this way now okay so i'm the villain i can be the hero and the villain all in a 24-hour period and i said nobody in their right mind would go through what i have gone through in my staff for the last eight months taking all the crap we've taken from everybody in the country and come back and said well that felt so good i would do some more of that so they said well how come you didn't talk i said because i didn't want to discourage anybody or disappoint i wasn't sure we could make this work i didn't need a lot of cooks in the kitchen i had a good staff that could do it and we had the blessings of the president and his staff we kept everyone informed of what we were doing but we were doing it and we kept schumer and schumer staff worked with us because we had to work with the the committees that basically had jurisdiction because they had the writing of the codes we had to change but we had the jurisdiction on all energy so we wrote it ourself that's how what you have before you and why it came to why it is now let me tell you why we call it the reduction inflation reduction act i named that one okay and i said this because of this i said we cannot have a piece of legislation that anybody can shoot at it and say it's inflammatory it's going to cause more inflation they're not arguing about that they're just arguing about well does it really take care and reduce inflation common sense would tell you first of all if the seniors in america are paying less than they were paying and you've kept their insulin at 35 and they were paying hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and couldn't afford it that has to be pretty much inflationary fighting okay if you're putting more product in the market we're producing more energy and we're going to basically have more supply in the market that should reduce the cost pretty simple that's pretty simple so i all the things we did and there's nothing we didn't raise any rates i could not believe that they would not agree on a 15 percent minimum for the largest corporations in the world that have a billion dollars of book revenue three years there's not one in west virginia there's not one coal company in west virginia or anyone else in that category but if there is and they're not paying at least 15 percent when they took the rate from 35 to 21 what i didn't know and i found out that when it was at 35 i knew this we weren't as competitive at the global 35 percent net corporate in america 35 was not competitive so we put a lot of caveats in the tax code over the years but we had a minimum floor 20 percent well guess what when they changed the code from 35 to 21 they kept all the caveats so the caveats that were there when it was 35 down to 20 went from 21 to zero that's what happened so we put the floor at 15 and i'll be damn they didn't come out of the woodwork we had 55 companies to pay zero the largest companies in the country we didn't raise the tax on anyone and how my friends on the republican side can say we raise taxes on people making 200 i don't think we changed any rates we've been made sure that and it just goes on and on but we'll get into more of this in detail later but i want to give you a little bit of a background our main thing was lower the cost of living fighting inflation for everybody that was the biggest concern we had the other one that we had there was reigning in the cost of health care which is why we have people that have expertise and can speak on that and then basically providing energy security and diversification you have the energy people here you know on schedules what you're saying i'm done now okay i'm done i got it off my chest okay so basically as we talked about we have putin's war in ukraine we have the energy being weaponized and we have the ability to be energy secured in our country and not have to rely on rogue nations around the world and be able to help our allies that's the purpose of why we're here so with that we're going to get started and talk now with the people have the expertise so medicare drug costs aca rp galen you and angela if you want to take off and go on and what it really affects and what you've been working on for so long yes sir um lowering the cost of prescription drugs has been a priority for aarp my entire career with aarp um it's something we've worked tirelessly on and the historic inflation reduction act of 2022 is going to go a long way to lower prescription drug prices uh and out-of-pocket costs um things that are in the bill i keep calling it a bill it's a it's a law now it's a law it's not a bill anymore it's a law so some of those provisions are holding drug companies accountable when they increase the price of drugs faster than the rate of inflation which has been a tradition a long-standing practice of pharmaceutical companies uh every year they do that and later this year they're going to be held accountable um also capping co-pays for insulin as the senator mentioned to no more than 35 dollars a month for beneficiaries and medicare part d that starts january 1st of 2023 so just a few short months away um also eliminating the cost sharing on recommended vaccines for people on medicare an example is the shingles vaccine copay right now is about 350 that's significant and nobody's really talking about that benefit but that also takes effect january 1st of 2023 and that's not only saving folks at the out-of-pocket cost but it's going to be an important preventative benefit for folks to prevent illness in older adults no more cost sharing in the catastrophic coverage of part d starts in 2024. premium uh in part d cannot grow faster than six percent per year that starts in 2024. expanded eligibility for the medicare part d extra help starts in 2024 and then capping the annual out-of-pocket cost for prescription drugs in medicare part d to 2 000 a year starts in 2025 and finally finally medicare is going to be able to negotiate the price of prescription drugs with manufacturers and that starts in 2026. these policies have broad bipartisan support among voters and will save taxpayers and medicare billions of dollars thank you senator manchin for 20 years medicare had been legally prohibited legally prohibited from negotiating drug costs and the pharmaceutical industry had been fighting to keep that prohibition in place to protect their profits we are now on the verge of finally bringing seniors some real price relief i can't overstate what a monumental improvement this prescription drug package has and will be for older americans struggling to afford their medications the law will also prevent a massive aca premium increase that could affect nearly 3 million people in the country 16 000 west virginians this is so important especially for our members who are between the ages of 50 and 64 who pay the highest premiums up to three times more than the average american we're pleased that the bill extends his financial assistance for three years and enacting these provisions represents a major victory for families across the country who are struggling to afford their prescriptions or health insurance and now is the time to start lowering the price of prescription drugs for all americans again thank you senator manchin thank you gaylene angel you have anything you want to add to it just to reiterate um thank you very much like galen and i have been working um on giving medicare the opportunity to negotiate my entire career at aarp when i first started at aarp i drove around the state seeing who was eligible for the low income assistance program and so now for our friends who make twenty thousand dollars or less a year that program will be extended to them and they'll get extra help paying for their prescription drugs as well these are meaningful things that will happen to people in their daily lives galen talked about the shingles vaccine which if anybody's ever had shingles you know how painful that is but you know the whooping cough vaccine is also huge if anybody's had a child or a grandchild and you have to make the decision whether whether you're able to safely be around an infant and so these are things that will impact people's lives in in such a valuable way here in west virginia and the the satisfaction that we have today is sitting with you like we said we've been working on this for 20 years and we really thank you for the opportunity to be here today the only other thing i would add senator is while we got to exhale for a minute when the legislation passed we know that the work continues and we really appreciate the opportunity to be here today to make sure that folks know in west virginia how they will benefit from the inflation reduction act so thank you i just think that basically the savings there's no there's no doubt that anybody on medicare we have 300 000 people on medicare in west virginia 300 000 they're going to have tremendous savings and be able to to plan their life around not having an ordinary expenses they can't afford i think that's the greatest advantage we have cecil from the standpoint on we've been criticized by my all my dear friends in the coal industry for some reason think that this is going to be harmful and i think it basically isn't the pathway forward that we can continue to produce the energy and provide the energy the country needs so if you want to give your your thoughts on that well i would disagree with our friends in the coal industry who have been suggesting that uh first of all i think we need to take a look back and then get ourselves to the point where we are now you have done so much for this industry and for coal miners in this nation and i want to quickly point out something that happened prior to the passage of this legislation and that was the saving of 80 000 retirees pensions and their health care which used to be paid for by the coal industry so signatory companies alone received a five dollar an hour five dollars an hour for every hour worked by a coal miner their savings are astronomical with respect to that and the health care that they were paying for for these retirees was taken care of in this legislation which you championed somehow that slipped her mind along the way and there are active coal miners today in west virginia and indeed across this nation that still have a job because these coal companies don't have to pay for those pensions in health care because they'd have been out of business if that was not the case so that's the starting point where i would begin this conversation about who's done what for this industry the second thing is they had to they suggested they'd be in the industry that their taxes per ton to double do you know what they were talking about they were talking about a tax that's been in place since the 80s that just happened to expire for about seven months and that tax of 1.10 pays for these miners who are sick with pneumoconiosis and indeed dying with it i would stay away from that debate if i was advising the industry that's a losing debate to be having we want to project a positive image for the coal industry not one where we complain that they now have to pay for the sick people that were that were created by working in this industry if we want to do something in addition to that we would pass a silicon standard so people would stop dying at the end 40 and 50 years of age down in the southern part of west virginia eastern kentucky and southwestern virginia but they don't want to have that conversation but getting with respect to this legislation takes care of that black lung excise tax let me make a couple more comments they actually let a person like me speak at the press club in washington dc and mostly billionaires and and important people get to go there they actually let a coal miner in there twice in the last three years and what i suggested was this we have lost so many minors sometimes we forget about the unemployed minors we look at preserving jobs which we fight every day for that and this legislation allows us to continue to fight for their jobs because it's a heavy investment in carbon sequestration and storage if you want a long-term future for coal it's got to be done by technology because as time goes on all we have to do is look back whether it's a democrat president and a democratic administration or a republican coal fire power plants continue to close there's got to be a path for keeping coal in the energy sector because without the technology that's not going to happen so this speaks to that this was part of what we recommended at those two events at the press conference there was another event which uh the senator joined umwa and speaking to some of these issues we look back in uh 2020. by the way 2020 was the worst year in history uh at least in the last 50 to 100 years for coal because if we actually reduced the workforce for coal down to 30 some thousand people in the nation today by the way one of the things that hasn't been said is the price of coal is through the roof right now and it has been for about a year and a half both metallurgical coal and steam coal because of demand for energy what the senator just spoke to so when the coal industry talks about paying a dollar and eleven maybe they should also say we're getting four hundred dollars a ton from that coal and we're getting 150 a ton for steam coal when they start complaining about the fact they've got to take care of people who are sick and i just i could go on forever and i know we don't have much time but let me just speak to something we miss here too we have advocated for bringing jobs to the appalachian coal fields because on that look back in 2020 10 years 40 000 coal miners lost their jobs and that's an additional 160 000 support jobs it goes about 200 000 people lost their jobs primarily in appalachia and what we suggested is that we bring manufacturing to appalachia and i don't think anybody in this state or any of the joining states would argue with that we've been trying to do that by the way for a hundred years right so we suggested some kind of investment at that time before the legislation passed to bring those jobs here and by the way i'm pleased to announce and i think most of you have seen where there's a battery plant that's coming to west virginia if all everything stays on track and we're going to represent those workers and i believe we're going to have about 800 jobs and manufacturing batteries here in west virginia and that's what we need here and some people i notice they comment and i'm going to shut up here in a minute about when you release this that somebody made a comment so this helps china because they manufacture all the solar panels and wind turbines well guess what that's the whole idea let's stop manufacturing these terms in china and stop producing all these other energy goods in china and let's start doing it here in west virginia and pay people a middle class wage and make those jobs junior and with health care and a pension and a future let's keep our kids here and that's the whole idea of somebody at some of the incentives particularly if the taxpayers say i could talk here for another hour and the senator told me shut up so i don't have to do that but look uh this bill speaks to everything that we discussed in those two appearances uh before the press club about what needs to happen in appalachia to put people back to work so we speak to the unemployed minors here we keep the active uh miners working we've already taken care of the retirees but there is a group of retirees and not as fortunate those that are the ones that work for non-union companies and the benefits of this health care go straight to them because they're depending in their elderly years on medicare to survive so uh people who've worked in the industry people are working in the industry right this minute and people are laid off this this benefits that and if anybody wants to debate that with me i'd be happy to to do that what we're going to thank you cecil i don't think they're going to debate you um what we're going to do is stay with energy real quick if we can and everyone tells us exactly what this well they evaluate the bill from their expertise uh point of view what it does not just only for west virginia which we want to know is this helpful for west virginia but how it helps the nation as far as energy independence i'll clarify one thing on on and i've never been in more direct negotiations with the auto industry than i have with this because they went after me with the vengeance i didn't want electric vehicles i said the only thing i can tell you is supply and demand you're telling me you have to have the 7 500 credit you're not going to make it you're converting everything to evs i said my historical evaluation of what's going on here is i said it's the first time in the history of the united states that we've never been able to be totally independent on transportation mode when henry ford did the production line you know ma and and model t and we were able to basically not only manufacture totally independently of any foreign supply chains the combustible engine all the the gears that it takes to run a vehicle and make that vehicle whether it be that trains planes or automobiles we've done it without depending on foreign supply chains you want to transfer our entire transportation mode and we're going to be holding to total foreign supply chains to run our transportation mode and i'm not buying into this and they kept saying well i said i'm not buying into it i'm not going to be waiting in line like i did in 1973 when opec shut down and i had to wait in line to buy gasoline to go to work i'm not going to be waiting for a battery to come from china that i can run my automobile and i said so i'm not forgiving you all anything i'm out and they just got and then they kept negotiating i says okay the 7500 you have to have i'll tell you how you're going to get it first of all you get 37.50 if we start extracting the rare earth minerals which we don't do in our country or north america or any of our our uh dependable uh supply chains as far as foreign supply chains that we have um uh with our favored nation trading i said so if we can show we do that we source it and we process it and then if we manufacture it you get the other 3750 if the manufacturing for the battery is done in north america you want to get your 7 500 then build this industry i am not going to sit here and sign off on something that went on for two months an unbelievable amount of pressure from lobbying what they wanted to have and right down to the last minute they thought i would cave on that i said i'll cave i'm going to take everything away from me i gave you an offer of 37 50 37.50 to get 7 500. i'm taking all that off the table they said we'll take it and that's how we got to where we got to but that is something we this bill basically tried to build things that we weren't doing that's all and i think it's going to be tremendous and the battery that cecil talked about so with that we'll go down toby we're going to go into the energy and you all know it well you know what what opportunities we have and they've been very much the whole we've had both sides involved in this as we negotiated through our committee on a very cute on a very silent part of it but they gave us the technology and gave us the input that we needed to make this work properly for our country toby joe so you asked you know how does how does the ira uh help i think one of the the biggest things that this bill does is identifies the fact that we are dealing with an inflation crisis and what this bill does is this points in the right direction and says this is the root cause of the inflation it's energy and americans now know that energy is everything it's the only product that every single american uses every single day name another product that has universal adoption energy is everything and when we have the current energy under supply that's going on in this world the energy crisis that we're dealing with is the reason for the skyrocketing energy prices which everybody feels it's the reason for rampant inflation which we're all dealing with right now it's also the reason why we have uh putin's influence and war going on that's terrorizing europe and oh and by the way you know the failed energy policies of the past emissions are still around the world are still rising if you care about climate so this bill puts the focus on how important energy is and as big of a problem this energy crisis is you know joe you understand we're not lambs waiting to be sacrificed at the altar we're not dependent on putin or begging for opec we have the solution ourselves and you understand the potential is absolutely tremendous but this potential is not being realized right now and it needs to change this bill is important first step in showing that there will be a balance in the energy policies that we put in place that is incredibly important but the thing that needs to happen is the commitment to the permitting reform because we need to build more energy infrastructure faster than we've ever done it before pipelines in lng facilities that's the key because the potential is absolutely tremendous if we have that infrastructure we have the ability to end this energy crisis and be a leader on the world stage we have the ability in the united states to increase our our energy production uh and specifically on the gas side by over over 50 bcf a day that would be a 50 increase in natural gas and while that natural gas would be slated for exports in doing that the impact would be absolutely tremendous uh using this natural gas to replace uh foreign coal which is the coal industry is doing amazing around the world by the way it's never been bigger unfortunately it's not happening here in the united states but the amount of coal that's soaring around the world we can extinguish those emissions with natural gas in the form of lng this amount of energy on the world stage would be the biggest green initiative on the planet it'd be equivalent to electrifying every single vehicle in the country putting solar panels on every single house in america and also doubling the impact of our wind generation that's equivalent to over 54 000 windmills it's absolutely massive it can do the environmental equivalent of all three of those things combined that's why we call it the biggest green initiative on the planet the other thing we have is just think about the world that we'll be in if we can unleash this american energy not only will be unleashing the biggest green initiative for the planet we'll also be in a situation where we have 50 surplus energy flowing through the veins of america that means when we have a to respond to a price signal right now this takes 18 months for us to see a price signal for me to push the button on my desk to get the rigs the cruise and get all the work done so we can actually bring that supply to the market with this surplus that's already flowing while slated for exports it's going to be on standby to respond to price signals and instead of waiting 18 months to respond to a price signal we'll be able to respond in 18 hours that is going to bring tremendous amount of stability to prices that's going to lower energy prices keep gas storage full and americans will continue to benefit from the lowest energy costs in the world the other thing i'd say is this amount of energy on the world stage 50 bcf a day would be enough energy to replace putin's energy that he sells to europe two and a half times over replace russian's energy export about 20 bcf a day it's replaced them two and a half times over it's absolutely massive and to put this in perspective the united states has the potential to increase its exports to over 60 bcf of gas a day how powerful is that on the world stage well that's the energy equivalent of around 10 million barrels a day of oil let me say that again the united states can be an energy exporter of natural gas equivalent to the power of saudi arabia we have that potential and then we'll also be unleashing the biggest green and the biggest jobs crater in the country uh 300 000 jobs is what it's going to require to do this so whether you care about the environment whether you care about energy security and low prices or whether you care about jobs in the economy you should care about our energy resources on unleashing american energy um this is a great step step forward and we look forward to working uh with you with with you joe on making sure that we have permit form that actually will unleash american energy so we can end this energy crisis and bring all these benefits to our state to our companies to our industry to the country into the world thanks toby alicia yes thank you senator um so i'm going to try to um be brief and save enough time for the rest of my energy friends here but um as as toby mentioned energy is certainly um critical to all of our lives we provide an essential service to society and um we recognize the climate um patterns that we're seeing the severe weather that is increased in intensity and and frequency all over the country we see that we really have a need to transition to clean energy and with being an essential service to society we have to do it in a way that our customers can afford and in a way that's reliable and so we've seen significant deployment of wind and solar and we know that there's going to be additional deployment of wind and solar needed in order to achieve our renewable energy goals so if we start from the top with extending the the tax credits for wind and solar and expanding the production tax credit for solar that will support the additional deployment of renewables but you need more than wind and solar we know that in order to provide reliable and affordable power for our customers at bhe we have all types of energy and that's because we really see the need to to keep prices low and and keep the lights on and so really investing in battery technologies for one to serve our customers when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine and the additional tax credits that are available now for standalone storage so we can get the battery deployment caught up with the renewable deployment but also the tax credits as you mentioned for nuclear the carbon sequestration that will allow us to continue to rely on our coal facilities to support the transition in a realistic way that supports our customers and then as we look at how are those tax credits being deployed really incentivizing companies like ours to do it responsibly so the labor standards that are included the domestic manufacturing that's included and then supporting energy communities so that we do it in a way where we're not walking away from coal impacted communities and the communities that have served our our society for so long but we're turning and facing those communities and seeing how can we deploy renewable energy in a way that is going to revive those communities so i think the way that it's being done across the energy pieces is huge and then lastly i would say you spoke about critical minerals and really recognizing that this transition and this increased reliance on batteries among other types of storage like pumped hydro but specifically batteries for our cars and the the power for our homes really requires us to recognize that if we do that without securing those materials domestically we're putting ourselves we're putting our national security at risk and so looking to secure the materials the lithium which our company is working on a project to extract lithium from our geothermal brine in the salton sea region which would provide the major has the ability to provide us with the majority of lithium that we use in the united states and then the rare earth elements that support not just energy but also our national defense systems and so that actually why why am i here berkshire hathaway energy we do have a natural gas pipeline system here in the state and about 500 employees in west virginia but we initially came to the state specifically to look at a rare earth elements project in that west virginia university is conducting to extract rare earth elements from acid mine drainage and we've partnered with wvu on that project and that initial visit to west virginia back in november of last year really we saw the opportunity to really support the transition to clean energy and the ira just helps us to do that so much more and helps all energy companies really to do it in a way that's responsible and truly gets us where we need to go for our energy future so thank you thank you because it has a direct impact not just on west virginia but if you can give us the impact that has on getting that line finished is there another project in the united states can bring that much energy that quickly to the market uh no sir um so explain that one to us uh you know i could talk for days on mvp and then we wouldn't have to hear from greg so that that could be nice um but no um assuming we got approvals it'd be about three to four months of construction and two bcf a day uh which would be huge and open up the bottleneck that is now in appalachia for for the gas producers what does that mean for as far as the market for west virginia what does it mean as far as the revenue for our state uh i think in annual taxes around 35 million will bring into the state of west virginia yeah um around 3 000 jobs construction jobs but annual payments of 35 million to the state and the project should have been done um in what was 2018 price of 2018 what's going to be the price now 3 billion then uh over six now it's doubled in price so um but just just really want to thank you i mean this legislation obviously doesn't happen without you um your staff renee cj lance did an amazing job uh with some broad balanced strategic initiatives here hydrogen carbon capture you know everyone's mentioned um it's really amazing and then that short turn around as the market turns you you're building a 42 inch line correct yes sir and you're how many miles you have left to go uh we have about 20 miles left okay out of how many 303. so you have everything else has been basically buried put together seeded and everything and restored and restored and that 42-inch line let's say that basically our economy changes from where natural gas is not as demand as hydrogen what can you do with that line the line can be sleeved and move hydrogen so it's dual purpose and and there's not another i'm getting a lot of you know i can handle because the bottom line is i just said give me another project that can bring this much to market that's all i care about how much product can you bring the market as quickly as possible and there's nothing else in the country there's nothing and when the xl pipeline when it went down two years ago it would have not been able to bring this much to market this quick correct okay greg what do you got now as far as on small producers greg basically represents the company that has much of the smaller the old traditional wells that we had straight down where a lot of people were worried about oh now the methane fee that we're going to put on here will put all of them out of business and what are we going to do we take them off the market so greg explain how this works with you all yeah i'll do a lot of reiterating so i'll do it quickly but um senator as you know rusty hudson our ceo a couple weeks ago said that you know the the energy provisions in this um this now law um allows a company like ours to continue and to operate in the energy future and that was the important part for us there's people believing that this methane tax is going to be absolutely detrimental to y'all's industry it's going to knock you all out of business and raise the prices so how you can't compete and it allows us that the the technology and the framework to continue to produce our existing mature assets by developing means for technology for controlling emissions retiring assets and allows us to focus on production and both retirement and emissions controls so you don't see that as a detriment at all we have we have been combing through and uh as you know we've had um our uh environmental health and safety folks working with your staff um uh for for quite some time and we really as we look at it from a company standpoint and from a an operator of existing you're talking about small operators kobe on yours on the large operators you see a detriment in there it can be harmful yeah no large operators um shouldn't be too much of an issue um you know joe i think the only concern that you get from this industry and you can you can imagine this industry has been uh you know beaten down to bp frank so you know i think the knee-jerk reaction from industry on any type of new regulation again against our our operations will you'll be met with some initial pushback but i think when people look and see how you drafted and put this methane uh put together you realize that it's actually if you're a great if you're a good operator good steward um then you should be in good in good good standing and guess what america produces the cleanest energy in the world and you know it's not going to be an issue for the operators that embrace that which is fortunately it's all of us let me just tell you when it was all about coal co2 that's all we heard about remember when coal start going in this direction then we start hearing okay the gas is coming up replacing the coal now it's all about methane and methane is much more detrimental so we think that there's a there's the technology is there and i've always said this if the technology is there no one can defend not using the technology is it affordable do we give you proper time to transition which we did all that the bottom line was on on this on on the the methane fee people think well that was good detriment no it isn't it's either basically get with it and make the investments and we'll be your partner and work with you or get the heck out of business if you don't do it right because it can be done right here's the thing i never knew i when i became chairman of the committee and and blm which is the bureau of land management which is all the federal millions and millions and millions of acres that we control come under my jurisdiction in my committee i didn't know that much about blm because it's all west of the mississippi we don't have blm much here in the east so i had to get up to speed on all that and i kept thinking why are they flaring so much up in the dakotas why is there so much going flaring on north dakota why is this and that i said my goodness we take the methane that's how consol started their whole energy business right taking the methane decantering the methane off the coal steel as i'm talking about off the coal seams and made a whole another product mark it i said it's it's valuable the problem was they never could on blm land they'd let you have a lease to go out and drill you'd produce but they wouldn't give you at least basically wouldn't give you a permit to build a pipeline to take the methane off so you were damned if you're doing damned if you don't and they just use it for whipping so i said okay fine we're all in this together so all my environmental friends says guys listen we're going to fix this thing i said we're going to need the product now if you're not going to hold them hostage and then basically let the federal government run them out of business by finding the living daylights out of them because you won't let them build a transmission line to pull the methane off so they can take it to market so we try to put some common sense to it if we're in this we're all in it together and that's where we've ended up with and i think that's right and and we think it has given a it will give a framework for conventional operators to to do it right to do it right into the future and if you have people that don't want to they're not going to be around very long i understand that but you know what this this is not designed to run anybody out of business it's designed to make you a better business person and and be also in compliance sam we leave anything left for you buddy oh i'm sorry to the 1973 gas lines and i remember sitting there remembering if that was a day i was supposed to be in line or not and that that came to mind but uh you know i think we've always been an energy state i think we are even more of an energy state now than we've ever been and i think uh a lot of the provisions in the ira are will really help us continue to do that i mean our industry as uh my friends have talked about i mean i think we we do things responsibly and uh you know the methane fees that you've talked about i mean if you know if we're if we're doing what we're doing and most of us are then those will be minimal and i think we can get there my big concern and we've all talked about it with mvp is the financial incentives seem to be there but for people to invest and deploy capital they need assurance that it's not going to be tied up six years as opposed to three years and sitting there with billions of dollars in increase and i think that permitting processes and getting those through and approved are going to be really critical thank you we're gonna go down now and i'm gonna here's how we're going to do it i want thomas you to go quickly if you can and then brandon basically give us the wrap up as far as on how you're transitioning and what 48c does for you whoever had 48c before then i'm going to come to tom and tom i want you to explain the tax when people are saying we're increasing taxes on people making two hundred thousand explain that math to me okay and then chris i want you to final up on the irs that we're going to put 87 000 gestapos with mr 15 or whatever ar15s coming after you okay so that tom all right i'll try to move quickly here senator so the nature conservancy basically focuses on two things at the global level that we're trying to do reduce and offset emissions to tackle the climate impacts that we're already feeling across the world and particularly feeling here in west virginia with floods and temperature changes and we work at the base of the foundation of what we do to protect the amazing nature of west virginia the appalachians and the world but we recognize that you don't do that just for nature's sake we're there trying to figure out how we do this balance for nature and people and for me as a west virginian our tagline for the west virginia chapter is to do this and make nature and people thrive together that's my commitment to west virginia and the work that we do and i want to thank the senator because the ira takes practical solutions-oriented approach that provides several investments and incentives that get us towards both of those goals if we focus in on the emissions reduction and tackling climate change side we can think about those provisions like the emerging technologies that to reach zero emission is uh the tax incentives to accelerate development of renewables we have four hundred 000 acres of open mind lands in west virginia we can repurpose for energy and that becomes a part of our energy economy um we've got the domestic manufacturing and advanced energy tech in clean manufacturing west virginia is ripe for those type of technologies to be seeded here in west virginia if we get behind them and the carbon capture and storage incentives that are in in the bill are really important not only for the reduction and capping of emissions but so that everybody that's sitting in this room can participate in that low-carbon future and it can be a part of their business model that brings revenue and investment to their business model as well so the second part of what i'd like to emphasize about the ira is that we have an amazing nature in here in west virginia it's part of who we are it's in our dna but it's also outside our window and defining our lives and sometimes we can take that for granted but the forests of west virginia and appalachians are an amazingly important resource for the world for carbon storage not only for the plants and animals and species we love to look at but this is an important landscape for making sure that we keep that carbon stored in our trees and in our soils and we have a real contribution to make there so the investments and incentives for climate smart ag and forestry natural climate solutions based on the nature that we have are going to go a long way and make real contributions to both of those goals i want it all i want the beautiful nature and i want it to be serving those climate goals that we have and we can do that in west virginia and west virginians need to get better at saying we can do it all as opposed to one thing oh i'm sorry tom i'm sorry no no so i just wanted to end then i'm trying to go fast here so i'm going to end now so i would just like to thank you again senator for pushing the ira forward you know we've been working across the aisles for a long time and many people are in support of these these incentives and these initiatives that are included in the ira we want to continue those discussions there are real dollars and real outcomes for west virginians for jobs health livelihoods we have real climate outcomes and as a west virginian i'm glad that we're getting our fair share of these benefits as we step boldly into the future i would be remiss to say if i didn't say as a as a the nature conservancy's representative this building on past commitments on climate gets us to 40 percent of goal we still have a gap so i look forward to working with everybody here and to all of our partners across the aisle in the future to think about what's the next bold steps we can take and how is that going to benefit west virginia as we are true to our roots as a traditional energy state and step boldly into this low-carbon future thank you thomas brandon senator the first thing i want to say is just as a lifelong west virginian growing up here seeing you in the spotlight uh i'm just so proud i just feel like you've embodied the best of us you know to be honest to be fair to have the courage to be a problem solver you know folks who oppose this are basically for doing nothing i mean i'm hearing crazy talk out there about how this is going to decimate the economy of the coal fields well those people must not be living in the coal fields because we've done been decimated you know i mentioned being born and raised that friends that i've grown up with most have left to find jobs more than i can fathom have died because of addiction which is tied directly to economic hopelessness that we've been feeling so to sit back and say to oppose say we're not gonna do anything about inflation we're not gonna do anything about economic diversification to try and bring jobs we're not going to do anything about invent what 48c does this is legislation that senator staff has been working explain to him about 48c it's in the bill we're this is the only place i can put this piece of legislation and it's all geared tell them what it is it's about manufacturing bringing manufacturing green manufacturing to extraction communities so it's saying okay markets are changing fossil fuels some fossil fuels are in decline maybe we're going to have to we want to bring manufacturing here for green batteries let's do it in those extraction communities what cecil is just talking about let's get some actual good paying union jobs in the manufacturing sector to come here to west virginia what it basically said very quickly is that if you have a coal community that had a coal plant or anything related to coal or coal uh a coal power plant that has been shuttered and that economy has been decimated you can use 48c there's four billion dollars set aside strictly for coal around the country most of us going to be in the west virginia areas in some of the pennsylvania western pennsylvania some a little bit of ohio but we are going to be the cross crux of this and you give a 30 reduction on anyone you can attract to the state of west virginia to bring in businesses in those shuttered areas and i've been trying to diversify the economy of southern west virginia this is year 12. i've had more interest from the private sector manufacturing sector in the last year just with an eye towards this hopefully passing than i did the previous 11. so we're feeling a real impact in southern west virginia already just on hopes that this would pass because the incentives are so strong with a focus on coal communities also for solar coalfield development helped invest in solar holler the first solar company in the southern part of the state we're talking about tax credits for renewable energy then there's a 10 boost if you're in a fossil fuel area if you're in a coal impacted area there's an additional 10 percent boost dan conan my friend at solar holler is just giddy about this is going to double the size of his company right here in west virginia these are ibew union jobs so i just i want to thank you for how you've held yourself uh throughout this with a major spotlight on you but i want to thank you as a southern west virginian for giving us a chance this bill gives us a chance to get back in the game to diversify our economy to have some good paying jobs and to stay relevant in changing energy markets um and and i'm hopeful thank you sir thanks brett tom explain the math thank you very much senator and uh appreciate it i'm glad you gave me two hours to do this uh oh you didn't well let me tell you we have uh i'm listed on the agenda's tax issues i would rather modify that slightly and say we're really talking about cost and price policy issues because what the the word on the street is you add a 15 minimum tax and that's going to add to costs and that's going to be passed along to the consumers and unfortunately or unfortunately since 1989 i have done published pricing guides for printing companies and so forth and dealt with uh cost price issues all those years so i'll let chris take care of the tax issues but let's deal with this cost thing 15 first off there are different types of corporations c corps s corpse there's other kinds of formations this tax the minimum tax applies to c corporations if you take the s corpse and the c corpse and put everybody together in the partnerships about 19 of those in america are c corporations c corporations are when you take your sales and you subtract your direct materials you subtract your labor you subtract your overhead you have income and that's what is the taxes paid for as you mentioned earlier senator 52 companies in the united states haven't paid no corporate income tax well we're still looking at this so 19 of them are c corporations but even at that the tax doesn't apply unless the net income that sales minus paying for the direct materials minus the wages minus the overhead unless we don't have a billion dollars and there's a offset there with the foreign corporations and so forth but this isn't going to be a fake touch we didn't touch foreign we didn't go overseas they wanted to go overseas and i said no we can't in a very unstable market with worldwide inflation we're not going to go down that path we're going to make sure that we're stable here in this country and we stayed in that we stayed and domestically in our own country so we didn't the guilty and all the other stuff they were telling you about that made us right we didn't touch that at all okay we're ready we're willing to go if the if the uh odc oec if they go which other foreign countries but not until then we're not going to leave the charge on that so we kept that under test okay so it only affects a small percentage of the total corporations uh or businesses now those businesses and prior to not 2017 paid this uh normal corporate tax it ran from 19 to 31 percent sliding scale it was dropped to 21 and they removed the alternative minimum tax at that time which was 20 percent now corporations took a opportunities to take lawful deductions and got down well below the 21 and so what this bill does is it adds to it just simply says there's 15 percent a minimum tax that we've got to pay and it's not so much that we're increasing the taxes there as much as it is we are taking away the uh the extraordinary advantage a company has not paying a tax where their competitor does pay a tax so we're leveling the uh playing field on that and we ask if that will be passed along to consumers well it's it's a complex price policy uh thing but if you if you think that when a retailer puts something on sale if they're losing money on it if you think they're losing money on it then that's not correct because they're expanding typically expanding the quantity that's sold and this is a similar situation the corporate income tax is paid on what is left over not what is going into the costs and we don't normally use that as a hard cost corporate income taxes hard costs to market up there's other price drivers in each industry oil would be a price driver a lot of times for coal energy and so forth so there's many different kinds of things not all of them are just basically cost plus so no this is not an increase in taxes especially on the consumer i've never seen anything chris you might want to wrap this thing up for us real quickly because there's an awful lot of scare tactics being used 87 000 gestapo agents from the irs also on top of that if you make 200 000 unless you're going to raise your tax that kind of stuff so if you want to just touch on any of that sure thank you thank you senator manchin yeah i mean it's it's been interesting to see the media reaction and and uh i think the tanks are being produced right now for the irs to use but but that's it's just uh you know just look back at the the mess the irs situation is in right now and i appreciate you know you putting this legislation in and helping to push this through because it has been a disaster there's a 21.3 million or 21.3 million backlog of returns to be processed there's you know the employees there's 30 000 less employees than the early 1990s at the irs uh there's 52 000 that are going to be eligible for retirement in the next five years and so you start to think about the sheer number of the backlog and how customer service and taxpayer services can can get better i think the statistic i saw was 167 million phone calls the last tax season of which only 10 percent of those made it to an agent so 167 million i can tell you personally i spent a lot of time on hold uh a lot of time on hold we would i would start on hold at 8 am in my office and be on hold until sometimes noon 1 2 3 p.m in the day waiting on an irs agent to kind of help to try to help a customer or a client of ours so just a lot of a lot of issues there that need to be dealt with and appreciate the funding that is coming in you know to solve this i do think secretary ellen has has issued a mandate to the irs in six months to issue a report uh of how they can use the funds that have been set aside i think it's eight billion a year uh there's you know there's not there's not going to be 87 000 irs agents hired there's it's impossible everybody at this table would love to have that many uh opportunities for employees at this point they're just not there and so i think it's it's critical to to debunk those myths and make sure we understand uh you know what we're trying to do here with the funds uh the other piece is the guns and and that piece there's there's a i think there's 2 000 employees at the irs that are you know in that department that have guns and so yes the media is just i think just taking it to that point but you know there's just a lot of opportunities here i think that we can hit with customer service uh we can see what the irs needs modernization i mean every big company now has the ability of callback systems and and it's just that you know you don't have that with the irs and so there's a lot of opportunities there that i think will will bring great customer service and and increase the opportunities there the fact on the the 400 000 or the 200 000 uh you know they they've made it very clear there's letters coming out from various uh secretary and treasury let me just clear that one up for you first of all we had it in the language when we passed it we were passing the bill and working on it when it was on the floor we had the guard rails i made sure we put that in there 400 000 can't touch small businesses you can't touch it's basically for increasing the the quality of the of the equipment i.t that we were going to use technology the babies would be able to answer your questions automatically without hold be able to do it returns smaller returns people that are paying through earned income basically that's not where the problem is the problem is all in the higher end when they can basically divert that that's what they were looking for and i'll make one other point real quick charles reddick our ettig charles redick is the head of the irs he is a trump appointee he has been there done a great job he was bipartisan a good man sharp and he has debunked everything that's been said everything that's been said he said that is not true it will not happen but politically it sounds that's the number one thing we have they're weaponizing they're going to come after you they're going to do this and that that's not the case at all if you want your phone call returned if you want to make if you need help with you're putting your you know they're going to be able to do online with all this new stuff coming out it's going to be unbelievable so i'm sorry but yeah exactly right i mean to just modernize modernize and spend the money on the technology i think that's a critical piece and the customer service i mean that's that's that's got to get i mean i personally have clients that have been waiting for years for returns to be processed that erode you know hundreds of millions of dollars from from the irs and refunds and and so i think you know we appreciate you pushing this through and helping with this legislation to really focus on you know how we can get better with it let me tell you another thing about what's so funny about this piece the irs there was a dear republican friend of mine from ohio brought to my attention when we were doing the bipartisan infrastructure bill and he said joe he says there's a pay for we're looking for how you pay for things you do and we call them pay for us he says we've been working on this for a long time trying to get the irs up to speed where they could do their job more effectively and efficiently to bring in more money that that the treasury's not receiving we said that's great but it fell out of that bill it didn't make it in them for okay and they're the ones that brought it to our attention my republican friends and now all of a sudden they're the same ones beating the living crap out of it saying it's weaponized i said come on guys you can have it both ways so we just basically today's the whole thing the presentation is the facts of what this piece of legislation it's a balanced piece of legislation and we had a lot of input from people on both sides of the al that benefit and babies thought they were going to be detrimental to them and for you all to be able to look at it for the professional we didn't talk to you all before what to say and there tell us you know anything we can make it better making sure the only thing i would tell you if you think it's been weaponized call my office i can tell you it wasn't intended i can tell you that janet yellen will not let that happen i can tell you the president united states when all that that happened it was not the intent if you think somebody's harassing you and coming after you and targeting you call me call the office we'll take care of that for you so that put that to rest there's other things here the opportunities are going to be tremendous for our state of west virginia we just have to be prepared for it and that's the bottom line i'm concerned about the workforce do we have the workforce to be basically to meet the demand do we have the supply of the workforce steve i look at you all back there and and senator and all you guys are fighting for we've got to have a trained workforce that can rise to the occasion charlie and the whole thing and is in the supply chain and all of that i appreciate it an open mind to all of what we've done here this could be the most transformative piece of legislation that i've ever seen come down the pike for an awful long time not because we were involved but because basically we come from a state that's been affected by some policies that haven't been good for our for our country i believe and this is one that we can take care of what you need today and look at what we can provide tomorrow and we never had that opportunity and west virginia can play a part in that before we go we'll get we'll go to the press so i'll go up to there and anybody whoever the press wants to talk to from the audience i know you wanted to you had a couple comments if you would this act is beneficial to west virginia there any question about it why would no republican representing west virginia vote for this bill why is that you know it's not just the republican and democrats basically the political atmosphere we're in today whatever side you're on if something looks like it could be very beneficial and i'm going to be honest with you all i didn't do this to help the democrats or hurt the republicans i did it to help the country i swear to god i didn't look at it from the standpoints of politics everybody kind of thinks that it happened because of politics and those those who know me and work with me before when i got i got covered on that monday before the wednesday and they were voting on the chips bill and i guess that and it had been said and they didn't tell me about this that mitch mcconnell said that he wouldn't move the chips bill if he thought we were going to do reconciliation and he'd been talking off and on to me for a month or so we go on the floor we talk you're not going to do a big bill i said i'm not doing any big bill i'm not in favor of a big bill mitch i'm not going to do that but i said i'll tell you this if i have a chance to put an energy policy together for our country i'm going to do it i never thought he'd get that chance i never in the wildest dreams that i think that they would give me the pin and let my committee work as they did for three months with each and every one of you all to put something that made so much sense for our country never thought that would happen so they were just assuming nothing was going to happen i don't know why but i they always knew if i could do something with energy that helped the country i would do it but i kept my mouth shut because i didn't think it would happen i get coveted on monday morning so i can't go to i'm done and so now monday my staff says i said how are we doing well they agreed on this they agreed on this we changed this this is looking good monday night i mean we're going around the clock tuesday are we getting closer by tuesday night we had draft we had language and by wednesday morning we had agreement on all the language i'm still in covet but going back and forth on that and schumer calls and i says chuck i think we've got the bill if you guys are going to sign off on it we we gave you what what we're going to sign off on if you guys are he says we accept it president calls we all talk i said let me make sure you all understand none of this all this is great but it doesn't have any it doesn't do what this country needs unless we do overhaul of our permitting process we cannot build things in america today because of the permitting and i says we have written a bill permitting overhaul and we're basing it off of canada and other countries that have very strict uh environmental controls but also they accelerate they give you time they give the they give these these uh agencies time certain whether it be on nepa whether it be on a water or the corps of engineers whether it be interior and then it lets it let's if you're going to build something or you want to build a transmission line to take wind and solar from the desert into the metropolis areas and you want to get that transmission line built then you know specifically that could be done no more than six months to two years you should be finished if not they're going to say can't be done reject you quickly before you go down the path of spending from three billion to six billion we're wearing people out no other country does what we do so we've written a bill that helps both the existing technology is this the energies we have for energy and the new technology that we're going to need to bring on board for the new clean transition and now i got them saying oh we're not going to agree to that i couldn't put that piece of legislation in that piece of vegetation in this bill because it had no financial ramifications to it which fits into the reconciliation so it got thrown out with a birdbath but i have a commitment from the president commitment from nancy pelosi and a commitment from chuck schumer i'm not signing off on any of this unless you all sign off that'll be in the end bill continuing resolution here's the politics we're dealing with i've got the hard left right now saying hell no we're not going to do anything now that makes it look like we're helping mansion and i said you're not helping me you're helping yourself if you want to get anything built in america so it takes 60 votes in the senate to build to pass this only takes 218 in the senate and in the house to do it my republican friend said and lindsey graham a friend of mine he says if joe thinks we're going to do that he's crazy we're not going to do that and i'm thinking this is something the republican party has wanted for the last five to seven years i've been with him joe we've got to do permitting reform the first thing they had three things they wanted joe we got to pay down debt we're not taking care of our finances i said guys i agree with you first time in 25 years we paid down debt 300 billion dollars 25 years first time number two they said joe we got to produce more energy hell you can't you can't just wait for the feds to raise the rates that basically are going to stop you all from wanting to go buy anything we've got to basically be able to produce more so i said fine more production we got it number three they said you've got to have permit reform if we don't do that permitting they've been trying forever i said guys i got it trust me i understand that because it's and we're not we're not bypassing anything we're accelerating so if you have a permit you can go to interior you can go basically the core of engineers you can go to epa all at one time boom boom boom boom and have a move simultaneously that's all we're doing that's what canada does that's what the developed nations do and now they're going to play politics with that on continuing resolution which basically keeps the cu either keeps the country open or we shut down government that'll happen september 30th so let's see how that politics plays out now that's that's what we're dealing with so with that i just want to thank you all and only thing i can tell you is politics has become a very very nasty uh destructive type of uh process anymore and both sides are guilty of weaponizing weaponizing the good of america for the good of their party both sides and it's just not right for our country so we're we're going to rise above that and this is a piece of legislation if we keep our heads down we can show what can be done

WITHOUT OBJECTION. MR. CARPER: THANK YOU, MADAM PRESIDENT. 234 YEARS AGO TODAY, THE STATE OF DELAWARE BECAME THE FIRST STATE TO RATIFY THE CONSTITUTION. FOR ONE WHOLE WEEK, DELAWARE WAS THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, AND WE OPENED IT UP AND 49 OTHER STATES HAVE JOINED US SINCE THEN. FOR THE MOST PART, I THINK IT'S TURNED OUT WELL. THE PREAMBLE TO THE CONSTITUTION DOESN'T SAY WE'RE GOING TO FORM A PERFECT UNION WHEN THEY ADOPTED IT ALL THOSE YEARS AGO. THEY SAID IN ORDER TO MOVE TOWARD A MORE PERFECT UNION, ACKNOWLEDGING THAT WE'RE NOT PERFECT, HAVEN'T GOT AT ANY RIGHT, AND WE MAY NEVER GET IT RIGHT. BUT TODAY, WE TAKE A BIG STEP, WE CAN TAKE A BIG STEP TOARKD MAKING OUR UNION -- TOWARD MAKING OUR UNION A BIT CLOSER TO PERFECTION. THE CONSTITUTION LAYS OUT A BALANCE OF POWERS THAT CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITIES ARE FALLEN ON THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, THE PRESIDENT, CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITIES ON US. OF COURSE, THE COURTS HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THEIR OWN. THE PRESIDENT HAS NOMINATED THIS THIS INSTANCE, A FELLOW NAMED CHRIS MAGNUS, HE'S NOMINATED HIM TO SERVE AS COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECT, C.B.P., A VERY BIG AND IMPORTANT JOB AS THE PRESIDING OFFICER KNOWS. I SAY THAT LEADERSHIP MAY BE THE MOST IMPORTANT IN LEADING THE SUCCESS OF ANY ORGANIZATION I'VE EVER SEEN IN GOVERNMENT, OUTSIDE OF GOVERNMENT, IT'S THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT INGREDIENT. CHIEF CHRIS MAGNUS HAS OVER 40 YEARS OF EXEMPLARY PUBLIC SERVICE IN COMMUNITIES THAT SPAN ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. HE HAS A STRONG TRACK RECORD OF COLLABORATIVE LEADERSHIP, AND HIS NOMINATION EARNED THE SUPPORT OF DOZENS AND DOZENS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PUBLIC SAFETY ORGANIZATIONS. MADAM PRESIDENT, IT'S BEEN EIGHT MONTHS, EIGHT MONTHS PASSED SINCE OUR PRESIDENT NOMINATED CHIEF MAGNUS FOR THIS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ROLE AT THE DEPARTMENT. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE COUNTING ON LEADERSHIP AT THE AGENCY. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO CONFIRM THIS NOP NATION AND -- NOMINATION AND PROVIDE THE LEADERSHIP THAT IS BADLY NEEDED, ESPECIALLY ON THE BORDERS OF OUR NATION. LAST THING I WOULD SAY, THIS IS ALSO PEARL HARBOR DAY, A DAY TO REMEMBER THOSE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES, SACRIFICED THEIR LIVES, STANDING UP FOR US, ALL THOSE YEARS AGO,

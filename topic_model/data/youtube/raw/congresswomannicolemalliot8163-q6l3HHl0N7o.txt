uh thank you mr chairman um thank you for having this hearing today i want to talk a little bit about the inconsistencies that we're hearing from the federal level the state level local levels uh i think it's been the double standards that have been put in place that have been very stressful uh and for my constituents um and infuriating quite frankly for example just recently our mayor announced that if you're a baseball star or a basketball star uh or even a performer that you don't need a vaccine to continue doing your job yet 1500 city workers firefighters police officers teachers they were fired for failing to comply with the vaccine mandate i would love to hear dr wolinski's opinion on uh what science what science was my mayor using and saying that you know if you're if you're a brooklyn net you don't need the vaccination but if you are a new york city firefighter you do um is there a science that was being followed there um thank you congresswoman so let me just say that cdc provides guidance um at the national level um that guidance and recommendations are really intended to be able to be useful and in places such as cherokee nation as well as new york city as well as rural montana as we put those guidances forward we certainly have recommended strongly both vaccines and booster shots demonstrating that boosters are working our data demonstrate that um if you are vaccinated and boosted as i just mentioned you have a 21 less sold less likelihood of death compared to if you're unvaccinated in the context of this guidance though we have always said that um this guidance is applied locally and that we give and we're very deferential to our political leaders locally to apply the guidance for what is happening locally this is critically important because this disease is local what is happening with disease in your county in your jurisdiction so as we have provided high-level guidance and recommendations that is intended to be applied we certainly would be deferential to the local leaders for how those policies should be made but but shouldn't there be consistency why is a brooklyn nets player or a let's say before it was even if you're a fan of the stadium you need to be vaccinated but if you're playing on the court you you you do need to be vaccinated now we're seeing that if you're an athlete or performer in new york city you don't need to be vaccinated but if you're a new york city first responder you do i mean don't you think it's important that the municipalities have consistency here i mean isn't it wrong that people are losing their livelihoods if they choose not to be mandated particularly in light of this new decision by our mayor you know certainly um i can't speak for mayor's decisions or how he made those decisions what i can say is the cbc recommendations and guidance is to get vaccinated to get boosted we know those vaccines are saving lives those boosters are saving lives so from our guidance perspective we would recommend it and what is the cdc guidance related to vaccine mandates for public school students across the country the cdc does actually not um apply any mandates the cdc um again for all vaccinations and school-age children as well we don't have mandates we um have guidance and what we do do is um synthesize all those policies on our cdc website so it's um transparent as to where those policies are but the cdc does not apply those merits okay and lastly um what is the administration telling you about i i guess there's a push now to pass a new coveted relief package um and my concern is that there have been billions of dollars in fraud in both the paycheck protection program and the unemployment insurance fund i understand as part of the chairman's memo regarding this uh meeting that part of the topic was going to be you know programs for economic development i understand that you're at the c here at cdc and not necessarily administering these programs but have you had any conversations with your colleagues in the administration on how to ensure that this money that was fraudulently taken from the taxpayers is returned to the treasury because i am hesitant to support any type of additional funding if we are not going to have accountability for the up to hundreds of billions it's estimated roughly 400 billion is the high estimate um that has been taken fraudulently through the ppp and unemployment insurance program here's what i can tell you representative what i can say is we're in a critical juncture right now where we are low on funds in the federal government in order to not only purchase vaccines boosters tests and um therapeutics but to deliver them and administer them to the american people we at cdc are deeply concerned about our ability to look at vaccine effectiveness studies studies that are germane into how we use these looking at studies of long covet post covenant conditions over the long term what are these what are these post coding conditions mean and i've run i've run out of time i just i just want to simply say that we should find out what happened to that money because to ask the taxpayers for more when we have hundreds of billions dollars that was lost is just unconscionable so let's find that money because it should have been used for its intended purpose to begin with thank you well generally this time has expired

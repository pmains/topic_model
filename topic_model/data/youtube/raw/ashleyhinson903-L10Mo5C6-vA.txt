but what we've seen lately is um is fear monitoring is also a way to become political with our children instead of putting our children at this moment I believe that we have to make up for our achievement Gap you know after Colvin our kids have lost a lot of time so I believe that we need to certainly concentrate on the studies of their academics number two mental health issues mental health issues have prevented a lot of children from succeeding big obstacles in the classroom number three teacher shortages with our teacher shortage it already exacerbates the problem of small class sizes and and at a state level we have seen the state budget for Education diminish over time I believe that it is diminished I think my Republican Brethren argued with me about that but it has demolition we have an economist as a state center who has said that it's diminished over you know several years and we have to you know increase our rates very high to support education if we were to catch up we have sunk from number one we have we've been at number one and we have sunk to the bottom of the barrel with our education we need to be focused on the academics in the classroom and finally our safety in schools you know superintendents have told me that you know they used to be worried about making the budget and they used to be worried about teacher shortages and they're worried about safety in schools as well and that the school has become a lot facility instead of a community Gathering Place like a wisman weiner in school you know our parents walked in we had activities in schools and it's just become a place that isn't as safe as it used to be so those are the things that I think instead of relying on peer monitoring and you know and political gamesmanship with that parents can always go to teachers and ask questions they can always go to the principal and the superintendent of schools to ask questions um we know that policy the policy of Limar School in Alberta is to be that the school board passed is aligned with the code in the Iowa law and it's about reducing discrimination for eliminating discrimination and harassing for children and so you have an opportunity in all of your schools to go for a school board member and that's what you should be concentrating on is voting the people in that you feel will do the best for our children we've lost sight of children being at the center of office they need to be learning and then you need to shore up their academics at the company

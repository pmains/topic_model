Mr. Speaker, the tired the poor the
huddled masses yearning to breathe free are still welcome in America, no thanks
to President Trump. Today, for the second time, President Trump lost a ruling on
his Muslim ban in the federal court of appeals. The purpose of the president's
ban is clear. The then-presidential candidate Trump explicitly called for a
total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. Just last
week, President Trump criticized his revised ban as "politically correct" and
called for a "much tougher version." The president's executive order is a Muslim
ban, plain and simple. Any argument to the contrary is undercut by the president's
own tweets. President Trump, by his own words and by his own actions, is
abdicating America's moral leadership. The greatness of America is not built on
isolation and discrimination; it is built on the rule of law and the ideals of
equality and inclusion and on a rich history of immigration. I yield back.

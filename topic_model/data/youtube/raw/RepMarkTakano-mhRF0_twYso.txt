if you don't know the name Ana Zamora you will after tonight she's one of the first lady's guests at the State of the Union allowed to stay in the country under the president's immigration policy she'll be in the gallery to highlight the need for immigration reform and right now the president has the country support for it fifty-two percent approve of his immigration policy with forty four percent disapproving in our new NBC Wall Street Journal poll but digging into the numbers you'll you'll see only fifteen percent disapprove of the policy itself it's a policy that say that's very personal to our next guest as a California dreamer she's made it her life's mission to fight for the rights of undocumented immigrant students depression I want to be read Wow joining us now is I Talia and Democratic congressman from California mark Takano who invited I Talia to be his guest at the state of the union tonight thank you both for joining us thank you thank you for having us so as I pointed out in the NBC Wall Street Journal poll fifty two percent of americans favor immigration reform but there isn't so much so much support for it on Capitol Hill so congressman I guess this question is she what are the chances that the republican-controlled Congress will actually do something send a bill to the president that he could sign that would bring about comprehensive immigration reform well realistically I don't know that this Congress this republican-controlled Congress has prepared to do anything at all they had a tremendous opportunity in the 113th Congress to pass a bipartisan Senate bill which had 14 Republican senators sign on to it it was a terrible tragedy to me that we did not have a vote in the house that democracy was not allowed to work I believed along with many others that that bill would have passed had it been allowed a fair chance had been allowed in afghan vote right i tell you i wanted to get your thoughts on recent actions by house republicans as you know they voted to block the president's actions on immigration and specifically to end the deferred action for childhood arrivals program that allows dreamers like yourselves in some cases to be able to stay in the country without fear now they seem to view this as sort of a chance to make a political point an empty symbolic gesture do you view it that way or do you view it as a more of a direct attack on your community it definitely is a direct attack towards our community then it's gonna remember these attacks on it and when it comes 2016 it's definitely something to keep in mind the Latino vote is very very important and the community when it feels under attack we definitely fight back yeah absolutely that's a good point and congressman I mean you know this the president hasn't always satisfied activists on immigration in fact up until his latest executive action there was really a lot of anger that he wasn't bold enough our activists satisfied are you satisfied and what more would you like to hear tonight from President Obama on this well I'm very clear that the immigrant community knows that President Obama is on their side I believe that the president needs to stand strong call on the Congress to pass the Homeland Security funding bill to stop messing around with our national security folks like Italia are not a threat to our country she and her parents are very hard working people if we were to deport them and along with 11 other people we would actually hurt our economy if we had passed the comprehensive immigration bill that was done by the Senate last session we would have grown our economy by a significant amount more than it would then that it is now congressman mark Takano Italia Garcia thank you very much

thank you very much mr chairman and i thank all of you for your testimony today i thank my colleagues for being here and being involved in this discussion let me just for the record say that i understand fiscal responsibility and accountability as well as anyone i believe that those who break the law should be punished i also believe that it is important that when you make recommendations to usda or any other agency you give them the opportunity to make the corrections and i appreciate the fact that you've done that and usda has agreed that they want to do it it is important for us to understand a couple of things one is that when we use the words waste fraud and abuse we don't use it in defense we don't use it in transportation and infrastructure we use it for poor people we use it in domestic programs we use it in social security medicaid and medicare we create a narrative that is stereotypical of that is unfair and inaccurate we're doing it in this committee and we're doing it in agriculture where i also sit which has some oversight of nutrition i have come to the point where it is my understanding that the only thing we are concerned about is poor people and if they are scamming the system we didn't do it in iraq and afghanistan where we spent more than 800 billion dollars i don't recall hearing about waste fraud and abuse only in these programs i appreciate the fact that you are working very hard to make sure that the taxpayers money is spent appropriately i agree with what you do i also agree that it's important to feed hungry children i agree with that i agree with the fact that we need to have this oversight in this committee what i don't agree with is how we go about it so uneven and and heavy-handed and so i want to again thank you for being here i want to thank you for your work but i also want you to understand that this isn't just not about hungry children this is about how we treat and respect people we represent the taxpayers that send us here mr chairman i yield back

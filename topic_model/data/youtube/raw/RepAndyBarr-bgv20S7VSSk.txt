appreciate you holding this very important hearing and i'm really appreciate the testimony and expertise of our witnesses a great discussion and um it reminds me a little bit of my constitutional law class in law school but it's it's it's very it's it's probably better than that um let me ask you let me ask you a question uh to both of our remaining witnesses here that's kind of basic a basic question does the president ever have the power under the constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation and answer that question irrespective of the war powers resolution i do not believe so um in my view the president only has general in unilateral authority to defend the nation um in the face of an imminent um attack exactly how imminent it must be as a matter for some dispute but but the power is limited to a fairly narrow scope of self-defense professor goldsmith i would tend to agree i might define it a little bit more broadly than that but this main problem with many of the article two uses of force by the president in recent decades is that it has no self-defense justification it's far removed from self-defense and these are in my view the low-hanging fruit for war power resolution reform so defining self-defense is a difficult question and i think that you should do it but there are lots of things that are obviously not self-defense where the president has been using force yeah this concept of anticipatory self-defense is a isn't is a tricky one and obviously the founding fathers couldn't envision the the the spectrum of threats uh that we face today um but you know i would i'd be interested to follow a question would be how how does the the declaration clause um and the spending power limit the commander-in-chief's authority to conduct foreign relations um as commander-in-chief if if congress doesn't exercise it and in that context let's go back to the youngstown decision the uh the the justice jackson's analysis and the steel seizure case the way i look at this congress has really abdicated its authority in many of these cases the president is operating in a zone of twilight if you will and um congressional acquiescence has really given and this is a bit of a self-criticism of the institution in which i serve but this is this has given the president quite a bit of power do you all agree that justice jackson's analysis in youngstown applies in many of these contexts today so i will say that um yes the question is um is how much authority does the president have to act on his own um so of course youngstown suggests the president when congress is silent the president has the authority that he has on his own um and then we go back to the question of how extensive article authorities in fact are um if congress has not rejected the president's action and i think jack and i both agree that it's not unlimited by any means but you're right that congress's silence has been interpreted in many instances to authorize the president to act more broadly than that professor hathaway can i follow up on your your suggestion about uh involving the courts now and providing a mechanism to for congress to push back in the courts uh i appreciate that suggestion but do judges really have the competency of putting aside the political question doctrine and justice ability do judges really have the competency to make national security decisions you know they really already do um so so this question gets raised all the time and it's so striking to me that we think that somehow um kind of suddenly lose their capacity to make decisions when it comes to more powers questions they're making the exact same decisions when it comes for instance to issues of detention so they're interpreting the scope of the 2001 authorization for use of military force when they're making determinations about the scope of the president's detention authority whether you can hold certain people um on guantanamo or not um and we have the fisa court the fisa court is specifically made up of article three judges whose whole job is to make national security decisions so i do think thank you yeah fair points final question on this on sunset um as you know we're nearing a self-imposed deadline for withdrawal of our presence is afghanistan um are there any lessons from from this do you all feel that our enemies and future engagements would take note of an end date on an aumf and then simply re-engage in hostilities after our forces have left that's a fear that has been articulated and i think that if it is understood as a reauthorization requirement um that there's no reason to believe that our enemies are going to see that as a sort of certain end date congress is capable of acting to reauthorize it does that in all kinds of circumstances the ndaa is reenacted every year and so congress is quite capable of reauthorizing and i expect it would reauthorize on a regular basis so i think that warriors is not necessarily well placed jeremy's time is expired thank you

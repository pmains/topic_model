hey everybody it's mark kelly i wanted to reach out because i know many of you are worried about what the potential spread of coronavirus could mean to you and your families these are challenging and uncertain times but we need to remember that there's nothing more important than doing what we can to help our neighbors there are many organizations that are working on the front lines every day to care for the most vulnerable members of our communities and we want to support their work now one of these organizations is the arizona food bank network this network supports arizona's largest food banks and food banks are especially important as so many arizonans are facing lost jobs or reduced hours at work so today we're asking folks to help and we're asking them to ship in a few bucks to help support the arizona food bank network and all of the important work that they're doing so if you can use the link in this post to chip in and help us make sure that families can keep food on their tables in the coming months

[Applause] our personal freedom is being sacrificed up in the name of protecting our health and this is a this is a battle that those who are worried about vaccinations are fighting every day but we're good we're gonna see it in spades soon and I'm reminded of my father in years ago the swine flu shot I don't know if you remember a long time ago and he came down with a syndrome and that was that was a direct result of a rush to vaccination and I seen that coming and it was hugely damaging to him he almost lost his life so our personal freedoms are gonna be taken during this face that we're looking at and we're gonna have to fight and fight and fight to get them back [Applause] [Music]

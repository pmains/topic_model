the chair now recognizes uh ms woloski for five minutes thank you mr chairman gentlemen thank you for your service thank you for being here today i think that arguably the most important thing the federal government is working on right now is ensuring and i'm an optimist and listening to you this morning i'm so optimistic that we're going to use the term when and not if when it comes to getting a vaccine shown through trials to be safe and effective that we have manufacturing and distribution capabilities to go and get it across the nation quickly i believe that president trump has already announced operation warp speed to achieve the goal of delivering 300 million doses of an approved vaccine by january of 2021 it's leveraging the full strength of the public and private sectors the partnerships that are there and becoming partnerships is in is unprecedented in this country and i salute that astrozenica told the energy and commerce committee a few days ago that this deal with the federal government stipulates that it will sell 300 million doses to the government at no profit johnson johnson similarly said it will provide its vaccine at a not-for-profit price other companies working on vaccines have also promised low prices dr fauci between the promises for low prices and existing government programs that cover the cost of a vaccine is it safe to say that every american will be able to get a vaccine once it's approved given what you've mentioned which i agree with the promises of the company about hundreds of millions of doses i believe ultimately over a period of time in 2021 if we have and i think we will have a safe and effective vaccine that americans will be able to get it i don't think that they will have everybody getting it immediately in the beginning it probably will be phased in and that's the reason why we have the committees to do the prioritization of who should get it first but ultimately within a reasonable period of time the plans now allow for any american who needs a vaccine to get it within the year twenty two right and that is the plan staying on the topic of vaccines dr fauci it's my understanding that operation warp speed enabled clinical trials for the most promising vaccine candidates to be run simultaneously which will get a vaccine to the market much faster than normal my understanding from listening to you just a few minutes ago we have eliminated no safety steps in the vaccine approval process correct that is correct correct that is correct again just to be clear so the folks that are watching this are hearing this clearly concisely and truthfully from you the fda is not compromising safety standards in order to speed up vaccine process approval correct well i would say it a different way okay we at the nih are doing the vaccine studies with the companies the fda will look at that data and on a science-based decision we'll make a determination as to the safety and efficacy and whether or not it will be approved so the fda is a science-based decision maker but as far as you know in that i agree but the fda is not compromising safety standards no no i know how no way no how is the fda compromising safety standards and their answers and their approvals are based on science yeah historically the fda has based their decisions on science they will do it this time also i'm sorry i appreciate it thanks for your assurances that we'll have a safe affordable and widely available vaccine for the american people all of america is praying that one of these promising candidates comes through that's why i'm so disappointed that we've seen some on the other side of the aisle speculate aloud that the administration might rush an unsafe vaccine to the market before the election to help president trump politically this irresponsible rhetoric only serves to plant irrational fears in the minds of americans i'm worried that enough of these types of attacks could result in people avoiding an approved vaccine when it does come to market when it is available for americans dr fauci can you address this once and for all would the administration approve a vaccine that's not safe and do you share my concern about the danger of undermining faith in the vaccine development process the commission of fda dr stephen hahn has assured me and has spoken publicly that he would make sure any decision on the part of the fda will be based on sound scientific data proving the safety and the efficacy he's told me that and he's been very public about that given that i think the american public should be assured that in the process of determining the safety and efficacy the proper steps have been taken to determine that and when a vaccine becomes available it's important for their own health and for the health of the country to take that vaccine i appreciate that thank you gentlemen i i can't let this moment pass without bringing to all of our attention again to the chairman that just last week the justice department indicted two chinese nationals for hacking companies that are working on a vaccine we sent a strong message to china this will not be tolerated i'm glad the administration took action by naming and shaming those involved as well as closing down a chinese consulate that was a hub for intellectual property and trade secret theft we must hold china accountable mr chairman we have to mr chairman before i close can you commit to holding a hearing on the threat of chinese espionage on vaccine products vaccine producers mr chairman whoever sitting in for mr chairman do you promise me that we will hold a hearing on the threat of chinese espionage on vaccine producers uh the chairman is not here to answer the question uh you have a few seconds left your time has expired mr chairman this is a grave threat for the record thank you mr chairman this is a grave threat to our country and the world of china is hacking our companies i seriously hope the chairman will take my recommendation i yield back thank you very much

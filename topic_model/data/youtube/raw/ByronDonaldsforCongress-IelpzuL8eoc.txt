hi I'm Byron Donald's candidate for US Congress I need your help and I need your vote because the negative campaigning has already started my opponent Casey Askar has decided to attack me not on my conservative record which started here in Southwest Florida ten years ago through the Tea Party movement and he's not attacking me on my conservative record in the Florida Legislature where I have stood up even to my own party to protect your constitutional Second Amendment rights know Casey's reached into the past - my mistakes as a young man when I was 18 years old and he tried to bring that up acting like it just happened today he's also going into my facebook history from 2011 long before President Trump was even running for office you see Casey won't tell you that I've actually spoken at both of President Trump's rallies in 2016 when he was running to beat Hillary Clinton or that I stood by the president in Atlanta at the launch of Black Voices for Trump or that I was giving the president an award for his greatest accomplishment one of his greatest accomplishments in office you see Casey's lying to you he has his high-priced political operatives who have taught him the Washington way and that is how to destroy true conservatives but I'm not gonna let him get away with it and I need your help in your vote so we don't let him get away with it Southwest Florida's not for sale it's time to send a true conservative to Washington I'm Byron donald's and I approve this message

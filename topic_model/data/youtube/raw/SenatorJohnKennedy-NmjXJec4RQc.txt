thank you senator kennedy thank you madam chair mr secretary welcome um i i agree with you by the way for what it's worth about getting the money out on the streets literally um see i'm looking at your budget here your current budget's 12.5 billion dollars you're asking for 14.2 billion does that sound about right that's a 14 increase one point you want an extra 1.7 billion dollars okay um explain to me why the american people would be better off giving you 1.7 billion dollars then taking that 1.7 billion dollars and spending it on infrastructure i did a little math and for 1.7 billion dollars we can we can resurface a four-lane highway from washington to denver so why we why the american people better off giving you more money than putting it on infrastructure well thank you very much senator and thank you for the question um it's a great question uh and i think the way i would think about it is the 1.7 billion dollar increase to my to the budget my budget is an investment infrastructure as well it's an infrastructure infrastructure investment as well it's an infrastructure in the investment in the american worker in this country it's an opportunity for us to look at uh as i think about the department of labor well do you believe every exp excuse me for interrupting i'm sorry mr secretary we don't have much time do you believe that every expenditure by the by by the federal government is an investment what's the difference between an investment and an expenditure an investment is an investment in the future of workers and expenditure is an expenditure in building a bridge okay well if you you have a union background which i respect and admire um if we took 1.7 billion dollars that you say you need you need more to run your department and we spent that on infrastructure that's going to create a lot of union jobs isn't it it's going to create a lot of jobs but we're also not going to be able to educate the workforce that needs those new jobs they're going to be created off of that infrastructure investment of new bridges but they're already educated the people building the roads are already educated they're good at what they do well senator reid just mentioned of an issue around literacy in this country so again it's an investment in helping people to be able to be retrained and trained in the jobs of the future i i come out of construction i work construction as well the construction industry that i worked on in the in the in the early 90s and late 90s is different than the construction industry of today yes let me stop you for a second i i don't want to get too far afield here into a history of the construction industry i used to work construction too let me be sure to understand what you're saying when my constituents call me and they say look you're being asked to raise taxes to pay for infrastructure why instead of putting 1.7 billion dollars in extra taxes on us why'd you give 1.7 billion dollars to the department of labor why didn't you use that the infrastructure am i just supposed to say because the department of labor says they're going to make an investment what metrics are you going to use this time next year to be able to prove to this congress that your investment paid off then better than 1.7 billion dollars in infrastructure before answer let me just quickly go back to the tax question i think the beauty for your constituents is that the infrastructure bills that uh that's being negotiated right now does not raise taxes on the average american uh who earns under four hundred thousand dollars so the average american is not paying for that that's that's that's not true okay well we will that's not why i can't agree to disagree let me move on because i've got one minute left and i like to stay within my time does your does your agency conduct surveys as far as employee services any surveys we do yes okay do you pay people pay the people who do the surveys no to to take the survey i actually don't know the answer to that well here here's what i'm asking i'm not i don't know i don't know i need your help finding something out one of my constituents got this in the mail it's a letter i know it's not under your your jurisdiction from the bureau census bureau and and they asked him to fill out a form on children's health and he opened it up and look what fell out five dollar bill and there's no reference in the letter to the five dollars in cash you got from the federal government what's this all about i have no idea can you help me find out i will help you find out i took i didn't get one of those letters well i i filled out my my census uh not my my survey i want five bucks and i understand that the bottom administration is also sending people forty dollar gift cards i doubt that's from the bite administration but i will look i looked it up it's on the internet it must be true i'll look into it via my friend would you i promise thank you mr secretary sir

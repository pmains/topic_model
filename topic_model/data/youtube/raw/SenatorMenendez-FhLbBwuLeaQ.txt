we are here first of all good morning we are here we are here for obvious reasons and with that i think it's only appropriate that we begin this program with a moment of silence come on guys a little bit of respect a moment of silence please thank you while these moments of silence and prayer are absolutely necessary they alone are not enough they are yet another reminder that we must do better as mayor of this wonderful community of west new york i welcome you all to our memorial high school and as saddened as i am and all of us are from the tragic events that our children and all of us are facing together as a nation i am equally as proud proud of the youth that stand before you here today behind us and here i want to sincerely thank our federal leadership u.s senator bob menendez senator cory booker as well as congressman albio series who could not join us today due to a knee surgery for always and once again today standing up for what is right and for calling this press conference here today to demand the necessary change like many we began this morning with meetings today was a special meeting courageous and compassionate students future leaders that you see behind me and to the side of me demanded to speak to administration and elected officials about the current state of affairs as it pertains to gun control it was a meeting with courageous and compassionate students and future leaders that i am extremely proud of they were valiant enough to come forward because they're scared because they don't understand why they have to feel scared to come to school they don't understand it i don't understand it and our leadership does not understand it i thank and commend our senators for spending time and speaking with them candidly we must continue to urge and plead for gun control reform because no one can deny that as it stands it is out of control protecting the health and safety of our future generations has never been more important than right now it is our duty to ensure that our youth have safe places to learn play and grow now schools across this great nation have always been that place until now we must do better now as a graduate of this high school i never thought i would see a memorial of this sort it is dramatic because the situation is more dramatic here we are and the time for change is now our hearts go out to all of the families who have been affected and their lives forever chained changed by senseless acts of violence especially in our schools western york is a very small community i'm sorry a very small municipality but a very big community and under dire circumstances like these a community just like uvalde like many of you as a father of a six year old when i first saw the pictures of those many students the first thing that i saw in looking at those little children of rob elementary i said they're just like our kids they look like our kids they can be our kids because they are our kids let us protect them because they deserve it our hearts and prayers are with you evalde we are uvaldi thank you all at this time it is my pleasure to introduce a person who has always stood strong for safety of our students and children u.s senator bob menendez well thank you mayor [Applause] well thank you mayor first of all let me thank the mayor and the commissioners or some of who are with us let me thank the west new york school district the superintendent the board of education members the principal and the teaching staff here who have joined us let me thank the students who are exhibiting those that we had the privilege of meeting with inside as as part of the representatives of the student body who i think had such incredibly riveting and tough questions that exhibit the nature of what we're trying to overcome and to all the students who in an organized fashion came out and are showing what they want to see and doing it in a dignified way as well as well as the speakers you'll hear from my colleague in the united states senate senator cory booker who has been a tremendous advocate on reasonable gun safety laws as a member of the senate judiciary committee as well as the njea president that represents all of the teaching and educational staff in our schools throughout the country and moms who demand action and and others who you'll hear from shortly [Music] you know uh and we also have some of our public officials here we have the mayor of uh weehawken has joined us mayor turner the mayor of bayonne has joined us mayor davis the sheriff of hudson county is part of our law enforcement protection the sheriff shallary we appreciate him as well you know as we meet together just last night gun violence tore through multiple communities at a medical facility in tulsa oklahoma four people were killed by a government and two were injured in shootings in pennsylvania near a walmart and outside high school in los angeles and while we pray for the families of the victims and those impacted by these horrific shootings we're all here today because no more families need to go through what the families in tulsa and uvalde and so many other are going through today just before this event started senator booker and i had the opportunity to meet with some of the students who are part of the peer mediation group here at memorial high school and i want to thank them and i want to say to them thank you for using your voice to speak for those who are no longer with us represented by the memorial classroom of 21 empty desks one for each of the 19 children in uvalde and the two teachers who were censusly taken from us thank you for using your voice for those who are currently recovering from their wounds and for all those who forever carry with them the scars of gun violence and for using your voice to make sure that we act so that this doesn't happen again we're all here today to support uvalde a small predominantly latino town in texas that is the latest community shattered by a mass shooting at a school it follows columbine and virginia tech sandy hook santa fe parkland and now evalde this year alone there have been more mass shootings than days in the year across our country 22 schools have had a shooting and just 10 days after the senseless murder of 10 americans in a buffalo supermarket two teachers and 19 children were killed in cold blood in their classrooms children children most of them in third and fourth grade cut down by an assault rifle that in my view has no place in our society and i want to but because sometimes we get desensitized by numbers i want to say their names alexandria rubio 10 years old alicia ramirez 10 years old a married joe garza 10 years old annabel guadalupe rodriguez 10 years old eliana cruz torres 10 years old eliana ellie garcia nine years old jacqueline jackie cassares 10 years old jalea nicole silguero 10 years old jesse carmelo luganos 10 years old jose flores 10 years old lila salazar 10 years old mckenna lee elrod 10 years old juliana rodriguez 10 years old miranda matthias 11 years old nevaya bravo 10 years old rogelio torres 10 years old maria mata 10 years old josiah garcia eight years old javier lopez 10 years old eva mireles one of the teachers 44 years old irma garcia 48 years old every single one of them leaves behind family members who will never be whole again in the case of vader garcia's husband a broken heart manifested in a fatal heart attack presumably from grief make no mistake as we speak right now there is a community of loved ones in uvalde who will always remember may 24 for the doctor's day of their lives the day when their children their children were slaughtered in the building where they went to learn where they went to be safe to learn to run around at recess to be a kid how can we possibly claim the mantle of the greatest country in the world if elected officials simply stand by and let this happen how can we live in a society where we regulate everything from a license to drive a car to lottery tickets but we cannot even simply require background checks for assault weapons capable of committing mass murder how can we look our children and grandchildren in the eye and explain why they have to practice hiding in a closet or stay quiet under the desk in the dark just in case someone comes to their school with a gun it's unconscionable and it goes against every fiber of what this country should stand for which is why i want to be abundantly clear every single mass shooting is a result of a policy failure guns especially assault weapons equipped with high capacity magazines do not belong in schools they do not belong in our supermarkets or in a movie theater they have no place in our houses of worship in our workplaces they don't belong on our streets full stop and they should be outlawed [Applause] i know some of my colleagues in the united states senate have a different view but those who seek to kill americans with such weapons do not have greater rights than our nation's children to whom we have a precious obligation to protect their right is equally as great if not greater [Applause] now some of you may see that our colleague on the senate senator chris murphy spoke on the senate floor as the shooting unfolded senator murphy is one of the senators from connecticut who experiences the tragedy of sandy hook he was there on that horrific night consoling parents who received the worst news a parent can ever receive he bore witness to the anguish the agony of americans who were being told that their little boy and their little girl weren't coming home senator murphy came to the senate floor last week to ask our colleagues a simple question what are we doing here if not to protect children in their schools what are we doing here if not to do everything possible to find a way out of this recurring nightmare why go through all the trouble of running for office why even bother being a public servant so i know what our answer to senator murphy is what are we doing here we are committed to honoring the victims of vivaldi what are we doing here we are going beyond thoughts and prayers we are advocating for action we are focused on passing a gun safety bill with measures that are proven to bring down the rates of americans killed by a firearm i'm talking about legislation that would expand background checks like hrh or the assault weapons ban that i voted for in 1994 these measures work and there is simply no earthly reason why congress has failed to act on measures which are supported by overwhelming majorities of americans keeping you and your family safe is the most rep important responsibility we have as senators which is why i'm proud to lead critical measures like the keep american safe act which would ban the sale of high capacity magazines you don't need a gun with 50 or 100 rounds high capacity magazines are high capacity killing and they should be outlawed once and for all [Applause] i have led measures with senator booker that would ban the sale of what they call ghost guns untraceable weapons that can be sent assembled at home to kill others and i'm a proud sponsor of the hear act with my colleague congresswoman bonnie watson coleman that would outlaw gun silences and suppressors and as chairman of the senate foreign relations committee have been focused on making sure that congress cracks down on the gun manufacturers whose weapons are used to violate human rights abuses around the world so we're very clear we have solutions to the problem of guns in our country we need the courage of some of our colleagues to finally break the gun lobby and vote for the american people and next week when we go back to washington we refuse to accept business as usual we want a vote and we want to see who stands with the american people and who does not [Applause] it's time for the american people to know who is who is for protecting our kids and who is standing in the way of common sense gun reforms we owe it to those who are no longer with us we owe it to those who survived those who will sunday have to return to the seeing of the worst day in their lives and we owe it to every child and parent in america so that when we say never again we actually mean it so i'll end up with this outside of rob elementary school in new orlea there is a sign it says welcome and then underneath it it says as i have thought about what to say today this image has haunted me in my brain that bilingual sign alongside the images of little kids holding honor roll certificates honor roll certificates they earned at the end of the school year is for me the starkest reminder of what this means for a tight-knit latino community like and as i read the list of names i can't help but think of my own family i'll never forget the day when my daughter alicia my son rob who's here with us came home safely from high school the day of the columbia massacre and now as the grandfather of three girls i'm terrified to think about the risks they could face i have three granddaughters evangelina ophelia and olivia they are younger than the kids we mourned today but their names are so so familiar how will we explain to them why the senate took no action after 10 black americans lost their lives grocery shopping after 19 latino children and two latino teachers lost their lives going to school what kind of nation are we leaving behind foreign a a [Music] a that's why we are here today and in that fight i am thrilled to have as my colleague in the united states senate a member of the senate judiciary committee who has been fighting alongside with me to make this happen senator corey so i am sorry that we have to be here today but i am grateful that we are that we're not standing in an empty square talking about issues that don't seem to rouse the collective outrage of our country the truth is the overwhelming majority of americans want us to change this national nightmare senator menendez and i have been fighting on this issue not in a reactive sense since the day i got to the senate coming from a community too often ravished by gun violence we have been working for change proposing legislation pushing fighting giving speeches making demands but today i have hope because what brings us here is the strength and the commitment and the fight and the demand of our young people i want to say thank you to the high school students that are surrounding us right now you are the hope of our nation it was [Applause] not long ago in american history that a young woman underestimated believed that she could make a difference she literally was from our state but went down to washington and led the very first protest in front of the white house her name was alice paul when they told her she was a second class citizen she said no when they told her she couldn't make change she said no she went to prison for her protest she went on a hunger strike for her protest and finally the president of the united states then woodrow wilson said you are right i will join you and i will join the suffrage movement that's our history impossible implacable unbelievable odds but what overcame that were people often from our state who went on freedom rides who protested in the suffrage movement who fought against the vietnam war we have made change before and no one here should feel demoralized or dejected in this moment of history we should feel empowered we should feel strong we should feel confident this is the time for us to demand change [Applause] and so let us not equivocate let us not hesitate let us not retreat one inch from our demands we demand universal comprehensive background checks we demand a ban on military-style assault weapons that belong in theaters of war and not in our streets [Applause] we demand a nation that doesn't make it easier to get a driver's license than to get a gun license we demand licensing in the united states [Applause] nothing i am saying is a partisan issue let's be clear everything i just said all of those demands are overwhelmingly supported by democrats and republicans in america this is not an issue of right or left this is an issue of right or wrong and what we are doing is not an assault on constitutional rights no i'm sorry every right in the constitution has reasonable restraints we do not allow people to stand up in a crowded movie theater and yell fire and yet somehow we are allowing people with weapons that belong in war to fire them in our supermarkets in our mosques in our synagogues and in our schools we are americans the mission statement of our country is clear let me read you the first words of our constitution and what our mission statement is we the people of the united states in order to form a more perfect union but here are the things we wanted to do establish justice ensure domestic tranquility here's one provide for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty think about those four things think about justice and tranquility the common defense and the general welfare how far off have we gone from those core mission statements we don't have domestic tranquility when people are shooting in our streets and our houses of worship in our schools in our supermarkets we do not have justice or freedom when our children can't go to school as we just heard from students without a freedom from fear or freedom from worry israel was just telling me about every time that he hears us do a drill of being locked down he goes to his cell phone and texts to his family that this might be it he said he texts love because he doesn't know if this drill is going to be for real what does that do to our children it's like saying hey we've got a hole in the boat in the ship of our nation and instead of plugging the hole we're going to just pass out more buckets that is not a solution it is a surrender when we tell our children we can't protect you so we're going to teach you how to hide that's not what the strongest nation on the planet earth does it's not who we are and so today look around this circle of strength there are people from all backgrounds there are people from all faiths there are people from all across the political spectrum and we join in solidarity we the people we the people we the people in order to form a more perfect union well this country is being torn apart by gun violence and it's time that we heal it's time that we help it's time that we realize that there's nothing that is wrong with america that can't be solved by what's right with america and so senator menendez is right we're going to go back to washington d.c and he and i are going to get into the well of the senate and push and fight and try to make sure we pass something that will make change and i'm going to tell you if we win the day with the legislation being negotiated right now i've been talking to senator murphy in touch with kirsten cinema if we pass this legislation yes it is a good thing but it will only be incremental change it will be necessary change but it will not be sufficient to end this national nightmare what does it take to change in america yes you need legislators in congress fighting for well you've got them all across the state of new jersey our congress people your senators heck your governor and your state legislature has already passed so many of these laws you have people fighting for you but we are vulnerable right now because this state is only as safe as the closest state to us with the weakest gun laws when i was mayor of the city of newark after shootings we would do the analysis and we would find out that the guns came from outside of the state they're not new jersey guns the majority of them are from other places that have weak gun laws that's why the fight is for national legislation and so i want to tell you right now remember alice paul she didn't wait for a bunch of men on the senate floor to come together in a huddle and say hey fellas let's give those women the right to vote no that's not how change happened change happened by american citizens by we the people demanding demanding action because as frederick douglass says power concedes nothing without a demand if there is no struggle there is no progress well we all together collectively these young people leading us today say i am up for the struggle i will fight to defend my nation i will stand for domestic tranquility i will stand for justice i will stand for freedom from fear and gun violence and murder we can achieve that in america this is our country let us change its destiny now and commit ourselves to doing what is necessary [Applause] let us commit ourselves to peace and love and change and progress and a more perfect union now i'm sorry you have two brothers here as your senators but there's a little sibling rivalry so agora hablar espanola [Music] [Applause] [Applause] yes [Applause] [Applause] well first and foremost i want to thank that both senator menendez and senator booker for being here today i can tell you i had the opportunity to be inside just for a little bit and hear the frank conversations uh that were occurring with the students um who are so often affected by the trauma as was noted of gun violence and certainly the the conversation as to what actions need to occur for us to finally see something to happen but i got to tell you it's a sad day when i stand here and say that it takes real political courage to stand up and speak out when the gun lobby wants everyone to sit down and shut up and certainly in new jersey we're fortunate to have two senators senator menendez and senator booker who've decided to put the needs of their constituents and their communities ahead of campaign contributions from the nra so let's give them a big round of applause and credit for their convictions [Applause] but let's reflect on that why why is it courageous that after just one week after the slaughter of 19 children and two teachers that standing up and saying the status quo is not okay is something that's courageous how does anyone have the nerve to act like this is still a debate that we still need to have as opposed to something that we need to end now stopping the violence and saving our communities as a father who drops off his four-year-old and two-year-old every morning to school and who got the same messages as so many others when the news of all days started coming in and texted my wife and said please give our children a hug before i get home i'm angry i'm angry that anyone can put such little value on the lives of our children how do they still oppose common sense changes to help keep kids safer as a mayor i met i'm mad that students in my town like students here and students everywhere in america went to school this week wondering whether their classrooms would be next as an educator i'm sad i'm sad that even today my colleagues went into their buildings went into their classrooms not knowing if today is the day that they would have to put themselves their bodies in front of bullets to save the lives of their students we do this because we have not decided as a nation that weapons of war and mass destruction have no place in a free and sane society it's been a little less than nine days since we first started getting word of the terror taking place in texas and certainly we were all sick when we heard those reports come in but i don't think really that many of us were surprised because this has happened way way way way way way too many times in america the massacre in nevalde was only nine days ago and it's not even the most recent mass shooting just last night a gunman in tulsa killed at least four people in a medical building kind of country do we live in where we gather at an event to protest recent mass shootings and people have to ask which shooting and what effect is this having on our students how are they supposed to focus on learning punctuation or how to write a sentence or learn the periodic table when they've got to wonder if they're safe from the next mass shooter running through the hallways the lives lost in valde last week are an unimaginable tragedy that alone is more than enough reason to demand change that's not to mention all of the other mass shootings that we're all so familiar with whether it's parkland sandy hook virginia tech columbine and a long long list we see it in schools in churches in malls in movie theaters far too many places to name for all those lives lost we owe nothing less than a fierce fight for real reform and consequential change but we aren't just fighting for the memory of those lost we're fighting for the children who are going to school today scared and worried wondering what the day brings when they're trying to focus on their learning the trauma that they are experiencing leaves a deep mark it's a trauma not easily healed and we have to understand that the first step is stopping the trauma from continuing to occur of course we're already hearing that there's nothing that we can do to prevent the next shooting or even to make a difference but i refuse to accept this excuse that america's gun problem is too big to tackle when our children's lives are at stake we cannot stand for excuses or inaction we need more leaders like the one standing here today with the courage to prioritize our children and our communities over those special interests so those of us who value our children's lives have our voices as our students are showing us yet again here today to demand a change to the status quo to say that while the nra may have their money we have our voices we have our votes and we need to use our voices and our votes to stand up for our students to protect the people we love to elevate elected leaders who care about us and our communities and to help get rid of those who refuse to solve the problem no more silence no more accepting the status quo it's time to raise our voices it's time to push forward with our votes and it is time for us to be the change we need [Applause] i ask that as we leave today we remember that each of us can make a difference it's daunting we know and certainly in the conversation with the students the senators both noted this senator menendez i believe noted it's not going to be easy we understand that but it is not impossible it is not impossible to demand the change as senator booker noted to live up to the ideals of our nation the very best nation in the world and say we can do better we must do better we demand we do better and we demand that that occur now thank you very much everyone [Applause] thank you sean next is nicolas amore the moms demand action volunteer and jersey city public school teacher [Applause] so good first of all um the students of west new york your chant definitely had with me um good day everyone so my name is nicole zamora and i am a educator for jersey city public schools as a teacher for students with autism so i moved to miami in florida in 1990 when i was nine years old from colombia because of the violence and corruption however i soon realized that miami had his own violence and that getting guns was all too easy by middle school i knew where to buy a gun and many of my peers did just that fast forward to 2004 i was the third grade inclusion teacher it was my first year teaching and it was also my first lockdown i immediately closed the shutters locked the doors and asked my students to quietly hide under their desks just looking at my students hiding under their desks i came to realize that if someone came in and shot us we would all be dead after the lockdown was over i was informed that it was a gang trying to enter the school but the principal and security were able to convince them to leave luckily no one was hurt that day three years later 2007 i moved to new jersey in part because i knew that new jersey has safer gun laws and it would be a place for safe a safer place excuse me to start a family i now have a 12 year old daughter who i know is safer here than she would be in miami but i also know that gun violence can happen anywhere and at any time in december 2019 there was a mass shooting against the jewish community in jersey city again i was in lockdown with my students until 7 pm while my aides were watching the news through their cell phones i began calling the parents of my students to let them know that we were ok again i was lucky that the shooter was just a few minutes away and the police was already there trying to stop the shooter in the meantime most of the students didn't know what was going on except one and that one student had asked me if he could call his mother and when he called his mother he said mom we're going to die i had to stay strong and comfort him however that moment has forever been drilled in my head listening to my students say mom we're going to die every time i hear about another school shooting it takes me back to my childhood my lockdowns because i always think that could have been me i have been blessed that my turn hasn't come yet but i always wonder if my turn to die will be next and if i won't be so lucky now i also have to worry about my daughter's safety and if she could be next even with all the security that we have i still don't feel safe look what happened to uvaldi they had security at the school and the shooter couldn't be stopped they had about 10 police officers standing on the sidelines arresting some of the parents who were desperate to get to their children instead of worrying about the shooter since the shooting in marjory stoneman douglas high school florida i had decided to become more proactive by taking action by doing what i can to advocate against gun violence by doing what i do best to educate along with many volunteers from every town in mom's demand action we go around the state and educate parents caregivers grandparents etc about the importance of safe gun storage through the be smart for kids program i don't know about you but i am sick and tired of seeing dead children and teachers die because we have cowards in the senate that refused to stand up to the nra cowards that have the audacity to show up to the nra convention even after the death of 21 innocent lives but yet won't let guns decide their own convention i'm sick and tired of seeing neighboring states refusing to join states like new jersey and passing common gun sense lost i blame them for making our state vulnerable to criminals who bring weapons from their states i'm furious that these 50 cowards in the senate refuse to pass simple gun laws like background checks red flag laws regulate assault weapons raise the age to purchase a gun and repeal the plca and to all of those out there who think we're out to take your guns from these common gun sense laws i just mentioned take a moment to think which one of them says we're taking all of your guns away none of them do so wake up and listen carefully to what we're asking for we're asking for common gun sense laws so if you want to take action and help call these 50 cowards in the senate and tell them to pass these common nonsense laws [Applause] foreign and lastly i want to say speak out and speak out about gun violence don't wait for it to be your turn before it's too late take action today thank you [Applause] [Music] our next speaker is west new york's own high school teacher francisca sanchez ap history [Applause] good morning everyone my name is fran sanchez and i teach at memorial high school i have the pleasure of not just teaching here but having graduated from this very school 1980 i would like to thank and welcome senators menendez and booker for taking time to visit memorial high school to address our students concerns i would like to thank our superintendent ms clara herrera and our school principal mr guerrero for making this event possible lastly i'd like to welcome all our board members our mayor gabriel rodriguez distinguished guests students and staff we are here today to raise awareness within our community about the effects of gun violence even though our community has not experienced an immediate threat our students and staff do experience the psychological effects of the numerous school shootings taking part in our nation we might be hundreds of miles from uvalde texas but we feel their loss school is supposed to be a safe haven yet as the years have passed and the numbers of shootings have increased more students and teachers find themselves fearing for their safety this year our school introduced a more realistic active shooter in the building drill that took place while students were changing classes as we gathered the students into the classrooms many students stopped and asked is this just a drill and for a moment i found myself thinking the same thing even though we recognized the importance of the realistic component it introduced another level of anxiety and tension among the students that was palpable this time the drill fell more immediate it is our responsibility it is our duty to advocate for gun measures that will keep our students safe it is my hope that our students will use these feelings and their passion to continue to keep this issue at the forefront and push for meaningful change we are here today to amplify their voices thank you and thank you to the students who rallied to this occasion next we'll hear from one of your own uh fellow students uh bradley mansell is a sophomore bradley [Applause] good morning my name is bradley mansell and i'm a student here at memorial high school just like my many other peers who are here around us i want to thank everyone who is here today as i am hoping to do my part in bringing an end to gun violence as a student i should worry about my grades catching a football and even who i will be taking to prom not if something might happen as we all know we need change now we should be the last group of students that have to come together to ask for gun control it doesn't make sense how it's easier for me to get my hands on a gun that is for me to get my driver's license gun control will help stop the killing of innocent people and students finally i would like to thank all the elected officials who are here along with us fighting for change thank you for your time thank you bradley [Applause] all right uh so that ends our speaking program uh in a democracy we take questions from the press so we'll take a few on topic questions if there are any [Music] [Music] is [Music] well there are negotiations taking place with a couple of our colleagues led by senator murphy with a couple of our republican colleagues it is my hope that they will come to an agreement as senator booker said from what we understand of the negotiations what they're talking about would be welcomed but it would not be the totality of what we are talking about here today which we think is necessary for the nation so whether it's a red flag statute or something along those lines we certainly welcome a breakthrough because we have not been able to get 60 votes as i know the students here are learning history in the united states senate because of our procedures we don't get to pass something into law by a simple 51 majority when one senator wants to stand in the way you got to get 60 votes and as democrats we don't have 60 votes in the united states senate so we look forward to the voices of the people being raised to a crescendo that finally gets the attention of their senators and their states to cast their votes for common sense gun reform album is is is foreign a okay any any other last questions yes you've done this many times what's that why are they going to be different you've done this so so first of all though i just want to get behind that question for a second because the students from parkland moms demand action gabby giffords organization the brady organization their efforts over this last decade have made a lot of change there have been state laws changed all over america they are making progress so this idea that nothing has changed is almost a statement that tries to diffuse the energy of organizers who are making changes including in our state where we are continuing to push for more comprehensive and more informed background checks to deal with everything from ghost guns into some of these new ways of obtaining the the mechanisms for guns on the internet so first of all we are making progress it's almost as if we're judging the civil rights movement on 1954 and all the organizing that was going on then uh um and not seeing what ultimately happened as a result of the works in the 1950s that happened in the 1960s so so god bless those folks the second thing i'll say is what senator menendez again i feel like i'm repeating a lot of things he said in spanish but we are going to make some change i believe i hope i think chris murphy has been blunt it's an uphill battle it's not you know it's challenging but we may make some change this time but as i said it will be necessary change but nowhere sufficient and this is where the senator menendez just said in spanish is so critical one of the best ways for the people to have a voice is an election in just five or six months we are one or two senators away in the senate that's how close we are pennsylvania ohio north carolina wisconsin one or two cent and holding on to the house for making massive change and so this is what he said el primero and this the main theme on on this election has got to be election that is about do you want common sense gun safety or not not about republican or democrat this is a non-partisan movement but do you want to have common sense gun safety or not do you support candidates who the corporate gun lobby supports or do you support candidates that will work to make change tenemos we have a choice here and i believe it's time for more americans to join the activists and begin to join the demand for change that's when politicians will respond and we'll see more dramatic change anyone else last question anyone else anyone else in the town of west york we are lucky to have a shared service agreement between our police department clearly under the municipality and the board of education is something that we've implemented for many years and where uniformed police officers like the ones that you see here today are in every school for the entire day of the school so we don't have security guards we have actual police officers in our schools clearly as technology increases we want to increase with technology and providing better and safer environments doors windows etc in all our buildings we're an older community we have old schools that's not an excuse and we're working on that all right with that we're finished i want to complement the students for their positive energy for the way that they've expressed themselves i also want to urge them to go back to school and because what you're doing inside is as important as what we have been doing out here we need a new generation of leaders and to do that you have to prepare yourselves so thank you very much thank you to west new york and thank you [Applause] oh

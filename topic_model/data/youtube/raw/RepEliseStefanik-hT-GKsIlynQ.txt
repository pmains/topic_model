for what purpose does the gentlewoman from New York seek recognition without objection the gentlewoman is recognized for one minute Mr Speaker I rise today to urge my colleagues to support the champion helping Healthy Kids Act this critical health care legislation provides a five-year extension to the chip program that so many children and low-income families rely on in my district alone over 21,000 children use chip for access to low-cost health care services I'm also proud that this legislation includes a needed two year extension of funding for community health centers this is an issue I've worked hard on as over 95,000 people in my district received critical health care and preventative Services from these centers there is still much more work to do to improve our health care system for families in the north country in Congress I'll keep fighting to protect the programs our district depends on and I'll continue working toward the affordable high-quality health care system that my district deserves thank you Mr Speaker I yield back the gentlewoman yields back

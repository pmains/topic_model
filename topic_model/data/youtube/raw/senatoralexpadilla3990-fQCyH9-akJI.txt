 OVER THE LAST THREE DAYS, WE HAVE HEARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN, AS WE SHOULD, ABOUT THE INCREDIBLE QUALIFICATIONS THAT JUDGE CAN TIME G --KETANJI BROWN JACKSON HAS TO SERVE ON THE SUPREME COURT. IF YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING THE HEARINGS -- I WOULD DO IT AGAIN IN A MINUTE BE -- MINUTE. I WILL EXPLAIN WHY I AM DOING IT. WHY I KEEP DOING IT. IT IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD KNOW JUDGE JACKSON THE JUDGE AND THE PERSON AND THE FACT THAT SHE REPRESENTS THE VERY BEST OF OUR COUNTRY. THAT SHE IS NOT JUST QUALIFIED BUT EXTRAORDINARILY QUALIFIED TO SERVE ON THE UNITED STATES. BECAUSE OF HER QUALIFICATION AND WITH HER PROFESSIONAL AND LIFE EXPERIENCES. , SHE WILL MAKE THE SUPREME COURT BETTER AND SHE WILL MAKE THE COUNTRY BETTER. IT IS MY SINCERE DESIRE THAT ANYONE WATCHING THE PROCEEDINGS HERE. IF YOU TAKE NOTHING ELSE FROM THESE LAST FOUR DAYS, IT IS JUDGE JACKSON'S QUALIFICATIONS. A PUBLIC SCHOOL EDUCATION, FOLLOWED BY DEGREES FROM HARVARD COLLEGE AND HARVARD LAW SCHOOL. FUNCTIONS AT THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT AT THE FEDERAL PUBLIC APPEALS AND AT THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. TWO YEARS AS THE FEDERAL UGLY -- PUBLIC DEFENDER. TWO YEARS AS A STAFF MEMBER AT THE SENATE SEAT COMMISSION AND FOR FOUR YEARS AT -- AS THE CHAIR. IT IS TIME ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS, INCLUDING TWO LIFETIME JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS. NEARLY A DECADE OF JUDICIAL EXPERIENCE, WHICH IS MORE THAN THE COMBINED TOTAL OF FOUR OF THE CURRENTLY SITTING JUSTICES AT THE TIME THEY WERE NOMINATED. OF COURSE, THE LIFE EXPERIENCE. AS A BLACK WOMAN. AS A WORKING MOM. SO MUCH MORE. IT IS NOT JUST HER RESUME BACKGROUNDS THAT MAKE HER SO QUALIFIED TO SERVE ON THE SUPREME COURT. I HAVE SEEN, WE HAVE ALL SEEN OVER THE LAST THREE DAYS, SHE ANSWERED EVERY QUESTION AND MET EVERY UNFOUNDED, UNFAIR, AND INSULTING ACCUSATION WITH A LEVEL OF GRACE. THEY CAN -- TM PATIENTS THAT VERY FEW -- DIGNITY AND PATIENTS ----PATIENCE. SHE HAS DEMOCRATIC SHE IS SMART AND THOUGHTFUL TO LEGAL QUESTIONS AND SHE HAS AN UNDERSTANDING AND COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW. IN THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUAL JUSTICE. BASED ON HER BACKGROUND AND HER EXPERIENCES AND HER QUALIFICATION, IN MY VIEW, JUDGE JACKSON MERITS STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FROM THIS COMMITTEE. AND FROM THE SENATE AS A WHOLE. MY QUESTION IS THIS AND I ADDRESS THIS TO CONGRESSWOMAN BEATTY AND MR. HENDERSON. FOR THOSE WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE POLITICIZATION OF THE SUPREME COURT. WHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR THE COUNTRY IF SOMEONE WITH JUDGE JACKSON'S BACKGROUND EXPERIENCES, AND QUALIFICATIONS, CANNOT EARN BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FROM THE SENATE? REP. BEATTY: I THINK IT WOULD BE A SAD DAY IN AMERICA. AS MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE WAYNE HENDERSON SAID, WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS CONFIRMATION AND VOTING RIGHTS AND WE LOOK AT ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU ARE DEBATING TODAY, IT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL GROUNDING OF OUR SOCIETY AND OUR COMMUNITIES. TODAY, HOW CAN YOU SAY ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE, -- THAT A SENATOR SAID THAT HE AND HIS CAULK -- COLLEAGUES AGREED THAT SHE IS EXCEPTIONALLY QUALIFIED. WE SAW THE CASES THAT HAVE BEEN QUESTIONED. 10 CASES BUT IT WAS FIVE BUT THEY WERE STILL WITHIN THE WILL OF THE LOT THAT SHE WAS GIVEN TO DEAL WITH -- LAW THAT SHE WAS GIVEN TO DEAL WITH. IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE CHARGES WE HAVE SEEN IN ALL THE BOXES THAT NEED TO BE CHECKED, MORE THAN ANY OTHER JUSTICES THAT SOME OF THE SAME PEOPLE HERE HAVE VOTED FOR AND CONFIRMED. SHE IS ABOVE ALL OF THEM. THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS, HOW CAN WE NOT? AS A BLACK WOMAN WHO HAS LIVED THROUGH CIVIL RIGHTS AND EVERYTHING ELSE, LET'S SEND THE RIGHT MESSAGE. THANK YOU. >> MR. HENDERSON. >> YOUR QUESTION IS SO POWERFUL, PARTICULARLY AFTER IT WAS STATED, ALL OF THE FACTORS THAT HAVE BROUGHT JUDGE JACKSON TO THIS MOMENT. HER BACKGROUND IS ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY. HER DEMONSTRATION AND MASTERY OF THE LAW, SECOND TO NOAH -- NINE. IF AN AMERICAN CITIZEN WHO HAS OVERCOME THE CHALLENGES IN ONE'S LIFE SHE HAS OVERCOME, DEMONSTRATED HER ABILITY BEYOND ANY REASONABLE DOUBT, AND IS UNABLE TO GET THE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT OF MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE, INDEED, IT IS A SAD DAY FOR THIS COUNTRY. THE SIGNAL THAT IS SENT TO AMERICAN -- THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IS THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY, PREPARATION MAY NOT BE THE STANDARD BY WHICH YOU ARE MEASURED. INSTEAD, SOMETHING ELSE IN TANGIBLE PERHAPS, IN THIS PROCESS COMES THROUGH. THAT IS NOT WHAT WE WANT FOR AMERICA. THAT IS NOT WHAT WE IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT HAVE STRUGGLED FOR OUR PROFESSIONAL LIVES TO HELP BRING TO THE COUNTRY. IT WOULD BE A SAD DAY. I HOPE IS THE PARTISAN CONSIDERATIONS THAT MAY HAVE AFFECTED SOME IN THE PREP -- QUESTIONING OF JUDGE JACKSON WILL BE SET ASIDE AND SOME IN THE COMMITTEE OUT OF THE LOVE FOR THE COUNTRY AND THE PEOPLE AND THE FUTURE OF THE COURT WILL DO WHAT IS RIGHT AND WILL MAKE JUDGE JACKSON UNANIMOUSLY CONFIRMED APPOINTMENT. IT PROBABLY WILL NOT HAPPEN BUT I THINK SENDING A SIGNAL TO THE COUNTRY THAT INDEED, WE RECOGNIZE QUALIFICATIONS THAT SHE BRINGS TO THE TABLE AND WE LEFT THEM UP IN THE NAME OF THE AMERICAN

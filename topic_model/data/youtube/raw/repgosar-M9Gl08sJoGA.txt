Thank You chairman Bishop and members of the committee and thank you for the opportunity to provide a statement today in regards to HR 308 that keep the promise Act sponsored by my good friend and colleague Trent Franks from Arizona for several years now I've been actively involved in the troubling off-reservation gambling issue in my home state of Arizona involving the Tohono O'odham nation the tribe has been attempting to move from ancestral lands of their Tucson area reservation into another tribes ancestral lands into the Phoenix metropolitan area for the sole purpose of building a Las Vegas style casino this comes after told Odom and 16 other Arizona tribes negotiated a compact approved by Arizona voters which expressly promised that there will be no additional casinos or Gaming in the Phoenix metropolitan area until 2027 in exchange for this promised the voters granted the tribes a statewide monopoly on gaming relying in part on the compromises made by the Phoenix metro tribes to give up significant rights to additional gaming facilities this legislation was introduced to ensure that the promise of no additional casinos in the Phoenix area is kept until the existing tribal state compact gaming compacts expire and it does so without interfering in the trust acquisition itself let me explain how HR 308 came to be and why it must be enacted into law in return for exclusivity in Arizona the tribes agreed to cap on a number of casinos in the state and in the Phoenix metropolitan area to restrict the number of machines in the state and to share machine revenue with rural non gaming tribes so that they could benefit everyone could benefit from the compact every urban tribe except for to a whole - Odom agreed to this initial proposal to Olli Odom refused citing the need for a new casino in Tucson or on the rural part of the tribes reservation the state and all other tribes agreed to the restrictions on the gaming being pushed by Arizona's governor and others but also yielded to hold all of them stated needs after the agreement was reached the tribes and state promoted their model compact by saturating the airwaves and newspapers with a clear message that under the compact there will be no additional casinos in Phoenix and only the possibility for it to hold Odom to build one more facility in the Tucson area Toledo them alone spent 1.8 million dollars urging Arizona voters to rely on this agreed-upon limitation the voters approved the tribal state compact in November of 20 2002 and rejected two competing propositions the fourth love allowed unrestricted tribal gaming without any revenue sharing for rural non gaming tribes the second would have allowed for full commercial gaming without restriction the voters approved the proposal of the 17 tribe coalition because it was sold to the voters as the only proposition that would halt the growth of gaming in Phoenix and keep gaming out of local communities shockingly a few months after the voters approved the compact to hold a Odom finalized a multi-year effort to purchase land in Glendale for casino and used a shell corporation to conceal its identity because of the negotiated statewide compact and direct buy-in by the residents of the state the system embodied in the Arizona compact was viewed widely as a national model that was working well until 2009 when the Tohono O'odham announced that it would be seeking lands into trust off the reservation and in the Phoenix area for gaming to hold Odom dismiss dismissal of their promise to build no additional casinos in Phoenix is not something that Congress can ignore when the result will be so harmful for Indian gaming nationwide furthermore to hold Odom has falsely claimed a victory in court relatively to they're less than honest dealings with other tribes in the state of Arizona this assertion is factually false to hold all of them one-nothing based on the merits rather the shield of sovereignty sovereign immunity was used to keep its conduct from being reviewed by the courts in other words the court ruled that the tribe cannot be sued in court because it can't be sued in court mr. Chairman I now ask permission to submit evidence obtained from the underlying litigation discovery in the state of Arizona versus the Tohono o odham in the Congressional Record in order to supplement the record on HR 308 without objection sorted I fairly supported in gaming it done under the rule of law both in letter and spirit however however no entity governmental or otherwise should be rewarded for deceptive conduct that violates a compact and is contrary to the will of voters HR 308 halts a precedent that may lead to an expansive off-reservation casinos and dangerous changes to the complexion of tribal gaming in other states across the country tribes cost the nation including many of the other Arizona tribes that played an integral role in 2002 gaming compact strongly strongly support this legislation due to the impact the situation could have on tribal gaming enterprises nationally an identical bill HR 1410 passed overwhelmingly well overwhelmingly out of the Natural Resources Committee last Congress by a thirty five to five margin and passed the House by a voice vote on September 17 2013 our immediate adoption of this common-sense litigation by this committee and thank you again for the opportunity to testify mr. chairman and with that I yield back

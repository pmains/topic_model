this is senator Jon Tester I am here in Bozeman Montana at Community Health Partners which is a community health clinic that serves this region also have satellite offices in Livingston and Belgrade in West Yellowstone they provide dental services and medical services to make sure that the this region has access to affordable and might I say some pretty darn good health care now you might ask out there why are you sitting in Bozeman Montana have community health partners and it's because last actually this morning Eastern time at about 1:30 a.m. we passed a bill that will fund the community health centers in Montana and Community Health Partners is one of those health centers that will be able to receive some of that funding some seven billion dollars over two years so it's three and a half billion dollars a year throughout the whole country Montana will get a piece of that action and will be able to save this piece of healthcare infrastructure if we want to talk it in the most basic of terms that serves this region I have been harping on the Senate floor now for several months that these folks needed some predictability and last night we finally got some predictability and I am here with lander Cooney who is the chief executive officer of Community Health Partners and I was just gonna quiz her a little bit to see how her or her TV skills are her Facebook live skills or I might add to to find out how how this clinic was doing leading up to now and that's really why I want to start before the action was done last night in the Senate what were you guys talking about what was the conversation in this room and in other rooms around community health partners great question so I mean I think this morning we felt a huge collective sigh of relief that came from our 135 employees the more than 11,000 patients we serve in parking Gallatin counties I think the the conversations we've been having over the last 130 plus days since our funding expired were thoughtful and were measured coming from a place fortunately for us of financial stability but also a place of great uncertainty about what the future would hold for for our patients and for the communities that we serve as you know more than 20% of our patients are uninsured the majority of our patients live below twice the federal poverty level and they come to us for a variety of services not just health care they come to us because of the type of health care we we provide that is really patient-centered and the whole person focus that includes dental it includes behavioral health and includes a variety of other supportive services and and our patients and our staff were really nervous that we were not going to be able to serve serve our communities the best of our abilities and so so since the end of fiscal year which was the end of September you guys have been literally walking a tight wire here not knowing if you were going to have money to be able to stay open to save you but to serve your patients or not did you did you talk to your patients about this at all that the patient's talked were they aware were the patients aware what was going on absolutely and and I think our message to our employees into our to our board members and to our patients was you know community of Health Partners has been thinking and planning for times of uncertainty we've never quite experienced this before but but we knew we needed to be ready as a responsible organization and as a good steward of federal dollars that have come to us in the past and so we were able to say we're okay and we're we we have stable footing to ride out some degree of uncertainty and we felt sort of paralyzed to respond to changes that were cropping up into our communities and you know that the state of Montana has made some changes at the state funding level that has affected a number of the patients we serve the receiving mental health services or targeted case management or services at offices of public assistance that have now closed and so we we felt very burdened by not being able to step into some of those gaps that we knew were there because of the uncertainty that was out there and we feel like it's our responsibility to to know what's going on in the communities we serve and try to adjust our services to meet those needs and we felt very unprepared to be able to do that yeah and and so and you might have touched on this but you've been here how long and how long does community health partners you say just started a living expense they've been here 20 years this year congratulations yeah and and you serve how many pages eleven thousand don't you said and we happen to be sitting in the fastest growing area of the state of Montana this area in population is growing at about four percent a year and and so you're seeing I would imagine an influx of patients every year and is your patient load growing every year or are you capped out because of personnel or because of facilities yeah there's a whole bunch of different factors there right and what we see is no shortage of of need and we look around sometimes in in Bozeman and Belgrade and we think wow it's booming everyone's doing well in this new economy and and the reality is that not everybody's doing doing well lots of people are are piecing multiple part-time jobs together the cost of housing is such a burden on individuals and families and that those stresses mean that that we need us communities to have resources available and and health care affordable health care is what keeps people at work keeps people in school and so what we are trying to do is its take care of our community as it grows and be there for the the portions of our population that need us the most what's interesting because you said you're at about eleven thousand people that you serve the statistics I have is in the entire state of Montana community health centers and there's what sixteen of them in total serve about a little over a hundred thousand folks so you guys because there's there are thousand people live in this valley in this region there might be actually yeah so you're right on right on target i I hesitate to ask this question because I don't know the answer to it and I wanted you to answer it the right way but did you did you lose any staff because of the uncertainty I don't think so I think we we certainly were getting questions from folks in the recruiting process it wasn't people people knew that this was an issue and that it was a new sort of unprecedented issue and and we couldn't pretend it wasn't right I think if this becomes a pattern for the community health center program going forward it will significantly impede so the point you're really getting to is that we gave funding for two years now for the last hundred and thirty days you guys didn't know if you're going to have funding so we're but we're better shape than we were a lot better shape but the truth is there's not called the chyme Act that gives you five years of funding that is really where Congress needs to take the next step to and be able to give you the kind of predictability to plan not only for your patients but also for much more being run this operation much more fiscally responsible way wouldn't you say so that's the right answer for that too so look going forward now you've got we've got that we've got the funding taken care for two years what are you doing now that you weren't doing a week ago what you mean we weren't doing yesterday yeah okay yesterday right yeah we're I think like I said we're gonna try to thank folks like you who have been speaking up and helping make sure that these essential programs have the resources we need to to do what we're supposed to do so thank you you're welcome here thank you for the work you do sure and and then we're gonna get back to work you know this open a huge distraction from from from the work we do yeah and we are good at telling stories that about the work we do and the patients we serve and we're always happy to do that and we you know we we more just want to get to work and provide the care that is needed in our communities so we're gonna go revisit the projects that have been on hold for a few months and many of them are around behavioral health you know we're being called upon to step into the addressing the substance use disorder epidemic that our country is facing we have a lot to learn about that but we want to be a partner and a piece of the solution so we have some work to do there and everything else well I just want to say all the things that that Community Health Partners does in this Gallatin Valley is critically important and you talked about substance abuse which is a problem that is impacting every state in the Union and I often think that we just have Montana's watching us on this but we doubt we've got folks from all over the country so so that the folks outside Montana that may not understand Montana as well as the Montanans do we are a very rural state and when when we lose a health care facility or a health care facility is potentially at risk of being lost it's not usually easy to find access to health care just by going a few blocks down the street sometimes you have to go a lot further than that and while these folks take care of folks that have some financial difficulty and there's no shame in that not for the grace of God we'd all be in that position it's really important to know that without these health care facilities whether it's in Livingston or Bozeman or Belgrade or West Yellowstone that the people wouldn't have access to health care and quite frankly if you alluded to it if you have a sick employee you don't have good production they stay home they don't make wages to take care of their family oftentimes and it becomes a real problem sell land okuni CEO of Community Health Partners I just want to thank you guys very much and I would just tell you as a u.s. senator from Montana the folks in Lander is not the only one in this room the folks in this room spoke loud and clear and and let the delegation know how important this was last night and I will tell you as critical as I am Washington DC and I am often very very critical of the way things go what we did last night was pretty darn cool so thanks and we just had come through the door who's been working her fingers to the bone Christy King who's a nurse practitioner here and we are on Facebook live Christy so say hello say a lot of the world dancer tell me what you do sure I'm a family nurse practitioner so I serve folks here from we say from cradle to grave taking care of their healthcare needs and how long have you been here I've been here about three and a half years okay and so can you tell me if your patients talk to you about this hundred and thirty day lag and no funding and what they were saying to you they did patients were super nervous about what's gonna happen to their healthcare because for the last step for a lot of these folks they've been declined other places we will work with patients regardless of their ability to pay and provide these wraparound services for them they don't get elsewhere and so they rely on us for for their care for their medication for their counseling and it just seemed like that was all going to be taken away and so these folks have nowhere else to go and and there's a real sense of urgency and concern there and so now now we've got some funding and for the least the next couple years thank you for loot Lee and and and now hopefully there will be less pressure on the future will be more certain let's put it that way so what do you anticipate you talked about wraparound services I mean you'll be able to continue to grow those services and talk about what wraparound services are by the way yeah really quick and so we can talk about how we're going to grow those over the next couple well I think community health centers in general are very unique because not only are we having you come in the door and treating your health issues we're working on making sure you have all the other components that help you to be healthy if you need housing will help you get attached oh wow connected with the appropriate folks for that if you need dental care we have a dental clinic and can set you up with that if you need help with your medications because you can't afford those because you're uninsured or underinsured we have a program that can help with that and people who can help you through every step of the way so it's not just like here's the form figure it out it's we really want to take care of you and prevent those problems before they get to be you know a huge train wreck yeah it was good how many of the people you treat that what percentage your kids under the age 18 20% 20% 20% good that's good that's good that's good and you know that's that's about all I got for you the person the person I really want a quiz here I've got two more do I get time for two more I got time for two more my direct mate yes thank you for your great work thanks for thanks for not leaving any of your patients to come talk to me right okay cool Katie Madison who is the clinical director the clinic director is there a difference if I say clinical versus clinic okay so you you run the clinic so you running come on in a little so you're running the physical facilities is that is that what you want tell me what you do oh geez so I make sure that the right people show up at the right time to take care of folks I make sure the schedule is covered I look after my staff I help make sure that you know supplies are in and it's good so how many people work can in this dimness Bozeman facility how many people work 35:35 are you clinic director for all of them no I run the Bozeman clinic and I've got some team members here at the Belgrade clinic our Livingston clinic director is in Livingston yes and then our West Yellowstone clinic director is here as well cool and do you have all nurse practitioners physician's assistants MDS what do you have so um since I've been here we've had all of the above so right now we have one MD who is taking care of patients here at the Bozeman clinic we have two NPS and we have one PA we are currently bringing another MD on who will start with us in April and I was able to call him today and say we're funded come on down come on down well that's good and in so you got 35 in total sounds like half a dozen Doc's piays empties so I have four providers yep who are doing clinical or medical providing up I've got behavioral health therapists as well and then we have nurses medical assistants we've got administrative generalists who help with scheduling we've got a resource coordinator Christy was talking about wraparound services we refer to her as our miracle worker she would not come and sit here but Jen bureau deserves an incredible shout out for the work that she does every day as do all my guys I mean they they solve unsolvable problems that's what we do and that's why it's so important to keep you guys going one of my other colleagues is really fast sorry um NIC Redmond who's our data analyst recently had a letter to the editor here in Bozeman and he referred to this group of people as radically compassionate and I got choked up when I read that and that's exactly that's exactly who these people are you've never seen yourself as a radical before have you it was just such a perfect phrase though and it really it really was impressive well thank you for yeah everything thank you appreciate ya now that now the toughest interview of Dana Jackson the board member here we go yeah so good to see you how long you been on the board going on four years four years and how many people are on this board and what kind of decisions do you make typically I'll often do you meet by the way we meet once a month the entire board there's an executive board that meets once a month although and then there's several committees that will work so I'll cut right to it you guys are on the board or the ones that have to make the tough decisions right so I had you can did you started building a contingency plan for what happens if you don't get the money we did we we discussed it a few months back yeah and it was very tough you know when you have to start saying what what can we do to make it go so much further or what do we have to take away in order to survive and you know and it's it's when you get down to its people you know it's and that's what's the tough thing it's gonna be people yeah and we need those people to help with patience so so now that the fundings there are do you anticipate your next board meeting you'll be looking more proactively instead of we've put a lot of stuff on the back burner because of it and and I know a lot of with the staff there you know they have some stuff they want to implement and we've kind of put up you know a standstill on everything until we knew any you know we we were looking at our reserves and saying how long can we last you know that type of thing which gets real scary yeah it does well and how many people just say we're on the board eleven people mm-hmm and as each one of the clinics the Belgrade have its own board to know you you see the whole works holy Mack yeah one week we're one month we're in Livingston we're in Belgrade we eat here we just go all over so last question what made you want to get on this board these people and their mission it isn't honor and absolute honor to be on this board we're happy we're happier on it because you got to have people who are passionate and you're obviously passionate so thanks yes so just to close this thing out I would just say this these folks are here and they're committed to health care in rural states like Montana these folks are serving a population that in some cases wouldn't get served at all without them that's why when we have a 130 vote in the morning in Washington DC it's worth having because without funding for facilities like this we're gonna have a lot of people in a world of hurt and and if I make one plug to anybody who might be serving in the Senate that's watching this or anybody who might be able to influence people who are serving in the United States Senate and in the United States House tell these folks to pass the chyme Act this is money well spent this is money that helps keep America America and we hung these guys out for 130 days and that is totally irresponsible

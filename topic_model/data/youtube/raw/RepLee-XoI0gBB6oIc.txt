thank you let me thank the gentleman from New York for yielding but also for a year a tremendous leadership you and congresswoman Joyce baby from Ohio really have had sounded the alarm beat the drum and really brought to the American people the important issues that we're dealing with each and every day so I just have to thank you for your diligence and for staying the course every week you're here really representing not only this Congress but the country very very well so thank you I rise today with all of my colleagues and the Congressional Black Caucus with our whip mr. Hoyer and others to urge our Republican colleagues and in the Senate to of course do your job also let me just remind us that once again the president is trying to meet his constitutional obligation once again he's trying to do what he is supposed to do and that's nominate Justice Scalia's replacement to our nation's highest court and Senate Republicans have a constitutional responsibility to give the president's nominee a speedy and fair hearing followed up with a simple up-or-down vote sadly the Senate Republicans said said no to their constitutional responsibility the Supreme Court has a huge responsibility of deciding cases that impact every aspect of American life from our elections and college admissions to scientific patents and a woman's right to make her own health care decisions it's imperative that the Supreme Court be allowed to function in its full capacity with nine justices former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor who was appointed by a conservative president president ronald reagan she did not mince words in her condemnation of republicans playing politics with the court she said we need somebody in there to do the job and just get on with it former justice O'Connor I could not agree more despite the cause for action in the constitutional mandate Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has said there will be no hearings no boats not even a meeting with President Obama to discuss the late Justice Scalia's replacement that's just wrong his actions prompted the New York Times to editorialize that he and i quote seems to have lost touch with reality and the Constitution speaking of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell mr. speaker I'd like unanimous consent to insert a couple of New York Times articles into the record without objection thank you the title of these articles one is Black Sea bias and delay on Scalia's successor the other one is new york times article senate republicans lose their minds on a Supreme Court seat likewise judiciary Karen Charles Grassley of Iowa let a letter to Majority Leader signed by all of the republican committee members confirming their resolve to not have hearings or a boat on the nominee this is downright ludicrous Republicans cannot and should not use the Supreme Court to push their radical political agenda the Constitution is clear mr. speaker article 2 section 2 he shall have the power by and with the advice and Senate of consent of the Senate shall appoint ambassadors other public ministers councils and judges of the Supreme Court nowhere in the Constitution does it say except in an election year or except when the president is a Democrat or when Republicans have spent the last seven years actively working to subvert every policy that a president elected by nearly 70 million Americans Constitution doesn't say that this is simply unacceptable and the American people deserve better for more than a century every single Supreme Court nominee has received a boat on the floor of the United States Senate just like all the presidents before him President Obama should nominate a Supreme Court justice and the Senate should determine if he or she fit are fit to serve on this nation's highest court instead Republicans are holding the Supreme Court and the American people hostage their action in the words of the New York Times is simply quote and i quote panic masquerading as strength the Senate has a responsibility to at least consider the president's Supreme Court nominee and by refusing to do so they are failing their constituents and their nation so mr. speaker it's really past time for Majority Leader McConnell and the rest of the Republican leadership to do their jobs and work to get a new Supreme Court justice the Supreme Court is way too important to be used as a political bargaining chip enough is enough so once again I joined my colleagues congressman Jeffries congresswoman members of the Congressional Black Caucus and the American people in saying do your job with that I yield back

administration using taxpayer dollars to fund secret migrant flights and bus trips from the border across america pennsylvania congressman dan muser is sponsoring a bill demanding answers on all of it and he joins us now congressman good morning to you tell us about this bill what's the goal well good morning the goal is simply to provide my constituents and the american people transparency and notification as to how hhs is moving illegals uh and flying them to different parts of the country we have in northeast pennsylvania for instance and other parts of pennsylvania in the country uh these flights coming in known as ghost flights that are filled very often with children or young people adolescents but very often with adults as well without any notification coming in with full flights arriving in the in the dead of night literally and being put on shuttle buses and sent to different parts of of a region like for instance they were flying into wilkes-barre scranton and then we we got aware of it uh and then they stopped heading there they began going into harrisburg and then lehigh county uh and and then into white plains it's just really outrageous carly that the hhs and i've met with hhs twice and frankly they didn't tell me the truth as to what was going on in fact they told me it was a coincidence that these flights were coming in in the middle of the night so it what they're trying to do is mitigate the unbelievably horrible the policies of the bible administration where we have five thousand to set seven thousand illegals a day coming into our border and really they're turning all states including pennsylvania into border states congressman your bill aims to expose this further why is the white house so afraid of local leaders knowing who's in their communities could it be that the truth is simply wildly unpopular the white house knows it and they're trying to cover it up that's exactly it there's no other rational reason for it why wouldn't we want to know if in fact these are adolescents for the schools to be made aware so all we're asking for is notification to truly help because hhs is now now needs to help again mitigate these awful policies because the border the detention centers along the borders in texas and arizona and california are completely overwhelmed so we could actually help if local officials are aware if the governor is made aware if we know who the sponsors are right now see the customs and border patrol agents are very often taking information off of a young person's arm with a phone number or an address making contact with that phone number and sending these people young people often to that destination with no more information than that i've had a cbp agent look at me in the eye when i was at the border as he's in the middle of processing and says i sometimes feel like a link in the chain of human trafficking that's how and that's why the it's they're so demoralized because they feel like they're essentially working for the cartels they they feel like the link in the chain like you said do you know how much um these migrant flights are costing taxpayers a lot i mean our numbers are in the neighborhood of 350 million dollars and i'm sure that that's low and that's just for the hhs flight see hhs takes over for the miners it's not it's not uh department of homeland security so our numbers show it's about 350 million dollars of taxpayer money for the flight to take place and and for these shuttle bus it's just just absurd congressman dan muser thank you so much for shining a light on this and coming on this morning we appreciate it i appreciate it

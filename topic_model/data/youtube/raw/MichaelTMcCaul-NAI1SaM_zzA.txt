if the issue of how to handle the recent surge of children crossing the border alone has a divided the nation someone the us to provide aid for those kids and I'll deport them but congressman Michael McCaul says to secure our borders quick deportation is needed the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security joins us from Washington this morning to talk about the issue good morning congressman thank you for joining us morning Amanda the August recess yes the August recess begins this week and the possibility of Congress lean this ongoing border crisis on the back burner until Labor Day is is very real in the eyes of many could this happen well that would be irresponsible this is a crisis that demands action and leadership and that's what we plan to do sit today we'll be voting on the House floor today on a measure that I think will resolve this crisis in a couple ways a message of deterrence by changing this 2008 law this trafficking law that will treat Central Americans the same way we treat the Mexicans crossing into the United States which provides for a swift and humane removal from the United States back to their homes we believe that once these children start going back to their homes in Central America that the numbers will come down significantly because they won't pay this five to ten thousand dollars per child you know at that point in addition and in this bill we deploy the National Guard to the southwest border as you know in our state the governor's already activated the National Guard we think it's a responsibility of the federal government under the Constitution to pick up the tab for that and pay for the National Guard not only in Texas but all across the southwest border and then finally we have the South calm going down into Guatemala on there on the Mexican side a nice can border to help secure that border so that Central Americans can't really get through into Mexico so we think this whole package is is the right way to handle this from a deterrent standpoint and it will resolve this crisis and finally you know you grew up in Texas you know what our border is like better than most of the representatives out there beyond what Governor Perry has proposed it can anymore be done oh I think a lot more can be done I look I'm going to be working this fall on a very scaled up measure to finally get security down there I think putting the national guard down there is a great first step but it's a temporary measure and I think long-term I will be coming up with a plan we intend to unveil this fault I think we'll get a lot of attention to get this done once and for all I think most Texans I talked to one security at the border first and foremost and I think this latest surge of children demonstrates how wide open it is when you have 60,000 kids walking right across the border in the Rio Grande Valley sector it demonstrates that it's not secure and that we need to get this thing done it's a serious situation representative michael mccaul good luck today thank you very much for your time Thank You Amanda

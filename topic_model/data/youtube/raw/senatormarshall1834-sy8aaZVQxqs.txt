all right we've reached a turning point on the vaccines that are out right now for the first time more vaccines distributed than new cases reported of covet 19 the read on all this from senator roger marshall the republican senator from uh kansas also a physician by training so we got a double bang for our buck here senator always good having you thank you very much what do you make of that this is a first now where the vaccine availability eclipses that of the number of cases well look we're in that acceleration phase of implementing a plan uh we've got three vaccines out there and gosh i think we passed 90 million vaccinations so we're on our way i really think we can get hurt immunity by april or may if our president's team does their job and our governors do their job you talk about the point of hurt immunity can you still get that when there's still a stubborn plurality of american senator who are leery of the vaccine and and don't don't want to take it i i do i i would imagine 25 or 50 of americans have had already had the virus and if we can get another 150 million vaccinated we're going to be there and what i really wanted to talk about today is there's lots of good news out there saying that after just one shot of the of the vaccination from from pfizer and moderna it achieves 75 90 efficiency and there's also good data out there saying we could delay that second shot by 12 weeks so what what i'm theorizing or asking the cdc and fda to consider is use some real practical knowledge and practical common sense and say after we get the senior citizens vaccinated after we get everybody with high risk vaccinated let's try to get a whole lot of people with one vaccine in them as soon as possible so the normal rationale for the two dose vaccines they all have that feature except johnson johnson's it's a one dose vaccine but um the the normal rule of thumb 21 days after your first dose is when you should get your second dose you say that you can actually push it out to eight weeks or more yeah actually the the news data is saying more like 12 weeks even so what the second shot of those vaccinations does is raises it from you from like from 75 effective to 95 effective which is well and good that's why our senior citizens need it those that are sick need it but if you could just imagine if there's a finite supply of a vaccine would you rather give 200 people one shot and achieve by doing that probably 150 would be effectively vaccinated versus giving a hundred people two shots and you only get 90 people so there's a finite number of sources there's a finite amount of people out there giving the vaccine so i i think the uh hopefully the fda can kind of consider this plan and give some folks back home some leeways the the health department officials the state officials on how on who to be given this next round of vaccines to and we'll save thousands of lives but if you're if you're older said i just want to be clear you are still recommending that they not wait beyond the 21 days after first oh so all of these vaccines minus johnson johnson's of course right and i want to be careful that i'm recommending or just asking versus asking the fda to consider i do think that senior citizens should get that second vaccine as they're at most at risk but after we get our senior citizens vaccinated that's going to eliminate about 80 percent of the hospitalizations and i then i think to get this hurt immunity we need to get as many people vaccinated as we can in a short amount of time all right thank you very much senator roger marshall obgyn by trading as well from kansas all right it'd be

mr. Fudd you recognized thank you very much mr. chairman and thank you all for being here today it was enlightening to hear of your success stories and as well to hear our Chairman talk about the need for these programs now more than ever and with that said I do have to note that Perkins funding has declined by 24% since 1998 so if we need these programs certainly we need to take a look at how we fund them senator can you just talk to me about how this reduction in funds has hindered the expansion of high-quality CTE programs the reduction of funds is sort of coming at the exactly the wrong time because good news is I think there's a renaissance of awareness that this is really important and with the economic circumstances of the especially the the fiscal reversals and recession of you know 2008 2010 there's even more need for training and more need for people to receive that training so the funding has been going down at the same time as the need has been increasing and thank goodness we've all been realizing the importance of these programs so it this you get good bang for the buck out of these investments and I just want to say I you know as we all fly a lot I was sitting on a plane one day next to a guy this is in the last month we'll probably had the dirtiest fingernails I've ever seen in my life right so I asked him what he does he teaches welding to young people at a high school in Texas he started to talk to me about how important Perkins was he started to talk to me about what these young people have accomplished through his programs and how they have succeeded when no one thought they would succeed so I agree 100% we need to look at the funding and we need to fund more of these programs so these young people can come out and do productive things we know that there's a shortage of welders in this country of bricklayers and Mason's we need to train them and I think that we can do that if we put the resources in it so I thank you for that as well to you senator Kaine last year I introduced the go to high school go to college act which would expand Pell eligibility of course for students attending Early College High School's you introduced the JOBS Act last year as well which which would allow Pell grants to students enrolled in short-term job training programs can you talk a bit about why it's important for us to expand the use of Pell grants to these kinds of programs okay I'm get on my soapbox this is really important this is an example of the second-class status of CTE that still is kind of contained in the federal laws so Pell grant if you income qualify you can get a Pell Grant but the course has to be the length of a college semester a lot of high intensity welding programs or 10-week courses it's not the length of a college semesters not 14 weeks so we don't allow Pell grants for these intense CTE programs why don't we I mean the the student income qualifies it's because we have viewed those programs as second class I'll tell you another one in the military active duty military tuition assistance benefit you can get that if your CEO says what you want to study is relevant to your MOS you can use it at a community college or a college up to forty five hundred dollars a year but if you want to use three hundred dollars to take the American Welding Society certification exam because you're trained as an ordnance enlisted officer you can't use the money for the certification exam you've got to use it on a college campus it makes no sense there are still many policies that kind of hold the college and CTE on two levels and some of the best policy we can do is going through and removing those vestiges of the day when CTE was not viewed as of equal measure and that's why we introduced the JOBS Act so if you income qualify take that 10-week HVAC intensive course it doesn't have to be the length of a college semester well certainly I'm hopeful of that is something we can do on a bipartisan basis it makes all the sense in the world so I'm hoping that my colleagues will be supportive of it lastly to you sir takane please talk to me about why it is important for us to address the Higher Education Act as it relates to training educators in these CTE programs yeah great question the Higher Education Act is also maybe the best place to to fix this Pell Grant disparity that we that we were just discussing but but training is critical the one of the bills that we have that I was discussing in my testimony the educating tomorrow's workforce act really talks about this career training and professionalism I think we've all seen many of our great teachers these days or career switchers but there is no place where that is more the case than in CTE education and I'm sure that the teacher that you talk to on the train on the plane with the dirty fingernails before he was a teacher he was a practicing welder and then he was bringing that into the classroom so professional development is really important and maybe with a special focus on the career switcher to bring them from the technical field into the classroom they tend to be the you know the most popular teachers and in many of the schools where they work thank you I yield back mr. chairman letti yields back senator Kaine

I'm Michael Mills and I am a teacher at North East Jones high school my name is tyler garrison and from harvest high school hey so I'm Carson Miller and I'm from Gulfport high so about seven years ago we noticed that we don't have any real kind of leadership programs here in South Mississippi especially for the 4th congressional district I found out some of my colleagues from around the country we're hosting you know employee workshops job fairs career fairs but I didn't hear much about a leadership fair for young people and so we came up with the idea to create a Youth Leadership Summit right here in South Mississippi where we take the levant and 12th graders from any school that wants to make it be homeschooled they could be private school public school does not matter but eleventh and twelfth graders from around the 4th congressional district so they could come down here and hear firsthand from Mississippians who have made good who have overcome that will share their stories whether they've overcome obstacles or adversity to achieve the pinnacles of success in their careers and today is our seventh annual Youth Leadership Summit every year the stage gets smaller and the crowd gets bigger we couldn't be more proud of the schools the administrators the counselors and the teachers who encourage their young Future Leaders to come to this event but also the students themselves [Music] [Applause] our students really enjoy every year coming because they learn a lot about leadership and I feel like it costs them to grow it gives them a great perspective on the outside world and what to expect after high school if you're a rising eleventh or twelfth grader and you'd like to participate in the Palazzo Youth Leadership Summit please contact our office let your school administrator know your guidance counselor that you want to be a part of one of the most exciting inspirational leadership programs from young future Mississippi leaders right here in Mississippi's fourth congressional district just give us a call or ask one of your teachers to get you the information and come down and have an opportunity to hear from Mississippians made good their stories of their life and their successes and so you could be well prepared to be a future leader for Mississippi is amazing that's the best way to describe it like it's been amazing and I hope that like everybody who comes and who's here today it takes exactly what I've taken from it so far

rand paul is a senator from kentucky he joins us tonight senator thanks so much for coming on and his wife kelly paul also thanks thanks a lot um actually i'll start with you mrs paul you wrote i thought a very affecting piece in the washington examiner today about what you experienced last night can you tell us what it was like to be in the middle of the threats and the screaming it was absolutely terrifying i have never experienced anything like that in my life i hope no one else ever has to we felt completely powerless before some of the video that i think you have shown where the police with the bikes were kind of creating a moving barricade for us in the minutes before the police with the bikes showed up we were completely encircled and surrounded pressed up against two cops who we were surrounded by people who were screaming in our faces yelling that they were gonna f us up screaming say her name and at one point you know at first i was trying to look in their eyes and trying to have any kind of reason or to see someone as a human being and i realized they did not see us as human beings we were trump supporters so they absolutely despised us even though if we were ever in a situation and maybe could have talked to some of those folks and they knew about rand's background in criminal justice reform and the things that i've spoken out on we could have had agreement but in that moment it was just like this bloodthirsty mob and all i could think of was the man who was kicked in the head in portland you know a week ago or the man whose jaw was broken or eight-year-old sequoia turner i really felt that we were going to lose our lives i thought someone was going to throw a brick i mean it was the most terrifying moment in my entire life so given that let me just quickly to you a follow-up uh mrs paul given that the experience that you had you just described it so vividly what do you make of the news coverage of it i've seen a couple of different accounts today that suggest it was not a big deal at all that you're complaining for political reasons npr tonight described it as a peaceful protest what do you make of that i'm furious i am furious i'm furious that biden and kamala harris are not denouncing this you tell me if you are surrounded by a mob that will not let you move that is screaming in your face that is holding you completely hostage and you cannot walk to your hotel and you are on a dark street you tell me that's not violence you tell me that is not an attack that's right there were times it happened incredibly quickly you know it's it's nearly one in the morning we have two blocks we think we can make it two blocks it looks clear we make it one block and right about the time we see these policemen we go up we just as we approach the policeman the mob turns the corner and they say we've got him we've got rand paul we've got him trapped 30 people descend on us but then 30 became 60 became 90 became 120 and it swelled and we were in a pocket of kelly and i and the two officers all touching each other in a very small pocket they're completely surrounding us they are pushing us they are threatening to kill us and they're yelling and screaming and i thought we were going to be overrun and so i i looked to the policeman and i yelled in his ear i said they know who i am i'm in congress i don't think the policeman did know i was in congress and i said they know i'm you need to call for reinforcement and he's calling for reinforcement but even though there were thousands of policemen it it it seemed like forever to come and we were there but it was the pitch and the tenor of this is the invective everything is getting louder and louder and louder and i thought they were going to be overrun i mean these police were brave but there were two of them at first versus 120 people if someone falls to the ground that's when the law becomes kicking and stomping people and you're done for but they came up they were incredibly brave the president has said this and i'll say it again they deserve our thanks our praise they deserve a medal and i'll be there in the white house with when the president gives them a medal for what they did because i truly believe we would have been killed the left says oh well you weren't killed so you weren't threatened no the police saved our lives because these thugs would have killed us they would have stomped us and killed us and these people don't live in dc either there's evidence that's coming out that these people were paid and that they came to town at someone else's past so why are we putting up with this why are we i mean this is the most heavily fortified city in the united states it's the seat of our federal government they don't own these streets most of them are even from there why are we why have we tolerated this crap for three months i'm serious we don't need to put up with this why are we well look at where the problems are portland minneapolis washington dc chicago and new york what do they all have in common democrat mayors not just this time around democrat mayors for 50 years and the thing is the president put it very well in his speech last night he said if you want the country to be portland if you want the country to be on fire put somebody in the white house who doesn't care about whether we have police or not the police are brave and they're protecting us are there for reforms you know me tucker i'm for a lot of reforms for the police i am for reforming them but i never let myself forget that 99 of them or more are good people they live amongst us they go to our church we see them in the grocery store and if we want to make it out that they're all bad people it's the same misnomer or the misrepresentation that they're saying oh all white people are racist we actually have less racism and prejudice than we've ever had in my lifetime we have been going in the right direction for so long you look at corporate america you look at universities you look at inner marriage you look at church integration we are we have been going in the right direction but now they're telling you that the world hates you and you might as well just break windows and take stuff instead of going to college and succeeding it just it just boggles my mind where we're going but the violence has to stop like right like right now and we can have those debates later once we make it safe to walk on streets that we pay for randy kelly paul thank you both very much that was thank you compelling i appreciate it thank you thank you tucker

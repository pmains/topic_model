germ√°n who like congressman eisah also sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee great to see you today boy this is big news with Facebook first of all your your take on those 32 pages for that inauthentic behavior what's being looked at that you know about well Russia's interfering they're continuing to interfere we can't minimize it I think my colleague mr. Isaac at first analogized these pages to the New York Times they're not the New York Times they're Putin and we have not sanctioned Russia for its interference in our 2016 election we have sanctions on them for their own abuses of human rights but we haven't done anything to stop them from to make it plain to draw that line in the sand that they'd better not interfere in the 2018 election and in fact that's what they're doing congressman Sherman I was under the impression from reporting and what I've read that those sanctions were upcoming is that not the case we haven't done it so far we didn't draw a red line in Helsinki and unfortunately on a party-line vote the Republicans rejected spending money on vote tabulation security and so a lot of people are going to wonder whether their vote was counted in the United States or counted in st. Petersburg so that's one element at all this but these ads Facebook now saying that it is in the very early stages of its investigation and this coordinated inauthentic behavior still trying to get an idea of what that means moving forward I'm hearing the words Kremlin and Russia the vice chair mark Warner had mentioned that he said look my team and I his staff have already drilled down on this they've been briefed and then now this from representative Adam Schiff the ranking member of the house permanent Select Committee on Intelligence just moments ago quote today's announcement from Facebook demonstrates that we law what we long feared that malicious foreign actors bearing the hallmark of previously identified Russian influence campaigns continue to abuse and weaponize social media platforms to influence the u.s. electorate what needs to be done in your estimation at this point does the federal government step in I mean there's been resistance because you want to have freedom of speech we want freedom of speech if Russia as they do they have RT TV people could switch to that right now please don't that's what the Russians speaking with their own voice admitting that it is Russia but when they pose as Americans on Facebook it's up to Facebook to get them off but more importantly when we saw a cyber attacks on the DNC when we saw the theft of files from the Democratic National Committee by Russia and Russia has yet to be sanctioned for that that's a problem when we haven't drawn a line in the sand but instead of kind of embraced Putin as an ally of some sort that is a problem and when we don't spend money on vote tabulation security we endanger our democracy and weaken our country these are the steps that this government has taken and they're the wrong steps I don't want to go down the rabbit hole here but have the files and computer hardware and all of that been made I should say have they've been turned over by the DNC and and those Democrats who say that they were hacked I know that the DNC is cooperating with all federal investigators so I I don't think that you blame the New York Times I don't think you blame the victims of this cyber burglary I think you blame Russia and a foreign policy that does not punish or deter Russia or even insulate our vote tabulation system from further Russian as well absolutely Russia is a wrongdoer in this and meddling might be too soft of a word for what Facebook is finding out that they're doing now inauthentic behavior coordinated but I ask the questions about the DNC files and computer files and whatnot just because it helps to be able to see what happened for your time I thank you very much for coming on look forward to coming back and talking about North Korea and Iran all right congressman Sherman thanks a heartbreaking scene in California

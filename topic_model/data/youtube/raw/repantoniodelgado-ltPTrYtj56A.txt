madam Speaker I rise today because we must listen to our children our children are calling out for us to take action to address the epidemic of gun violence which has spread to traditionally safe places like schools concert halls movie theaters and places of worship our children are growing up under the constant paranoia of gun violence try if you can to imagine the depth of their fear and anxiety where nowhere is safe last week I visited seven schools in my district and spoke with students who fear for their safety and stress over our inability to take action on gun violence we are not even halfway through 2019 and there have already been 13 school shootings is there any mystery behind the student walkouts we experienced last year in response to gun violence I was proud to support HR 8 back in March in order to achieve long overdue universal background checks a baseline measure to address gun violence now the Senate must act I implore my colleagues in the Senate to hear the young people of our country calling for change and to pass HR 8 the time is now I yield back my time

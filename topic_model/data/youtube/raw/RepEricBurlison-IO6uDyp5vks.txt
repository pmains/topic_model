hi i'm eric burleson and this is a capital report it's february the 4th and this week in fact just moments ago i voted for house bill 1377 it was sponsored by owen brandon and this bill is the right thing to do for the families in our state we have we have great needs in the state and obviously there are a lot of families that that are receiving state funds to help out in their in their family situations the unfortunate thing about the charitable work that occurs is that sometimes people take advantage of that share it's our job as legislators to be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars and that's why when senate when people are receiving state funds we want to make sure that they're not using those funds and that charity to pay for illegal substances and drugs that that would would cause more harm and damage thing about those kind of situations and the the victims in that situation is really children when uh when a parent chooses to accept welfare funds from the state and then takes those funds instead of buying food or improving the lives of their family they instead decide to purchase drugs with that money the the victims are the children we want to make sure that we're helping those kids and so this bill makes sure that if a person is is tested for drug abuse then the state will require them to go through drug rehab in order to continue to be on state funds if they refuse to to go and rebat in rehabilitation then we will remove them from state programs this is the right thing to do in the best direction for the not only those people we should not be enabling people to continue in a drug habit we need to help people and also help the children of those families i appreciate your comments and concerns i think this is a bill that is in the right direction but we have received so many emails from you so far already and i'm just here to represent you thank you very much and you can contact me on the state website or on my facebook page also on my gmail account eric.erlson gmail.com

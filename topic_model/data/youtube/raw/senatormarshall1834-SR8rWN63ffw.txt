thank you madam chair i want to lock in on prior authorization for a second and my first question is for dr durham prior authorization is the number one administrative burden facing physicians today across all specialties prior authorization the number one administrative burden facing all physicians across all specialties as a physician myself i knew of the frustration of having to do this talk to a person who maybe a non-specialist who wasn't from my area so i couldn't imagine trying to do a prior auth with you on a patient in the er your years of experience and and as an obstetrician i'm trying to tell you who doesn't have need inpatient management couldn't imagine doing that but this burnout's leading to early retirement it ties up nurses it's frustrating to nurses as well it makes us all less productive i guess my queen and you spoke about this earlier prior authorization my question is do you ever feel that prior authorization is used to ration care or to delay the care the patient needs um thank you so much for your question and um as a fellow physician that you understand sort of what we're going through i do think it delays care absolutely especially in the emergency room context we have literally two to three hours sometimes just to get someone a bed because we're waiting for the insurance to respond to give the okay that yes what you have presented to us meets the criteria for us to get a patient an inpatient psychiatric bed so without a doubt it delays care and when we're thinking about an emergency room we have a lot of patients we need to see i i talked briefly in my testimony about we've been beyond capacity in our emergency rooms and i think that that's not unique to bmc but across the nation during this crisis that people are going in for emergency services and so awaiting beds a waiting placement just you know clogs the system if you will thank you my next question for dr prince prince stein and we're going to stay on the same subject of prior authorization if there was a streamlined solution would it be helpful to your specialist streamline meeting i would suppose that 10 diagnosis account for 80 or 90 percent of the issues that need to be prior off we have senate bill 3018 it's bipartisan by camera as well we have 17 sponsors uh including eight democrats nine republicans 450 national and state organizations are sponsoring this legislation which would streamline the prior authorization would it be helpful for members in your specialty yes i think it would and thank you psychiatry represents of course a small percentage just 10 of the mental health workforce the rest of us are psychologists social workers counselors marriage and family therapists and thinking of solutions that include all mental health providers is appreciated thank you you bet my next question for miss goldsby uh you work in the department of alcohol and drug abuse services does prior authorization ever impact your patients especially does it delay care or ration care then intermarshal we do sometimes see prior authorizations delaying care particularly for some patients who have insurance benefits um when they're needing to be placed on medications and a streamlined approach to those patients would be beneficial to your staff yes absolutely no barriers to treatment yes okay dr lachman kind of the same issue prior authorization in your world i know you're doing research more research based do you ever sit there and think about uh some of what your research leads you to that will patients have access to it are you worried about an insurance company deciding as opposed to evidence-based medicine deciding what that patient should be receiving absolutely i concur you know every single hour that we spend navigating pre-authorization to get a patient the evidence-based treatment that he or she needs is an hour that could be spent on something else you know delivering the care that changes people's lives it could be spent on i'm also doing the training that you'll have mentioned is critical so i think any way that we can cut down on the processes would be helpful to where we can just give people the treatment that they need okay thank you so much

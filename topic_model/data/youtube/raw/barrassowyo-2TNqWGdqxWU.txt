let's go to Senator John Brasso on this the Wyoming Republican the Senate GOP conference chairman Senator what did you think of what the energy Minister was saying there if that wasn't the reason for cutting production he did seem to lay out the Fallout that it would have that it it weakens the United States doing so well that's exactly what the energy minister of Saudi Arabia said that the pain was going to get worse here in the United States Neil for almost two years American families had been feeling the pain the biting pain of high prices at the gas station at the grocery store and when this administ administrator says it's going to get worse this is a self-inflicted wound upon ourselves Neil if they understand that affordable energy is a lifeblood of a family and of a nation and what we have done to ourself has now held ourselves hostage by Saudi Arabia because we have such radical energy policies when the answer is right here in America it's right under our nose it's right here in Wyoming where I am we have affordable available reliable energy yet the Democrats every Democrat in the house the White House and the Senate will not let us use it we need to change the American Energy policy to an American First Energy policy not be dependent on Saudi Arabia Arabia or anyone else for that energy we need to get back to energy Independence we have it I know what you're coming from that Senator and obviously uh you know the president and his message on you know stopping domestic production to the degree he has or making it more difficult did lead to this but the Saudis are interesting in themselves they are clearly screwing us with this decision they know that that whatever your views of the president all they're going after America in a way that is not going to help the West not going to help our country very akin to the embargoes they LED in the 70s the last one almost drove them out of business with friends like that who needs enemies right well the the Saudi energy minister is the brother of the Crown Prince so he speaks with authority and I talked about 10 days ago he seems very happy and content with sticking it to us right and I talked about 10 days ago to the uh ambassador from Saudi Arabia to the United States specifically about this decision to cut a million barrels a day production and the Ambassador confirmed to me that the position of the United States both our national security advisor and our Secretary of Treasury Janet Yellen was to continue to beg and plead that they don't make the announcement that they were going to do that cut until after November look a strong president would never allow this to happen a strong president Saudis still did it and I understand what you're saying about the president potentially botching it and begging for them not to do so they did it anyway but in zinging the president they zinged all of us who needs friends like that right well we've had a relationship a strategic relationship with Saudi Arabia but 15 presidents seven Kings going back over 80 years it's a security relationship related to Iran to us two million barrels a day we don't need their oil and we need to make it clear that we're energy independent in this country we have the energy here Neil and the president's actions have been to draw down on the Strategic petroleum Reserve which is what that Minister was talking about he's drawn it down to the level the lowest level in 40 years we're going to need to replace that at some point but the president is so focused on the upcoming election and his terrible poll numbers that he does see he seems to be willing to put our national security aside he is sticking it to us and enjoying it and relishing it whatever you think about Joe Biden the Saudi kingdom is saying the United States that it's helped him time and again dealing with houthi Rebels from the Moran and all of that he is saying to us we don't care about that we're going to stick you against the wall whether you like it or not something how do you do huh the strongest nation in the world should never find themselves in a position where you can get stuck against the world this is a strategic Mistake by the president and the Democrats who put their environmental agenda above the security and the well-being of the American people and that's why that's why the Republicans are surging in the polls and Neil I'm very optimistic about our opportunity to take back the house take back the Senate and then I'd be the chairman of the energy committee and we would focus on affordable energy and American Energy and not depending on guys like that to your point Senator thank you so much very good seeing you uh Senator abarasso on all of that

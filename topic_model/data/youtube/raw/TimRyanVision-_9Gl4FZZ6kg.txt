thank you from ohio mr ryan for five minutes thank you mr chairman i just i'd like to thank each of the witnesses for their uh testimony and their contribution to trying to solve this problem uh mr woodson i would just take issue with what you just said about the luxury tax because very high levels of inequality deregulation led to a complete collapse of the economy and a lot of blue-collar people lost their jobs there and it wasn't to punish anybody who's has wealth it's to help balance a budget make investments and all of these other things so that was much more significant than maybe the people that lost their jobs for luxury tech but anyway i want to talk about two things that i think can help thread the needle with the conversation that we've been having about i believe in the expectations i'm an old athlete i think like you hold the bar up here and people will get there more often than not if you give them the help love encouragement that they need so i believe in that um what i want to do is try to figure out how we can move the discussion to what ms edelman talked about a little bit about how these investments can help and i think we should base our policies on the latest brain science that we have how does a child's mind function what's going on in there and we fortunately have a lot of technology today that can help us understand that and what we've come to understand over the past few years is that we have all these different regions in our brain one of the regions is the old part of the brain called the amygdala the amygdala does our fight or flight or freeze and when we're under very high levels of stress our amygdala gets very activated and we go into fight or flight we see it in the military we see it with young kids when that piece part of your brain gets very activated it starts to shut down the prefrontal cortex and when we start talking about the executive functions which is where the prefrontal cortex is this is where the executive functions are housed it's the ceo of the brain and i think we need to figure out how we can help people young kids deal with this issue because the high levels of stress violence whether it's hunger and equality in these neighborhoods is activating this particular part of the brain that we know about and it's shutting off their prefrontal cortex so you want to talk about what's the secret sauce the secret sauce is how do you get that prefrontal cortex to operate and function in a positive way and it's a little bit of what we were talking about love kids feeling cared about safe that calms the amygdala and allows you to access your prefrontal cortex so these programs are important there's another program that's out there or an approach called attention training or mindfulness based stress reduction and this particular process has been proven to calm the amygdala down and reshift the brain to be able to access your prefrontal cortex there are studies that actually show areas of the amygdala that because they were so active uh actually got smaller because as they used this mindfulness-based stress reduction practice there was less activity in the amygdala and that part of the amygdala actually shrunk this is an approach that i think can help us give the kids the awareness that they need i know we've talked about coping skills both in bishop you said both internal and external these kids have to know what's going on inside of themselves and so we need to give them the tools that increase awareness to know what's going on inside of themselves and what's happening outside of themselves and i would just encourage all of you to take a deep look at this practice this is something that the seattle seahawks did in the past year and i'm not sure i would share that example if they didn't win the super bowl but they did so i'm happy to share it with you um this is something that the united states marine corps is doing to help marines focus be in the present moment not get up in the caught up in the past in the future even if yesterday was a really bad day so i want to encourage you to look at the programs that are using some kind of mindfulness-based stress reduction to help these kids secondly i just want to talk about food we just talked about an entire farm bill that continues to subsidize food that is making children sick we have an epidemic of diabetes in the united states in the next few years half of the people in the united states are either going to have diabetes or pre-diabetes and if we don't have a farm bill that starts focusing on fruits and vegetables edible edible classrooms gardens healthy food regional farming making sure that young kids have an opportunity to access getting rid of food deserts investing in urban ag this all is part of a poverty program that will lift everybody up and so i wanted to just take my five minutes not necessarily to ask a question but as we wind it down to share my thoughts thank you we certainly appreciate the anatomic instruction you do doctor thank you mr yarmouth for five minutes thank you mr chairman i'd also like to thank the witness

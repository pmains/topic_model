at a time when we're doing all that we can do to rein in spending decrease our deficit and strengthen our economy it's imperative that we look for ways to get better results for less money throughout our federal programs and all of our legislative initiatives as chairman of the subcommittee on federal financial management i look in every nook and cranny of the federal government for ways to save taxpayer money by targeting wasteful spending fraudulent or abusive activity by focusing on reducing or eliminating waste fraud abuse and efficiency we're able to save and recover scarce financial resources that preserve and strengthen our nation's vital programs like medicare medicaid and our defense operations ultimately though solving our nation's fiscal challenges will require the federal government to transition from what i call a culture of spendthrift to a culture of thrift in every federal program that we administer we can be better stewards of taxpayers money unfortunately there's no silver bullet to rooting out waste and fraud but there are many bipartisan and common sense approaches the government can take to begin to see real results and that's what we're going to do

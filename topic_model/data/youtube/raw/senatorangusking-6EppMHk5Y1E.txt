Thank You mr. chairman I must say I'm delighted to be joining you as ranking member of this subcommittee I am just delighted and delighted to welcome director Smith who I just learned hails from Portland Maine which means you have a lot of credibility coming out of the box mr. director don't screw it up we're delighted to have you here I'm also excited you mentioned about Thurgood Marshall it was 50 years ago this spring as a young law student that I heard Thurgood Marshall speak at the University of Virginia law school and it's one of the highlights of my life I still remember the speech to this day I'm a strong supporter of the National Park System firm believer in its mission protect and preserve the natural and cultural resources of this nation for the enjoyment of future generations in this role I hope to help the Park Service bring its operations into the 21st century to help our national parks connect to a new generation of visitors and to redouble our efforts to solve the challenges facing the park system from older challenges like park maintenance and funding to the newer challenges such as record visitation at certain parks and the long-term threats of climate change director Smith I also welcome you to the committee today I appreciate your testimony on the pending legislation and appreciate the work that you've done for many years I understand one of the issues that I'm going to be talking about is Acadia National Park and you worked on that issue in 1986 and it's a delight to have you here with your expertise in history the Park Service and the Department of Interior has been working with me for some time to address concerns about the legislation involving Acadia I know that both the administration and the Maine delegation are dedicated to preserving and continuously improving Acadia National Park one of the crown jewels of the National Park System I think the changes we've made in this legislation appropriately take care of a number of issues at the park importantly the bill addresses the concern from local neighbors about the park and about the boundaries by protecting traditional activities of clamors and warmers near the park and it also addresses an assortment other issues that were bound to arise between close neighbors who've been in proximity for a hundred years by the way I was at a celebration two summers ago of the 100th anniversary of Acadia National Park and at the celebration was the only person on the island older than the park David Rockefeller he was a hundred and one and was at that celebration the legislation that we're bringing forward also codifies important work and a welcome gift to Acadia fourteen hundred acres on the scooting Peninsula and addresses some long-term concerns about the skies and scale of the park by ending a lack of clarity on the Park Service's authority and the role of Congress regarding future acquisitions and boundary changes thank you again director Smith for being here and thank you chairman Danes and I look forward to our hearing

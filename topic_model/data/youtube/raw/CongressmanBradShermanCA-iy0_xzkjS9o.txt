how does America get saddled with these bad trade deals if we look at our quote free trade agreements we see a four hundred and twenty-five percent increase in our trade deficit with those countries you get that statistic if you include NAFTA which of course is the granddaddy of all of our trip free trade deals and that doesn't even count our worst deal which was granting most favored nation status to China so how do we end up with such bad deals first the elites convince themselves that it's good for the country they do this because they love the theory of the economy economic textbook and don't feel comfortable looking at the practice of how business actually works second the elites benefit from these deals these deals help economists and Wall Street and attorneys and so they convince themselves that they're good for the country as a whole and create a sub cultural echo chamber in which it is a sub cultural norm that all smart people realize that these are good trade deals so having convinced themselves to support these deals they use a condescension false appeals to patriotism and sneaky tactics to saddle the American people with these trade deals take a look at what the effect on working families America needs a raise to get it we need a severe labor shortage we would have millions of additional jobs a desperate labor shortage if only we had balanced trade with the world let's look at TPP and its inclusion of Vietnam we are told that the trans-pacific partnership will give us free access to the vietnamese market there's only one problem in Vietnam there's no freedom and there's no market in fact we will not have access except as the communist party of vietnam decides to grant it on the basis of crony capitalism but our workers are going to have to compete against 40-cent and our Vietnamese labor now we're told that in Vietnam under this deal it won't be illegal to organize a union they won't put you in jail for organizing a union yes what they'll do is they'll plant drugs on every union activist and arrest them for that you're not going to see free unions in Vietnam so it hurts working families so how do they sell it they claim that it may take jobs away but it's a necessary fact sacrifice because we have to contain China as the ranking member of the Asia subcommittee I'm here to tell you the TPP is great for China first we're told well we get to write the rules no these are Wall Street's rules they're not the rules of the American working family second TPP enshrines the idea that currency manipulation is just fine so China gets the single most important change in the in the rules of international trade but finally and most obscurely there are the rules of origin now we know that under this deal goods that are made in vietnam or japan come right into the united states with no tariffs which you don't know is it goods that are fifty sixty percent seventy percent made in China then go to Vietnam or Japan to where they can put a made in Japan sticker on it and send it in the United States that's when they admit that it's fifty or sixty percent made in China as a CP I'll tell you if you're in a position to admit that your goods or sixty percent made in China that means they can be ninety percent made in China so China gets to fast-track their goods into the United States no tariffs and we get no access to the Chinese markets so it's a really bad deal how do you pass it you use sneaky tactics they don't have the votes to pass it now the American people would rise in opposition to try to pass it now so they're going to wait for the lame duck and then have a group of retiring members of this body shaft the American people with the TPP we do have a solution we need to get all three remaining presidential candidates to declare that if sneaky tactics and lame duck sessions are used to impose TPP on America that they will in their first month in office pull us back out of TPP unless we hear that clearly from the three presidential candidates all of whom oppose TPP that night not only oppose it but they will erase anything that happens in ER in a lame duck session then the elites will prevail we will lose jobs again our workers will have to compete with 40 sent an hour labor Chinese goods will be fast-tracked into the United States with made in Japan and made in vietnam stickers on them it's time for the presidential candidates to go beyond are saying they're against it they have to declare that they'll make sure that any lame duck approval of TPP that happens in December will be erased the following January I yield back Germans times expired chair now recognizes gentleman

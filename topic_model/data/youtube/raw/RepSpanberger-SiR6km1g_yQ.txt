please welcome congresswoman abigail spanberger hello everyone i'm abigail spanberger and i look forward to hearing from you as we talk about the issues facing you your businesses our communities and our country but before i begin i want to begin uh to address the major news of this week the draft opinion related to roe versus wade and the potential that our country and the supreme court intends to overturn it i am deeply concerned about the possibility of this ruling uh this leaked opinion uh becoming a reality it represents a loss of a constitutional right it represents a movement backwards for a right that's been in place for two generations and it represents a threat to our constitutional right to privacy throughout the pages of this draft ruling justice alito part by part uh stages in an all-out assault on the right to privacy and all that it protects abortion rights and other rights that have been decided based on this principle i've heard from many virginians who are concerned about what this would mean what happens when the supreme court announces its final decision what it means for the girl who's been raped and who is now forced to endure a government-mandated pregnancy uh of her rapists what it means for the mother who is pregnant again but this time it's an ectopic pregnancy that threatens her life and threatens to leave her children motherless if she's forced to undergo a government government-mandated pregnancy these are the things that are on my mind and these are the calls that i'm fielding from people throughout our district who are deeply concerned it's a complex issue it's a emotional issue but foundationally we are looking at movement backwards about the reversal of rights that have existed for two generations and potentially enough people of every decision based on the constitutional principle of a right to privacy so i look forward to answering your questions to further discussing this or or other topics before we open up the phones i do want to remind everyone that you can always reach out to my office to provide us with your opinions and your ideas uh my office number is 804-401-410 you can also submit a letter you can also submit your opinions on our website at spanberger.house before we get to questions i do want to give an update on the bipartisan infrastructure law which i was proud to help negotiate and ultimately get across the finish line and celebrate as the president signed it into law last month i was proud to announce an additional 165 million dollars for virginia to expand transportation options reduce travel times and decrease congestion on our highways like i-95 this investment is made possible thanks to the bipartisan infrastructure law and i am excited to see the benefits uh here in virginia these are the kind of investments the bipartisan infrastructure investment and jobs act promised to make to our physical infrastructure our roads our bridges our broadband connectivity and our electrical grid and i'm excited that we can make long overdue improvements here in the commonwealth because they will make sure that virginia make remains the very best place in the country to raise a family go to school start a career or begin a new business venture it remains the greatest honor to serve virginia's families our communities and our country and i'm grateful for the opportunity to serve virginia's seventh district as virginians contend with the challenges ahead of us it is my job to keep an open line of communication such as tonight's event i look forward to answering your questions i look forward to hearing your concerns and i look forward to following up on any constituent service issues that might arise tonight so with that i want to thank you again for joining us this evening and i look forward to the discussion all right thank you very much congresswoman we're going to get things started now with uh rory and rory is calling from orange she's got a question about the federal excise tax roy you're online with the congresswoman what is your question well hi congresswoman we have spoken before and i appreciate your follow-up on a number of items always committed uh by these conversations to follow through in the citizenry much appreciated uh three things i'd like to possibly ask i am going to ask uh number one where are we on the potential of abating for a period of time the federal excise tax on fuel that's number one it started the administration talked about it others did i see no progress number two uh i see that there are expiring tax credits uh for a number of the car companies that are getting a credit for the production of electronic and other green type of vehicles and that's going to add into the price tag if those credits by the federal government are not extended and number three so the excise tax the credits for the automobile manufacturers to be expanded and number three and your credit as you mentioned in your last call and if you could comment on what you are doing for the education and being able to train more trucking from virginia but also with the office that i have out west i recently was in long beach california and when you look at the port of la long beach san pedro where the president had visited last year and thought that 24 7 was going to open up the lines there's certainly so many facets of that that have not happened you and i have spoken about a supply chain czar maybe somebody from the military that even for office looks good but i would encourage you and others on the phone that the wall street journal has about a 15-minute video that goes into much detail on the supply chain activities from the ports and all the other variables that come into play so the excise tax the tax credits and then our quest for this czar to go deeper into the supply chain thank you congresswoman thank you very much thank you for your thought for questions don't worry i have a pen i was tracking them okay so number one the parking lot whether they meet the possibility of um evading the gas tax or relief for drivers first i want to join uh with constituents who have called in people across our communities who are impacted by uh the not just high cost of fuel but in fact also the the volatile cost of fuel we've seen uh we saw some hopeful trends and then those leveled off we saw it creep back up and so it is such a challenge and certainly representing a district where uh so many people drive to work long commutes and particularly within uh the rural communities that i represent i have spoken with county leadership about the on average miles uh that so many constituents uh drive each day back and forth to work um and and it's significant and the cost to people's pocketbook has been real so the discussion there has been discussion certainly at the state level there's been much debate about what to do uh with the federal gas action whether whether excuse me with the state gas tax and whether there would be a temporary pause that's a state issue but at the federal level there's been discussion of this as well it's still possible that there may be a forward effort here but indeed what people like me are pushing for is a larger package that's focused on supply chain issues inflation across the board related legislation um and whether ultimately it does make sense or doesn't make sense uh to include a a federal um gas tax holiday as some people call it would be dependent upon the other steps that we would take i think it would be short-sighted to simply uh stop that revenue coming in without also taking additional steps to really strengthen our supply chains moving forward um so i'm gonna get to question number three and then go back because it's related to question number one so among the other things that i'm pushing for for us to contend with inflation right and and just as level setting inflation wasn't caused by any one single thing it wasn't caused in a day uh we have inflation in this country because of a whole you know supply chain issues from a year ago because of covid uh at the ports as you mentioned in your question we have had backup of uh containers not being offloaded not being shipped outbound that's created real impact for american uh producers of products that are going uh that are supposed to be shipped out of the country so a couple things one i have been very vocal in calling on the administration to appoint a supply chain czar they still haven't done it i still think it's a good idea i'm glad you agree with me uh and i continue to push for this it's important to have a single point of contact um who is doing the kind of across-the-board view of what's happening in dot what's department of transportation department of energy department of commerce small business administration right everybody's got a little bit of a purview in this and it would be important to have someone whose daily job is it to look at all of the cross-cutting challenges so i still continue to advocate for that um in addition i have worked not only with what was in the bipartisan infrastructure investment and jobs act in terms of provisions to recruit and retain additional truck drivers i've spoken about that on town halls in the past but i also just introduced a piece of legislation bipartisan with a colleague republican colleague from wisconsin that is meant to recruit and retain additional truck drivers we currently have a shortage of about 80 000 truck drivers nationwide and just yesterday i actually went for a ride uh with one of the local trucking companies here i went for a ride with one of the drivers heard a lot about her experiences what it is moving goods up and down the east coast being an important piece of moving goods uh from place to place as part of our supply chain i actually got to do a loop in the truck around a parking lot uh and so uh i have a tremendous tremendous respect for anyone who can drive a truck more than the about 200 feet that i drove it and i my gratitude is with every truck driver who is on our roads keeping goods moving but this bill would um extend an exten refundable tax credit for anyone in a uh certified uh truck driving apprenticeship uh or training program so on their way to getting their cdl and then it would also for two years refundable tax credit it would also provide a refundable tax credit to any certified driver licensed driver uh who is driving more than 1900 hours a year uh so making sure that you know as they're ensuring the vital movement of goods across our country that they also not only see an economic benefit um to remain in the industry but also recognize that we are valuing uh so significantly the importance of what they do uh for our supply chain this bill is broadly supported by trucking organizations both at the state level uh and at the national level it's a bill that i discussed at great length with a number of different trucking companies in our district i'm proud of this effort and again it's part of a larger piece of it i'll speak about supply chain issues related and inflation related to meat and poultry certainly we know that uh meat and poultry and the price increase that we've seen in meat and poultry has certainly outpaced um the inflation that we've seen kind of across the board on average and that impacts families at the grocery store so i have two different pieces of legislation one to contend with the monopolistic behavior of our four top processing plants uh that is aimed at focus focusing on uh ensuring that under usda there's a special investigator division that would ensure uh that the the packers in stockyards act is being enforced and that we uh are safeguarding uh not only our smaller meat producers but we are rooting out anti-competitive behavior that drives up prices that so impact not only our meat producers but also those of us who are going to the grocery store and and purchasing meat so those are two elements two priority issues i also have another bill that would help smaller processors local processors which would be so valuable throughout virginia get set up and be able to process meat so butcher meat uh from our local uh cattle and uh and poultry producers here in virginia so those are a couple of the elements of work that i am doing to get at uh some of the moving pieces related to the inflation that we're seeing the third piece was about expiring uh tax credits uh and uh for those who purchase electric vehicles um so this these these tax credits are done uh based on make and model and so there's a set number for each make and model um and those when those expire for a customer who wants to or a person who wants to make use of those tax credit they still have many many options for newer models coming down the line but some of the electric vehicles that have been on the market for quite some time uh those numbers uh those those uh tax rebates are no longer available but there are many tax rebates available for newer models uh and and uh companies that are newer to this market so there's uh no efforts right now to retroactively provide those those rebates for uh cars that have already had an expiration of those but there are plenty of vehicles electric vehicles that are still eligible for those uh because they're newer to the market okay thank you next up we're going to go to kerry from henrico and carrie has a question about the border crisis kelly you're online with congresswoman spanberger what is your question um hello congresswoman i really appreciate all the effort you're doing up in d.c for us i am really concerned this is obviously a much more broad issue what um you know i've been hearing about how the immigration system has been great is it a breaking point especially in texas and the morale of the border patrol is really at the at the lowest it's been the amount of uh i guess undocumented immigrants are just is at record highs and it's not stopping we're coming into an era where there's going to be more and more people coming across the the warmer seasons what is being done i mean it's been in in um office for over a year and i'm just i'm shocked frankly that nothing else has been done i'd love to know how what you can do thank you well i'm going to start with a couple different comments um to address the things you said um and i think you actually laid it out very very well um generally speaking some of the concerns that you brought up but certainly concerns that are echoed uh by so many constituents and concerns uh that i share you you mentioned that border patrol agents um are are facing real significant issues related to morale uh and and that is true um there have been significant challenges along our borders for years uh the reality is that our system needs major overhauls and improvements we are an extraordinary nation and people from all over the world dream of coming to the united states of america and we need an immigration system that works we need an immigration system that does not put the burden of its brokenness on the men and women who swore an oath to protect our country and our borders and enforce our laws and we need an immigration system that does not put the burden of how broken it is on the family fleeing violence that has a legal right to file for asylum um and so a couple things in terms of what i have done um i last uh under the last congress uh so um worked on legislation got legislation passed bipartisan legislation i worked on with a former member of the house of representatives from texas uh focused on border security focused on ensuring the utilization of intelligence to understand human trafficking and narco-trafficking efforts uh to better inform uh the the men and women uh enforcing the laws at our border and to keep them safe and immigrants fleeing violence safe that bill was signed into law by president trump under the last administration and i am proud of that uh you are right to mention that there's uh and anticipated increases in migration uh frankly there's two contributing factors there one there is a seasonality to this uh it's in fact based on needs here economically people come to the united states for jobs and the seasonality of jobs are heavily available in the warmer months also there's uh the potential that there may be a lifting of title 42 which was a public health provision put in place under the trump administration and carried forward by the biden administration that put certain limitations on how people can enter the country whether they can file for asylum and based on a public health protocol now from a public health standpoint this will be lifted at some point in the future and i have been very clear with the administration writing a letter with a fellow former cia officer alyssa slotkin from michigan uh outlining the fact that there are real concerns related to uh how ready we are or are not at the time that that this um that this title this public health mandate is lifted uh we laid out very specific requests of the administration to include that there be processing of families and uh and individuals wishing to come to the united states either at their country of origin or at a third-party country sometimes those fleeing violence may not be able to safely walk into a united states embassy or consulate in their home country but when they set out to make a thousand-mile journey giving them the ability to do it in a third-party country is a safe alternative and one that also ensures that people with a legal claim to asylum are able to make that claim without uh making that dangerous dangerous journey and without overburdening the the the men and women of our border patrol um overall we need comprehensive immigration reform it's something that i have long been a supporter of this the system needs reforms and we need earnest conversations about the fact that throughout our district uh we have a need for workers for laborers for additional visas uh notably the biden administration has expanded the number of h2a visas which uh was news that was met with uh quite a bit of of joy from so many employers uh particularly those that work in uh seasonal work uh tourism well h2a is specifically within agriculture but we need to go beyond that we need to ensure that the process by which people who come to the united states to work particularly in the agricultural sector that the farm workforce modernization act which is a bill that i supported co-sponsored and voted for is able to move forward it's a bipartisan piece of legislation that ensures that you know we the united states of america we know who's coming into the country we're making sure that we are getting uh visas for the agriculture sector that farmers and producers that want to hire people from abroad have the ability to do that uh that individuals come into the united states go through the e-verify system uh so that we can you know be sure we know who's entering but that we can also ensure the workforce uh is is available um and that people who want to work earn money uh contribute to our communities and our economy and then travel back home and come back again that they're able to do it legally and safely um and for many year after year if they so choose uh i also have been a supporter of and have voted for the bipartisan dream and promise act which would give legal stability uh through legislation for any person who's characterized as a dreamer so that's a child who was brought to the united states a child who grew up here whose life and entirety of their life has been here and are now young adults doctors and teachers and lawyers and uh police officers and community members throughout our society um and so carrie i thank you for this question because there's the immediacy of contending with the challenges at the border which requires a significant plan uh i was pleased to see uh the homeland security uh secretary the homeland security secretary has released a plan um that is um you know a step in the right direction but from uh but there's still many more questions that my colleagues on uh the committee on homeland security have um as we move forward certainly into the summer but importantly as we look at the fact that presidency after presidency and we can go back multiple presidents the the system has needed repair the system has needed people of good faith to come together and say i don't want to just attack opponents and cause fear i want to solve a problem i want to recognize and honor that throughout the history of our country people have wanted to come here and we should create the the parameters for people to be able to do it legally for us to get the workforce that our nation needs and for us to have the safety and security and peace of mind of knowing who is coming to our country uh to work to live to vacation and that's an important element but we need people of good faith who are committed to real immigration reform from top to bottom and focused on actually solving once and for all uh a a real challenge a real crisis that uh far too often we are too reactive of um so i i i legislate on this i'm focused on this uh and i do hope that we can make long-term impact so that we are not um reacting uh year after year when we continue to see uh the challenges that we see thank you for the question kerry as a reminder this forum is interactive and we'd love to hear your questions if you have a question you can press star 3 on your keypad at any time to get in the queue to ask a question a member of congresswoman spanberger's staff will collect your questions you can also ask a question by submitting one through the portal below our online streaming player at spamberger.house.gov again that's spamberger.house.dub forward slash live if you're watching on facebook live tonight and wish to ask congresswoman spanberger a question we encourage you to visit that online streaming portal so you can submit your question now back to the phones we're going to go to kristin in richmond kristen has a question for the congresswoman about roe versus wade kristen you're online what is your question thank you so much first i wanted to say i think you do just a fantastic job and really appreciate the way that you represent us and the way you handle yourself i feel you're a real leader so thank you for that my question is i have two one is around is there i i was cut off a little bit in hearing your introduction around roe v wade because i was giving my name to the person but um is there any chance that uh clarence thomas might be investigated for a conflict of interest or is there any kind of effort around what's clearly the political politicalization of the supreme court and what can we possibly do to potentially keep this from happening and my second question is around ukraine um it's just i think the entire nation has been sickened by the genocide going on over there is there i think you have special insight on this with your service and thank you for that service um is there anything that might bring us into that conflict to help save ukraine it's just heartbreaking to see what all has happened over there and um i just wondered is there any chance that we might um you know clear the skies or do other things that might help them more than just giving supplies to a dwindling number of soldiers thank you for the questions kristin so to speak to the first one related to the politicization of the supreme court uh you know our our country was founded on the principles that we have three separate branches of government um and whenever i meet younger students kids i always like to ask them you know what are the three branches of government which one am i in uh just to reiterate the importance of those three separate branches and it is rather distressing and disturbing that we continue to see um the court move in certain ways uh that that seem outwardly political you mentioned um clarence thomas justice thomas and certainly the leaked audio related excuse me the leaked text messages related to his wife and her advocacy as it relates to the january 6th insurrection is deeply deeply concerning at this point in time uh the january 6 committee uh the select committee in congress is doing the strong and detailed work of uh fully investigating what happened what contributed to it uh who played a part and and will make so much of their findings uh public when they do public hearings this summer so i would uh point to what comes from that uh for of any any possible future better understanding of certain individuals involvement in this particular case the spouse of a supreme court justice and also i would defer to the the justice department on any criminal related investigations uh certainly it's incumbent upon any member of the judiciary to recognize his or her own conflicts and act accordingly and and certainly uh i would hope that justice thomas uh would would do that uh if and when such a circumstance presents itself related to ukraine and uh the the genocide the the mass killing of ukrainian civilians the uh outrageous invasion uh an an all-out war that russia has um waged against not just ukrainian soldiers but the ukrainian people the ukrainian history uh ukrainian antiquities and and buildings of note and effort to just wipe ukraine and its culture uh from from the earth uh has been a very uh clearly disturbing thing to witness uh and so i just want to speak to what it is that the united states has done what congress has done um and the impact that that has had so certainly from day one the united states has led our partners and allies in the implementation of crushing sanctions it is incredibly important and i am very proud that the state department and that the administration led our partners throughout europe uh uh throughout the world in walking in unison in putting sanctions in place this was such an incredible signal it was also economically has been economically crushing for the russians this is important in addition to that we have provided military weapons military supplies we have provided supplies to backfill supplies from other countries so working together to make sure that we're uh that you know s 300s can go into ukraine and then u.s weaponry backfills it into slovakia we have led the way uh in our efforts to ensure that the ukrainians have the military um supplies that they need in addition to military supplies lethal supplies we're talking you know the s-300s the stingers the javelins the switchblade drones which the ukrainians have been particularly lethal in using in addition to turkish-made drones we're also talking about communications support the actual equipment to ensure they can communicate medical supplies so that those who may be wounded can survive those battlefield wounds uh and intelligence since day one the united states intelligence community has done incredible work and the administration has leveraged and i say this as a former intel officer has leveraged the intelligence that they've collected um to make sure that vladimir putin knew that not only were we fully aware of his plans and intentions um at his efforts to try and manipulate the world you may think back to two months ago when there was uh the united states made public that putin intended to release a false flag video that would be his justification for the invasion of ukraine being able to get ahead of that was was and continues to be um an important advantage for the ukrainians as they work on the battlefield we just passed in the united states house a bill that would not only uh enable us to sanction right we're already sanctioning russia and russian oligarchs but to seize what we sanction so it isn't just about sanctioning money in a bank account or a house that you know in the united states or elsewhere or an oligarch's yacht it's about going one step further seizing it liquidating those funds and using those funds to further arm and support the ukrainians and ultimately rebuild ukraine when they have defeated the russians this is an important step one that i'm proud to have worked to spearhead with some of my colleagues on the house foreign affairs committee uh and also an important dem uh demonstration of our commitment uh to not only the sanctions but to the ultimate defeat of russia in this war uh we've also passed in the house and in the senate so it's headed to the president's desk a len lease uh legislation that would facilitate with greater ease um additional provision of military weaponry and lethal aid to the ukrainians and so um the i was on a call with president zielinski uh some weeks back when he talked about the need to close the sky and and i mentioned this kristen because you mentioned it um and the issue with a no-fly zone is this that if there is a new fly zone established by the united states or by a nato partner someone must enforce that no-fly zone which means when there is a plane in the air someone must shoot it down shooting down a plane that is the act of aggression that draws nato into a military engagement uh and draws us into uh essentially a world war and so the united states has done it it's incredibly important things i'm very proud as an american i'm very proud of of every vote that i have taken to support the ukrainian people and to uh make clear that vladimir putin his regime and every single oligarch who enables it uh should be squeezed economically until uh they um until this war is over until the ukrainians win until it is clear that the authoritarian efforts the uh violence of this regime uh is is something that is denounced the world over um and and something we will not tolerate i was also proud to vote uh now ultimately united states is a net exporter of oil and gas but i was also proud to vote to say that we would not uh bring an import in any russian gas it was a small small percentage but it's a lot more than symbolic because it it started a trend and made sure that other nations knew that they too could could walk away from uh funding this sort of uh horrific uh genocidal war that the russians are are waging uh so the united states continues to be a close partner i'm sure that you've seen that um secretary of state lincoln and uh the secretary of defense austin traveled to keeve met with president zielinski uh the speaker of the house the chairman of the foreign affairs committee the chairman of the house intelligence committee um among some others traveled to kiev also to meet zielinski and to demonstrate the united states's ongoing uh consistent and heartfelt commitment uh and and one final note on this i i have the absolute privilege of representing um some incredible ukrainian americans in virginia seventh district whose hearts are breaking on a very personal level because of family loved ones uh and and people they grew up with back home who are impacted devastated or killed by this by this war um and in that sadness and fatigue and uh and horror they have doubled down in their support their humanitarian work and so i just on on behalf of um everyone i represent i just want to thank those who continued uh to to raise money and support uh and and help people in ukraine um particularly uh in in in light of their own fears and sadness about family members who are on the ground suffering all right thank you congresswoman next up we have yvonne from nottaway county and yvonne's got a question about high schools and community colleges while you're online yes i'm here hello congresswoman i'm doing fine how are you good to hear you we thank you for your service you are just absolutely wonderful my thank you ma'am i was i was justin not away a couple two weeks two weeks back or so how are you doing i'm doing well thank you um having been an educator for a number of years i'm always concerned with the welfare of students and i want to know has there been a discussion or if there will be a discussion again about how high school graduates being um at maybe the states or the government expense to go to a community college or a technical institute anyway something beyond high school where are we with that so i'm just going to ask one follow-up question because your phone blipped for just a moment were you talking about um uh like some of the initial proposals about community college and additional skills training uh federal support to that is that the question yeah okay so i i thank you for the question thank you for your work as an educator and certainly to any educator on the line thank you so much for your uh commitment to the next generation um and your commitment to educating uh the future of our our communities our our commonwealth in our country so uh i would want to mention two things um one i um i voted and i was proud to see it move forward increase dollar amounts uh to pell grants which is an important way that for some families who are pell eligible being able to utilize those funds to pay for community college two-year college four-year college is incredibly important i also continue to support expanded use of pell grants beyond just two-year and four-year colleges to technical training programs that require certification uh that require a a learned skill set uh but may not be a full degree program so that's one bucket and that's pell grant programs are typically need-based based on family income another effort that i've worked on is relates to 529 plans so those are the the programs that allow people to save for for college um without with with great tax relief and so i lead an effort to ensure that not only are those 529s eligible for four-year degree two-year degree but that they can also be utilized for shorter term certification programs like truck driving licensures and particular programs which right now if they are shorter in length if they don't meet certain hourly requirements uh for federal regulation they are not yet eligible so those are two places where i have been an advocate of making sure that you know students have whatever options appropriate for them it may be a two-year degree it may be a four-year degree or it may be training in a skill set um and in a in a profession that will allow them to you know be so focused on on being a strong uh part of our economy uh but not all of those uh jobs and skills uh require a longer degree program so those are two places where i'm working uh from a congressional standpoint where there has been some movement um and and uh there continue to be other conversations uh about larger uh programs specific to community colleges um but to answer your question those are the the kind of two active elements and and ones that i happen to be working on all right thank you as a quick reminder this forum is interactive and we would love to hear your questions if you have a question you can press star 3 on your keypad at any time to get into the queue to ask a question a member of congresswoman spanberger staff will collect your questions you can also ask the question by submitting one to the portal below our online streaming player at spanberger.house.gov again that's spamberger.house.gov forward slash live and if you're watching on facebook live tonight and wish to ask congresswoman spanberger a question we encourage you to visit that online streaming portal so you can submit your question and next up we are going to ask a question about medicare and the question is this is an online question is there any chance of congress passing a law to allow medicare to negotiate the price of prescription drugs this comes from iran ron thank you for this question um thank you for giving me an opportunity to talk about a topic that i love to talk about which is the fact that medicare is currently prohibited from negotiating the cost of its prescription drugs and that means that retirees throughout the country are impacted by the fact that medicare cannot negotiate legally prohibited by law from negotiating the cost of prescription drugs and so there have been multiple efforts i have co-led efforts i have voted for efforts in the house i have voted multiple times to allow medicare to negotiate the cost of prescription drugs i have worked on i have voted for legislation that would not only allow medicare to negotiate the cost of prescription drugs but would allow private insurers to utilize and leverage those negotiated prices this would impact families across the country this would impact people whether they're paying for medication every single month due to a chronic illness or whether or not from time to time they get a prescription and they are shocked at the prescription counter when they go to pick it up certainly i am passionate about this issue because it's an issue that i hear about non-stop no matter where i am i hear about the cost of prescription drugs the impact that it has on seniors on fixed incomes because medicare is not able to negotiate the cost of prescription drugs the impact that it has on families the impact that it has on people who are literally making choices about when they pick up their prescription because they can't necessarily afford their rent or their mortgage or their grocery bill at the same time that they're picking up the medication that they need to survive uh this is um has been a priority of mine since the day i got to congress and it will be a priority of mine for as long as i am in congress this is why a couple months back i brought the president to our district because i wanted to make sure that he heard directly from people i represent not for me but from people i represent about the impact that they feel because of the cost of prescription drugs and what it would mean for them if medicare could negotiate the cost of prescription drugs uh i was grateful that he was k that he came to the district and i was certainly even more grateful to every constituent who um who felt it their responsibility and their honor to be able to tell their story on behalf of others about what it means to not be able to pick up the the insulin that your child needs that your husband needs at the same time because you're worried about whether or not you can afford it all what it means when your wife in your golden years has an illness where the medication that she needs to stay alive is expensive and every single month you were thinking about what that means for your ability not just her ability to live but your ability for your family to to to exist to to to pay for food and housing and all of the other necessities of life and so i'm grateful to every constituent who shared their story with him i continue to advocate for this i continue to vote i continue to sponsor legislation uh and and i will keep on this until we see movement in both the house and the senate and send a bill to the president's desk but thank you for raising this issue ron it's one that i am very passionate about because it matters to people and when we're talking about the issues of gas prices and inflation and challenges that families are facing particularly as we are on our way back towards recovery after covid one of the greatest impacts on american families is the cost of prescription drugs and particularly for those who have chronic illnesses uh or life-threatening illnesses where that medication means the difference of whether their tomorrow exists or not so thank you for raising this issue uh it's one that i continue to be passionate about it's one that i continue to hear about from constituents and if you want to share your story please call our office please 804-401-4110 i welcome your stories because they are what keep me fueled and working on this issue thank you so all much let's go back to the phones now we have james from orange and james has a question about uh charging stations for electric cars james you're on live what is your question uh hi mr member i appreciate you taking the call um as a real person in virginia driving is really uh something that we're required to do every single day to go to jobs to go almost anywhere and so when i look at the impact on gasoline going all the way back to opec uh hurricane katrina the gulf wars and looking at what's going on in europe with ukraine it becomes very very clear to me that uh our reliance on on gasoline and oil at this point almost to the to the degree or to the detriment of everything else is causing us a lot of problems uh throwing us into large economic uh gaps and so my wife and i recently were looking at potentially trying to see if we could you know afford to get an electric car and one of the challenges that i see is that in rural areas there are almost no charging stations and that leaves you with having put a charging port in your home um so i was curious are there any federal incentives or any initiatives moving forward to try to support really getting stations out to the rural areas so that people have the opportunity to start making that move if something that they think is worth going toward a quick second question if you don't mind uh regarding the roe vs wade initiative um i remember that in 1999 we had a president that was brought before congress for impeachment trials because he lied before congress and i'm looking at what happened with the um neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh uh sessions in 2017 and 2018 and in both cases these both of these people stated that they considered crescent to be a matter of of stated and stable law in the supreme court um and while i don't like the fact that somebody uh wrote the secrecy in this supreme court uh justice thing i also have to say if this is the motion that goes forward should they not also be held for impeachment because their whole appointments were based on the fact that a number of people believe that they would actually support precedent thank you well thank you for these these two different questions and i'll address the second one first and then i'll go to the electrification electric vehicle issues uh certainly i would i would urge anyone on the call um who who might be curious about the the scope of james's question to look at some of the montages and the videos that are available and certainly they've been played on the news and they're available where it replays the questioning that some of our supreme court justices went through when they were before the united states senate where they stated very clearly uh an opinion that roe versus wade was settled law but it was an issue of uh precedent that starry decisis meant it couldn't be changed uh and and went on in quite a great amount of detail about that um i think that's the crux of james's question so for anyone who's been following along and trying to determine what they think of this uh current reality i i would recommend you watch that and make a decision for yourself uh certainly there have been multiple senators uh who both from the hearings that they participated in or witnessed as members of the united states senate in addition to private conversations there are um senators who are speaking openly about the fact that um that what was discussed with them that what was part of uh the confirmation hearings what was represented to them was not in fact uh from their opinion truth so i'll defer to those senators to continue discussing that um but certainly i think that james uh raises some important questions about uh one's truthfulness when they are under oath attesting to their opinions their beliefs and how they intend to do their job certainly confirmation hearings of supreme court justices are paramount to the choices that senators make as to whether or not they're confirmed as are the confirmation hearings of others who are serving in high-level positions in the executive branch as ambassadors as secretaries or deputy secretaries anyone who goes through that confirmation process who's sworn in under oath the purpose is that as they are being vetted and questioned that they would be truthful about how it is they intend to execute on the job that um that ultimately they may or may not be confirmed for so i think james raises some really important questions there and i'll be continuing uh certainly to listen to the senators who are speaking openly about the conversations that they had the impressions that they had and what was represented to them uh both through those hearings and in private meetings so pivoting over to the question about electric vehicles electric vehicle charging stations uh there's two things that i would point you to james one in the bipartisan infrastructure investment and jobs act there were significant investments made in electric vehicle charging station infrastructure and uh in your question you mentioned uh the instability that exists in the world you had mentioned uh the invasion of ukraine by russia and frankly we have a real need in the united states to ensure that we are not dependent on petroleum state autocrats and autocracies throughout the world be it russia saudi arabia venezuela iran the countries that do source so much oil throughout the world are countries that frankly the united states within our national security priorities should be working to ensure that we are uh fully able to be independent and distanced from any uh of the bad actors who are among those uh petro state um uh autocracies um that uh uh that are out of sync with uh certainly with our country on so many levels uh but where we can demonstrate leadership as a country is in the national security driven pursuit of energy independence uh and we do that at with our at home production certainly we are ultimately a net uh producer of oil and gas but we do that by also harnessing the power of renewable energy uh and by utilizing electric vehicles uh which are a great option for so many families and so in the bipartisan infrastructure investment and jobs act there were major investments in creating a network and supporting the creation of a network of electric vehicle charging stations and i would note that this is um different from a gas station right so a gas station you want to put a gas station in the ground you build you build a gas station you dig a hole you put the tank in you can fill it up of course there's permitting and there's building issues and construction et cetera but you can be a stand-alone entity the issues with electric vehicle charging stations is that you are pulling electricity from the grid so that impact has an impact on the electrical grid around where the around where those charging stations may be so there's a real value and importance uh in this involvement from department of transportation from the federal government in supporting the development and growth of electric vehicle charging stations and so there's uh significant investments uh meant to ensure a strong network across the country uh certainly on large traveled routes and also within our rural communities but then i would point to a particular program uh the rural electrification for america program uh i call it reap most of the time so i hope i got the acronym right which this is a program that is a federal program to bring renewable energy to rural communities and i am leading an effort to ensure that this program can be utilized for electric vehicle charging station installations because for so many people within our rural communities who as you mentioned jim frequently do have very long commutes um if they're not working on the farm or they're not working uh in in the local community uh to be able to uh ensure if they choose to drive an electric vehicle to know that they have that charging mechanism either at their home or in their community is important also as more and more individuals regardless of where they live do move to electric vehicles it's important from a tourism standpoint it's important from a travel standpoint so that people may travel to beautiful rural virginia uh and certainly orange and other places um in our district are major tourist destinations and so to be able to ensure that that economic uh driver continues to be such and can um can accommodate both uh those who live in the county and might choose to drive an electric vehicle uh but also can be helpful uh to uh ensuring that uh tourists can can come and visit our beautiful countryside charge up their vehicles and then go home is important part of this so the reap program is is a beneficial program it's valuable to farmers and producers and rural communities uh and economies and ensuring that if the rural electrification also allows for um the program dollars also allows for use in electric vehicle charging station infrastructure uh is a modification to the program that i'm leading legislatively so um in process james that's the the bottom line related to your questions uh in process to try and make sure that we're bringing this infrastructure to the whole country um but uh but i'm i am working on it and i thank you for for raising it i've heard about it from constituents which why which is why it's something that i'm working on so i'm glad to have uh additional feedback from you on this issue

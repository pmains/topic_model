Thank You mr. chairman I'm here and Thank You secretary Cooper for your time and certainly for your service and also it's at the beginning when we were all casually talking your offer to to bring this committee together in a closed and classified setting so I appreciate that very very much and I think would do much good because I'm much agree with my friends across the aisle and and and colleagues on this side of the aisle that that often times what happens over the CBC's is your name so while I understand the strategic imperative to to reassure regional partners standing against an aggressive Iran I am seeking to better understand the administration's decision I think we all are to sidestep normal processes especially giving ongoing reports frankly of Saudi human rights abuses very important to me Russia remains sir the largest arms supplier or to the strategically important asia-pacific region how do the pending arms sales to partners in the Middle East affect long-term efforts to convince asia-pacific countries to buy American Thank You congressman Wagner I actually just came back from South Asia and there was some honest if not difficult conversations with partners about their current status there wanting to have a more deep fulsome relationship with the United States however they needed to find ways to off-ramp some legacy requirements or legacy equipping from say Russia earlier in this hearing I referenced in my testimony cats of sanctions right that is that's a tool that is a tool that Congress provided the administration it is certainly a tool that's available in any of our partnerships again being in an open floor I don't want to go into detail where we're we're we're looking for that to be applied but it is certainly something that having that as a tool factors in our discussions and negotiations bilaterally well I'm sorry to know that you were there and that you're having these discussions and I look forward to perhaps a more detail and that in that regard so if as you mentioned in your testimony none of the sails would alter the military balance of power in a region why are emergency procedures necessary mr. secretary yeah again as noted these were not new sails we're not introducing new technology new capabilities what made it an emergency was a confluence of these conditions so when one looks at the conditions not just on where our partners are or were they assess we are there was the immediacy of the threat streams emanating from Iran so the direct threats not only to our interest but to our partners as well a couple that the being able to reassure our partners that we're still with them and then also add to the layer also referred to here earlier of sending a message to our near-peer adversaries that do not take advantage of the current threat posture in the region we are standing with our partners cemetery Cooper you explained in your testimony that China and Russia are I believe you call them secondary audiences for mais notification can you explain how the emergency notification advantages the United States in competition with Russia and China yes thank you Russia and China are extremely aggressive in their advocacy for sale pushing their arms emissions to to anybody they usually do it at a cut price cut rate they certainly don't do it in a transparent fashion the way we do it it is unique that the United States arms transfer process by statute and by policy is done in such a transparent fashion not only for our accountability to the taxpayer but also our accountability to a partner who were investing in we also as I mentioned have a long what I'd say tale of support our sales that is not replicated by our near peer adversaries we provide not just training sustainment or with them along the way and it's important to factor in in that training is a statement it's inclusive of human rights rule of armed conflict making sure that our partners are using these systems in a way that we would find appropriate from our standards sending that message to our near peer adversaries is to say do not take advantage of a situation in a particular conflict area and by no means think that we're stepping away from a partner who were working with who is only protecting their sovereignty in their region they are carrying equities on our behalf on behalf of American national security thank you for your time and your service my time is expired mr. Chairman I yield back I look forward to our further discussions

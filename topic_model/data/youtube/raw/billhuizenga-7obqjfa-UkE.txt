hi this is congressman bill Huizenga and wanted to talk to you today about a very special day in our nation's history Memorial Day you know it's something that we've been celebrating since the end of the Civil War and has special meaning to me as the grandson of a world war one veteran the son of a disabled world war two veteran and I think it we all have had people in our lives whether it's a father or a mother or uncle or aunt cousins we've all been affected by this and I want to just make sure that we all take the time on monday to say thank you to them tell them what we appreciate it i recently just had the opportunity to visit our troops in iraq and kuwait and i got to tell you when we say thank you they they hear us they appreciate it and we can't say thank you enough to them and their families that are serving so as you're going to be out and around on monday i'll be out there as well we'll be doing a number of parades and some some ceremonies please visit the moving wall on veterans in fruitport and I just hope you have a good day but let's remember those veterans and if he can take time at three o'clock there will be a moment of silence and I hope you have a good weekend

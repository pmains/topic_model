hearing that employers are allegedly asking for applicants Facebook passwords during job interviews senators Richard Blumenthal and Chuck Schumer are urging Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate whether the request is a violation of federal law and joining us this morning with more insight is Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut good morning sir thanks for joining us thank you so you are asking the EEOC's Department of Justice to look into basically the constitutionality of this practice of asking applicants for their passwords we're asking both the department justice and the Equal Opportunity Commission to investigate whether this practice violates existing law but I believe there is a need to strengthen and clarify the law to prevent this really unnecessary and unreasonably invasive procedure practices like this one are very much akin to asking someone for the keys to his or her house and then rummaging through file these photos other documents and there are sufficient means available through the public realm I am very encouraged by the decision of Spotsylvania County Sheriff's Office to reassess or suspend this practice which I think indicates a realization that there really are legally problematic aspects to it in fact that just coming down that the Sheriff's Department there will suspend this practice you're writing a bill that would indeed address this because it seems to me senator that so much of this is unchartered with all of this new social media you're trying to put an end to that with a bill when one of the two relevant federal statutes was written in 1986 Mark Zuckerberg the inventor of facebook was two years old and many of these laws state sometimes when the internet was barely imaginable so we need to update and upgrade the law to protect people against coercion and really when you think about it if you're applying for a job in this economy and the prospective employer asks you for a password or login information you have really no choice but to give it if you want that job and it threatens not just the individual who is applying for the job but other people loved ones family friends who may be communicating privately with the expectation of privacy and communicating to you some of the most intimate details of their life and then that information goes to the employer when you surrender your password or login information so it has very pervasive widespread ramifications your bill sir would have some exceptions can you tell us about what those exceptions would be exceptions for law enforcement if someone is dealing with children in positions of trust or national security if there is a defense contractor or the defense department itself there is an arrow and I am site narrow range jobs that require further background checks the FBI for example but it ought to be now right and you have been quoted before we let you go sir saying that this practice is an unreasonable invasion of privacy for people seeking work I think you addressed that but this can be sometimes a very desperate a group of people just looking for work in these tough times tough times when people have no choice but to provide a password or login information which may create dangers of breach which has happened in the past or discrimination so there are lots of dangers here a bill really is necessary new law to protect people against is unreasonable and

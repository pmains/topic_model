thank you very much mr. speaker thank you for arranging for this beautiful ceremony today in honor of Donald Payne thank you so much for bringing us together in such a beautiful way to Donald's family I hope it is a comfort to you that so many people share your grief and are praying for you at this sad time and that Donald is being honored in so many different ways he was in life and now with his passing the the fact that the president of the United States Bill Clinton and members of President Obama's cabinet were present with their assistant leader mr. Clyburn at his funeral the fact that we are under the dome of the capitol of the United States and the vice president of the United States is here to sing the praises of Donald Payne as well as an outpouring from his colleagues and house and in the Senate I hope that is a comfort to you I just want to share with you a couple other tributes that may not be well-known to many of you here on March 19th when we observe st. Patrick's Day because was on the Saturday and so we observed it on Monday there was a big dinner the IRA merican Ireland fund dinner huge dinner hundreds of people turned at the Prime Minister the teashop of Ireland was there and when the head of ours when our representative Ritchie Neil spoke as did Peter King Richie devoted his entire comments to Donald Payne in this big Irish festive festival there was a huge as big as the wall picture of Donald Payne and the crowd cheered wildly wildly as as both mr. Kingman especially ratita spoke about what he did to help the people of Northern Ireland wasn't it a beautiful tribute down it was beautiful that was a couple of weeks as we know after his passing I want to tell you about one an incident that happened a few years ago we want a delegation the Donald health deranged and lead a to Darfur and to Africa it was it was very emotional for all of us but as with anything you did with Donald you were better prepared when you went that are received when you got there and better able to help when you left whether it was the alleviation of poverty eradication of disease promotional piece ending violence protecting human rights you name it but this trip we were going to Darfur and other catcher Sudan and other countries in Africa and Donald helped arrange everything but when we were going to Khartoum he said I'm not going and you remember this maxi then I'm not going he's and I said well why but you you know you're our leader he said they're not going to tell you the truth I already know that I'm not going to give them that opportunity but you have to find out for yourselves which we did then we max on that trip it done went we visited it wasn't just about visiting heads of states and parliamentarians heads of states and parliamentarians it was about visiting people in HIV aids clinics to see the care they were receiving it's about visiting women working in sweat oh it was about learning about the country but I want to tell you about this one incident because I'm reminded of it today when so many people are saying is that Donald Payne and I'm referencing people singing the praises of Donald Payne who aren't even here today we were in Liberia mr. Kaiba you remember this very well we're in Liberia and there was a big celebration of dedicating a library to congressman Donald Payne for his leadership and we're there and I am Telling You it was very hot they gave us dashikis to wear so was even hotter every person who spoke and believe me the leadership of the world turned to that was after Sirleaf john president so Johnson had already honored that Donald and the rest of us at an event but all the focus is always on Donald but anyway would go to this this library dedication at the AME college in Monrovia boiling hot everybody turned out to honor Donald a long list of speakers and every person who spoke mr. vice president you'll recognize this mr. speaker every person who spoke said what an honor was to be on the program with everybody who spoke before you've been to those events until you know where they're like 1920 speakers but get to halfway through and one gentlemen distinguished gentleman gets up and he says to all of the speakers who spoke before me and will come next Honours granted and it brought out the biggest smile on Donald Payne space a picture that you see on the program has twinkly eyes that beautiful smile that is obviously a family trait there's obviously a family trait but ever they wanted to outdo each other in praising him but acknowledging everyone there too he was so wonderful and there's so much to be said about him it's really a personal loss to so many of us and so when a colleague passes away it's sad it's a loss in that there's very very personal with many members and I just want to recall since mr. cleaver introduced the idea that we can speak religiously here today of a prayer that is posted on the wall by a presbyterian African bishop in Africa and I think it applies to Donald very well in the prayer that should says when at long last I will happily go to meet my Maker he will say to me show me your wounds and if I have no wounds I will say to him I have known and he will say to me was there nothing worth fighting for that was Donald he fought for poor people he fought for people all over the world I mentioned that we mentioned Africa that's 10 in mesh in Northern Ireland but all over the world nope North this whole hemisphere he took loans this is hard to make that fight he was challenging the status quo especially to end violence promote peace that's why it was my honor to name him to be a representative to the united nations general assembly one time is the way it goes but for Donald it was two times because his contribution was so valuable we saved from time to time but it's never truer than today got truly blessed America with a life leadership and service of our precious Donald Payne thank you

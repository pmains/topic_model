republican congressman from florida michael waltz uh congressman thank you i don't know if you heard our conversation um and i know you've addressed some of these issues already in florida and kind of put them to bed uh but what are your thoughts here well i think this is a this is a big win for voter integrity uh it's a win for restoring confidence in our elections and it's yet another roll back of the whole myriad of changes uh that were put in place under the guise of covid uh that seemed to benefit benefit one side versus the other for example drop boxes unsupervised were used heavily in uh and around philadelphia but not out in the more rural suburbs in uh in pennsylvania so this is yet another step forward but uh you know as your reporter just mentioned we still have a long way to go because people can still harvest uh by mail and then finally i would say look i hear from uh certainly my constituents and conservatives and others concerned about voter integrity all the time and asking what is the congress doing about it and i can tell you for certain under nancy pelosi you don't want congress doing anything about it and constitutionally the state legislatures are charged setting the terms for elections uh and we are seeing forward movement in texas in georgia now here uh through the courts in wisconsin uh in other states uh and i think we absolutely have to restore confidence uh in our election yeah that's what it's all about you just have to have faith that the the people who vote their vote is counted and that's just everybody has to have faith in that so that you can believe in the results okay i wanted to get your reaction to this story effective today forty thousand national guard and twenty two thousand reserve soldiers who refuse to get the covet vaccine are no longer allowed to participate in their military duties and lost their pay and their benefits now this comes at a time military struggling to reach recruitment goals your former green beret as i recall what is uh what are your thoughts on this yeah i'm also still serving uh in in the national guard look this is uh this is an absolute blow to the military's readiness we are heavily dependent on the national guard and reserves just in the last few years hurricanes wildfires national social unrest of course coveted vaccine deployment and they have to train and be ready for their overseas deployments while still holding a civilian job and you'll hear proponents of this say well this is all about law and order and good order and discipline and you can't have soldiers picking and choosing what shots you have to take but we all they they we all know that there's a real gray area here this vaccine was developed under emergency use uh they're still lacking long-term research and the big difference now is that uh since it doesn't stop the spread even though we were promised that by falchi and others it's an individual health decision and therefore you're not infecting or one way or another your unit and your fellow soldiers to your left and your right at the end of the day the military is way overreaching and this is in the midst of china's biggest built military buildup yeah modern modern history how ironic given that's where this virus came from now now i have a military in the family and i have friends in the pentagon and as you know a a majority of them will say you're in the army it's not a democracy if the army says you have to get the shot you have to get the shot yeah and look that's absolutely right but they also have to make uh decisions and way risks that makes sense and if you're looking at 20 of your entire national guard when you can't recruit to fill certain numbers then you have to weigh that versus what is the vaccine doing to maintain readiness calculation all i'm seeing is this all or nothing ideological heavy-handed approach uh because there's this is politics at play here and so this is i'm on the armed services committee we're going to fight this and get to the bottom of it make them explain this decision all right good enough glad to have the conversation congressman michael waltz thank you sir

welcome back we're here with representative karen bass sonny yes congresswoman you wrote the george floyd justice and policing act that was passed in the house but is now stalled in the senate senate democrats rejected the republican police reform bill that was written by senator tim scott we've seen protests across this country for the past month demanding police reform what needs to be done to make sure a bill can be agreed on by both sides is passed and signed into law well most definitely we need the senate to act and you know that is one of 200 bills that is sitting on mitch mcconnell's desk that's actually a bipartisan bill it was no small matter that we had all of the democrats vote for that bill and frankly if it wasn't for the hundreds of thousands of people out protesting i don't believe that would have happened and we even got a few republicans two days after trump tweeted and told him not to do that so we are working to get the senate to bring it up but at the same time conversations are going on with republicans i'll tell you i had never had an experience like that before where my republican colleagues in committee uh when we were voting talked about everything under the sun but the bill and so i took that as a positive and they came up to me afterwards and said you know karen i really think we can get somewhere on this issue and i won't stop talking to people i don't care who it is but mainly talking to my republican colleagues to see if there's something that we can do i did i do have a relationship with tim we came in together before he went over to the senate and so i want to keep the conversations going with a situation like this as you know it can take us 30 years or 30 days to come up with a bill now we're only going to be in session for another couple of weeks but there is still time for the senate to act or for tim scott to come up with a new bill that would be more uh what would be better for the senate democrats to vote on congresswoman we were talking earlier in the show about congressman yoho yelling at congresswoman alexandria ocasio-cortez and the deep sexism that is not only in politics but still obviously permeates our culture what do you think about that you obviously have i'm sure have some experience with it but why are we still living in a time when men still think that they have agency to say such things about women well i think they still struggle with with who we are and our positions and she's so high profile i will tell you the second that that happened i searched her out went and talked to her immediately all the women gathered around her and we demanded that there be an apology and so i know that yoho apologized today we don't think that's enough we're not finished but i want you to know that we all surrounded her immediately as well as a number of the men i do feel bad for my republican colleagues especially the republican women because megan you know there's only a handful of them i mean there's 199 republicans and there's about maybe 14 women and so i'm doing legislation right now bipartisan legislation on women who are pregnant and incarcerated and i went to the republican women and had a really hard time getting them to be supportive of the bill it was easier for me to get republican men and so i worry about what goes on in their caucus now it broke out a little bit yesterday with with liz cheney but uh they especially are not used to dealing with women in the democratic side you know there's over 100 of us and so the democratic men and we're led by nancy pelosi so the dynamic on the democratic side is a little different not saying it's perfect but it is a little different that would exist on the republican side at the end of the day they're still men right they're still men so um we all have to deal with men so you know um trump deployed federal troops to portland uh the other day oregon to control black lives matter protesters and just this week he threatened to send troops to other cities like chicago new york philadelphia detroit and oakland now some things some people think that maybe this is a rehearsal for him on how he'll try to disrupt the election in november he's already explicitly said he may not be willing to uh to accept the results if he loses how do you feel about that and how can we stop him from continuously sending these troops into our cities for only disrupting it even further well the problem that we have is that he's a lawless president i mean we're going to have hearings about it in several different committees he clearly wants to be an authoritarian leader but i think when it comes to the results of the election he can try not to leave but our system just doesn't work that way if he needs to be evicted i have full confidence that he would be removed from that oval office well you know it's going to be an exciting fall that's all i can think we thank you representative karen vance it's good to see you again and keep on fighting a good fight we'll be right back

chairman Castro members of our Hispanic Caucus we together reflect the American story and that's the story of immigrants past and immigrants present all of us have that heartfelt view from the codicil of what has made America great we're here today to talk about the impacts of what I believe is the most anti-immigrant administration in modern history of America and let's be clear as my colleagues have stated already this has a lot more to do with the politics of this president in getting reelected than solving the problems the problems at our border the humanitarian crisis that they have largely created but we've been through this before last year the administration ordered ice to deliver over 5,000 I nine audit notices to businesses across the country to match the w-2 forms now audit is just a nice word for a term raid it's it's it's is what it is it's a raid and we've seen this throughout our country it's ironic that this Sunday a day normally held for religious services that we will have federal agents in major American cities creating more fear instead of solving problems but their goal is the same and that's to perpetrate this anti-immigrant policy to play on the politics of fear and to stoke fear in our immigrant communities let me give you a local flavor because we all represent different constituencies I represent the wonderful people of Fresno Madera and Merced counties a very rural part of California a lot of the breadbasket of our a lot of agricultural production and so where this impacts is our campesinos these men and women who work hard every day to put food on America's dinner table and the fear that is expressed I can say it best in a town hall that we had last week in Los Pinos with secretary Perdue the Secretary of Agriculture and a farmer friend still though Bostick asks the question of the Secretary of Agriculture Joe de bostic's parents were farm workers he lived the American dream was able to go to college and now as a farmer he says mr. secretary do you realize the anti-immigration policies that your administration is pursuing is creating fear in our rural communities like we've never seen before in my district because of these raids we have so many other impacts to these hard-working families and many of the families have members that are documented and those that are undocumented last year we had a meeting of of Packers processors and one of the business person see this picture Jim this is Madea Madea has worked in my in our operations for 12 years she came to me last week and she says mister I am NOT going to be able to come to work because we understand your facility is going to be audited or a raid will take place I have a home in Parlier California that I am so proud of that we bought and some of my family members are here illegally and some are not and I cannot risk the the chance that I could be deported that's the story let's be clear this is what's happening these raids do nothing to help resolve the crisis at our border or provide any solutions to our broken immigration system instead of spending resources to round up people peacefully living in our communities the overwhelming majority that are hardworking folks there wanting to live the American Dream the dream of immigrants past and immigrants present we should not be using them to attack a problem that is really not of their making the issue of the refugee crisis we know is in the Central American countries and we ought to be working with our neighbor Mexico and and and to solve the problems there of the humanitarian crisis so while we provide assistance to other countries we are not providing assistance to deal with the humanitarian crisis here at home what this administration fails to recognize and appreciate is that we are a nation of immigrants past and present so what we should be doing instead of these divisive policies is really working together on a bipartisan effort for comprehensive immigration reform that's what we should be doing immigrants are contributing members of our communities here to build a better future for themselves and their families this chaotic and divisive policies must stop by this administration mr. president show us that you really care and let the better angels inside you be demonstrated in working with us to solve problems and not spread fear throughout our urban and rural communities in America which is gracias my colleague a good friend from California who I've worked with both in Sacramento and here in Washington took us to the San Ysidro border last year and pointed out the challenges were facing congressman Juan Vargas knows this challenge very well

thank you very much director currency first of all like to thank you um for listening to me and some other members of this committee in regards to the merger potential of arizona and new mexico that would have been a disaster so we really appreciated your september 11th 2015 letter that said that that would not go through so thank you so now let's get back to the budget so you ask for 88 million dollars for new federal land acquisitions now only 17 of land held private is held privately in arizona and it's even worse in nevada the federal government already owns more than 650 million acres people back home in arizona are sick of the land grab from your agency now the congressional research service has informed my office that they could only find one blm report from 1997 entitled lands potentially available for disposal and that report was authored because of the direction from congress so my question to you is how much land does blm currently own that is potentially available for disposal well congressman i appreciate the question and i really struggle with the term land grab right i don't really know well i don't know you know my question is is how much land we can dispute that all you want but i'm after our question here about what how much land you have for disposal and what is that inventory how much is it yeah so we will i don't have that you don't know today we will work to provide that to you but at one point on the land of water conservation fund willing sellers right we're only working with willing sellers well we're not we're not using that my point there is once again if we want to get in a tick for tax we should have we had a huge problem that needs modification in that process and it's disdainful that we actually put money in that program without without having meaningful reforms that's something wrong here and i'm going to get to that question here in just a second so hold that tight so you don't know um so what you do is every year you come here in front of congress asking for new acquisitions when do you think i can have that inventory we'll have to get back to you as soon as we can after this hearing but we're going to follow again i'm going to okay sure okay i see how we're trying to misdirect this i would expect as soon as possible a list of all lands for inventory for disposal if this this is a two-way street and it should be a two-way street okay uh we're asking the the bureau of reclamation for that inventory it's a bipartisan ask and it it is fundamental for this congress to do its work by having that inventory so just as an fyi the meaningful part i want taken away i want that inventory and i want every year from now on when we come for an ask that we have an inventory of land that is subject for disposal back to states and back to communities is that agreed we will be happy to provide you what we have in it but i do want to put a small caveat that when we make our land use plans we very often will look at a broad sweep and say at a high level 100 000 foot level these lands could be available for disposal so just because they show up on a list that we know that's perfectly fine because the starts of the discussion because that's the discussion we better have could be okay so now you testified that federal cold resources will continue to be an important component of the nation's energy mix yesterday secretary jewell tried to claim the obama administration's war on coal doesn't really exist and that's a joke if you were all really concerned about taxpayers receiving a fair return for the sale of coal as you stated in your testimony then your administration wouldn't have blocked all new coal leases on federal lands by executive order last year the blm and taxpayers received 20.9 million dollars for three new leases of federal land for coal correct well on your point about we're not blocking all the leases okay let's go back to my question my question to you was we need to stay focused taxpayers received 20.9 million dollars for three new leases last year true or false that sounds accurate okay and what will be the return for new leases this year well we uh i don't know this is what i was trying to correct earlier we are not blocking all new lease sales so there there is a long list so what's the number then i believe there are 18 projects that are able to still move forward so so there's about 7 billion tons 20 years of supply that is already in industry hands there's another three to four years of supply that's going to continue can continue moving through the system but i'll tell you the understanding but it's a streamlining issue about about money because i mean when you start looking at royalty rates i mean those are lifebloods for western states but coal coal lease sales have gone down because industry has asked us to stop leasing right we have major projects in the powder river basin not in montana but in in wyoming where companies have said that project is ready to go but we would prefer that you put that on the shelf we want to see how the market dynamics are going to play out oh i so we have billy i would i would absolutely give that to you you know in that aspect but it's been kind of a lot of the forces coming out of this administration in regards to war on coal i mean when you don't have a marketplace uh uh you know and how many coal plants have actually closed their doors um over the last several years so absolutely the market forces but they're being driven by this administration saying listen we're predisposing one energy source or several other sources over a predominantly past one i mean i would think natural gas is probably the biggest competitor to coal i think that's just a matter of the market forces that came from within that this administration never piloted natural gas i'm sorry they may have done other sources but not natural gas that's not a claim that this administration can make so i yield back

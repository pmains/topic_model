mr president i'm very pleased to be here on the senate floor with my friend and colleague from minnesota senator klobuchar as we introduce an important resolution this month mr president is national alzheimer's awareness month alzheimer's is a terrible disease that exacts a tremendous personal and economic toll on both the individual and the family like many families mine has experienced the pain of alzheimer's i know that there is no more helpless feeling than to watch the progression of this devastating disease it is equally painful to witness the emotional and physical damage inflicted on family caregivers exhausted by an endless series of 36-hour days moreover alzheimer's is the only cause of death among the top 10 in our nation without a way to prevent it to cure it or even to slow its progression more than 5 million americans have alzheimer's disease more than doubled the number in 1980 based on current projections as many as 16 million americans over the age of 65 will have alzheimer's by the year 2050. in addition to the tremendous human suffering it causes alzheimer's costs the united states more than 200 billion dollars a year including 142 billion dollars in cost to the medicare and medicaid programs this price tag mr president will increase exponentially as the baby boomer generation ages if we fail to change the current trajectory of alzheimer's disease our country will not only face a mounting public health crisis but an economic one as well if nothing is done to slow or stop this disease the alzheimer's association estimates that alzheimer's will cost our country an astonishing 20 trillion dollars over the next 40 years it is estimated that nearly one in two of baby boomers reaching age 85 will develop alzheimer's as a consequence chances are that the members of the baby boom generation will either be spending their golden years suffering from alzheimer's or caring for someone who has it in many ways alzheimer's has become the defining disease of this generation if we are to prevent alzheimer's from becoming the defining disease of the next generation it is imperative that we dramatically increase our investment in alzheimer's disease research according to a study commissioned by the national institute on aging alzheimer's and other dementias cost the united states more than cancer and heart disease this study finds that both the costs and number of people with dementia will more than double within 30 years skyrocketing at a rate that rarely occurs with a chronic disease at a time when the cost to medicare and medicaid of caring for alzheimer's patient exceeds 140 billion dollars a year we are spending only slightly more than 500 million dollars on alzheimer's research spending 142 billion dollars under medicare and medicaid more than 200 billion dollars overall and yet only 500 million on research we currently spend six billion dollars a year for cancer research 3 billion dollars a year for research on hiv aids and 2 billion dollars for cardiovascular research and i want to emphasize that those are all worthy investments investments that have paid dividends in terms of better treatments cures in some cases prolonged lives than others surely we can do more for alzheimer's given the tremendous human and economic price of this devastating disease the national plan to address alzheimer's disease was authorized by bipartisan bipartisan law passed in 2010 the national alzheimer's project act which i authored would then senator evan bayh the national plan has as its primary goal to prevent and effectively treat alzheimer's by the year 2025 the chairman of the advisory council on alzheimer's research care and services which was created by the national alzheimer's project act has testified before congress that the united states must devote at least two billion dollars a year to alzheimer's research to achieve that goal i'm therefore joining with my colleague from minnesota senator klobuchar in introducing this resolution declaring that the goal of preventing and effectively treating alzheimer's by 2025 is an urgent national priority our resolution recognizes that dramatic increases in research funding are necessary to meet that goal and results that the senate will strive to double the amount of funding that the united states spends on alzheimer's research in fiscal year 2015 and then develop a plan to meet the target of two billion dollars a year over the next five years just think of the figures here mr president we're spending some 212 billion dollars a year treating caring for people with alzheimer's all we're asking is that over the next five years we achieved the goal that the alzheimer's council a council of experts in alzheimer's including experts from the mayo clinic and senator klobuchar's home state have recommended that we spend two billion dollars two billion dollars it's such a tiny percentage of the amount that we're spending so this is a worthy investment it's one that will not only relieve suffering save lives potentially but it will also more than pay for itself thank you mr president i would urge our colleagues to join us as co-sponsors i would also ask unanimous consent that letters from the alzheimer's association and the us against alzheimer's group both the predominant national advocacy groups endorsing our resolution be included in the record at the conclusion of my statement thank you mr president i'm very pleased that my colleague senator klobuchar who's been such a leader in this area has joined me on the senate floor and i would yield the floor to her mr

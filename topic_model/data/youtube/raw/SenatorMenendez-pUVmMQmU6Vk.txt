uh thank you Mr chairman congratulations to all the nominees uh the collapse of several crypto asset platforms uh this year has highlighted the growing economic risks of unregulated digital assets we've also seen the potential for contagion when these firms collapse under the weight of risky behavior and bring down other firms with them as an example last week new jersey-based crypto lender blocked by filed for bankruptcy due to its exposure to FTX if digital assets become further integrated with the traditional economy and financial system that contagion risk could be Amplified so Mr Hill and Mr mckernan uh if confirmed how will you ensure that fdic's supervised institutions are shielded from inappropriate risk in the digital assets assets space Senator I I guess I'd I'd start by saying I think it's important to distinguish between different types of crypto related activities that Banks can potentially involve get involved in I think there's a big difference between a bank providing custody services for crypto related activity versus a bank using its balance sheet to engage in speculative Investments but I think generally the responsibility of the FDIC and the other banking agencies is to ensure that to the extent activities are legally permissible that they're done in a safe and sound way Mr McKenna Senator if it confirmed my uh the way I would approach crypto related activities within the uh banking system is really threefold first uh any crypto related activities at a FDIC regulated Bank need to be performed in a safe and sound manner uh second those activities need to be in compliance with consumer protection and other law and third the activities can't pose a risk to financial stability I maybe might just amplify a bit the the second Point compliance with law uh I'd want to study this issue further if confirmed but as I understand it there are some significant open questions as to what is a permissible activity when it comes to crypto at a bank so I think that's something I'd want to understand better and and second uh I do think there is a role for the market Regulators to play in continuing to define the rules of the road in this space and the banks will need to similarly comply with that law but at a high level it's about safety and soundness compliance with law and risk of financial stability all right in order to manage this risk it's important for Congress to have as much information as possible in April the FDIC issued a financial institution letter directing its supervisors to notify the FDIC of any activity they currently engage in or intend to engage in related to crypto assets Mr Gruenberg will you commit to keeping Congress up to date on the findings of your research and the integration of digital assets into the traditional Financial system yes Senator thank you I appreciate the caution FDIC has thus far shown with regard to digital assets and I expect the nominees before us today to continue the scrutiny if you are confirmed chair Gruenberg Mr Hill Mr McKeon and the latest data from the FDIC shows that just four percent of the agency's executive managers are Hispanic virtually the same number as the year before furthermore the agency employs employs the lowest number of Hispanics relative to other Regulators such as the OCC and the ncua both in overall Workforce and in senior positions this is a community that has a 1.8 trillion dollar domestic Marketplace impact it needs to be represented in our financial institutions so why has the FDIC lag behind its counterparts and hiring Hispanic and Latino staff and Leadership Senator if I'm you raise a very important point that has been a focus of attention and priority for us as a general matter among minority employees the FDIC has generally been at or above the civilian labor force but that has not been the case for Hispanic employees we've been significantly below as as you pointed out and for for us that has been a focus of attention in terms of our efforts to ensure diversity and inclusion at the FDIC earlier this year we established at the FDIC and interdivisional task force focused on Hispanic employment because it really is within our diversity issues that most significant Challenge and we are focusing in particular on Recruitment and hiring as well as a training and promotion at the agency and I assure you this will be an ongoing priority and we will be glad ahead to stay in touch with you and your staff for the senator has been for some time um and you know the problem is we'd make no progress so I hear all the things about you know we're going to recruit we're going to do this we're going to but we make no progress so I'd like to ask the three nominees to the FDIC are you committed to having a diverse Workforce and will you work to achieve it if you are confirmed yes senator yes senator yes Senator and Mr chairman with your Indulgence a very quick question uh provincial question to Dr McLean um under previous administrations HUD removed key multi-family housing staff from its office in Newark transfer them to the New York regional office HUD has not had a regional a region to administrator from New Jersey in over a quarter of a century now as a former mayor in the state legislature I know that presents a challenge for residents and property owners and managers New York and New Jersey have very different housing needs and issues so it's critical that we have HUD staff in the state that are familiar with our unique needs will you ensure confirm that the Newark office has the staff it needs and New Jersey remains a priority at Hutton foreign thank you for the question I understand that this has been an ongoing conversation between your staff and head and we it also came up in my conversation with yourself if confirmed I'm committed to continuing to work with you and your staff on the issue surrounding New Jersey and we'll make that a priority as we continue to move forward okay continuing the work is nice but making a difference is nicer I've said this to the secretary who I was very supportive of uh if if it continues that we don't have the appropriate staff in New Jersey then I will not support future HUD nominees no matter how qualified they are thank you very much

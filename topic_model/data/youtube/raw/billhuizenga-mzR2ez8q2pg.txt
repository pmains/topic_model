to amend the federal deposit insurance act with respect to information provided to the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection pursuant to the rule the gentlelady from Illinois mrs. biggert and the gentleman from Texas mr. green each will control 20 minutes the chair recognizes the gentlelady from Illinois Mr Speaker I ask unanimous consent that all members may have five legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and to add extraneous material on this bill without objection mr. speaker at this time I would like to yield to the sponsor of this bill the gentleman from Arizona chigan I always do that Michigan mr. Huizenga for such time as he may consume the gentleman from Michigan is recognized Thank You mr. speaker and to my colleague might not have been the right state but it was the right pronunciation that doesn't happen often so thank you and mr. speaker the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau a massive new branch of government created under the dodd-frank act fails to safeguard proprietary information given to the bureau by regulated entities I rise today in support of my bill HR 4014 which will create more peace of mind for financial institutions while offering more oversight and consumer protections to hard-working taxpayers if you remember one thing remember this we all agree on stringent consumer protections this bill is a common-sense measure that adds necessary oversight to the bureau specifically HR 4014 would immediately close a loophole in the law that was created under the creation of the CFPB currently information collected by the CFPB from financial institutions is not protected by the same confidentiality provisions that other financial regulators are required to provide additionally we must ensure parity between state bank supervisors and other state regulatory agencies that oversee non banks at the state level and make sure that they are afforded the same protections we need a real solution to ensure that privileged information will not be intentionally disclosed to any third party HR 4014 would protect that data that depository and non depository institutions provide during an oversight exam therefore enhancing the bureau's supervision process and giving financial institutions the much needed certainty and the information that the information will be kept private unlike current statutes regarding other federal agencies accessing revelant relevant information the dodd-frank act failed to provide such protections despite the CFPB's claim that they won't or wouldn't share such information the simple truth is if we don't pass HR 14 for 4014 that the CFPB could legally share privileged information with third-parties absent the specific congressional legislation the courts have permitted this practice of sharing in the cases of other Phaedra federal agencies although the bureau has said that they are prepared to take all reasonable and appropriate steps to protect proprietary information we cannot be sure therefore we must pass this bill to restrict them from doing so even President Barack Obama's appointed director of the CFPB Richard Cordray recently testified that it was quote and oversight and that he would be quote supportive of legislation solution a legislative solution to ensure privileged information is not leaked to third parties through the CFPB my bill is that real legislative solution this is a common-sense fix that will put an end to the needless uncertainty in legal costs to both the CFPB and to financial institutions mr. speaker while I believe this issue must and will eventually be addressed in the dodd-frank act this is a very important step I urge swift adoption of this important legislation to restore genuine accountability to the CFPB and for delivering a more efficient and effective government for America's hard-working taxpayers I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to see that this omission in the dodd-frank act is quickly rectified and sent to the president for his signature with that I yield back the balance of my time the gentleman yields back the

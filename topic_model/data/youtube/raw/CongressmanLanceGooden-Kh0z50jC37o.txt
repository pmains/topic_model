president Trump visits techno Paso Texas later on today first off he's goes to Dayton Ohio then he goes to El Paso so I'm going to bring in Texas congressman Lance good Gausman look he's gonna walk into a minefield in our paso today and there's a lot of talk that the president could lose Texas in the 2020 election your response to that please first off how sad that we've come to the point that's the President of the United States visiting a site where so many people have lost lives a tragic a tragic time how sad that that should be a minefield for the president United States we have members of Congress we have presidential candidates that before the day had ended they are criticizing and blaming the President of the United States for mass shooting similar to those that took place when a Barack Obama was president Democrat presidents have had many mass shootings and tragedies on their watch it's horrible it's a terrible problem but to blame the youth President of the United States on day one is just outrageous to me some of the the cries that we have seen from a presidential candidate and members of Congress and El Paso I think are shameful distasteful and should give every American pause that that's what their Congress has come to grant it but it is a political tactic to attack the president at rhetoric and attack him on the grounds that he didn't say anything about guns when he made his statement about white supremacy and I returned to the question yeah I bet I got a return at Lance I got a return to this there are serious questions as to whether or not he can keep his hold on Texas in 2020 address that I think the president's gonna be fine in Texas I think Republicans had a wake-up call in the last election and I think that Republicans are more engaged than have ever been they'll continue to be more engaged Republicans are taking this election cycle seriously and I think we've rested on our laurels politically over the last decade things have been so good for Republicans that we're now realizing it's time to take action it's time to engage voters that previously haven't been engaged and you'll see some drastic improvement with respect to taking this election seriously in 2020 the president is basing his reelection campaign on the prosperity that his growth program has created for the economy and also for the return on your 401k the stock market rally now the economy could slow if this trade fight with China keeps going and the stock market has come down off its highs I put it to you again last that maybe the president's vulnerable on his key issue you know if I had a crystal ball then I suspect we'd be in another place today but I'll tell you the economy is better than it's been in 50 years I can't predict what's gonna predict what's gonna happen in the next year but things seem to be looking up and up for this president I think one thing that Democrats and Republicans can agree on is this president has a tendency to get lucky when it comes to areas that people think he's in the wrong on this economy is one of them last election was one of them and he didn't win because he was lucky but this president makes things happen and this president will make things happen in this next cycle the economy is growing Democrats know that which is why they're not talking about it which is why when a tragedy like this happens they don't talk about the things that we should be talking about they start slamming the president United States it's unconscionable and you're gonna see continued distractions for the next year and three or four months until we get to the election next year but I think Donald Trump's fine in Texas I think he'll be fine nationwide I just want to make sure that you're ready for the news headlines this evening after the president has visited El Paso you know what's going to happen every demonstrator every protester every voice that hates him will be all over the evening news you ready for this oh yeah and could you imagine if he said I'm not gonna go to El Paso they'd have been outraged so if the president says he's going there outrage if the president says he's not they're outraged at what point do we begin to move forward from the political bomb throwing and actually move the American people for it and that what we're seeing out of members of Congress and on the Democratic side in El Paso presidential candidates who can't even talk to the media without dropping the f-bomb and then they go and talk about how Donald Trump is not presidential give me a break it's it's nonstop with these folks and it's got to stop got it Congress allowance Governor Gooden a Republican Texas thank you very much for being with us on an important day so we appreciate it thank you

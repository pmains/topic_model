that gentleman from Indiana mr. Carson is recognized for five minutes thank you very much mr. speaker mr. speaker i rise today to pay tribute to the 1955 Crispus Attucks men's basketball team the first all african-american high school athletic team to win a state championship not only in the great Hoosier State but in the United States although the school was initially constructed out of pressure to segregate Indianapolis High School's Christmas addicts high school quickly became a source of pride for the african-american community Indianapolis and across the Great Hoosier State however despite its historic championship victory the Crispus Attucks high school basketball team did not receive the praise and recognition traditionally bestow it upon previous state championships after it's when the team took the traditional ride on a fire truck from Butler Fieldhouse to Monument Circle in downtown Indianapolis but the team was not allowed to get off the truck at the circle for the traditional photo sessions instead the fire truck took one more lap then headed back into the city's black neighborhood now mr. speaker 60 years later I stand along all Hoosiers to recognize these men for their trailblazing efforts in bringing our city together through high school sports their win was a major first step for African American athletes across our country breaking the barriers of segregation and setting the stage for the diversity that we now see today mr. speaker today I'm joining my colleague in the Senate Senator Joe Donnelly to give these men the recognition they deserve it is long overdue but I hope it helps to bring some attention to their amazing accomplishments I ask that my colleagues join us today and recognizing the 1955 Crispus Attucks men's basketball team and thank them for bringing tremendous pride to the citizens of Indianapolis and people of all races across our great country I yield back mr. speaker gentleman yields back the balance of his time the chair

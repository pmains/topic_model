speaker pelosi said today no bill is everything and she's basically it sounds like urging her caucus to accept what's in there right now do you think that it was a mistake to use the kitchen sink approach with the build buildback better bill and the infrastructure where everything was put in there and then we've seen this haggling over the course of these couple months instead of paring it down look i think we have an unbelievable opportunity and i think when we see the final package that is going across the finish line uh in the you know days ahead we're going to be really proud of the moment of thinking big and bold about this moment i mean we're gonna have an opportunity to create an economy that's fair for everybody that people can participate that women can participate allison i'm home right now proxy voting because i got that phone call from the school nurse that my seven-year-old my second grader was exposed and she couldn't go to school do you know how many women get that phone call and because we don't have a paid family and medical leave policy in our country they they sink under the logistics or the the the pressure and the anxiety of getting that phone call that's what's that's what's the problem right now that's what we're trying to fix we want women to go back into the workforce we need to have a paid family in medical leave we need child care to be there for our working families so i think when all is said and done we're going to have a work product that we're really going to be proud of getting do you think i mean i know that you had originally wanted the 12 weeks of paid family leave it's going to be sounds like 4. is that enough for what you're talking about you know it's better right now that we than we have and i mean look i i want to be pragmatic about this i mean certainly we are the wealthiest country in the world and we should be um acting as though we are by giving those 12 weeks but we're trying to accomplish so many of these things for so many families that have different struggles so i think that us looking at you know how we can get the best deal possible uh is has been the goal uh for all of my colleagues whether you know in the progressive caucus or in the in the new dems yeah congresswoman lori trahan thank you for your time thank you great to see you

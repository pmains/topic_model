u.s senator chris coons senator chris  sits on the judiciary committee and has been a huge supporter of west side in providing affordable care health care for all please welcome senator chris coons to everybody here at westside health for what you do to provide access to quality affordable health care for the people of delaware the last few weeks have been dominated by the fight over the confirmation of judge barrett as i suspect all of you know later today senator carper and i will travel to washington for the final vote on judge amy tony barrett and it is amazing to me galling to me angering to me that in the middle of a pandemic a global health pandemic that has killed more than 225 000 americans and infected more than eight and a half million americans that the trump administration is seeking to take away the protections of the affordable care act from a majority of americans don't take my word for it there's a filing in the u.s supreme court in a case that will be argued one week from the election so we are one week from an election two weeks from an argument in the supreme court where the aca is at risk why did donald trump and the republican majority insist on racing through the confirmation process for judge barrett even with several members of the senate infected by covid even with later today vice president pence coming to preside over this final vote despite the fact that last night we learned five of his innermost circle have tested positive because they're determined to remove the aca they have voted dozens and dozens of times in the senate to take it away they have tried in states they have tried administratively they have tried in the congress and now this last ditch last minute effort in the supreme court is going to cost us all what would it mean well one of the things that the aca did is medicaid expansion former governor carper knows better than anybody what it means to have not just the protections against pre-existing conditions discrimination but also the expansion of medicaid and in delaware that meant federal funding so that 62 500 delawareans could get access to medicaid that is essential to the patients served here at westside health but that's not all the damage they seek to do pre-existing conditions are a part of the lives of 340 000 delawareans and every woman in delaware a majority of delawareans are protected against pre-existing condition discrimination just because they're women the seat that will be filled by the vote today i hope and pray it won't but i am a realist it likely will is the seat long held by justice ginsburg justice ginsburg fought for gender equality and to have the first case heard by justice barrett be a case that will reverse protections against gender discrimination and health care is the most galling piece of this of all a majority of delawareans today are protected by the affordable care act from being discriminated against just because they're women or they're people with pre-existing conditions or that are beneficiaries of expanded medicaid we have worked hard in the senate and especially on the judiciary committee to help delawareans understand what this means and i've talked over and over about three different delawareans in my judiciary committee work there's anita from lewis the proud sole proprietor of a small business prior to the aca affording coverage was a struggle she was one of the earliest adopters getting her healthcare through the marketplace in 2013 and today she pays less than half of what she did pre-aca there's debbie from newcastle another self-employed small business owner with a pre-existing condition that requires physical therapy x-rays multiple monthly appointments and she falls in between medicare and medicaid without her health insurance she could not possibly afford her medical bills and continue to support a small business badly impacted by the pandemic and then there's carrie carrie dennis mayer from middletown whose mother virginia is with us here today as well is going to share her story with us in detail carrie i have tried to tell your story on the floor of the senate and in the senate judiciary committee but nothing can be as powerful as kerry telling you her own story some of you may have seen when the democrats boycotted the final markup of the senate judiciary committee we instead had pictures pictures of real live individuals whose stories we want the american people to hear so they know that a justice spirit will take away privacy protections health care protections fundamental rights as i detailed across hundreds of cases that will impact labor protections environmental protections literally everything from native american rights to the rights of criminal defendants are at risk but today in front of west side health senator carper and i wanted to focus on the affordable care act and i'm so grateful to carry dennis mayer for coming and sharing her story with us and with you kerry [Applause] good morning senator and thank you so much and representatives uh the deputy chief medical professionals and fellow constituents thank you for giving me the opportunity to say favorable words about the affordable care act and how it improved my quality of life and how the aca removed my healthcare insecurity and replaced it with quality healthcare at a reasonable cost in 2009 before aca was passed i was in an intense healthcare situation my premiums were too expensive and my coverage was at best skimpy the aca saved my family by providing quality health care services within my budget today i had the big three dreaded pre-existing conditions diabetes high blood pressure and asthma however i'm not worried because today the aca is still here it is helping me manage my pre-existing conditions with doctors visits medications uh diabetic counseling and monitoring also i'm a patient here at westside family health in bare delaware where they do treat me well miss alonso is an enrollment specialist who basically helped me get the right aca health care program for my needs aca is not just benefiting me but thousands of delawareans and millions of americans all across this country what is interesting is that most people do not know the need for affordable health care act until they really need it and if you fall between the cracks of health healthcare and security and healthcare uncertainty then trust me you're grateful that aca is there to help you basically what it provides for patients is it gives them access to preventative care it gives them access to early con early detection and intervention and treatment it provides it improves the chances of recovery it improves the chances of resuming a normal daily life in my situation uh but in most situations most people won't let their health care get or get in a worse situation with health care if they have access to the right care and the right options and i know aca is the law of the land and has been for the past 10 years now we as the people need to lift our voices and tell the government how we feel about aca once again in my case my life is getting back to normal which is being a good parent running my business teaching adult training classes volunteering helping my family my friends my church and my work staff when needed and lending my voice to affordable health care act when asked i thank you for taking the moment to listen to my story and god bless to introduce u.s senator tom carper and invite him to the podium u.s senator tom carper was one of the original architects of the affordable care act over a decade ago since then he's been working to improve the landmark law working hand in glove with healthcare providers like westside so i would like to please welcome senator tom carper [Applause] good morning i i just before i uh get in my uh remarks i just want to say i've been here i got chris and i've been here i don't know how many times over the years and i want to say to everybody who's part of the team here at west side all the way down to dover with the thousands of people with tens of thousands of people every year to provide love and care for thank you let's put our hands together for this team come on you guys should clap for yourself too i i want to say to christians how proud we are of you all of us in delaware well almost all of us in delaware for the great fight that you have led an uphill battle you made us proud give them another round of applause please there you go chris uh and i and our families oftentimes uh go to church we're presbyterians and we don't go to the same church but a lot of sundays that's where we end up and many sundays our church is about a mile from from here over west western presbyterian many sundays are our pastor greg jones talks about the matthew 25 chris and i talk about matthew 25 a lot and i'm thinking about matthew 25 right now which says something like this when i was thirsty did you give me the drink when i was hungry did you feed me when i was naked did you clothe me when i was sick and in prison did you visit me when i was a stranger in your land did you welcome me matthew 25 doesn't say anything about well when i had a pre-existing condition and i couldn't get any health insurance did you do anything about it matthew 25 doesn't say anything about well i was uh 20 years old and uh my uh i used to get coverage for health when my my parents plan and now i don't get to to do that any anymore matthew 25 doesn't say uh if uh there's a something like an exchange that i could actually get coverage in and and get help by a tax credit did you preserve that tax credit but you know what those are just some of the things that are on the line affordable contraception is on the line and one of the reasons in this country where the number of abortions that are being conducted is actually going down down down over the years is because of access to affordable contraception that's a hallmark that's an important provision within your office here it'll go away how do i know it'll go away last night on 60 minutes in an interview with leslie stahl donald trump was asked not once but twice about what his hopes were for the aca and he said with respect to the supreme court as chris has said meeting on november 10th one week after the election president trump said again and again i hope they ended i hope they ended well i'm not so sure he's ever read matthew 25 because if he would he wouldn't be so sure we have an obligation to meet we have an obligation to meet the needs including the healthcare needs for those who are most vulnerable among us and through the affordable care act not only do we meet that moral obligation but we do so in a way that is fiscally responsible we do so in a way that's fiscally responsible the affordable care act now enjoys the support of about 65 percent of the american people those who are considered maybe 25 but by more than two to one margin now the american people say preserve this legislation preserve the benefits that it provides there's a lot at stake on this boat tonight this is senator coons knows that i know a lot at stake we're gonna uh the handwriting is probably on the wall but we will go down fighting because it's the right thing to do and i said in this speech last night on the senate floor to my republican colleagues our republican colleagues you may succeed this time with respect to this nomination and the supreme court but you're going to win the battle and not the war because in the end right will win out and i said last night do you think you could do this just because you can well you're wrong this is the wrong thing to do and in the end wright will triumph i uh oftentimes uh have had a chance to introduce a young young guy who's a student what is where does michael go to school middletown he goes to school down in middleton he's in high school michael davis caruso and michael's he's a runner i mean i'm a runner too chris is a runner too this guy's a real runner and uh not only is he a real runner as uh some of you may have remember he's a real runner who has a teenager oh gosh well he's 14 years old i think he ran the the chicago was at the chicago chicago marathon he didn't run a 5k he didn't want a 10k which i could barely do these days he didn't run a half marathon he ran the chicago marathon and he ran it as a teenager and he ran it with cystic fibrosis one of the reasons why he's able to do that is because of the care that he gets through the affordable care act and he wanted to be here today his mom had other other uh um responsibilities and says you know you go to school so he's in in school today but he sends his best and michael understands it without the affordable care act and access to the team of doctors and medications that running a race or even going out to his mailbox would be impossible so michael good luck on your schoolwork buddy and we'll look for so far to seeing you at uh maybe at the uh caesar rodney next year the caesar rodney we'll see but uh well michael couldn't be here guess who can be here and it's dan white i've had an opportunity to be with you any number of times with introduce her any number of times jan is a wife dan is a mother and i where's maggie maggie maggie i understand maggie is going to become a mother again in uh two months two months all right congratulations maggie jan is a wife a mother how many uh come on up here come on how many uh how many children are 17. come here come here all right that's good that's close enough mother of one and boy or girl i have son and how old is your son 25 25 all right uh wife mother small business owner from new york new york new and she's been battling stage four non-linear non-hodgkin lymphoma for help with the four years three four four years she knows the affordable care act has protected her and her family by not letting insurance companies set lifetime caps or drop her coverage she's a remarkable woman a remarkable delaware and i'm really delighted that you could join us again today dan come on in here thank you [Applause] thank you senator carper for the quite certain i owe my life to told me just how close we had come that my file was dropped on his desk at 8 30 in the morning by 8 45 the partners had met about me by nine o'clock they were on the phone to me with the words be in this office in one hour pack a bag you are not going home you are being admitted directly to christiana from the office we have to begin chemo today we have to try to save your spinal cord and your life by 10 i was in the office by noon i was in the hospital i was cycled through heart study lung study blood work picc line shoved in my arm and by late afternoon i was on chemo our heads were spinning but the speed was crucial because the assessment was i was seven to ten days from being completely paralyzed and three weeks from dying that of his career i was his full-blown emergency but i'm here and on our 30th wedding anniversary i was here to play with michael in disney world just like we did on our honeymoon and when ethan proposed to marissa we knew the weekend but not when so my phone lived on my lap and i was here to get the best three word text ever she said yes i was here for a thousand moments of simple joy with family and with friends i'm gonna wait somebody needs help we're gonna wait [Music] and for those who know me the mantra is onward so onward the idea of losing the affordable care act protections is enough for me to lose countless nights of sleep as life-changing questions roll through my brain with my health history will we be able to afford the premiums our premiums now are more than double our mortgage without the protections how high could they go and will we be able to pay them and even if we have coverage if there are lifetime maximum caps when will i reach those and chances are i am way way past them already so what do we do do we choose to forego care and live on hope or do we choose to pay for care and if i relapse i will almost certainly bankrupt my family and i could die anyway it's hard enough to fight the cancer we shouldn't have to fight for the chance to live we need the aca protections thank you

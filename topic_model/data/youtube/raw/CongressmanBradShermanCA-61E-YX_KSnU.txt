we want to welcome back congressman brad sherman democrat of california and he's a member of the house foreign affairs committee so sir let's begin with the passing of queen elizabeth elizabeth ii in your mind what is her legacy she symbolized the united kingdom in a way symbolized the western world for [Music] decades and decades and she presided over a time when the united kingdom and the united states were very close step by step all the way through world war ii the cold war and even now in ukraine she also brought grace to public affairs and we live in a shrill time it's hard to identify other public leaders who you say well there's there's grace we're learning that king charles iii will be proclaimed just that the king tomorrow officially what do you know of him and um any thoughts as he uh prepares to take over the monarchy well he's got big big shoes to fill there's obviously controversy with his first marriage and and all that he steps in with a reservoir of popularity than his mother did and uh and we'll see it's it's gonna even if he was as good at doing the job as she was uh starting in the 1950s gave her a tremendous leg up that he won't have well let's bring it back to the domestic front and to your home state of california energy prices their energy issues there i want to play the leader of the republican party in the senate mitch mcconnell of kentucky on the senate floor blaming democrats for california's energy crisis here's what he had to say democrats have made california's electrical grid into a giant experiment to try out all of their misunderstandings about energy policy it's not going well with hot weather demand surging california authorities are sweating political shortfalls of up to 5000 megawatts california's love affair with pickle unreliable green energy could force its residents to put up with rolling blackouts just to conform to wealthy liberals preferences the government had to send out an emergency message begging citizens to ration power ironically just weeks after announcing a future ban on gas-powered automobiles the state is now begging folks not to charge their expensive electric cars to avoid crashing the grid so california democrats don't want you putting gas in your car they don't want you to plug in your car either that's exactly where their war on energy would leave the american people going nowhere fast congressman your response um texas had a major electric problem just uh a few months ago i didn't see the gentleman from kentucky going to the floor and trying to make a partisan issue out of that to turn to a state that's just [Music] faced the greatest heat wave any of us can remember and say do nothing about global warming fan global warming burn as much carbon as you possibly can um shows almost uh a nihilistic uh approach burn the country down and enjoy doing it approach the fact is that uh electric vehicles charge uh can be you know 10 pm to 6 a.m that's not when we're going to have a blackout that's when other demand is down electric vehicles can and in future will and some do already put power back into the grid at key times and then use their batteries and pull the the power out of the grid at that uh that 10 p.m to 6 a.m window uh less than one percent of our electricity currently goes to uh electric vehicles but where is mitch mcconnell's answer to global warming except burn it all down and uh he was born into an america that was a great country and uh he seems to be intent on doing nothing about global warming in california announced just recently regulations too bring california's to do more on on the energy talk about what will happen in california and how the state what is the state doing that the rest of the country is not doing even even other countries well the the recent announcement is that uh after uh uh in roughly a decade we will not be selling gasoline-powered vehicles now it'll take decade or more after that before all the gas powered vehicles are down to a small percentage of those on the 405 freeway but that we see prices of electric vehicles coming down we see the tax credits that congress just adopted the president signed and we're going to see american energy produced in america running our vehicles and if we produce uh oil uh we'll be able to export it to countries that would otherwise be dependent upon russia and iran so this is a huge step forward from our national security and reflect on this if democrats hadn't pushed for a higher fuel economy standards for decades i'd be driving a car getting what my first car got like eight miles to the gallon you'd be driving one two american demand for uh gasoline would be double or triple what it is so prices would be way off the roof and we'd be filling our tank every three days so thank god that democrats pushed through fuel economy standards because imagine a country in which the average uh the average car was getting nine miles to the gallon in the history of fuel economy standards talk about that when did that push begin where are we now well uh uh we are to a much higher standard we're going to a higher standard i haven't memorized the exact numbers but i do know my first plymouth and uh it was it was the 9 miles to the gallon maybe i could have driven a little better and gotten 10 but and of course you know miles per gallon will become irrelevant if we're driving electric vehicles let's turn our attention to this month coming up and the house agenda right before the election what will what pieces of legislation what will the debates be like in the house before voters go to vote in november well the debates will be highly partisan i don't you're an observer and we'll have calls coming in so we can get a taste of that the the actual action um as far as passing legislation will keep the government open with a continuing resolution there'll be a vote on uh on on same-sex marriage in the senate i doubt very much that it'll get 60 votes and uh but it will put people uh on record uh we'll be passing a resolution uh about our about the passage of the queen um but this is not a time when you expect uh a congress which has not been all that functional to uh and we live in a non-functional time i mean 20 30 years ago congress was a much more cooperative organization but let's not shut down the government what are your concerns about president biden's approval rating they we've seen a little bit of an uptick but a lot of voters talking about the economy and giving him low ratings on that what are your concerns about democrats prospect of holding onto the house because of that well first you talk about the low ratings everything gets low ratings today uh with the exception of chocolate fudge sundaes but you uh every institution every politician it used to be if you had 50 approval in your district that was that was terrible why only fifty percent now i mean you go go on the floor and brag about it um second we dealt with covet we didn't deal with it perfectly as a society and no society in the world knew what to do with it and the effect on our economy was that we we kept people's incomes high and i don't hear republicans contradicting that they couldn't go to bars restaurants and sporting events so they bought everything on amazon and that pushed up the price of goods and is still having an effect and then of course they'll try to blame biden for the fact that factories in china are shut down that isn't biden that's she but if factories in china are shut down it's going to be hard to to supply american stores so uh i i think the wrap on biden for the inflation is is misplaced that being the case presidents always get more credit and more blame for the economy than they deserve but gas prices are coming down and uh i think that combined with this dobbs decision which was horrendous on on the abortion issue may may be enough to to get democrats to continue to control the house we're talking with congressman brad sherman this morning democrat of california please join in on the conversation he'll take your questions their comments the phones divided by democrats republicans independents start dialing in now congressman i want to get your reaction to axios scoop here kevin mccarthy the leader of the republicans in the house on september 19th is going to unveil a commitment to america if republicans win the majority and here is what axios is reporting the document will be much smaller it aims to give republicans a unified message to run on in the final stretch before november and it will include they're committed to an economy that is strong focusing on inflation high gas prices supply chain issues a nation that is safe with a focus on crime and immigration a future that is free the section headers include making sure every kid in every neighborhood can succeed better care and improved health care outcomes for all americans and a government that is accountable the final section emphasizes the extent of the oversight efforts republicans are promising next year if they take back the majority your reaction well i think he's handing us the election there he says dedicated to freedom and yet he's there to take away a woman's right to choose and and so many of the republicans particularly those in tough districts have signed on to legislation that says uh that the fetus is protected from the moment of conception not even the moment of implantation that outlaws an awful lot of birth control so his idea of freedom is to outlaw birth control and take away a woman's right to choose his idea on health care he's opposed every effort to try to make sure that americans have health care insurance he's opposed every effort to bring down the kite with the price of pharmaceuticals and of course we just passed a law that will bring down the price of the 50 leading pharmaceuticals and cap insulin prices at 35 dollars but he's opposed all that so he's for health care as long as you don't have insurance and the prices are sky high and he's for freedom except for women let's get the calls larry in galesburg illinois republican hi uh i just had a couple of questions one is is the representative going to take an electric plane from california to washington since he's a lifetime politician and two is plymouth i'm sorry but back in the 50s i had a car i was getting 14 16 miles to the gallon probably paying 75 cents or 50 cents a gallon well back at that time 75 cents then is well over four dollars now and uh maybe i should have consulted you before i bought a car in the uh in the 70s because mine only got nine or ten uh maybe i should have gotten the model of plymouth that you got as to an electric plane no i will not be using an electric plane no we will not completely ban in our society the use of fossil fuels the goal is to be at net zero but if we can simply bring our our carbon emissions down i think the we can turn the corner on global warming so this idea that uh there will not be any use of of of carbon fuels uh starting when my next plane back to los angeles is obviously false we'll go to tennessee old fort tennessee bob a republican uh yes i want to know do you think we'll be moving off of paper money and coins and uh another thing you must not believe in the bible homosexuality is a sin and you're expecting us to accept that you know if you read the bible eating a cheeseburger is a sin because it mixes meat and milk that's at least my bible but i i don't think we should put people in jail for a cheeseburger and i don't think we should discriminate against people because of who they love as to paper money we've mostly gone away from it it continues to be used uh to some degree and i think you'll see a continuation of of those of those trends john in lake geneva wisconsin independent good morning thanks for taking my call i was wanting to ask the representative with the pertain to electric vehicles with the mining you know not in my backyard is the saying typically you know all the materials for the batteries or the 90 of them probably are coming from other countries where slave labor is used to sit and strip mine the earth which is contradictory to your climate change agenda so i'm kind of wondering how you can wave how you're straddling the fence on that situation well you're not going to be having a perfect world not next decade not the decade after there is going to be mining uh mining is not you know as you say as you point out is not pristine all the time uh but it doesn't uh uh you know it's not a major source of global warming uh if it's done right as to slave labor we've got to make sure that the material coming to our country uh is not produced by slave labor which is why i've worked successfully on legislation to prevent us from bringing in uh products from xinjiang province where uyghurs are enslaved but the idea that because democrats want to improve the environment that we think or that is going to be some perfect world with no mining and and and no no jet fuel is just absurd let's do better we're not going to be perfect south river new jersey uh anthony democratic caller hey thanks for taking my call uh thank you congressman for your service i'm a registered democrat my whole life uh lately though i feel i've been lied to a lot by the democrats um i wanted you to comment on three things of legislation that i would like to see past that are the majority of the people's support um you know all these talking points are you know they're just they're just wrong um i'm gonna give you three talking points and i'm gonna ask you for legislation on that that's three questions i hope we get some other people in as well okay i know you don't want to hear my voice i i i want you to give me your best idea and and give some other people a chance to talk go ahead okay i'm gonna go for one point reclaiming my time reclaiming my time okay okay so here's the thing about i i know we have a victimistic crime of of the overdoses it's not a victimless crime i wish we'd stop saying that but on the abortion the majority of the people are for abortion but they want a limit on it now the bills that you guys just tried to pass have all the way up to full term even if the the baby's outside of the board the body why why are we saying that everybody's all the republicans everybody's against abortion like i'm a catholic i'm pro-life and i would never have an abortion because you know i mean i can get pregnant but i would never have an abortion but okay let's take your point let me deal with this democrats in the house of representatives support restoring the roe v wade standard and that is a standard that allows states to uh provide some regulation in the second trimester and and much more severe regulation in the third trimester democrats are not for abortion in the ninth month uh for trivial reasons and uh to say that a bill that's going to restore roe v wade is somehow going to change our society from what it was when roe v wade was the law is simply wrong we'll go to los angeles michelle republican caller thank you for uh taking my call they're just curious on fuel efficiency the battery the electric battery will have a problem with once they're spent in storing them i'm just wondering what do you think of the future of hydrogen fuel for cars as opposed to electric batteries uh i'm i'm not an engineer and i can't tell you whether a hydrogen car is better than uh uh than an electric car for the purposes we're trying to achieve and i think that it's up to the to consumers the private market and the engineers to see what products are there and what consumers want to buy and i'm an agnostic as to which version of a zero emission vehicle we have and i realize they're not zero emissions since either hydrogen or electric you have to generate some electricity or you need electricity to generate the hydrogen so none of this is is perfect but they're both steps in the right direction alan in only illinois democratic caller hello oh thank you for taking my call my question is about electric vehicles and i happen to own a hybrid right now and i get about 49.49 miles per gallon uh my question is a lot of states will use the gasoline taxes uh to pay for roads and bridges etcetera um do and i know that the republicans would have a no to every answer that people would come up with but i live out in a rural area and there's a concern that the farmers would have to travel a lot more distance wise and if you have electric vehicles based on mileage they're kind of scared about that well if you drive hundreds of miles a week you pay a higher gas tax now and i don't know what system we'll have to finance our roads one is the user fee where you're charging people based on how much they drive or based on how much gasoline they use which has been roughly correlated or whether uh we'll use general revenue funds as we do for for some of the road programs such as the biff that we just passed so um we will have to decide whether it's a user fee or general revenues uh if it's a user fee then obviously people who use the roads more will as they do now pay more for the roads walbridge ohio bernice independent bernice good morning in walbridge ohio are you there hello hello bernice go ahead yeah they got the name wrong it's supposed to be ernie of walbridge ohio hi bernie hi go ahead yeah i got a question i've been independent about 30 years and this whole thing around donald trump uh there's enough here with what he did at georgia phone call what he did at the capitol and signed a riot what he did at malaga team and all that stuff over there this guy is nothing more than a con man in my opinion i read his book the art of the deal when he was running i'm glad i didn't vote for this guy this guy is so corrupt he don't care about nobody but himself and all these people that worked with him that helped him from roger stone to flynn and everybody they pardoned some of these people and somebody didn't pardon someone got to go to jail and this and that but he just sits in malaga living the life of riley this is ridiculous people can't see this guy wants to be a dictator he looks up to putin he looks up to adolf hitler he looks up to dictators because that's what he wants to be more than the president united states he wants people to bow to him to do everything there is like they do to the other people over in those other countries donald trump is a very dangerous dangerous man and he needs to go to jail if he don't go to jail he needs to stay at malaga and do whatever hell he wants there the rest of his life okay bernie or ernie sorry i think i think bernie was clear um i was the first to uh file articles of impeachment against donald trump uh in the first year of his presidency i think he uh will go down as one of our worst presidents and i'm hoping that his grip on the republican party is released what about the search of the mar-a-lago home in florida the fbi search and what you've read about what they found are you getting any as a member of congress foreign affairs committee are you getting any reasons um from uh i i'm just amazed as to why he took the material and didn't return it it's almost as if he wanted this search to take place there is no purpose that he could not have achieved either honest if there was any honest purpose for him to have those or nefarious that he that required him he could have copied those documents he could have read them while he was still in the white house he could have returned them in the first month in mar-a-lago he was almost taunting the justice department and it has worked to his political advantage and disadvantage his grip on the republican party has intensified as he um he really forced the search on the justice department whether he did so deliberately because he wanted that sympathy in the republican party or whether he kept the documents because he's just obstinate pig-headed and arrogant we'll find out later amherst massachusetts rachel independent caller um hello thank you for taking my call i'd like to address representative sherman as my foreign affairs committee member one of them and i have a question regarding well i am sort of on a fact-finding mission about haiti and i need something um i have a friend he's a first responder he's been doing that for i think like a quarter of a century almost he's still a young man but he's dedicated his life to first response in climate disasters and he's been in haiti ever since the earthquake for 12 years now he's in a very desperate situation the spring water that they get water from his community has dried up their food insecure their water insecure there are guns in the streets guns on the roads he can't take his child to the embassy because the embassy is in the capital which is besieged by gun carrying gangs of people who will kidnap an american child who will you know shoot people on buses going to the city and and it's a very desperate situation and he's not alone i'm sure that there are many thousands of other families american families in haiti who are petitioning their embassy for the paperwork they need um the documents they need to okay rachel i'm going to jump in congressman your your reaction your response uh i don't know her friend's situation uh i uh obviously our embassy has got to serve the american citizens who are there in haiti if there's some reason they can't get to port-au-prince then we've got to do things electronically if that's available or by phone i don't know if this individual is in need of evacuation or or the caller was describing a situation that that i'm unaware of but all over the world we take care of american citizens congressman we'll leave it there thank you very much for your time this morning

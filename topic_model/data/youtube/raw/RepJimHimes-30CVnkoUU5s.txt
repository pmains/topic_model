democratic congressman jim hymes of connecticut is a member of the intelligence committee and he joins us this morning thank you congressman we appreciate it good morning chris so let's start right there do you think that president obama has the authority to launch airstrikes without congressional approval or do you think that you deserve a vote um i do not think i do not agree with the white house that the original authorization which of course was uh targeted at al-qaeda gives him the authority uh to without congressional approval uh do what he has said he would like to do look i actually think there probably is not uh consensus but i suspect there is a strong majority in the congress at least for the concept of operating more aggressively in iraq of course syria and arming the rebels there becomes a little more problematic but there are far larger principles than than simply this operation at stake here uh do we as americans want to continue to seed war-making authority which in the constitution is very clearly placed in the hands of the representatives of the people in the hands of one man and look i'm a democrat i support the president on most of what he does but uh you know you know the the logic they are using to say that he can now essentially make a a you know undertake hostilities using our troops is uh a bit tortured and this is a moment for a debate in the united states congress so that we go into this a heads up and b with some sense of consensus and congressman of course the other debate which is going to start taking place next week is about arming and training those syrian opposition forces uh where do you stand on that because i know you've expressed a lot of concern about the fact that it's not clear who those forces are who the good guys are who the bad guys are would you vote yes if that vote were held today well uh you've characterized that that that very well and look for background i actually think that uh what the president is calling for in iraq and in syria with respect to air strikes and activities against uh isis makes sense it's consistent with a pretty successful counterterrorism strategy which as the president says we've employed in yemen and pakistan and elsewhere uh which by the way does not end terrorism but certainly keeps them on their heels but the question of whether we should spend 500 million dollars to arm the so-called moderate rebels it needs to be closely closely examined and you're right i am a profound skeptic i sit on the intelligence committee and virtue of that i've had an opportunity to get a little closer to these guys than than most and i will tell you um that i mean i think i couldn't have said it any better than you guys did when you showed the syrian foreign minister encouraging american cooperation while warplanes syrian war planes were bombing the very people that were talking about this morning so we've got some profound questions to answer about whether this is wise whether this in fact ends up shoring up assad and by the way that may be a good thing or a bad thing but let's not believe that you know uh fighting in a three-way civil war is is going to be anything other than messi and then of course there's real profound questions you know about vetting you know okay a 19 year old that grew up in some dusty village in syria who now we have designated as moderate you know i was 19 once too and uh you know i suspect that that moderate label is highly influenced by who's got the money and who's got the momentum and and these are just things that we as a congress must debate and be very very skeptical about all right congressman very quickly before i let you go because we're out of time would you vote yes if that vote were held today at this point and and you know there's a lot of talk and a lot of debate to be happened but at this point i would uh i would likely vote no on the provision of 500 million dollars to uh to arm so-called moderate syrian rebels all right congressman jim hymes thank you for your time this morning we really you

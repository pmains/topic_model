president I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendments be set aside and that I be permitted to proceed as if in morning business for up to ten minutes without objection thank you madam president Madam President in President Obama's State of the Union address last week he outlined an agenda focused on what he called middle-class economics which he described as providing Americans with the tools they need to go that they need to go as far as their ever and their dreams will take them our country thrives when hardworking Americans prosper and the president was right to praise policies such as the GI Bill and Social Security that have helped us to do just that that is why Madame president I am perplexed at the president's proposal to tax the earnings of the 529 college savings plan accounts rather than help American families meet the owners cost of a college education this new tax would greatly diminish the benefits of Allah that is helping millions of parents plan for their children's futures the president's proposals undermine the very values that we should be promoting families making sacrifices today in order to better provide for their children tomorrow the president's plan would also lead to more student loan debt for many young people at a time when concern over the level of that is rising I would also note that the president has proposed eliminating the tax deduction on interest on student loan payments Madam President one of the first questions new parents ask themselves is how would they be able to pay for their children's education for the past 14 years the 529 accounts have been an important part of the answer they have allowed parents to save for their children's education in tax advantaged accounts regular affordable contributions made with after-tax dollars from their paychecks grow over time when college years start those savings and the earnings from their investments can be withdrawn tax-free for educational expenses these small sacrifices made from paycheck to paycheck can have an enormous impact making real the dream of higher education parents know that receiving a college degree greatly improves their child's future earnings potential in fact according to data compiled by the united states census bureau in the year 2011 individuals with college degrees earn approximately 1 million dollars more over the course of their the careers then do workers with high school diplomas census data also show that people with higher levels of education are more likely to be employed full-time year-round college graduates also tend to have access to more special lives jobs that in turn yield higher wages now Madam President critics of the 529 plans assert that they disproportionately benefit very high income families who could afford to pay for college without the tax regrowth in these dedicated savings accounts data from the college savings foundation however countered this assertion according to the foundation the average value in one of these 529 accounts is nineteen thousand seven hundred seventy four dollars additionally the average contribution to accounts that receive regular electronic contributions such as those coming from paycheck withholding is just 175 dollars per month that is clearly more in line with hard-working families trying to make ends meet than with affluent families to enjoy significant disposable income Madam President my home state provides a great example of the benefits of the 529 law after this law was passed in 2001 thousands of main families established these accounts but then came a powerful extra incentive in 2008 the Harold Alfond foundation which was established by one of Maine's greatest philanthropist created the alfond college challenge a five-hundred-dollar contribution to the college savings account of every baby born in Ming to date some 23,000 main families have used this generous gift to begin plan for the future education of their children as their parents own contributions are added to the account the future becomes even brighter for these children and for our state as the children grow and make their own contributions from after school and summer jobs so to grows their appreciation for financial responsibility and self-reliance the president says that his proposal is driven in part by the need to simplify the tax code our test code certainly needs simplification and I hope that that becomes a major accomplishment of this Congress but the question must be asked how does creating a difference between the 529 contributions already made which would remain untaxed and new contributions which would be taxed how does that simplify anything and perhaps more to the point in addition to simplification our tax code needs predictability Madam President before i joined the senate i was employed at Hudson University in Bangor Maine an outstanding institution that has a high percentage of students who are the very first in their families to attend college every day I saw how hard parents and students worked how many sacrifices they made in order to make higher education a reality my experience said Hudson is the chief reason why one of the very first bills that I introduced in this chamber was the college affordability and access at that bill called for creating tags preferred educational savings account the precursor to the Coverdale savings accounts tax incentives for employer-provided educational assistance and to tax deduction for student loan interest many provisions of that bill are now law but would also be harmed by the president's proposal Madam President the 529 college savings plan program channels the determination that I saw while working at Husson University and that exists throughout our great country into a tangible benefit built upon the virtues of saving and planning for the future changing the tax rules for the 529 accounts would break a promise to families across this country who are working hard to save for their children's education to help them attain a brighter future I urge my colleagues to join me in working to make college more accessible and more affordable and to save the 529 college savings plan program thank you madam president and I thank the sponsors and managers of this bill Madam President

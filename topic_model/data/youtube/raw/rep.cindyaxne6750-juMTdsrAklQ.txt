agreement the gentlelady from Iowa is recognized thank you madam Speaker today a lot of hard work is paying off with the passage of u.s. MCA thank you to my colleagues who crafted this agreement that gives market stability to farmers protects Iowa workers from having their wages undercut and helps reduce the high cost of biologic drugs and it even has important environmental protections I know my farmers producers and agricultural workers are celebrating the passage of us MCA today everywhere I go the message has been clear we need us MCA because of uncertainty in our markets we now have that deal the house has done a great job but the Senate already said they won't take up this agreement anytime soon it will pass today with bipartisan support and whenever the Senate chooses to bring it up it will pass with bipartisan support then as well the same senators who have blamed the house for not moving this forward quickly enough are now stopping the us MCA from becoming law Iowans and Americans are asking for help and we must get this deal done I'm proud to have fought for a better trade agree

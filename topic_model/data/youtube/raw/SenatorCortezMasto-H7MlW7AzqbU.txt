Thank You chairwoman and ranking member for this hearing thank you all I think we're done you pretty much said everything that we need to get started on but let me say this because I I think you touched on this miss woods flowers and and that's this it's the idea that this act that we are talking about the bold act really sets the tone that this is a public health crisis and we are creating an infrastructure that is necessary for that coordinated care plan that we have all been talking about today that's a coordinated plan that we can tap into an infrastructure to address everything and I and I say that because I just came back from Nevada and I know there's Nevada folks here as well and we had a roundtable discussion Northern Nevada and I had a lot of my stakeholders at the table to talk about where are the gaps where do we need to work together because I will tell you in Nevada we have a state aging division they're phenomenal you do an incredible job incredible job and I so agree with you that now it's time to coordinate and connect everybody together because of what we just heard and miss Gay Harden I am going to touch on this one of the gaps we have is the doctors not that they don't want to be there but they're not trained to think about this when you first come in and there's an early diagnosis or detention to connect you with the services that you need in your community that is the number one thing that I heard from the folks in in Nevada that I was sitting with how do we bring them in and then you brought in the first responders it's the same thing so by creating this idea that this is a public health crisis we have an infrastructure that now we can all tap into and start education start early diagnosis start the detection and then start the help and assistance that's necessary for everybody to tap into it that is the key that's what we're trying to achieve here so I so appreciate the questions and and the comments that you had today let me let me touch on one one area which is the data collection which for me is key I'm a data geek and I think that's where everything starts is collecting the data and we learn from the data and it takes us in directions that are so important but one of the things I'm particularly concerned about when it comes to dementia related health disparities is those that occur in our communities of color American Indian and Alaska Native communities LGBT Q communities and people with intellectual and developmental disabilities so dr. McGuire let me ask you this can you tell me what kind of health disparities the CDC's data collection has already discovered thank you very much for that that question through our behavioral risk factor surveillance system we are asking people to evaluate their own memory performance we call it subjective cognitive decline and we also ask caregivers about their specific caregiving situation so we know one in nine Americans report that their memory has worsened in the past year and we know about one in four Americans is caring for a loved one or family member so to answer your question we do know disparity wise we do know that we see higher numbers of individuals that are african-american that are reporting the subjective cognitive decline also individuals that are Hispanic Latino and also American Indian Alaskan Natives through our work we are working with some tribal organizations to increase awareness and tribal communities and to really try to think about risks reduction so we have some messaging campaigns that are being developed about managing your blood pressure in middle-aged because we know that managing your blood pressure in middle age can help reduce your risk of having dementia later on and we're developing those messages for tribal communities for the providers and for the four of the general population as well thank you is there anything that we have not talked about today I'm gonna open up to the panel where you see gaps or other challenges that we should be focused on I think there's gaps in teaching our young people about Alzheimer's and how their diet and lack of exercise might be a precursor to ultimately the systems I talk to my kids about it and I guarantee you I go to mom you know he had clean of the pantry but they're interested in it and they're changing their own diets and I think I heard you say doctor that mice no matter what they ate did he say that if they were exercising they weren't showing signs of dementia and so I thought that was just a really fascinating bit of information apparently have to sweat if you exercise which is not so hot in my opinion but I'll do it if that's what it needs to be done so I think education for the youth and the young ones really middle school elementary school because that's there they're eating lots of sugar right thank you anyone else yeah I'll just I'll just expand on that so the the challenge with exercise and diet is that you know under controlled conditions a strain of mouse does not get the same degree of aging in the brain as those that don't exercise challenges in the human population we know very little about how our genetics might interact and change the way in which exercise might be important when I talk about my exercise research I often get somebody stands up and say well my father was a marathon runner and then developed Alzheimer's at the age of 60 and so it's it's not as sadly it's not simply exercise and everybody will be fine what we so what we can do using both human studies and and animal model studies is to really understand how the genetics interacts with the environmental factors such as exercise such as diet in in order to to reduce risk but I think is really important though is for sure as a population as societies it's going to help we can't predict who it's going to help but overall it's going to help it should reduce numbers or should reduce the incidence of Alzheimer's disease so the more we can do to encourage our children you know and and older to get out there and do some exercise and balance their load their lifestyle is going to be important thank you thank you all appreciate you being here

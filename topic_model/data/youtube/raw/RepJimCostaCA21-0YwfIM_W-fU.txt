Mr Speaker I also rise today to recognize National Hispanic Heritage Month and the countless Hispanic Americans who have contributed so much to the RIT's richness and diversity of our nation Rea Kitano was an example but there's so many many many examples in my district again in the San Joaquin Valley of California the majority of our constituents trace their origin to Hispanic communities actually in California it goes back to the very origins of the state about four hundred years ago and they in so many different ways reflect the diversity and the breadth and the width in our community and in our nation in business in education in the military labor in sports meaningful contributions working people that make a difference every day giving back you know the Hispanic community throughout our country reflects the American story and that's the story I believe of the immigrant immigrant pasts and immigrants present all wanting to make a contribution and to live what we call what the American dream the dream that is held near and dear by everyone throughout the world who admires and appreciates that America is a beacon of light and certainly it has been for the Hispanic communities there are so many different individuals that I could recognize in my congressional district I would like to mention a couple of individuals that I think reflect the temerity the tenaciousness and the willingness to give back mr. Aguilera first-generation immigrant worked his way from a homelessness person to owning his own business he founded the Merced Soccer Academy a local nonprofit organization which brings young people together to compete and to learn from one another every Monday he hosts meetings for community members to share in events another individual that I work with from the California Highway Patrol officers Aldo Garcia also known as L protect dog the protector is a community outreach officer that focuses toward the Hispanic community his emphasis on education not just law enforcement has broken down barriers for peace officers and created a more approachable situation there are so many examples Jose Ramirez world champion boxing champion and his Olympic competitor Tom Flores two-time World Super Bowl championship coach for the Oakland Raiders the list just goes on and on and on and guess what all of these individuals their families reflect immigrant origins coming to live the American dream isn't that really that what it's all about I believe so so I urge my colleagues to join me in recognition of National Hispanic Heritage Month and the noteworthy accomplishments that Hispanic Americans make throughout our country serving in our armed forces making the sacrifices that all Americans make it's what makes our country the great country it is I yield back the balance of my time

right now with Congressman Jim Himes is a Democrat from Connecticut also importantly a member of the House Intelligence Committee congressman it's always great to have you thank you so much just want to get your take on what Rene Marsh is reporting right there we're looking at bomb threats being made against three separate commercial airline flights here in the United States none of them seen as credible at this moment but this is the second week in a row that we're talking about this and we're looking at this and people are getting pulled off planes people are having all of their bags checked fortunately nothing has happened so far but this is a disturbing trend no well it is unfortunately this is obviously very much breaking situation but there doesn't appear to be any reason to believe that this is anything other folks at this point in time but that's still pretty serious I mean as you point out it is yes an inconvenience to hundreds of people but more to the point and even more ominously you know you take dozens if not hundreds of law enforcement officers off their posts and focus them on something that turns out to be a hoax oh look let's hope it's a hoax and let's find out let's hope that we find out who the perpetrator is because you know people need to understand that this is may seem like a joke but it's a profoundly serious thing Congress there is other congressman's other breaking news this morning out of Boston work Joint Terrorism Task Force had a man under surveillance this man pulled a knife on the FBI agents and cops that man was shot and killed you sit on the Intelligence Committee inside the house have you heard anything about this incident in boston yet we heard from Michael Balboni you know CNN contributor here he was saying that he's hearing perhaps that there had been some kind of online threats against police officers in Boston yeah I think speaking for myself as a member of the Intelligence Committee I have not yet been briefed and I you know this wouldn't be unless this in fact had some sort of terrorism Nexus to it it's unlikely that that we in Congress would be briefed that remains to be seen obviously this is the law enforcement matter and it's just a guy who was you know looks like perhaps emotionally disturbed or whatever you know not likely to rise to the level of congressional notification but that remains to be seen Congress been talking about the airline's again I mean this morning TSA has a new acting director following this report exposing such vulnerabilities in the TSA screening process the fact that undercover agents could get through with weapons with with fake bombs with everything every single time that they tried to in an undercover attempt that not only is troubling but it also raises the question why is airport security still so vulnerable when we know that planes are targets well it's a great question and it's one that's going to you know pose a lot of questions around here i am at it i have not yet had a chance to review that report but look all of us go through that security we know how obtrusive we know how inconveniencing it is to empty your pockets to take the laptops off to take your shoes up if we go through all of that and it turns out that we can't even stop weapons and bombs that the tsa fails to identify those things we have a huge problem so as I said this is a new report but you know this is really serious stuff and I imagine it is going to be the subject of some pretty serious congressional hearings and figuring out exactly what's going on congressman as we speak the Senate is expected take another step forward toward passing the USA Freedom Act which deals with domestic electronic surveillance among other things it's a bill you voted for and supported in the house there's been a great deal of focus on electronic surveillance but this week there are reports that the FBI owns a fleet of planes that it uses for surveillance over American cities registered under corporate front names and they say they don't need warrants to fly these planes to surveil and investigate US citizens is this a cause of concern to you should it be well to take a little bit of a step back here USA Freedom which you referenced up front is hopefully going to pass today in the Senate precisely because it represents something that I think most people want which is a scaling back a careful scaling back a nice compromise and scaling back of a lot of the more obtrusive authorities surveillance authorities that were in the Patriot Act in particular the metadata program that of course we all came to learn so much about after the Snowden revelations but the this program that you make reference to what people need to remember is that the government does not have the authority anymore and in particular once USA Freedom passes the Senate which ends bulk collection programs it does not have the authority to simply gather in mass in bulk I should say won't have the authority after this USA Freedom passes in bulk anybody these information so look there are a lot of ways to surveil there our cell phones there are computers when the government has reason to believe or probable cause and legal terminology to think that somebody may have an ex ism to terrorism or in the FBI's case may be associated with drug dealers or criminals or whatnot yes in that case they are going to apply all of the tools at their disposal to listen in to somebody who is a target because there is some probable cause for that person to be a target Congressman Jim Heintz from Connecticut thank you so much for being with us please come back a busy busy week in terms of intelligence and national security thanks congressman thank you

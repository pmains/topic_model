I forgot what I was gonna ask well moving right along thank you very much thank you for sticking around with us ambassador Hale I was in the middle of asking you a question about your perception of legal authority for hostilities some of us are concerned about the way in which the President construes his inherent article 2 Authority and so I wanted to just confirm that there are really two legal justifications for a military strike against a country like Iran the first would be that we are responding to an attack or we are attempting to prevent an imminent attack that would be as mr. string has articulated within the president's article 2 Authority the second would be that the administration comes to the conclusion that there is an existing congressional authorization that would cover such action or the Congress passes a new authorization but just I just want to make sure that I'm right in general that the two ways you could strike Iran is if you are responding to attack or defending against an imminent attack or you have an authorization from Congress well thank you senator those do seem to be fairly specific legal questions would you mind if the legal adviser acting legal advisor respondent I don't as long as he as long as we get an answer sure I was maybe hopefully you might give a little bit clearer answer than we've gotten from mr. spring but I'll put it to mr. Strang Thank You senator so under under US law I think your question is under US law rather than international under US law there would need to be a an AUMF an authorization for the use of force by Congress and as we've stated there's been no determination to date that either AUMF a plot would apply to Iran and then secondly you talked about the constitutional authority in previous OLC opinions across the administration's the authority has been described be a little more flexible than what you stated so there are there needs to be a a precise national interest that's been articulated by a president in order to justify the use of force under the Constitution some of those types of national interests that have been identified in the past are protection of US persons a property supportive allies support of UN Security Council resolutions promoting regional stability and deterrence of the use of WMD so it's it's a little more flexible than you described senator but it's broadly in line yeah I think the issue that you will find with many of us is that that list would seem to describe almost any reason to use broad article 2 Authority to engage in hostilities and so I think there will be a difference between our interpretation of that article 2 Authority in your article 2 Authority mr. Hale I wanted to follow up on your opening statement regarding the present situation with Iran there's been a great deal of confusion as to what the administration's position is with respect to negotiations with the Iranians say what you will about President Obama he was pretty clear that he wanted a negotiation on their nuclear weapons program and and setting aside there are other malevolent activity for future negotiations the Iranians of telegraphed a potential interest perhaps on terms that are acceptable to us but an interest nonetheless to enter into negotiations is the United States prepared to sit down and talk with the Iranians if the subject is limited to their nuclear program or their potential nuclear weapons program or are we still insisting that they commit to opening up negotiations on a host of other activities before we would entertain any discussions the objective of our entire strategy here is to seek a negotiated outcome with Iran that's comprehensive that covers the nuclear issue the ballistic missiles advanced weaponry the malign behavior in the region human rights practices treatment US citizens we are open today it's a dialogue without preconditions president has signaled that consistently we're ready to do that but the goal would have to be a comprehensive agreement along the lines I said so the position still remains no preconditions you're willing to sit down and talk today that's correct lastly let me sneak one last in for mr. string and I apologize for going backwards and forwards I wanted to talk about this authority to protect partners I may disagree with you there's a broad Article two ability to protect partners without congressional authority but let's drill down on the existing 2001 authorization and you have referenced that the 2001 authorization may give you broad authority to protect partners who are engaged in fights with us against the enemy I would submit that you're right if they are engaged in fights against a named enemy under the 2001 authorization and that enemy has attacked that but what about the case in which a group not listed in the 2001 AUMF has attacked a partner who's a partner in the fight against Isis or the fight against Al Qaeda but has been attacked by an entity that is not listed in the 2001 AUMF do you have any responsibility to come to Congress to launch a attack against that new entity or is or is any attack against a partner of ours in the fight against extremism covered our response to it covered under the 2001 AMF I I think you've notting so I think you get what I'm asking yeah thank you I appreciate the question to understand the question so senator what you've laid out is very a very fact-specific hypothetical and I just like I prefer not to get into answering very hypothetical questions I think what were what were what we've articulated in the testimony today is is the first scenario that that you mentioned in that when US forces are deployed alongside partners and allies we have a right to defend our forces and those those partner Allied forces as they together are pursuing missions pursuant to either the tooth out 1 or 2002 AUMF so that was the core proposition that were but you're prepared to argue affirmatively in that hypothetical but you're not prepared to say you do not have the authority in the case that they are attacked by a entity not named by the administration as a terrorist group affiliated with al-qaeda well in some ways the so the answer that I provide is not not necessarily hypothetical because we I can cite a couple examples where we've actually exercised authority to protect to protect our own forces as they're engaging in in in certain operations pursuant to the 2001 or 2002 AUMF and come under attack by another group for example in 2011 US forces were engaged in operation in in Iraq and came under threat from some Iranian backed militia groups and under the proposition that I've laid out our forces were able to to respond appropriately to that threat okay I've got over my time Thank You mr. chairman

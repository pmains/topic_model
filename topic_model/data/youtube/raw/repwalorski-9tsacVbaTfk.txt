I rise today in support of HR 65-61 the comprehensive care for seniors Act of 2018 this bipartisan legislation would require the Secretary of HHS to finalize updated regulations for the programs of all-inclusive care for the elderly commonly known as pace while still giving the secretary the flexibility to make updates and changes to this proposed regulation the pace program is a proven model for delivering high quality comprehensive community-based health care for seniors it helps seniors whose health conditions would otherwise land them in a nursing home to remain in their homes for as long as possible by allowing them to see health professionals and social service providers at local pace centers there are currently 124 pace organizations in 31 states that serve over 45,000 Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries enabling them to live safely in the community through the fully integrated services and support provided this allows beneficiaries to live longer experience better health and have fewer hospital visits seniors facing health challenges should have the option to receive high-quality health care while continuing to live at home and programs like st. Joseph pace in Mishawaka in my district allowed them to do just that in 2016 CMS released a proposed rule to update the original guidelines from 2006 a bipartisan group of members of Congress sent letters in November of 2017 in June of 2018 urging CMS to prioritize updating the existing regulatory framework which is more than a decade old the agency was unfortunately not taken had not taken any action this much-needed update would allow pace programs to customize their interdisciplinary team around the needs of each enrollee provide more services in the community and give greater flexibility to partner with community providers Mr Speaker I reserve the balance of my time

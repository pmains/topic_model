I'm Jerry Moran and I approve this message. This really is one of the best parts of my week. Leaving D.C., coming home heading out to visit with Kansans. It's what I love about my job. Listening to you and finding out what matters. It doesn't seem as if washington D.C. ever listens because many of the people we send their they don't even try. But I listened, then I lead, and I always will because I'm determined not to let Washington D.C. speak for you.

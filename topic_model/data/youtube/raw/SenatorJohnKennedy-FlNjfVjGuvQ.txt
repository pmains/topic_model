let's bring in louisiana senator john kennedy senator thanks for joining us the administration says it will turn their back if these folks come by sea the national review had a piece out and said so this announced policy of turning back illegal aliens apprehended by the coast guard but admitting those who turned themselves into border patrol represents a revival of sorts of clinton's wet foot dry foot policy wherein cubans caught at sea were sent back but those who reached the beach in florida got to say only this time your foot needs to land on the left bank of the rio grande president biden's already had a crisis at the u.s vexing border i mean is this our next crisis well i think it's pretty clear that uh president biden is not particularly interested in what's going on in cuba and what's happening to the people of cuba um you know life is full of contradictions and what's happening in cuba is both beautiful and disturbing to one's core i mean it's beautiful because we're seeing the people of cuba uh demand their freedom the thirst for freedom is innate it's instinctive it's part of the human condition castro promised the good people of cuba they would be free if they put him in power he lied uh he lied about socialism socialism has just trickled down poverty and the people of cuba have had enough president biden issued a press statement i thank him for that but that's not nearly enough he needs to be on the phone with every leader of every democracy in the world canada uk new zealand australia japan south korea india every european nation they need to stand together they need to stand together daily they need to demand change and and declare their support for the people of cuba the president needs to be bringing all of america's cyber skills to cuba to keep that internet open so the whole world can watch because the castro regime is now starting to kill peaceful protest protesters but all the president's done is issue a statement and and that's that's just not enough sean in my judgment and he's ambivalent about whether if if the people of cuba make it to america whether we're going to turn them back so it is what it is and it's not very pretty it's not very pretty right now senator i do want to switch gears with you senate majority leader chuck schumer and senator bernie sanders they've reached a 3.5 trillion dollar infrastructure deal last night and they've greenlit reconciliation to bypass the gop filibuster there's many fears out there that this will fuel more inflation we're already seeing now consumer prices have increased 5.4 over the course of a year that's the biggest monthly gain since august of 2008 we saw milk go up 7.5 percent bacon orange is up 8 and gas which is really people are failing up 45 so what is the likelihood that this infrastructure package is going to increase inflation even more look republicans aren't perfect but there's so many people on the other side that are crazy and they're being led by president biden i mean i think the americans who voted for president biden thought they were getting the uh the second coming of barack obama instead they've got the second cousin of bernie sanders um i mean think about it i'm in shock i mean president biden believes in bigger government more taxes more spending more debt uh weaker military open borders abortion on demand i could keep going um i mean his his mantra seems to be we can't possibly spend too much these numbers are breathtaking his recent announcement after spending two trillion dollars on a corona virus bill to revive the economy after it was already revived now he wants to spend three and a half trillion dollars creating welfare for the middle class three and a half trillion dollars is three thousand five hundred billion dollars we're going to run out of digits here um and this is real money i've never seen anything like this well part of the reason you know he's locked up go ahead no senator i was just going to say you're right i mean talk about crazy according to a morning console poll that came out about 1.8 million people out of work have turned down jobs because unemployment insurance benefits congress has set this expiration date for the benefits in september i mean these benefits are directly related to why people don't want to go back to work if you pay me to stay home i will stay home well look the economy is reviving and we in congress did what we had to do to keep the congress rather to keep the economy afloat but it's it's back i mean as you pointed out sean our biggest problem is we can't we can't fill the jobs now president biden has promised repeatedly that he's not going to raise taxes on anybody who makes less than four hundred thousand dollars a year he already has um but by by injecting all of these printed dollars into the economy it's led to inflation uh wages are going up but inflation's rising faster than wages this is a recipe for disaster and i'll tell you what every fair-minded american is thinking to to themselves how could my family survive if every month i spent more and more on my credit card and just made the minimum payment how can our country survive doing that they can't senator i do want to get your take on this before we let you go because the media is padding these texas state democrats on the back for their move to fly out of state to d.c on a private plane avoiding this texas election integrity law to vote on it take a listen to this getting out of dodge dozens of texas democrats flee the state in an attempt to block a voting bill they claim is a dangerous attack on democracy the first i have to talk to you about this threat to have you all arrested when you return to texas and supposedly to track you down like the fugitive slave act is still enforced today president biden traveling to the birthplace of american democracy to fight back against the republican effort to restrict voting rights calling it the most dangerous threat to voting in our history all right so today you and several other republicans actually criticized myrna perez who is one of president joe biden's judicial nominees who until recently was the director of voting rights at the liberal brennan center for justice for her self-professed belief in a living constitution which means she thinks it can change president biden has also said no amendment to the constitution is absolute does this worry you senator about where the country is headed right now well what president biden wants to do is appoint people to the federal bench who who will try to rewrite the constitution every other thursday to advance a left-of-winning social agenda that they can't get by the voters through their elected representatives they want to do through the back door what they can't do through the front door and all of these folks are nauseously woke they all believe that america was wicked in its origins they believe that america is even more wicked today than most americans are racist and misogynistic and ignorant but they on the other hand are smarter and more virtuous than middle america as they sip their caramel frappuccinos i think they're wrong and i think the american people are going to demonstrate how they how wrong they are in 2022. i don't know what's happened to president biden you know he he says with the voting rights act in texas he says it's the worst thing to happen to america since the civil war are you kidding me if he he's the only person in the milky way who believes that he must have been playing frisbee uh out in the quad during history 101 to liken the voting rights bill to a war that almost destroyed our country 700 000 americans died we're still suffering from the scars give me a break senator kennedy thank you for joining us you always bring a massive dose of common sense to a city that needs a lot more of it so i appreciate you joining us and breaking it down thanks guys

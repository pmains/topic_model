the Subcommittee on livestock and foreign agriculture will now come to order this is another one of a series of subcommittee hearings that we are holding to deal with our appropriate role in terms of our oversight as well as to try to find ways in which we can cooperate with the administration to solve problems on behalf of our country and specifically American farmers growers ranchers dairy men and women throughout the country and and this morning we're going to talk about the challenges dealing with the trade issues that the administration is engaged in as it relates to products that we all grow at international markets that we rely upon in terms of our access to those markets and to have a level playing field to the degree that we can and and fairness and implementing changes that are necessary that I think on a bipartisan level we all agree that we have to deal with we sometimes disagree on the strategies on how to get there in terms of the best way to reflect the needs of American agriculture let me begin with my opening statement and I want to thank all of you who are here this morning I hope we get a chance to get some answers to questions on how we're really dealing with US agricultural trade policy and its impacts on the lives and the livelihoods of not only farmers ranchers and countless others who rely on American agriculture but our farm communities because the ripple effect in our farm communities directly impacts employment it impacts our schools and impacts our way of life and as some of you've heard me say it before nobody does it better I think than the American farmer that puts food an abundance of food at the highest quality for health purposes anywhere in the world America's dinner table every night so I'm going to start off by reflecting a and a and you'll get a sense for my comments a show that many of us grew up with as kids that I reflect upon on occasion and that is dragnet now how many of us remember dragnet as a kid used to watch it would sergeant Friday used to always say just the facts ma'am okay well I'm going to talk about this morning in my opening statement just the facts as I see them trade is especially crucial in California where we export over 40% of this incredible abundance of cornucopia that we produce about 50 billion dollars a year at the farmgate in 2017 over 20 billion of that was reliant upon our ability to export to Mexico to Canada to China to India all around the world we are very good at growing things we've been blessed with an abundance of good farm country today members of the subcommittee we have a very good distinguished group of individuals who I've worked with and I think many of you know we have ambassador Gregg Dowd the office of the US Trade Representative and we have USDA Under Secretary for trade and foreign agricultural fairs Ted McKinney who we've many of us worked with over the years and these two gentlemen have a lot of a wealth of experience of working here on the hill and this as we like to say isn't their first rodeo we we believe that these two individuals are the most directly involved in the administration's discussion on agricultural trade policy so we're very glad that they would take the time to update the Subcommittee on the challenges we face given the Epps and downs of the trade discussion in recent months we're all interested in I think where we are today and where we're going that's what my farm country wants to talk about we know that farm bankruptcies are the highest that they've been in a decade after record highs in 2013 farm income is forecasted to fall below 70 billion dollars for the third straight year in crop prices in many areas have cratered from record highs within the last decade to generational lows dairy and livestock farmers are struggling California wine exports to Europe are down 15% and down 25% to China and the target of California growing fruits and nuts and we produce half the nation's fruits and vegetables and 70% of the world's almonds and 50% of the world's pistachios is projected to cost our growers this year over two point six four billion dollars that's just in the specialty crop in California for almonds pistachios and and and leafy greens as a matter of fact according to the USDA's Economic Research Services and imports agriculture goods increased by six percent between 2017 and 2018 and while exports exports that are all part of this trade discussion only grew at 1% as you can see on the screen and I've got it up there and for members of the committee these factors have factors have led to the u.s. smallest agricultural trade surplus in over a decade that's what this chart shows and we've always enjoyed again because of successive administrations a surplus in our agricultural trade but this is the narrowest that's been since 2004 and 2006 and I think we're all concerned about that and that's why this hearing is so important and then there's something that none of us can can control right it's it's just the nature of farming and that's the weather flooding continues to ravage prime corn and soybean regions in the Midwest hurricanes a battered cotton and rice and specialty crop producers in the south drought has particular impact on livestock and rogue crop farmers in the southern Great Plains and and throughout Eastern California and of course we've got wildfires again we had an abundance of snow in the mountains and we've got a pretty good water year in California and now we got wildfires it seems to be either feast or famine that have taken a disproportionate toll on timber and our wine grape growers in Northern California and so in my view I think the administration's trade policies even though with the best of intentions have made these difficult times that deal with a lot of factors that are out of our control more difficult for farmers and ranchers I'm glad that the president has abandoned what I thought was an ill-conceived plan to put new tariffs on Mexico I've talked with a number of our senators Republican and Democratic alike and they had very much concerns over the last 10 days about these proposed tariffs but I do remain concerned about the exercise that that that this exercise has created and slowing down the momentum that existed after the administration agreed to lift the 232 tariffs which I think was an important step an ambassador light hauser had indicated to many of us was part of a series of milestones that needed to be achieved to bring the u.s. MCA the US Canada Mexico agreement before us so while we made I think progress two weeks ago I think the last week has been a step backwards and I hope there won't be no more policy surprises as we attempt to work on a bipartisan basis to to move this trade agreement forward I'm also concerned about the lack of a resolution with the situation with China we're eager to see our farmers and ranchers on a level playing field not only with China but with Japan since our competitors are already enjoying preferential access I'm one of those that in my opinion I still believe that the trans-pacific partnership would have been a better strategy to deal with China's unfair trade practices which we've been known for decades they back to the Clinton administration and the Bush administration every administration's had a different strategy to deal with these unfair trade practices as a matter of fact most of what was in TPP was a part of now what is in you MCA and with some improvements and I wonder whether or not at some point in time maybe we might want to consider rejoining the efforts with TPP and I've had suggested that to ambassador lighthouse er the administration I think has acknowledged the damage these policies have caused for farmers they've done so in effect by issuing now with this new round twenty eight billion dollars in to taxpayer-funded bailouts for those affected and for the committee assignment members I have this chart here that's before you it shows how they attempted to try to provide support across the country in that first round of nine billion dollars of mitigation and you can see how much it benefited various commodity groups on per cents per pound and I know the USDA is in the process of formulating how they will provide benefits in the second round and that's important but you know farmers in California I can tell you and I think around the country don't they're not looking for a handout they're not looking for subsidies and this in the bigger scheme of things doesn't come close to mitigating the impacts that these on prices have had three cents a pound on almonds for example we think the impacts have resulted in a 30 percent 30 cents per pound decrease in in at the marketplace and you can go down the list so I'm concerned about the policy signals of that are taking place not withstanding the attempt to soften the blow for farmers and that is being used gentlemen as I said on the outset I have respect for both of you you're knowledgeable and you've been around for a while as we say it's not your first rodeo I know secretary Perdue and ambassador light House are also doing everything possible to resolve these issues and I know we all share in this committee on a bipartisan basis the goal of seeing American agriculture succeed we all represent American farmers ranchers dairy men and women you both have lived through the agriculture of going back to the 1980s you've seen firsthand the foreclosure crisis followed by a grain embargo you know how destructive trade wars are on the farm especially when we compound additional market stresses and whether we're talking about on the farm are on the boardroom you know we all know that there needs to be a plan in place and so that's what we're going to be asking you here this morning what where's the plan in place farmers don't operate without one and I think it's reasonable to expect the same from from this administration let me tell you a story about a conversation I had last year over dinner with the European Union Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development Phil Hogan and I feel Hogan and I've gotten to be friends and he said Jim he says let me let me tell you something he says we just finished our agreement with Canada he says we're finishing in our agreement with Mexico or working with the mierqis Sur countries and we're negotiating with Japan and this is what had the EU AG Commissioner told me he says when you figure out what your trade policy is let us know and we'll dust off TPP and we'll get to work and so what we're trying to figure out is what our create policy is I want to hear the plan for getting our agriculture trade policy back on track today I'm not looking to point fingers or buck-passing or blaming the last administration that doesn't get the job done the time for all that is passed we're here in a trade war now for over a year I don't think anyone wins a trade war because I think everybody has leverage I mean we haven't even seen the Chinese talk about the one trillion dollars and American debt that they have are their ability to go to security markets every month and so this this tariff poker war I think is one in which no one wins so the president promised three and a half million American farmers and ranchers that he'd get them more of what they've had before and not more subsidies we know that for China the easiest thing for them to do is to buy more AG products they have the market and they have the need and clearly there are other issues at hand here that I know the the trade ambassador is trying to negotiate and that's important but what we want to know is gentlemen what I want to know is where are we today and where are we going and with that we'll look forward to hearing I'd like to defer to the ranking member of the subcommittee for any opening statement he might like to make

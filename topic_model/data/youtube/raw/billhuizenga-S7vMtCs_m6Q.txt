can bring the fake staff relief at least for now for a little while so the Senators in the end they passed a last-minute deal last night that funds the government through the middle of November house is expected to follow suit on this deal so the battle over disaster aid what was holding up the bill the bill and Senate Democrats say that they hope that the stalling on the whole thing to be complete is over watch this it is hard to see how the House Republicans could have could reject this proposal given the overwhelming it vote it received in the Senate receiving a majority of both parties which doesn't happen on major bills that often these days no that's for sure right it sure doesn't so join now by Republican congressman bill Huizenga he is the financial service on the Financial Services Committee and does not support this latest deal congressman welcome how good to have you here today hey Thank You Martha I appreciate the opportunity you know I think people are tired of hearing about deadlines and then hearing oh well actually it turned out that we could have funded FEMA for another week or so we could have had a little more trying to figure this out what's going on well my point exactly is we've been going through this you know this is this was avoidable it was unnecessary but it's the Senate you know it's like drama is us is is their name and I tell you it's it really is frustrating when you're sitting on that other side when we know that once again no tough decisions were made so we know that the fema disaster aid was trimmed a bit and spending was also trimmed a bit and that's how both sides got to get on this deal should we take away from that but you know it's possible that both sides can make some compromises that you can figure out a way to pay for disaster aid with these you know by cutting into spending well there's there's a lot of people that say this is this is new ground for the first time ever we have actually set a precedent here of taking some money out of other places in the budget to pay for these things and i equate it's sort of like if your car breaks down and it's at the shop and you know you got to get your transmission work done are you still going to go out to eat that this weekend or go to the movies and those kinds of things or are you going to reprioritize and that's really what it's about but is that truly what we saw happen here and if it is why aren't you happy with the deal well this is better frankly the Senate lowered that that FEMA funding by a billion dollars they chose to keep money in their force alindra and some of the other things but it is going to lower it a billion dollars and it's not about taking care of earthquake victims or flood victims it's a because we'd want to do that I want to do that we've seen those things here in Michigan we've seen it around around the country but it's about prioritizing and making sure that we're not spending more than what we're taking yeah and its progress you said funding for cylinder do you mean for green jobs or for the company cylinder itself which is now in bankruptcy what programs like like that the program that Solyndra yeah that cylinder ahead and you know it's you know everybody's tired of hearing about the $16 muffins out of the Department of Justice you know for the four there for their conferences and those kinds of things and and and the bottom line is Martha it's about responsibility and transparency and accountability for this government and it simply isn't there what kind of concessions in spending were made by for for what we were doing in the house yeah okay well first of all we we looked at the program and first and foremost I don't think it was enough it was a partial paid for not not a full paid for but one of the areas where they were taking that money out of was a program that many argue benefited the Detroit three having to do with advanced vehicle manufacturing and we know that GM Ford and Chrysler all were neutral on that bill despite what our friends in the Senate were saying because they had accessed the program it had been okay but it hadn't been the home run that they had thought about yeah that was one area where we were going to take a billion and a half dollars all right let's hope we don't revisit this in the middle of November and we can get somewhere before then congressman Huizenga we thank you very much for being with us today well I appreciate it Martha thank you what about 19 minutes past the hour now what does America need to learn from

mr. Chairman I rise to speak today in support of HR 1 635 the empowering students with an enhanced financial counseling Act which I introduced earlier this Congress was my friend congresswoman Susan Bonamici of Oregon as the school year begins high school seniors across the country are trying to figure out their next steps many of these students will ultimately decide to attend a traditional four-year university or Community College program parents and students know too well that the cost of college tuition has climbed dramatically over the last decade I know that many families are worried about how to afford a college education as college tuition has risen student loan debt has surged to more than one point four trillion dollars surpassing both national auto loan debt and credit card debt this should be of a concern to everyone not only do those with loan debt to their names many borrowers are entering the workforce with overwhelming debt that will play a role not only in their own lives but in the health of the American economy as a whole student loans can of course play a positive role and up in students attend college when they borrow mindfully and responsibly unfortunately many students enter into binding loan contracts with their respective universities without fully appreciating the gravity of the financial decision they're making and the consequences that can have on their futures a recent survey of current students and new graduates with a high level of debt found that more than forty percent had no recollection of having received financial counseling even though current law requires that students receive insurance counseling before receiving their first loan it is vitally important for students to be equipped with all the facts of their loan agreement so they can finance their post-secondary education responsibly and with eyes wide open the empowering students through enhanced financial counseling Act is designed to improve financial aid counseling for students receiving a Pell Grant or a federal loan HR 1635 increases the timing frequency and content of mandatory student loan counseling under current law borrowers are required to receive counseling only when they arrive on campus and upon graduation we makes it easy for borrowers to lose sight of just how much debt they are acquiring each year and the responsibilities they bear to pay it back hr:163 5 requires financial counseling for students and parents who participate in federal loan programs before they sign the dotted line on their loans after that students would participate in annual counseling so they can continue to understand their financial obligations and how new loans would affect their payments later on the importance of annually providing information was dramatically reinforced in a recent year when Indiana University reported they were able to reduce undergraduate Stafford loan disbursements by 11 percent 11 percent or 31 million dollars by telling students annually what their monthly payment would be after graduation before the students took out loans for the next school year this was more than a five fold decrease in outlays compared to public schools nationally in addition to making the counseling an annual event this bill would require the counseling to include recommendations to students to pursue all available grant work-study in scholarship assistance prior to taking out loans as well as provide them with information about the differences between federal and private loans in bankruptcy exit counseling would include the information about the borrower's remaining loan balance as well as what to anticipate throughout repayment of the loan the legislation would also require borrowers to affirmatively provide consent each year before receiving additional federal loans instead of automatically receiving the full offered amount every year the bill also equips low-income students with enhanced information about the terms and conditions of the Pell Grant program provided by providing annual financial counseling to all grant recipients the counseling will include information about the expenses the grants covers the level of assistance the students are able to receive in the ways to seek additional assistance in the case of changing financial circumstances under current law pell grant recipients are not required to receive any counseling this bipartisan legislation will up American students and Families borrow responsibly and understand their a package better so that new graduates have the very best chance of success upon graduation and mr. chairman with that I reserve the balance of my time

thank you uh clara thank you mayor i remember uh as one wasn't planning to talk about this but i do remember as the fires uh raged in this county uh driving through that trying to get all the aviation assets and everything we could possibly bring to bear but the the way this community has responded to such a challenge and such a test is so inspirational uh and i know that as claire said we will persevere we will persevere and we will be better at the end of the day um i truly believe that and i you know i have a special connection to smithville white it fortunately just got drawn into my new district but i my father grandfather survived the 1900 hurricane in galveston and my family moved to smithville for a couple years so i have a sort of special place in my heart for smithville it's really an honor to join you in a day that commemorates the sacrifices and the of the bravest of americans for the freedoms we hold so dear this beautiful memorial is a testament to those who have served and those who have given the ultimate sacrifice for generations our men and women in uniform have defended democracy in far corners of the world and as we gather here in peace and tranquility of smithville we are surrounded by a world that has become increasingly volatile it is fueled by extremist elements that fill the power vacuums created by uprisings and toppled regimes in faraway lands such as libya egypt and syria their hatred now circles the globe at the speed of the internet make no mistake america remains at war with this radical ideology and as we saw in boston in benghazi and in fort hood and in numerous other plots against americans our enemies are committed to their cause america's armed forces are our first and best line of defense against our enemies abroad and despite the issues that separated us politically we are united as a nation in support of an appreciation for our courageous american soldiers sailors airmen marines and coast guard on this day of remembrance i always pause to think about my father just like senator cornyn's father he was part of what we have now called the greatest generation in world war ii he was a b-17 bombardier navigator in the army air corps had the unbelievable experience sort of a bucket list thing to go to brenham texas and fly into b17 and they said congressman what was your dad's position and i said well he's a bomb a deer and they said wow he had the best view on the plane but the deadliest seat and when i flew in the plane i understood what they were talking about with the 450 calibers and the nazis targeting them he flew on the largest bombing mission in u.s history in support of the d-day invasion in normandy as people like my father senator cornyn's father maybe some of your parents grandparents brothers sisters sons and daughters who have fought at moments of peril in our nation's history today we have a new generation of greatness that he did the call to protect america after our homeland was attacked on 9 11. and i want to call the names of the fallen hero in this county sergeant mario rodriguez junior lance corporal cody stanley captain joshua meadows specialist joshua ray ferris tinam re priest chief petty officer matthew mills of navy seal team six and army staff sergeant joseph altman each with ties to bastrop county passed away between 2006 and 2011. today we honor their sacrifice with the sculpture of an angel a very fitting memorial of an angel here at veterans memorial park they are the are true angels defending freedom and to every man and woman who has don the uniform and to your families we thank you for your service and your sacrifice no less than our freedoms our constitutional democracy are in your hands americans veterans will forever hold a special standing and we must support them not only on the battlefield but when they come home when they come home last week i passed out of my committee the homeland security committee a measure that was passed by the house to help it's called the helping heroes fly act to provide expedited airports security screening to our wounded warriors and their families nothing disturbed me more greatly than to see one of our soldiers who fought the terrorists defended this nation to have to go through secondary screening in our own airports well that day is over that day is over we also passed legislation ensuring veterans disability compensation that that will increase wherever there's a cost of living increase in social security benefits to me that makes sense and also last month the first of two new community-based outpatient va clinics opened in my district where veterans can get the medical care that they need without driving hours to get it i'd like to leave you with the one of the greatest speeches i think of all time and yet one of the shortest speeches which i think is good advice for a lot of a lot of politicians and it was abraham lincoln's gettysburg aggress address and it has great on this day has such great significance his words are really timeless when he spoke these words at the graveyard when the dead were still there at gettysburg as they buried them and he wrote the world will little note nor long remember what we say here but it can never forget what they did here it is for us the living to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced it is for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation under god shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people and for the people shall never perish from the earth thank you for allowing me to speaker today to you i'm proud to represent you in the congress and i hope you're proud of me may god bless you texas and the united states of america thank you like to introduce our next guest major general jimmy j well

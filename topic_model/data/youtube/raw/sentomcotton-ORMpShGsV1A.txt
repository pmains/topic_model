let's bring in Army veteran in Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton he's author of a great book Only the Strong gives gives us a real perspective on what our foreign policy was and should be today uh Tom first of your sense on today Veterans Day instead of Senator Tom Cotton what about the veteran Tom Cotton hey guys thanks for having me on and happy Veterans Day to all the veterans out there this is a day when we remember their service and their sacrifice and defense of our nation you know one thing that really came home to me when I was researching and reading uh the material that I use for Only the Strong is sometimes the wars that we fought especially since World War II have seemed inconclusive or maybe public opinion has soured on them but every veteran who served in all of those Wars deserves our deepest respect and gratitude and Remembrance you know one thing I point out and only the strong is that over two-thirds of Vietnam veterans were volunteers like my father's even many of the conscripts did so willingly they didn't resist they didn't burn their draft cards they went out and fought their for their country at a time of need or consider the battle of Mogadishu which most Americans remember from the iconic book and movie Black Hawk Down For Those veterans that fought in Mogadishu on October 3rd and 4th 1993 that was their D-Day that that was their Okinawa so we should not only thank them for their service and sacrifice but remember how heroic it was even if it didn't have the Strategic consequences of a battle like D-Day even if it wasn't an award that remains as universally popular as World War II well Senator we're glad to have you on the program on this Veterans Day we also want to ask you about the balance of power that continues in the Senate as we continue counting votes some one week after anticipated to be one week after Tuesday of the midterm elections you have Nevada you have Arizona still counting vote Center Georgia we know is going to go to a runoff you know I think I have to ask you when I look at this is how do we sit today in 2022 where some states say for example Florida with a population of 22 million 21 million people can give us election results you know oftentimes in a contested tight race maybe not this year but oftentimes in a contested tight race within a day and in smaller States like Arizona Nevada have us waiting a week maybe more to find out who won yeah well it's mystifying the people of Arizona and Nevada deserve a lot better than the electoral system the politicians in those states have delivered to them in fact our nation deserves better when you have the fate of power in Congress hanging in the balance as you say Florida which has many millions of more people than those States was able to count ballots all in one night Arkansas which is about the size of Nevada We counted all of our ballots in one night these states need to take a hard look at their election laws just like Florida did 20 years ago you know after the 2000 presidential election I think many leaders in Florida were embarrassed about what had happened Democrats and Republicans together came together and they reformed their electoral system so you would have an efficient system that is confidence inspiring and gets results promptly I hope that whoever wins these races for the State House in Arizona and Nevada will take a careful look at their system in the future and reform them so we can have election results on Election night what does it say when when you look at some of these race boards in Arizona you've got Mark Kelly and Blake Masters and then in Nevada you have Adam laxaul Catherine Cortez masto and then in Georgia we've got that runoff and it looks like uh Mark Kelly's ahead in Arizona all the votes have not been counted it looks like Adam lacksaw it's ahead in Nevada so that would be one Republican one Democrat and then in Georgia we've got the runoff again can you believe this we might be this might determine the balance of power again in in Georgia what does it say to you when you look at these races and how close they are the Democrats and the Republicans are neck and neck in so many states we thought we were expecting a red wave we didn't necessarily see that across the country what do you make of that are we just completely divided well Ainsley we're still counting ballots out west I'm hopeful that Adam laxalt will hang on and give us our 50th seat and I still think there's a chance for Blake Masters to come back as well and give us our 51st as you say in Georgia to borrow from Yogi Bear it seems kind of like deja vu all over again but I'm confident that Herschel Walker is going to win all of your viewers can help him out by going to teamherchel.com and learning how they can pitch in but as you say Ainsley we're a closely divided nation uh and that's one reason why we work so hard in these campaigns turn out the voters who share our views about America's future and what we all hold dear we had some real really great results all around the country I mean if you look at Ron DeSantis and Marco Rubio's victories in Florida and the congressional candidates they helped to win or Governors who delivered strongly for their people like Brian Kemp in Georgia and Kim Reynolds in Iowa Mike dewine in Ohio they won big victories as well even in places where the top of the ticket came up a little short Lee zeldin in New York for instance he ran and a great campaign he helped four different congressional candidates get across the finish line which may be the difference in the House of Representatives yeah so I think if we look forward to the future if Republicans are focused on accomplishments and success and delivering results for our people then that's going to result in winning elections Mitch McConnell has gotten Brian Kemp to give the analytics and his door knocking and his lists and his methods and practices to urgel Walker in his Camp over the next few weeks that should be a huge help meanwhile which I don't think is helpful is Donald Trump seems to be brawling with Governor Ron DeSantis one of the superstars one of the best governors in the country and Donald Trump said this amongst a long missive untruth social Ron D sanctimonious is playing games the fake news asked him if he's going to run for president and he says I'm only focused on the governor's race I'm not looking into the future well in terms of royalty and class that's not really the right answer what is the right answer well I think the right answer right now is that we're still in the midst of the 2022 election Brian we're still counting ballots out west we have a lot more ballots to cast in 20 uh or in Georgia uh next month um look I decided not to be a candidate in 24 so I don't plan to be a pundit but I will say that Ron DeSantis had a huge victory in Florida because for four years he had focused on effective governance and delivering positive change for the people of Florida that's why he won such a huge Victory that's why so many people across America are voting with their feet by moving to Florida that's what anyone thinking about running for president in 2024 should be focused on on delivering results for our people do you worry about this hurting the Georgia effort because you guys really blew it two years ago yeah I believe everyone should be in the boat rowing in the same direction uh for helping Herschel Walker all your viewers like I said can go to Team herschel.com if they want to help out there really doesn't need to be any kind of Focus right now on 2024 in my opinion because whoever runs and wins in 2024 is going to need a governing majority in the Congress the way we start that over the next four weeks is to make sure that we elect Herschel Walker to represent the state of Georgia for the next six years so I would encourage everyone just to focus on helping Herschel Walker win this election on December 6th Senator Tom Cotton thanks so much it was great to see you thank you all happy Veterans Day to everyone thank you for your service military officer attorney went to Harvard Law School politician serves our country in that way as well so God bless you thank you

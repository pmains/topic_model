mr. president I rise today to speak in support of the VA accountability and whistleblower protection act bipartisan legislation that will help ensure that our veterans receive the care they deserve we are veterans more than we can ever repay for their dedicated service part of this debt is providing our veterans with timely high-quality health care in my home state of North Dakota our VA Medical Center is located in Fargo it not only serves the veterans in North Dakota but it also serves the western half of Minnesota as well and if there's one thing that our veterans have made very clear about the health center in Fargo from North Dakota and Minnesota our veterans have made very clear that it is an outstanding health care center that provides high quality service our veterans love the Fargo VA they do a great job and it's important to note that the vast majority of VA employees are dedicated to serving our veterans that are working diligently to provide services to veterans in their communities however as recent events have shown that are a number of instances were poor performance or misconduct by a VA employees had tragic consequences in cases like these the VA needs to have the ability to address these situations and to do it in a fair but expeditious manner this bipartisan legislation will provide the VA secretary with that Ness with the necessary tools to do just that and ensure that VA employees are putting our veterans first specifically this legislation establishes in law the office of accountability and whistleblower protection within the VA a post that was created earlier this year through executive order it authorizes the Secretary of vho and suspend demote or remove VA employees at any level and hastens the appeal and you process additionally it establishes protections for whistleblowers these are important reforms these are reforms that are important for our veterans and that's why the legislation has garnered the support of many veterans organizations it's garnered the support of our North Dakota VA commissioner as well as the veterans service organizations including the American Legion the AMVETS the Veterans of Foreign Wars ROK and Afghanistan Veterans of America the Military Officers Association of America and others and also it's garnered the support of co-sponsors on both sides of the aisle here in this chamber seventy-three years ago over 160,000 brave Allied troops landed on the beaches of Normandy I can think of no more appropriate day to pass legislation that honors our commitment to our veterans and helps ensure they receive the care that they have earned I want to thank the committee chairs senator Isakson of Georgia also senator tester of Montana for their outstanding bipartisan leadership on this important language and I particularly also want to thank Senator Marco Rubio of Florida who is the prime sponsor of this legislation and has been a champion for veterans issues I know that this accountability issue is one that he has spoken out on consistently often and passionately on behalf of our veterans and so I want to thank him for his leadership on this very important legislation and at this point yield to the prime sponsor of this bill Senator Marco Rubio the senator from Florida and I want to thank that the senator first kind comments this issue is one that I think matters to all 100 members of this chamber and millions of Americans and I to find it timely that here we are on 73 years of the day of the incredible sacrifices that were made on that beach in Normandy and that we have the opportunity to honor the men and women who have served us before then and since then particularly those who are now in need of services with the passage of what is truly landmark legislation

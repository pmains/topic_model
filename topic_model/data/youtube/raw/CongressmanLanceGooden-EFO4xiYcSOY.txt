welcome back to the program recently the app behind the vote-counting scandal in the Iowa caucuses has come under scrutiny and one US official is speaking out when America's Jack the sobic sat down with Congressman Lance good and to discuss the issue take a look we were very excited to welcome here to one of America news congressman Lance Gooden from Texas congressman thank you so much for being on with us thank you now you had some very interesting tweets recently that I caught my attention car lot of attention here Washington DC about the Iowa caucus results or the lack thereof tell me what were you seeing yeah well it's interesting it started the weekend before a few days before a poll was supposed to come out that always comes out and then suddenly those results were withheld and if you recall there were campaigns praising the Des Moines Register I believe it was for not releasing those results that's when I first thought okay there are already setting the stage Joe Biden is losing in these polls they're trying to save face for Joe and they're already trying to change the outcome perhaps and then on election night when these results should have been coming out we were looking at reporting and zero of the results were out at one point I remember commentator on CNN said that the results at this point four years prior were 90 something percent reported and at that point in time they were at 0% and so we found out that upon further review that this shadow company the name of it is shadow that produced the app that was designed to be a reporting tool for these these County parties was actually very historically in bed with the Clinton team people that had put together this app had been Clinton supporters Clinton campaign workers and then it's just kind of been baffling to see how these these Clinton surrogates of the past have been involved with a reporting process that we found perhaps protected candidates who are going to that night no isn't now we don't know so isn't there some kind of issue there in terms of conflict of interest when you have a clearly partisan team clearly partisan organization that conducting vote tabulation as opposed to mere services for candidates and campaigns yes there is and what they would argue as well this is a democratic caucus a Democratic primary a Democratic decision-making process and even if you concede that point that ok fine if it's partisan since it's a partisan process and it's only the democrats who are actually voting and what not what's interesting is that the the hillary backers of the past i mean just a few weeks ago you had hillary talking about bernie sanders and on positive terms and saying that he was a miserable person and not liked by anyone and we've seen these these clinton backers of the past insert themselves into this process and it's really fascinating when I talked to Democrats the night of the spate to stay the Union across the aisle it was a varied response some Democrats said I can't believe we we messed this up others said they're already trying to keep Bernie from winning just like they did the last time and then a few even blame the Russians it's crazy to me that there are Democrats who are still using this this Russian blame tool in a way to further their talking point that the Russians that all roads lead to Russia it's it's it's bizarre but conflicts of interests are absolutely present in this in this controversy now do you think this is something that anyone from the FEC might want to look into given the nature of the fact that it just looking on the surface level of this company it seems that they're mixing political money that's coming from the campaign's along with money that's going towards these counting of the votes the answer is maybe I don't know I don't the FEC doesn't seem to be all over enforcement and enforcement actions I believe they're they're very slow to respond I've seen that an enforcement actions that we've been tracking but there's definitely a conflict there I think probably one of the biggest impacts that this will have is this will eliminate Iowa's position as a state where people look to for guidance and to kind of kick off the presidential nominating contests I would even think that this will harm in future presidential election years when Republicans in an open seat went long after President Trump leaves office in four years when Republicans are fighting it out for the nomination I would think that Iowa will be less on the radar moving forward constantly it's good thanks so much sometimes to be done with us in American news thanks

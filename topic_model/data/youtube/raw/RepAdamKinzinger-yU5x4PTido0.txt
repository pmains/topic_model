each and every one of them believes the former president won the 2020 election joining us now is a republican who does not believe that outgoing Illinois Congressman on January 6 Select Committee Member Adam kinzinger Congressman appreciate you joining us I'm first of all what do you make a Blake Masters changing position on the 2020 election after seemingly after that call with the former president it's basically now saying look nothing matters uh I mean and that's what he's running as nothing matters it's just I'll tell the audience when I'm at the debate that the election wasn't stolen assuming that when I'm speaking to the base they won't have heard that because they they won't have watched the debate or they'll understand what I was doing but then I'll talk to them and say yeah I really like I mean this is a deal ultimately he's just running on a personality he's not running on anything that matters anything that means anything in his mind it's just how do I go out and convince these people he is a he knows obviously the election wasn't stolen but he thinks people are gullible he abuses them and uh you're seeing that all over the country right now Anderson in the past few weeks several Republicans who previously tried to distance themselves from that lie that the election was stolen um showed up to campaign for election deniers Virginia governor Glenn Younkin traveled to Arizona for a rally with Kerry Lake vice president Mike Pence is endorsed Blake Masters how do you reconcile that you can't I mean it's not reconcilable I mean you see somebody like Mike Pence that does a good thing on January 6th but since then but with few exceptions has said he's been so proud to serve with Donald Trump is working for people like Blake Masters it's all about this now Shadow campaign for president in 2024 if Donald Trump doesn't run and you know look Glenn young can I mean you can look at his campaign and say Here's a number of things he did right and how he spoke to people he had an opportunity if he did want to run Nationwide which is the rumor you know to go out and be a different candidate same with Mike Pence could have been that but it's all about in these last couple weeks turning out the base and you're going to need the base to win a primary so nothing matters there have also been attempts at voter intimidation like the two armed people in tactical gear watching a ballot Dropbox of all things in Arizona last week what does that say I mean how concerned are you about about that the safety of poll workers the potential of of you know I don't know violence surrounding the election or just the idea of inter people trying to people think that they are doing something by being armed watching people drop off ballot dropbox at ballot drop boxes which are again surveilled 24 7. yeah think about this Anderson so everybody in their life and and I think this is what Donald Trump did well everybody wants to fight for a cause they want to fight for a mission they want to feel like they're doing something bigger than themselves and that's a noble characteristic both in Americans and frankly human Humanity in general if you convince people that an election was stolen you'll get them to show up on the capitol on January 6. if you can convince people that there's ballot harvesting at dropboxes you can get these folks to show up armed to intimidate people but also think they're doing something to defend democracy and that's why I think it's so important to point out like yes they obviously there's voter intimidation but they are being abused I mean this is exactly when you look at the rise of authoritarianism and the rise of authority authoritarians they take people's good intentions and twist it into something else and you're seeing that and people that are watching these boxes like yes you have a right to in Arizona you can probably have a right to sit there with an AR-15 but there is no other reason to sit there with an arc 15 very openly but to show your strength and to intimidate yeah Congressman kinsiger I appreciate it thank you anytime

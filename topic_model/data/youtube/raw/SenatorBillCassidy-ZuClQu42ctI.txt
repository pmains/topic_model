or terminal is Republican senator Bill Cassidy from Louisiana Bill good to see you or Senator good to see you um I want to get your take first I mean we we heard in Edwards report that and we know this you and I know this that the the Strategic petroleum oil Reserve at a 37-year low we have that reserve for what we see happening in Florida right now when you have a hurricane hit or a disaster hit something that's unforeseen that we can tap into that Reserve to shore up American Supply Joe Biden has used it just to drive down prices uh and I would argue in anticipation for the midterm elections trying to help his party what say you I totally agree with you this is a political move we should be already planning to refill that Reserve but ideally we would not have had to have tapped into it we could have increased domestic production now by the way that portion of our energy economy that Biden does not control privately held lands the the rig count is up we're probably producing about a million more barrels per month on private lands we need president to open up the tap if you will on public lands off the coast of Louisiana Texas Etc that would create American jobs it would produce more American Energy it would drive down prices and we could leave the spr alone yeah Mr Senator and it's a really good point so you're saying you know what if you want to actually bring on more Supply drive down prices it might be beneficial if you open up more leases around America not just on private lands but on federal lands but instead of doing that you have Joe Biden saying you know what I'm going to attack the mom-and-pop gas stations that are that are trying to make a buck selling gas to the American people I'm going to attack them and tell them to lower prices as opposed to doing my job and increasing Supply I find that the president blames people when things are going wrong and he takes the credit when things are going well now that may be a natural human tendency but in here you should really reverse that the president has been responsible for a scarcity of oil and gasoline in our nation and now when there's a scarcity he's blaming others but then he takes credit when prices come down even though it is the production on private lands which is increasing Supply it's almost always opposite day when the president talks about oil and gas you know Senator also you know obviously we know the main driver of uh prices at the pump is crude oil prices but we also have you know local state and federal taxes in the inflation reduction act Joe Biden and Democrats put in additional tax on crude oil which in the end drives up the price for American consumers at the pump yeah it does but I'll go back Sean the key point we can make our economy stronger we can have better jobs for the American people really well-paying jobs if we just allow production of oil and gas on our own on our public lands there's been permits sitting at the um at the federal government level for six months eight months that have they been permitted these aren't new leases these are permits on existing leases if those permits have been granted they would already be sending oil and natural gas to be refined onto the shores of Louisiana now that would create American jobs and it creates American independence and it also drives down prices that's what the president has to answer to they've not done it yeah and I think it's a it's a really good point I think because oil prices have come down a lot of Americans might think that Joe Biden has been part of the solution but you really have oil traders who see a recession on the horizon and demand go down not supply up and therefore prices have come down it's it's uh bad news on the horizon not good news that it's dropped the price of oil and gas Senator I want to turn to Senator Joe manchin he was the one hold out in regard to build back better which actually turned into the inflation reduction act he flipped his vote voted for it a lot of you know Green New Deal uh you know parts of the inflation reduction act you know made it to the president's desk but as part of that deal voting for that package he had some oil and gas reform some pipeline reforms that he wanted that he was promised he was a corn husker Kickback if you will we're Republicans supporting Joe manchin for the reforms that he got for selling America out and voting for the inflation reduction act which is a misnomer for a bill now what I'm told just so a tweet that Manchester has asked that his that the permitting reform be pulled from the vote tonight so I think that is kind of an indication of what was happening the pipeline coming out of Texas should be coming out of West Virginia did really well doing transmission across state lines for Renewables did very well everybody else we were stuck in that same morass where a petty Democrat on based on her personal ideology his personal ideology can crush a program that would mean thousands of jobs and lower energy prices we need to fix that we need to have rules that are clear with timelines enforceable timelines and unfortunately Joe's Bill didn't do that we're waiting for that sort of clarity you know and that we have breaking news here streamer just came out and said that he will not take mansion's energy provision out of the bill he's going to take it out so it won't make it across the finish line and I know that Senator capito also from West Virginia has another bill she's a Republican in that she wants to actually have put into this package that she says and probably you say we'll do a lot more for streamlining the energy process and given more rights to States and taking it away from you know all the litigators yeah absolutely by the way wouldn't it have been nice if the process by which Schumer and Mansion came up could have included Republicans on the front end maybe some of Shelley's good stuff could have been put in there then we would have a permanent reform that would have passed it's not the way it's supposed to work it was kind of a back room deal unfortunately it's Fallen apart but no fortunately it's Fallen apart but unfortunately we will not have permanent reform that is real you know Senator uh I always look to you and when I talk about health care we think about health care you're a doctor but you know you're from Louisiana and energy State you know that energy sector really well thanks for joining me today and giving me your perspective on on energy and what's going to happen in the Senate uh with regard to um Senator manchin I appreciate it thank you Sean thank you all right now to Hurricane Ian intensifying into

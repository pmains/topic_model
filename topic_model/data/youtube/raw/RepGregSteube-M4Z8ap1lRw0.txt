much more than that joining me right now is Florida Congressman he is member of the House Ways and Means Committee and member of the House select subcommittee on the weaponization of the federal government Greg stuby Congressman thanks very much for being here I want to say I'm so happy to see you back at it I know you had that bad accident how are you doing how's your recovery going great unfortunately I can't fly still because of the blood that's in my lungs but that should be in March so I should be back in Washington uh mid to end of March and I look forward to getting back to the committee work and certainly on the select committee weaponization and the Ways and Means Committee we've got a lot of work that we need to do and I'm looking forward to getting back to DC well I was following you on Twitter and I was so horrified with what happened can you tell us a little about what happened yeah I was working on you know we're still dealing with the aftermaths of Ian down here in Southwest Florida we still have you know Limbs and that sort of thing down and I was uh uh trimming a very large limb on an oak tree I was about 25 feet up on an extension ladder with a chainsaw and uh the limb broke loose hit the extension ladder pushed flipped me up into the air and I fell about 25 feet I had a concussion I tore the ligaments in my neck I got a contusion in my lungs the blood clotting in my lungs which is why I can't fly and I cracked my pelvis so I'm still not white bearing on my right side because that crack in my pelvis is is healing and but everything else is I'm doing better the docks will clear me to fly like after that first week of March oh Congressman I am so sorry to hear all of this we are all praying for your strength and your recovery I'm so happy you're back here with me talking about your work which I know you love give us your reaction first off to what we're seeing at the border look I have been told for years that the CCP has abused our Visa process the student visa process has been abused they send people in there so that they can into America so that they can steal intellectual property and send it back to Beijing so why would they need people at the wide open Southern border and are they Anonymous now are they wanting people to be quote unquote the Enemy Within just in case a military conflict unfolds between the U.S and China your thoughts on the Rio sector uh really unleashing up to 30 Chinese Nationals into the country every day that's just the Rio Grande Valley yeah my response is outrage is a guy who served in the military and served an operation Iraqi freedom to defend our country against all enemies uh we have an Administration that doesn't care that our enemies are you know shooting balloons and surveilling our nuclear sites are bringing in their own Chinese Communist Party Nationals into our Southern border I've been saying for over two years now that we have an invasion at our Southern border and that's exactly what's going on and we have an Administration that is completely ignoring current law simply giving them a notice to appear which you know that they're not responding to or showing up for and then refusing to go in and get to these individuals after they've been deported because their amnesty claims are bogus uh it's it absolutely is beyond the pale uh it's it's surprising to me that Democrats are okay with compromising our national security all in the name of politization yeah that that's true um I'd like to hear more from the Democrats you make a great point but Congressman I don't understand why it feels like Joe Biden is constantly on his heels like apologizing to communist China I mean yesterday the president finally broke his silence on these three unidentified objects shot down last weekend and here again we look so stupid we have no idea where they are they appeared that they're not uh connected to China but how dumb do we look by this comment watch this I want to be clear we don't have any evidence that there has been a sudden increase in the number of objects in the sky we're now just seeing more of them partially because the steps we've taken to increase our Radars to narrow our radars and we have to keep adapting our approach to uh delaying to dealing with these challenges three had nothing China he claims but we shut them down anyway Florida Senator Marco Rubio tweeted this anyone in the administration or congress who suggests it was not intentional is either a fool or a liar or a CCP apologist he's talking about the larger spy balloon that was able to travel the country for a week California Congressman Daryl Isa also treated this a military officer reached out to me tonight Biden's speech on the balloon was all lies Congressman your reaction well they've been he's been lying to the American people ever since and before he got elected president and they've gotten away with it because the mainstream media doesn't hold him to account for their words that are completely false to the American people uh he allowed a Chinese Communist Party surveillance balloon that the payload was 90 feet long I mean think of how big that is there's some how most houses aren't 90 feet long um that surveilled nuclear sites B2 bomber sites went all the way across the country and one of the frustrating things when we had a briefing this past week or this week for members of Congress they told us that they knew about it on January 27th it was confirmed on January 28th they notified The Joint Chief staff uh on that day on the 28th the the president of course there's some confusion here but was notified for sure on the 31st and then by the fourth was when they shot it down so like eight days goes by while they're surveilling the Chinese Communist Party surveilling our country and our nuclear sites are in the b2s and they don't shoot down until it's already done all of its reconnaissance the bottom line is Joe Biden is compromise his family is compromised because the Chinese Communist party has given his family millions and millions of dollars and he's compromised and it's it's so clear and apparent to the American people how how covered it up they still won't allow an investigation into the origins of covid-19 in that Wuhan lab and it seems like Joe Biden is okay with that he is okay with it because it the end of the day doesn't care about the American people he cares about his family making money and he can't compromise the relationships that he has with the Chinese Communist party which is evident in all the evidence that we've seen in the laptop with Hunter Biden with actual testimony um from guys like Bob Alinsky who said that he was the big guy that was getting that 10 percent so he's compromised so he's going to allow the Chinese Communist party to do whatever they want and then lie to the American people about what's actually happening well this is so incredibly disturbing where is the media on this this is disgusting aside from a few of us no one's covering an a compromised influence peddling operation in the White House Congressman thanks very much we certainly will keep a spotlight on it be well sir Greg stuby this morning in Florida thank you all right we will take a break when we come back chat and Jeep

in his farewell speech President Obama said if anyone can put together an alternative healthcare plan that is demonstrably better and covers as many people at less cost he would publicly support it I feel the same way the ACA is not perfect and anyone who is serious about working to improve our health care system should count me as a willing partner but that is not what we have heard from president elect Trump and my Republican colleagues their irresponsible plan is to repeal Obamacare and then figure out what comes next that's like jumping ship without a life raft or a plan repealing Obamacare will leave 1.2 million people in my state without health insurance allow insurers to again denied coverage and based coverage based on pre-existing conditions or put annual and lifetime caps on coverage and denied young people the option of staying on their parents plan this will hurt real people who depend on the Affordable Care Act I urge my colleagues to join me in finding ways to improve our nation's health care system rather than burning it down and I yield back the balance of my time time of the gentleman has expired

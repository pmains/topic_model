I guess I mention all of that because if we're going to have a red wave right we need to make sure that the folks that are in Congress that are in our state legislatures Etc that there are doing the will of the people you know what then I think we need to talk to somebody who's going to be very involved in helping to create the Red Wave I know who you're calling you're calling Mike Johnson I'm calling Mike Johnson Congressman Mike Johnson from here in Northwest Louisiana one of the most powerful Republicans in the House of Representatives Congressman Johnson welcome back to American Crown radio sir hey guys it's great to hear your voices good to talk to you so this commitment to America that the Republican Party especially the Republican leadership uh uh you're very involved with this Steve scalise is involved with this um what is the commitment to America what what is it that you guys are doing right now we're going to try to recapture the magic that Newt Gingrich and the Republicans uh were able to uh bring about in in 1994. we all fondly remember the contract with America days the reason we remember it is because it was so effective and what they did is um about this time in that election cycle they went to the American people and they told them not just what they were against everything that Clinton and the Liberals and the Democrat Party were bringing about on the country they said what they were for and what they would do and so that contract with America became just that the the people bought into the idea and and they were able to recapture the majority for the first time in 40 years for the Republican party and we all know that the story um they were very successful they were able to check off all the boxes of those those promises they made and even Bill Clinton he never saw the light but he felt the Heat and he moderated and even worked with them for welfare reformants and other achievements so and we're hoping to do that again and his moderation probably is what got him reelected uh is somewhat in 96. I I've been looking at the plan no question you guys have four basic pillars of this an economy that's strong a nation that's safe a future that's built on freedom and a government that's accountable uh first of all the the economy that's strong what is how does that translate into actual policy uh great question look everybody knows the economy is going to be the number one driver in this election um the people are feeling the pain of this inflation and it's all brought about by uh by the team in charge Unified Government the Democrats in charge of the White House both houses of Congress so we are going to to bring about legislation policy changes and a shift uh so that we can fight inflation and lower the cost of living for everybody we all know we have to work on uh the policies related to the energy and that's really important to us in Louisiana of course so we have to reduce gas prices and make America energy independent again we were energy dominant under the Trump policies but we've gotten so far away from that and of course part of that too is strengthening our supply chain and ending our dependence on China that's a a central threat to our country and we have to take it seriously so you're going to see measures uh under that prong of the plan to go after all those all those markers and and if we have a big enough Red Wave we'll be able to do it the the second thing on this hallucination that's safe really encompasses uh as you mentioned the things that are most important to people in this election inflation the economy that type of thing right after that comes immigration and uh crime and you guys talk about that under a nation that's safe well exactly right I mean first and foremost everybody knows that open border has created so many crises for us on every front so we have to secure it we have to combat this this flood of illegal immigration that we have and and everything that's come along with that um whether you're talking about the fentanyl crisis I mean fentanyl overdoses is now the leading cause of death for Americans age 18 to 49. it's directly related to the open border because it's produced in China and trafficking here by the cartels they're having their way and they're killing innocent Americans and so um we're going to work on that we're going to end the Catch and Release loopholes and require legal status to get a job and eliminate welfare incentives that are bringing all these people over the border and obviously we've got to reduce crime we have to protect Public Safety the Democrats are all on record as that wanting to defund the police and disrespect the police that's what's wrong the chaos that we have right now so we're going to Institute exactly the opposite policies and in fact we're committing to support 200 000 more police officers around the country by uh offering recruiting bonuses and alike we've got to get serious about this we're going to get on top of it and uh that'll be a top priority okay so my lots of folks feel like to some degree that Republican leadership present company excluded has abandoned them you know there's there's a lot of folks that say that some members of Congress aren't supporting their conservative values how does this contract or this commitment to America how does it bring maybe some not rhinos so to speak but certainly those that may not be as conservative as others how does that bring them all onto the same page well I'll give you a little inside baseball as a member of the House leadership uh Team you know one of the things you've got to do is make sure let me give you a football metaphor because we're in Louisiana everything's either a hurricane or a football metaphor right when you take the field you you got to be ready to run your plays right and part of that is leadership it's coaching it's uh you know the team captains it's it's letting the members know what their role is um what position they're going to play on the field so to speak and and what plays they're responsible for and so doing all this organization on the front end uh is is a way to make that really effective to to let everybody know uh what their job is what what's expected of them and and I have some real hope that we're going to be able to do that well it's one thing Newt did well he told me one time um just just he and I were talking he said you know what the thing about governing and a majority is if you don't give the members a a rabbit to chase they'll create their own so I mean it's leadership 101 in any organization right so part of that is the organization on the front end and we've got a lot of plans for that Mike we have about a minute left you talk about Newt Gingrich there's I've been looking at this plan there's only one thing that I think is missing Newt Gingrich was the last speaker of the house to put out a balanced budget and all spending starts in the house I don't see anything in this about a balanced budget but if you guys really are trying to recreate the magic of Newt Gingrich doesn't the budget have to be in there somewhere absolutely I'm one of the biggest Advocates of that and we have uh I signed on to balanced budget amendment proposals and the rest and the RSC the Republican study committee the group I used to leave you know we produce a budget every year we have one that would balance in eight years and so we're going to push that aggressively because a 30 trillion dollar and Counting national debt is not sustainable and it's going to crush us we say China is a big threat that the national debt is the largest threat that we have as a nation so it'll be a top priority I promise you Congressman Mike Johnson thank you so much for being here with us on American ground radio and of course uh I like I like the plan I've looked at absolutely I I like the plan and and uh I'm hopeful that you guys are able to push this big wave and more importantly that you're able to push the country back towards the right thank you guys we'll be talking about it all along the way and you're welcome here anytime

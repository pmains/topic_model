it's the reason they do it we're joined now by the select committee member who played the lead role in today's hearing democratic congressman adam schiff of california uh mr chairman thanks for joining us so your panel laid out some some pretty stunning evidence today um from stalwart conservative republicans in addition to the to the election workers in your view how much if any of what we heard today reaches a threshold of actual criminality well you know again look i uh i've said for some time that i agreed with david carter the federal judge in california that this plot to overturn the election likely violated multiple federal laws now it's one thing to say there's enough evidence to begin an investigation it's another thing to say is there proof beyond a reasonable doubt and that latter judgment is going to be one for the department of justice to make but i do think that these issues have to be investigated by the department some of them you know obviously those who broke into the capital are under investigation and prosecution uh but the plot went beyond those that were uh in the capital that day and i do think those allegations merit investigation by the department today we heard a lot about this scheme to have states submit slates of fraudulent electors and i suppose the the hope was that vice president pence or somehow the confusion uh would allow pence or the congress to throw this back to the states and thus allowing trump to hold on to power we finally heard of donald trump's involvement in the scheme direct involvement and we heard this from the republican national committee chairwoman ronna mcdaniel she testified about that call in which donald trump was involved i want to play that for our viewers he turned the call over to mr eastman who then proceeded to talk about the importance of the rnc helping the campaign gather these contingent electors in case any of the legal challenges um that were ongoing change the result of any of the dates i think more just helping them reach out and assemble them but the my understanding is the campaign did take the lead and we just were helping them in that in that role what is the significance if any of the fact that trump initiated that call with the rnc chair well look you know we he was initiating that call to give the impromature of his support his weight behind what was being asked of this head of the republican national committee likewise this is why he's on the call with rudy giuliani to the arizona speaker of the house of representatives because this is donald trump's request that the speaker of the house a fellow republican in the absence of any proof call the legislature back into session decertify the biden electors and appoint uh some illegitimate electors for donald trump uh and you know likewise here he is meeting with his own attorney general being told that these claims he is making are bs but he's out there continuing to make these fraud claims that underlay the whole scheme so look this was his plot and and i think we demonstrated today his key involvement at different points along the way is that illegal is it a crime to submit fraudulent slates of electors well this will be ultimately up for the justice department to decide our job is really to expose what went on uh to prescribe legislative remedies to protect the country going forward but those kind of calls will have to be made i understand that i understand the decision to prosecute is up to the department of justice but you used to work in the u.s attorney's office in california you're a former assistant u.s attorney you have an idea of what laws might be involved without saying whether or not somebody should be prosecuted is that potentially a crime i'm not a lawyer help me out here well look i i think the the broader uh plot to overturn the election of which this was a part um likely violated multiple federal laws as judge carter held and i think it needs to be investigated not just by the congress but by the justice department but again i'm not prepared to reach a conclusion about what the justice department ought to do in terms of whether they have proof beyond a reasonable doubt of all the elements of a particular crime but i do think it needs to be investigated not just by the congress the vice chair of your committee liz cheney gave a rare public request it seemed for white house counsel pat sipoloni former white house counsel pat cipolloni to testify what's your understanding about why he has not yet agreed to testify and and do you feel like ultimately we will hear from him whether it's in taped recorded testimony or lie look i i hope he comes forward uh whether he ultimately will i don't know people are showing courage to do so we had several courageous people come before uh the committee today all of them in terms of the secretary of state the speaker from arizona gabe sterling you know they're members of the president's party two of them talked about how they supported the president one of them was out there campaigning for the president um and they've had the courage to stand up and do what's right and fulfill their their duty as public servants um whether mr simpoloni will feel you know that same um you know patriotic duty uh will be up to him and it'll be up to the committee how to respond if he doesn't what reasons are uh cipolloni or his attorneys or his representatives giving for not testifying you know that i really can't say it was gut wrenching listening to the two um women the election officials talk about the threats against them emotional testimony from shea moss the arizona speaker talked about the guns the loudspeakers the insane allegations against him sexualized threats threats against kids do you think the justice department is doing enough to go after the individuals behind these threats against election workers and public officials well you know i can't speak to you know whether they're doing enough in in every particular case uh i can't tell you you know as an elected official that so many of us are getting those kind of threats and we're getting them all the time and they seem to be uh increasing in intensity uh and it's just a danger not only to the individuals who work within our democracy but a danger the democracy itself uh and i'm glad that uh ms moss and her mother ruby freeman and these other officials could put a human face on what it means when the president of the united states comes down on you like a ton of bricks and as i mentioned at the hearing if he could do that to ruby freeman um and and shea moss and he can do that to loyal members of his party he can do it to anyone and that ought to get people to sit up and take notice because anyone could be next your committee chairman benny thompson said if people who support trump's election lies the big lie if they win key state government jobs then in 2024 we won't have close calls we'll have a catastrophe we saw what happened in new mexico with a county official refusing to certify because of some deranged theory having to do with election software do you think the nation has the public at large have any idea what's coming down the bike here well i don't know uh part of what we're trying to do is to sound the alarm that you know the system held but barely and the lie that put our system in jeopardy is still being used around the country uh in ways like you just described in new mexico and and elsewhere and people are running for office on a platform of ignoring the actual election results uh and just doing anything saying anything adopting any lie necessary to support whoever they want to win that's how a democracy comes to an end and we need to wake up to that threat because we've had the good fortune to live in a democracy all our lives and this democracy is centuries old um i think we've come to believe that somehow it is inevitable uh and it's not um we're gonna have to really uh stand up to protect it no it's the american experiment it's not the american proven theorem congressman schiff thank you so much good to see you as always coming up next

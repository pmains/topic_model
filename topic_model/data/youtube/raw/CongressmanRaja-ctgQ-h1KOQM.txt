us now is democratic congressman raja christa morthy of illinois a member of the intelligence and oversight committees hi congressman nice to have you on the show so at this hearing today a lawyer for the former president compared these highly classified documents to overdue library books what is your reaction to that i've never seen an overdue library book marked top secret and certainly i've never seen a library book that was subject to a subpoena where the person receiving it refused to comply and that's exactly what you have here you have 320 classified documents required basically recovered by the fbi in in the possession of president trump at mar-a-lago that he refused to turn over for months and that is nothing akin to an overdue library book situation this federal judge said that she is now considering releasing a more detailed inventory of what was taken from mar-a-lago during that fbi search what would you be looking for from that document well i you know i think that it would be interesting to know uh in more detail you know what was in those boxes of documents obviously we have to make sure that national security is preserved and i suspect that a lot of it will still be redacted but some of it won't be and i think what you'll probably see is a lot of commingling of classified documents with all kinds of personal papers and so forth um which apparently uh was happening even in the president's desk yeah i mean that's what the fbi says and that that there were at least three classified documents in one of the desks in the president's office it's interesting to note though congressman that trump's lawyers are not repeating his claim that he declassified these documents but does that make a difference here in terms of the national security risks of such highly sensitive material no it doesn't and they could not possibly make that claim for at least two reasons one at the time that the lawyers met with lawyers from the doj met with the lawyers for trump executive privilege was not asserted nor did they claim that there was some broad declassification order that was made with regard to those documents and and if you look at those documents they're all marked as classified and clearly they didn't say this has recently recently been declassified or showing any indicia of that and finally with regard to the statues they make no mention of classification if you are wrongfully withholding concealing or removing documents especially related to defense information which is the case under the espionage act that is a complete crime in and of itself are you encouraged to hear this judge that say that that she may allow the intelligence community's damage assessment to continue even if the prosecutor's work is paused that's right i think that um uh i i would be concerned about that um i think that uh you know you need to have them simultaneously occurring um and i hope that they find a way to accommodate that taking a step back here though i mean look this is remarkable how much the justice department has revealed about this investigation through their filings through the hearing today from what we've seen so far do you see evidence of potential crimes well i think that the the development of the fact pattern with regard to the obstruction of justice is very interesting as you can see from the the justice department's response with regard to the special master issue apparently when they went to mar-a-lago in person they were handed a red weld of papers of something like 38 classified documents and at that time they were not allowed to go to the storage room they were not allowed to look through uh the the boxes of documents for other classified materials and and so that just leads them to have more suspicions especially when they go back and they find a hundred classified documents intermingle among all these boxes you know the the lawyers for trump specifically said that they cr they conducted a diligent search and there were no remaining classified documents uh at the time of their meeting with the justice department lawyers so it looks really um it looks really fishy yeah a lot of questions about that um why the lawyer would certify that or the the point of contact for the archives the records would certify that their all the classified documents have been turned over and then the fbi would go months later and find more than 100 classified documents we really haven't heard much of an exclamation um explanation about that from the trump side congressman raja krishnamoorthy thank you so much for joining us thank you

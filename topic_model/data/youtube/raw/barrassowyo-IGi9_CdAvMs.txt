I come to the floor today to oppose the Kigali Amendment that's the United Nations treaty that is under consideration in this body today two years ago this body the United States Senate passed a bipartisan bill the goal of the bill was to reduce hydrofluorocarbons hfcs and do it domestically we passed it signed into law now these hfcs These are gases that are used in refrigerators air conditioners fire extinguishers and an insulation they also contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions so I worked in a bipartisan way to build a coalition of senators to pass the bill two years later here we are the law is now in effect in the United States parts of the law are still being implemented yet now today we are being asked to sign on to treaty obligations at the United Nations that I believe are solely unnecessary we've already passed bipartisan legislation to reduce hfc consumption and it has already become the law of the land many of the benefits and the jobs they're being touted are U.S Innovations and as a result of our domestic legislation not ratification of some U.N treaty we did it here we did it right I say we don't need to get entangled now in another United Nations treaty our own law can be amended if we would like it can be repealed it can be replaced depending on the impact and cost the U.S can make changes quickly it's much harder if not impossible to do it with an international treaty in fact when you take a look at the Kigali treaty an amendment there there's actually no way to withdraw from it if we ratify and join in when I take a look at this it is especially bad because it doubles down on the practice of treating China yes China as a developing country and the key word here is developing China is not a developing country but this treaty says they are developing country and it makes a big difference in terms of the treaty and the way that China is treated internationally because it gives China special treatment and I will tell you Mr President that they don't deserve the kind of treatment that they would get with this under this treaty China would get an extra 10 years an extra decade to produce hfcs well this places us the United States in a competitive disadvantage to China for 10 additional years interestingly and I think surprisingly people that when they hear this the U.S would also be expected to give more American taxpayer dollars to a U.N United Nations multilateral fund that's set aside to help developing nations the key word here is again developing and they want to treat China like a developing country so it would send more U.S dollars to China because they have access to this U.N multilateral fund well the United States is already the largest contributor to this fund we've given over a billion dollars of American taxpayer dollars to this United Nations so-called it's a slush fund but what about China if they contributed oh no Mr President China has taken 1.4 billion dollars out of the fund that we have contributed to because we're a developed nation and China is still theoretically and legally by this treaty still developing when you take a look at the debt that we have as a nation and you go and talk to any High School class or a junior high school classes I've done in Wyoming did it in Wheatland Wyoming with a bunch of really smart kids and they say okay when we have this debt who are we borrowing the money from see what they say oh we're borrowing it from China so we borrow from China to give to the multilateral fund under this Montreal protocol and what happens then the fund gives it to China the U.S borrows from China we give it to the United Nations the United Nations gives it to China so we're further in debt to China this makes zero sense even to the high school kids that make zero sense with ratification of the Kigali Amendment to the U.N treaty more and more American taxpayer dollars will be going to communist China now this is happening despite the fact that everyone knows that China is not a developing country and shouldn't be labeled as a developing country or treated as a developing country China is the second largest economy in the world China is our greatest economic and geopolitical rival the United States should not let China play by a special set of rules that are designed to give a helping hand to truly developing nations China doesn't fit but this is exactly what is outlined in the Kigali Amendment and that is why I have filed at the desk an amendment to what is being discussed on the floor of the Senate today my Amendment says the United States will not ratify this treaty until China is defined rightly as a developed country not a developing country but a developed country because they truly are no special treatment for China period everyone should stand up for that in this body each and every member so Senators have some decisions to make are you going to vote to allow China to play by a whole different set of rules we're going to vote to put America at a competitive disadvantage we're going to vote to continue to give American taxpayer dollars to China now members of my colleagues and friends on the other side of the aisle say it's not about China this is about hfc chemicals involved again we have already passed bipartisan legislation to reduce hfcs the law is still going into effect there is no excuse for any Senator to give China a handout at the expense of the American taxpayers the American hard-working families no excuse whatsoever Mr President we should not be Outsourcing our environmental policy I urge my colleagues to support my Amendment and once again say no special treatment for China

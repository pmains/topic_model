we're going to broaden out the conversation now and as the panelists take their seats take a look at how two of them sparred the last time Congress debated health care we want universal coverage by a date certain we want to ensure that whatever mechanism brings that about is very clear and is is as immediate as we can make it the better it means more government more bureaucracy more mandates more price controls or more taxes than we don't want to make it better Bob Dole and Tom Daschle in 1994 they are joining us now let me welcome the former Senate Republican leader Robert dole former Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle congresswoman maxine waters from the Democrats congressman mike pence from the Republicans and Senator Dole let me begin with you because Robert gives gave us a lot to chew on there on the one hand he says that the president is likely is ready to introduce legislation as you call for except you also heard him there he says the president is going to come up wednesday night and argue for that public option is that helpful well many has every right to do it but I don't think it's going to go anywhere and you know in our recommendations as Tom can verify we permit the public auction after of option after five years and the insurance companies haven't cleaned up their act then there's a trigger of sorts and you can get into a public option but I think we spent too much time on that this is a massive piece of legislation eleven twelve hundred pages and there's more to it than just a public option you know I think we ought to go back and look at a cost containment look at insurance reform look how we can encourage people to be more responsible themselves and there are a lot of things we can do that will not cost as much money because I know congressman when the water is very conservative when it comes to spending we want to help her if we can so is this going to provide the kind of fresh start you were calling for earlier this week well I don't want to say job because i was calling when I think a will though I think once the present is in charge and as ownership it's elevated you know I think he'll jump up in the polls because the people dem Republicans wherever they're from have confidence in the president estates it little wobbly these days but generally whether it's a Democrat or Republican in the White House when he takes on an issue claims ownership and said this is what I want to do not what some committee wants to do or some very powerful member wants to do I think it's a big big plus for the president let me bring your Democratic counterpart in here you know how to count the votes in the Senate the president clearly now going to make this argument for the for the public option but at least from my reading it doesn't appear that that's going to move the Democrats in the Senate who have to be moved there's been some pretty stiff opposition well George I think what you have to do we wouldn't had the first vote on the floor of either the house or the Senate you know we're all already deciding what's in what's out what's good what's not before we've had the first day of debate and I think what we ought to do is have a good debate the president's made it very clear where he stands now it's the Congress's opportunity to respond if they don't want it then we have to make an assessment at the end of the day whether all the other things we've done just as Bob said so well it is worth support you know we have an opportunity to expand coverage to every American to control costs for the first time in a real way to dramatically improve quality which we need so badly and to provide more Americans with greater choice my question for you I mean you both you and Senator dole called for this bipartisan approach that didn't include the public health insurance option do you think is it but as a fallback after five years as a matter of strategy is it better for the president to push for this at the front end knowing that it's going to upset a lot of Republicans and and hurt the chances for a bipartisan deal or is it better to have a kind of pre-emptive concession saying you know we've had some debates about this we're not ready to go well I my advice to the president would be what what others have suggested as well make yourself very clear make it clear what it is you want and and and then let's have the debate I you know at the end of the day you've got to make concessions you've got to negotiate there's always give and take but to give and take before you even get the debate under way seems a little premature to me and kind of congresswoman waters you've been a strong advocate this look health insurance option you said as part of the Progressive Caucus has said that they will not vote for any bill that doesn't include a robust option either first time through the house or when it comes back from the Senate in conference from what you heard from Robert Gibbs today the way he described the public health insurance option and the way he called it valuable and not essential is that going to get the support of you and other progressives well first of all we support what the president has said all along he'd like to see and that is a robust public option he campaigned on it he's continues to talk about his support for it and we're going to stand behind him Nancy Pelosi has said that nothing's going to pass that floor without a public option with all due respect to Senator Dole the Republicans are not going to support a credible health care reform bill led by the President or the Democrats we're not going to get their support I appreciate the work that's been done by the President to try and get a bipartisan bill but there will be no bipartisan bill and I would like senator Dole and former senators both to talk about what it means to use budget reconciliation with the majority of the Senators getting this bill passed rather than trying to continue to control the Republicans I want to get that question their first let me bring in congressman pens because you said no matter what Republicans just aren't going to submit anything the president calls for your response not true George and Maxine knows how much I like and respect her but Republicans are ready to work for comprehensive health care reform you know when I went home and did town hall meetings across the state of Indiana you know I heard people saying look we need health care reform we need to do something to lower the cost of health insurance for families and small businesses and lower the cost of health care but I also heard people say that they don't want a government-run plan that's going to lead to a government takeover of health care in this country but where's the paper with 800 billion dollars in higher if it's just if a public health insurance option is simply one choice among many as but as Robert Gibbs has said how is that a government run plans a really fair question and I just saw Robert Gibbs on the show say that a public option introduced would not affect people in any way shape or form look the American people know better I mean when I get up in front of folks and I say look in this economy an economy that just swelled a nine point seven percent unemployment we lost a thousand whirlpool jobs in Heaven's Ville Indiana two weeks ago when i was there in this economy there's no small business or large business worth its salt that isn't going to take a hard look at sending all of their employees to the federal government for their health insurance the minute the public option is available under the under the plan that's been proposed businesses have to pay what an eight percent payroll tax and they can cancel all their coverage i mean the president says you can keep your health insurance if if you like it but it's awful hard to keep your health insurance if your employer cancels what's the answer to that objection well what we have said from the very beginning is that we're going to level the playing field there's not going to be an inherent advantage george with the government plan so congressman Pence's prediction i think is is is really baseless you've got if you have a real competition he is he has supported and and rightfully so the fe HB model the federal employee health benefits plan model that's what we have in Congress we have a myriad of choice as a myriad of options you don't see anybody rushing to one over the other because there's equal competition and that's exactly what we would have in these exchanges as the president is proposed but George if I may and I think it's a fair point but there's not a public option in the federal employee benefits plan senator the reality is that that federal employees all ten million of us get to choose between five different private health insurance plans and they're affordable because federal employees are permitted to purchase health insurance on a nationwide basis we ought to allow the American people to purchase health insurance across state lines Robert Gibbs is right Alabama eighty-nine percent of the businesses in Alabama have to go to one health insurance company that's true in most states there's a virtual monopoly let's let the American people shop across state lines and bring real competition a government plan if I could just respond to real quickly that is a race to the bottom and a lot of people understand that they'd all go to the state with the lowest threshold for eligibility and and all the problems that we've seen in other cases but i would say i find it interesting that many of the conservative and republican opponents to a public option oppose it in large measure because it would be so popular I mean that's their argument everybody's going to go to this public plan even though we've guaranteed it's going to have a level playing field but their opposition is because it's going to be so popular they oppose it I find that logic they're dropping in addition they have some concern for the private sector the insurance industry and if they you know you know in our recommendations if they don't clean up their act in a period of five years you know they're going to suffer from it so I would oppose it I was suppose if the government was telling me I had five years to clean up freaking existing conditions and all the other things that are wrong that I would get to it on the first day so let me also ready pull the trigger and I am NOT for supporting five more years of these health insurers are ripping off the American problem is going to be at least an 85 year before the bill is implemented the co-payments the deductibles not ensuring people with pre-existing conditions they have shown us what they care about you have the president of Edna making 24 million dollars a year and the tent top ensures all of their CEOs are making over 10 million dollars a year we can't give them five more years of this we need credible comprehensive universal health care with a good robust public relations they don't need your way through the full five years let me also bring up the other question yeah the congressman raised earlier senator with you in part because there's precious little yet Republican support for what the president is called for the Democrats are considering this reconciliation option which would be Democrats trying to pass it on their own with a majority vote what would be the impact of that well I'll go and maybe I don't understand to understand people but I always felt that if if it's bipartisan Democrats with Republicans Republicans and Democrats it's going to have a lot of credibility particularly it's going to be to the Presidents Bill and the American people know of Maxine and Mike are voting for this bill it must be a pretty good bill or if you've offended every interest in town it must be a pretty good bill and I just think it it just elevates everything two or three notches and I think the American people say well Tom Daschle is Ford and Mike Pence is for to name 20 or 30 I'm an optimist I still think we're going to get a lot of Republicans to vote for final passage if it's a reasonable bill now we're not going to even if it includes the public option Oh wouldn't go that far without do something you are one of the most respected members of the United States Senate have been served with great distinction and you can't get Republicans to support a credible health care reform PR you're not going to do it maybe we've really seen this pattern from the beginning of the year I mean they passed a so-called stimulus bill that that was without any Republican ideas Republicans in the Senate budget-busting budget that passed they passed cap-and-trade on virtually a partisan basis now they're driving through this government takeover of health care I you know I really think the American people at least the town hall meetings I had George many Americans feel that this federal government is spiraling out of control they want they want to see us take a half step back and figure out how we can lower the cost of health insurance lower the cost of health care have a strategy for energy put our fiscal house in order and yet what they see is with all due respect to Maxine what they hear is well they're not working with us so we're just going to do it on our own label on to you senator Daschle because opportunity you don't have a bill where's your bill what have you come up with what are you offering as an alternative this president has reached across the aisle he's done everything he stroked his control he's bagged but the Republicans are not supporting him it's bigger than health care it is about President Obama and the Republicans have decided to use this by which to bring him down I Sally Maxine I don't believe that I believe it's true in this room and Republicans have a number of bills we have a broad proposal developed by Conor and Roy Blunt we're talking about as I described before allow Americans to purchase health insurance across state lines let's bring about malpractice reform to end the era of defensive medicine these are all ideas we're willing to bring to the table but we don't want a government takeover of health care paid for with a lovely brilliant actress attacks may bring this back to Senator Daschle because you were resistant this idea of using reconciliation earlier in the year and your public comments do you think it's necessary now well my first choice is to do what Bob Dole suggest to see if we can still find ways to make it a bipartisan bill we don't have enough Bob Dole's in the Senate today and that's the problem the problem but but I think I need work is not a work but but but i think if we can't do it any other way we shouldn't be bound by this by this process I think both parties have used it we use it to pass a single most important health bill ever in the last 20 years the children's health insurance plan we use reconciliation do that the Republicans tried to use it to pass the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge and they've used it for every tax cut so far so there's no question both Republicans and Democrats have used it in the past we're just about out of time I just have to ask you senator dole something else you have made a little bit of news on Friday when he told POLITICO but he thought your hair's for president tell me about Petraeus for president well it seemed like a good idea at the time but I don't have it don't I don't know I met him I don't know him don't know his politics you know he may be in the other party but I don't he just always impressed me as being very candid with the American people laying it all out there kind of an eisenhower you know he kind of he may not be worse than all the different things that we do in Congress and in the administration but each he's a quick study so you'd like to see him on the ticket for the Republicans sure why not maybe I should run it I can run right now excited oh thank you thank you all very much well

Thank You chairman Powell thank you for being here and thank you for also answering our questions I appreciate you your comments earlier in the introduction and noting which you admitted that the aggregate numbers do look good but I also noted in your presentation that there's a quote that you say and and it's this and while three fourths of whites responded in a recent federal user Reserve survey that they were doing at least okay financially in 2017 at least financed at least okay only two thirds of African Americans and Hispanics responded that way when it comes to financially whether they were doing okay and I think that's what this comes down to it comes down to those individuals who are living out there who are struggling how much money is in their pocket how much it can pay for I notice you talked about the wages are at point two seven percent price index increased to twenty two point three percent so in response to Senator Menendez's question about the steps that you were taking for broad-based wage growth you answered several things but let me ask you this is it your opinion that it is the feds responsibility or role to do something about wage growth broad-based wage growth to play a role there I think you know the what you've assigned us is literally maximum employment and stable prices so and also financial stability we have an overall responsibility for that maximum employment the sense of that is it's not just one measure it's it's a broad range of measures and I think we've really you know we've worked hard and and to provide support for the labor markets and that would it would wage growth comes in to really both of those things it comes in to maximum employment it also comes in to inflation because the other thing that you said that concerned me and you said one way to address an increase wage growth was incomes need to go up and they only go up with higher productivity and that's what you said needs to occur but let me ask you this because I have looked at some of the economists and studied some of the reports in the last 30 years or so and I know that was true probably from 1950 to 1970s that they were both going up together but we also have studies that show from 1973 to 2016 it was just the opposite there divergent that productivity went up by seventy three point seven percent but the hourly pay went up 12.5 percent only 12.5 percent that's five point nine times more more productivity than pay so knowing that how can you say that we need to focus on higher productivity because that will also increase wages so what I said was that over a long period of time wages can't go or grow up go up sustainably without productivity also increasing I'm not it's a different thing to say that higher productivity guarantees higher wages I didn't say that and I don't think that's true I know very well the charts are what tools then what are you doing to address wage growth we've ensure that we are increasing wages because because here's here's what's happening and and you know this if you're in your community and I'm hoping you are and you're talking to people across America you know that wages have been flat since 1973 that means that the people that I go home and need my family and Nevadans in general who are struggling they don't have enough money to pay for housing costs for healthcare for education for prescription drugs and what what do I tell them that you're doing to look out for their interest to help them and improve their lives with the tools that you have so the tool that we have is monetary policy and we can we can and we have now I appreciate that now let me ask you this can you just put it in terms if you're talking to a constituent in my state to explain to them what you're doing now remember Nevada was a place where we had the foreclosure crisis people lost their homes they lost their jobs we had 15 percent unemployment at one point in time underwater and in their homes what would you say to those individuals that you're doing to ensure one it doesn't happen again and to improve the wage growth for them we're doing everything we can with our tools to make sure that if you want a job you can have one job and having a wage liveable wage or two different things yeah over the long term we don't have those tools you have those tools Congress is Congress has the tools to assure stronger wage growth over time we really don't have that with oh we can move interest rates around to support activity support hiring we don't have the tools to support higher productivity for example which tends to lead to higher wages without guarantees you can work with us and tell us the tools are the things that would that can be done like increasing the minimum wage that might improve livable wages for individuals correct so I would say principally edge over long periods of time investing in education and in skills are the single that's the single best thing we can do to have a productive workforce and and and share prosperity widely which is what we all want and I know my time is up and I appreciate that but I'm concerned is that based on your own individual opinion or is that research or data or information that you know that shows that it's a lot of research okay thank you

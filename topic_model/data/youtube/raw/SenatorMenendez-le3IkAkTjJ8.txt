thank you um leader uh Durbin I appreciate it very much your leadership in this regard sorry to be a few minutes late we were chairing a Foreign Relations Committee hearing but I have to be honest with you I have to listen to Diego I think I'm a total failure Diego a fantastic story uh I'm pleased to join my colleagues I just wish there were some more and from the other side here with us as well as we take stock of a after a historic midterm election uh my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have a choice to make Republicans can continue to take radical and extreme positions to please their base or they can do the right thing as we did years ago when the gang of AIDS Senator Durbin and I were part of that past comprehensive immigration reforms with people like the late Senator John McCain Lindsey Graham Marco Rubio and others we did the right thing we got over 67 votes it's time to do the right thing again they can do that right thing and embrace immigration reform as common sense policy for our country they can choose hater division or they can choose to relegate the former president and his failed movement to the Dustbin of History in short they can hold fast to the Maga ideas that have cost them in three straight election Cycles or they can come to the table in good faith and with Good Will to protect immigrants and unlock all nations economic potential type of potential the eagle just exhibited look I recognize uh that as someone who has been in this struggle for nearly 30 years between the house and the Senate I may not get everything I want in an immigration deal but it is my hope that with the questions that Republicans are asking themselves today we can have a sensible debate and a real solution right now there is a window to move legislation that would protect all dreamers there is a window to find Common Ground whether it's on Farm Workers effective border security and more all we need and I don't say this in a partisan basis because as I said that gang of eight had four Republicans and four Democrats and got 67 votes but sometimes you just have to speak the truth all we need is for Republicans to find the political courage and willingness to finally fix a system we can all agree is broken the same political courage they found earlier this year to begin to address gun violence and to do that they need to reject the anti-immigrant wing of their party and follow their colleagues who in the past have been willing to come to the table and draft a bipartisan deal like I said we won't get everything agree on everything I should say but we can agree on that because more than anything these next few weeks offer us a chance at a fresh start a Fresh Starts towards protecting the largest possible Universe of DACA recipients and dreamers a fresh start towards more of the historic bipartisan agreements we achieved in the 117th Congress a fresh start towards the kind of immigration system that we deserve one that can fuel economic growth and do right by immigrants who just want a chance to fulfill the American dream so let's be clear about the choice my colleagues have as we approach the end of this Congress they can continue on a losing electoral strategy of demonizing immigrants or we can work together to achieve a deal for the country but Ten Years After DACA was established I want you to know this much you have our commitment that dreamers and their families are here to stay dreamers and their families are here to stay DACA and its recipients are not going anywhere and we're going to fight like hell to protect the hundreds of thousands who are eligible for its protections because I for one and not going to stop until the day we look into our undocumented Farm Workers that we look into others and be able to say and to every DACA recipient every DACA eligible person every Dreamer thank you very much [Applause]

Bhatia who just pulled the microphone a little closer to you to your lips thank you okay my name is Ilya v2g on behalf of my family and other victims of war crimes committed during the course of war I am here to offer you a the word of simple message Vick victims cannot be ignored if you want lasting peace in Balkans we cannot be ignored if you care about justice we cannot be ignored and if all you want is simple the truth we cannot be ignored as I hope to make clear today this history is still being written this committee can help shape it its course I come from an Albanian American opinion immigrant family in New York I grew up between United States and Kosovo with lots of siblings including my brother photos Julie Agron and Matt Matt we were close family one for all all for one but six boys in New York imagine the headaches we gave my mother in the late 90s we started hearing about the what was happening in Kosovo we were devastated to see images of our friends families being expelled from their homes and murdered in their villages we worried over sick thinking about my mother sister and my brother photos who were in Kosova at the time around this time we got word from American opinion community in New York that people are going to over to fight against President Milosh wishes barbara campaign in ethnic cleansing usually Agron Mehmet went without hesitation they weren't scared the last thing last thing I told him was be safe you know I expect you to come back towards the end of the war my brothers decided to stay in Kosovo and help with the rebuild efforts one day they agreed to go to go in a humanitarian mission to help some Romans neighbors get to a safe zone eventually Serbian police came in unmarked cars and in plain clothing and kidnapped my brothers they took them to the other side of Serbia - Petrova sello two years later their bodies were found on top of mass grave in Petrova sello with their hands tied behind their backs and bullet holes through the back of their heads my brothers were sent to these killing grounds because there were Albanians they were murdered because there were Americans this had devastated my family for the past 20 years my brother photos and I have been fighting for justice because the Serbian government won't in 2015 then Prime Minister Aleksandar vucic admitted as much he looked my brother photos in the eye and said in uncertain matter in my mind only two people are responsible for these murders then he named the names this is not some unsolved mystery it's a simple matter of will then as Prime Minister and now as a president aleksandrovitch's protects war criminals who murdered my brothers president vouches has no shame about this he has threatened my family for our efforts for five years now he has promised members of this committee and the United States president vice president that he would resolve this case earlier this year in Munich president bhootish brag to Serbian media that he told members of this committee that NATO officials should be extradited to Serbia not the war criminals who murdered American citizens this is a systemic problem with Serbia the government consistently protects war criminals creating a political culture that intimidates witnesses and victims convicted war criminals are regularly given a hero's welcome when they exit the ICT u prison recently president vucic had an audience to call slobodan milosevic a great leader Serbian war crimes in are failing in many ways the they issue very few indictments the few indictment they allow are low-level suspects and direct perpetrators superior officers are sealed from scrutiny Human Rights Watch Amnesty International the humanitarian Law Center the European Commission the European Parliament and others have each noted this defect recently Serbia did not have a leading war crime prosecutor for 18 months when Serbia Parliament finally elected one the candidate won't based on the pledge of priorities prioritizing cases of Serbian victims not cases like ours these are many other problems in illustrated in Bac lack of effort to will resolve war crimes mr. chairman this effort affects other issues that I know you are you care deeply about there are still over 1,300 missing persons for them from from the war many of whom had not been found because the cover of operation operations that could occur at the end of the war the main suspect in Bertucci's case and principal responsibly over many of these covert operation to date Serbia has not prosecuted a single person for the cover-ups the good news is that concrete things that the Congress the European Union Serbia and even Kosovo can help these causes first of all I urge you to do the following passed the H cone resolution 32 resolution regarding the case that was recently introduced by Republican Lee Selden chairman Engel and Republican grace mang when the Congress speaks Serbia listens make sure that the European Union carports prioritized these issues as they Serbia currently in the midst of their EU accession process to date Serbia hasn't allowed Serbia has been allowed to open relevant chapters just by making empty promises this must stop considering legislation to give the president and my family more tools to pursue justice in this case where Americans are killed abroad by foreign governments or advocate at the humic 'it's at the pre-trial Rights international hell forward a legislative proposal to some of your offices regarding these issues would be happy to share with any other members of the committee second I urge the European Union to do one simple thing start prioritizing prioritizing accountability for war crimes during both Serbia accessorie process during the related dialogue between Pristina and Belgrade there are a number of ways to do this mr. Chairman I strongly support a call to not allow Serbia to enter the EU until it cleans up it x-act Serbia should not be allowed to enter the EU until it proves that it can't do and will complete prosecution mid and high ranking war criminals and the responsible for the cover-up operation additional the international community has taken creativity approaches to work with the countries in the region that have similarly forced and faced problems such as locating trial locating trials outside the country borders it is now time for the EU United States and the international partners to consider similar options for Serbia also the EU should not shy away from difficulties between but relate issues like justice sector cooperation between Serbia and Kosovo both countries need to cooperate and all types of cross-border criminal investigations the EU should make sure that they have agreement in place to Serbian leaders I urge you to change a course there is no shame on facing ones past only honor until Serbian politician leaders support their efforts to honestly confront Serbia's pass Serbia will never become a great that we all know and hope it can't be finally we are truly grateful for the many recognition that the Kosovo government has given to my family and other war crime crime victims but the Kosovo government can't do more it should make war crime justice in Serbia and regional cooperation in war crimes cases front line issue and the dialogue with Serbia as a sovereign nation Kosovo also has the right to take real action in these cases we urge you the international community to start prioritizing these issues thank you for your consideration my testimony Thank You mr.

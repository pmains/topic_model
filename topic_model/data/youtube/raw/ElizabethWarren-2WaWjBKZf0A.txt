I will start this as soon as Bailey is through drinking water okay Bailey any time now we need strong guardrails to make sure that taxpayer dollars are not used to bailout corporations and corporate executives that don't need it we also need to make sure that public officials don't profit from this crisis and I've heard from a lot of people around this country who know exactly that Michael and California rights senator Warren my wife and I on a small auto repair shop for 41 years although we are considered an essential business and we're open every day business has completely dried up I hope and pray when the next stimulus installment is negotiated Congress votes to send more money directly into citizens bank accounts and no more to corporations this has got to be a tough time for you Michael and Dennis in Missouri writes first it's not about me it's about weed the corona virus is a wake-up call to show how weak our economy really is greatness is when a nation can stand for its people look at history Wall Street always causes economic chaos to the working-class and bailouts by our supposedly der's I hear you Dennis and Matthew in New York writes today we found out that there will be a pay freeze hiring freeze and promotion freeze as a millennial who graduated with mounds of student debt into the bust job market following the 2008 Great Recession now my career is facing another crippling hit who's gonna fight for the middle-class worker Thank You Matthew and thank you for writing these Americans are right any taxpayer assistance that goes to businesses need to come with serious strings attached to make sure that that money is being spent to help support payrolls to help support our economy not just to help make investors and corporate executives richer we also need strong conflict of interest rules so no public official can profit from this crisis that also means full public disclosure of the money that these companies spend on corporate lobbying when they're taking taxpayer dollars it means strengthening oversight including the Congressional Oversight Panel and if giant corporations are going to get taxpayer loans then they ought to have to put workers on their corporate boards that's real oversight our economy does best when we make investments from the grassroots and grow the economy up not from the treetops down we need government action to help pull our economy out of this ditch join me at Elizabeth Warren calm you

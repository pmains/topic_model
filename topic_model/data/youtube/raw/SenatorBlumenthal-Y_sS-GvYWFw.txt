thank you thank you madam secretary for your service and for your very steadfast and and effective work on behalf of our national security and your words earlier on behalf the Secret Service I think all of us share your view that they do to use your word a marvelous job of protecting the president and many other law enforcement functions I want to follow up on a line of questioning that Senator Graham began in terms of looking forward the kinds of systems maybe analogizing the secret service to the military that are used in that context and I wonder if you've given any thought to additional steps that can be taken to safeguard against but also monitor the kinds of abuses that obviously occurred or allegedly occurred here we are in tenth senator on doing a thorough examination of how we do it now and what we need to do to improve to make sure this never happens again so all those kinds of options are on the table thank you switching to a different subject i was recently approached by a couple a same-sex couple who are married under Connecticut law one of them is a citizen of the United States the other is not and I wrote to you and I want to thank you for your assistance in connection with their application for a green card to be held in abeyance you're probably familiar with the problems that arise under these circumstances but eventually we need a solution like the uniting families in America Act that can provide some longer-term solution to this problem but I wonder whether we can establish a policy of not deporting or in other words holding green cards for same-sex couples one of whom is here the other seeking a green card a senator the legal advice we have been given is that a lesson until the law is overturned by the court and I'm talking as to DOMA which we have the Department of Justice has urged be done but until that happens we cannot unilaterally give green cards based on that what we have done however is when we have same-sex couples if they fall within the other criteria of our priority memo our prosecutorial discretion memo that allows us to to intercede with removal and some of the other actions I'm a strong supporter as our other members of this committee in repealing DOMA the respect from aerotek which would provide a comprehensive solution I've been approached by other similar couples who have enormous contributions to make to this country and whose families are every bit deserving of the kind of recognition that we Accord to heterosexual couples and so I hope that I can work with you on this area of trying to devise solutions in the meantime that will enable those couples to continue to be families here as we need and they deserve thank you yes absolutely thank you madam secretary Thank You mr. chairman

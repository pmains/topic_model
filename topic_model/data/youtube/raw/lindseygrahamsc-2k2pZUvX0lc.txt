now earlier today on the Senate floor my next guest made a passionate plea for Congress to dig even deeper for answers and is also questioning why the former Secretary of State hid behind Susan Rice in the immediate aftermath of this deadly assault she couldn't be on TV to talk about what happened in the state department because she was distraught I don't buy that does anybody believe that about Secretary Clinton and if it's true is something the American people need to consider I don't believe it's true I don't believe she was incapable of going on television as Susan Rice says I believe they picked the person very loyal to the president who would say whatever they needed to be said and what she said was so far away from the truth it needs to be investigated and tonight we always want to hear from you you can log on to our Facebook page share your comments with us also time to trend to 10 you can sound off on Twitter use the hashtag at sean hannity that's my twitter address and here with reaction the man you just heard from South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham senator welcome back good to see you Thank You Sean thank you all right this is we're now learning this is a before during and after controversy for the Democrats before we learn in the Senate Intel report that had they taken the advice counsel and plea from ambassador Stevens and others to provide security this could have been prevented we learned that this has now been investigated correct right on 16 August ambassador Stevens sent a cable to Washington requesting additional security because the al-qaeda flag was flying all over Benghazi there were 10 al-qaeda training camps they couldn't protect the consulate from an attack on jun 10th the consulate had been attacked if Hillary Clinton didn't know why why not the Secretary of Defense testified publicly that he was aware of the threat reporting coming out of Benghazi so how could the secretary of the fence know about the request for additional security the threat level al Qaeda being in Benghazi and Secretary Clinton not now we also learn this week and I think this is probably as disturbing as anything because it magnifies the intensity and the premeditated lie that followed thereafter yes but we also learned this week that in fact while the raid had just begun that the top military advisors of the president were informed this was a terrorist attack and they knew that going into a meeting that day with the president when they informed him is that all true absolutely general ham will happen to be in Washington he got a report in real time the consulate is under attack a terrorist attack I've talked to my first survivor he said he saw 16 to 20 armed people come through the gate there was no protest outside the consulate they were carrying a banner in Arabic later identified to be the banner of Ansar al-sharia general ham tells Panetta and Dempsey they go to the White House they informed the president of a terrorist attack on the fifteenth and sixteenth and seventeenth of sep tember the FBI and germany interviews every survivor of the attack at the consulate not one of the mentioned a protest they all said it was a terrorist attack and named the al-qaeda affiliates but it goes deeper because the CIA much day CIA knew do within three or four days that they had the videos that showed that was no within 24 hours it was reported as a terrorist attack and here's my question how could the president the United States two weeks later say it was a protest call by caused by video and where was the intelligence community remember when Greg Hicks said he almost threw up his heart was broken he was stunned when Susan Rice said there's no evidence of a terrorist attack this was a protest caused by video why didn't somebody at the CIA who knew better pick up the phone and call the White House until the president quit lying about Benghazi right there's so much to be unearthed yet all right so they knew within 24 hours there was no process going on but then Susan Rice did the five sunday shows and a week after the president questions it goes before the United Nations now then but couldn't that we got the cover up before during now after right and after this narrative emerges that directly contradicted the original written narrative right they knew it wasn't a terrorist they knew was a terrorist attack but they purposely lied to us is now over now absolutely no one in Benghazi reported or protest there was no protest the Turkish ambassador left the consulate shortly before the attack not one and the Ambassador went to bed do you think he went to bed if her protesters outside the consulate the FBI had in their possession on the fifteenth the 16th and the 17th interviews of every survivor not one of them said there was a protest they all said it was a dare attack now why did Susan Rice jump the gun why did she tell the American people this was a protest caused by video because if the truth had come out seven weeks before an election about an al-qaeda what happened of us tickets you could see coming for months about where the people in Benghazi were telling Washington al Qaeda is all over Benghazi and nobody helped him and if Hillary Clinton was too distraught to appear on television on the fifteenth of September and I know she had to be distraught is she really capable of being commander chief if that is true and Susan Rice has said this twice the reason Hillary did not talk about what happened in Benghazi she's in charge of the consulate not Susan Rice is cuz she was too distraught so there's now does that bear does that does that make sense if it does should she be running for president all right then that brings me to my last and final question because we got the before the this request was given to the State Department was never given the support they asked during no help was sent then they lie in the cover-up now proven afterwards forget yet in this Senate Intelligence report they mentioned Hillary one time Dianne Feinstein said any culpability for Hillary is just false is is this well is this is this designed to protect her for a 2016 run I don't know what it's designed to do but I can tell you what it didn't do it did not shed any light on how she could have not known it was a death trap how could she not know what was going on her own consulate and let me tell you this it didn't say one word about the president the United States if in fact the Secretary of Defense told the White House in real time this was a terrorist attack and if every survivor told the FBI was a dare attack how could our president for two weeks till the world it was a protest caused by video seven weeks before the election we're just starting on Benghazi are we ever going to hear from the people that were there and we ever would have got Susan Rice what about Susan Rice so I want to hear from the people on the ground that were there the palaces why can't we hear from them to you they won't give us the witnesses I finally got one witness almost two years after the attack and I tell you my friend the story of Benghazi is penetrating chris christie is taking accountability for what went wrong on this watch any fired people name one person who's been fired for benghazi name one person mid hello Carol the ire before Dennis lying and lying to the American people about what happened to the four brave Americans unbelievable all right senator we're going to stay on it somebody has to investing me too gotta get neat Ruth rose you can't fix it appreciate it amen

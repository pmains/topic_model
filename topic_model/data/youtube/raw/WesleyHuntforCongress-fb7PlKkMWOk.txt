well today we celebrate his dream and his life and his legacy and reflect on the lessons we can still learn from this civil rights icon joining us right now is u.s congressional candidate and army veteran wesley hunt and co-author of black eye for america dr carol swain dr swain good morning to you let's start with you when you were at vanderbilt teaching the college kids how would you describe what martin luther king meant to america well i can tell you that even then i left in 2017 that dr king's message was being erased by some people on the political left but i can tell you that for the people that understood dr king and who had read his letter in a birmingham jail and his and heard the i have a dream speech or read that speech uh it was powerful and i think that if you look at this moment we end today with race relations if people would go back read that letter from a birmingham jail listen to read the i have a dream speech you can see that dr king preached a message that is so applicable today and he would be appalled by the racism that's coming from the political left and the reversal of all the gains of the civil rights movement and because of him we passed three major civil rights bills in the 1960s that i would argue ended systemic racism under the law and made it possible for people like me to come from poverty and have equal opportunity in america and so dr king changed so many millions of lives and he fought for white people as well as black people he was inclusive and wesley uh dr swain was talking about her family in your family you've got people who grew up on plantations and were slaves yes that's correct and martin luther king had a dream that one day we'd be judged not by the color of our skin but by the content of my character and my family is a living product of that dream my great-great-grandfather was a slave and three my brother my sister and i are all west point graduates we've had the opportunity to serve the greatest country in the world because of that dream and for me that dream continues i have the opportunity to run for united states congress and i'm actually running as a republican in a republican seat in a white majority district and we're the clear front runner here and that's because here in houston the citizens here are judging me by the content of my character not by the color of my skin his dream is still alive today and don't let the left tell you any wise this is still the greatest country in the world we are progressing quite well and my family is a product of that dream amen dr king was famous for peaceful protests what would he make of the way people protest today i mean it's the opposite of everything that he stood for and he talked about how the distance destinies of whites and blacks were tied together and he also recognized that america was diverse and wasn't just about white people and black people and when he started his discussions of economic justice after the passage of the civil rights bills he was working for all poor people he wasn't saying just black people he was always someone that believed in the american dream the declaration of independence the constitution and the bible he used christian principles that were integrated in his arguments and that was why he was so affected wesley i'll give you the final word you know his dream dr martin luther king's dream was meant for us to not be monolithic to think freely to have our own ideas to have our own thoughts yes you could be a black man that's a democrat or republican or whatever you want to be but it's basically about freedom it's basically about rising up as a people together regardless of what we look like and that is the american dream that's dr martin luther king's dream and i'm honored to be a part of it and we are honored to have both of you wesley hunt and dr carol swain thank you very much for joining us on this martin luther king jr god bless you

without objection well thank you mr. speaker I joined my colleagues today in supporting equality and dignity for every American regardless of who they love very soon the Supreme Court will make a historic decision about the rights of LGBT couples and families and it's my hope they respect that each of us deserves as American citizens the ability to have a family and to love who they love now the economic downturn illustrated how important it is for all families to access the protections of civil marriage so they can live with more certainty and dignity even in challenging times no matter what the court decides we'll keep pushing so people in loving committed relationships throughout this nation can say two simple words with extraordinary meeting I do and we'll keep fighting to ensure that people don't face discrimination based on who they love let me close with the words of President Kennedy who said in giving rides to others which belong to them we give rights to ourselves and to our country Thank You mr. speaker and I yield back

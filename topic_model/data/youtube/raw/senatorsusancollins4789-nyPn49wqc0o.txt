mr president and i want to thank the senator from alaska for yielding to me for this purpose and commend her as well as the senator from washington state for their extraordinary management of this bill mr president i'm pleased to report that the amendment i have called up in may pending is actually a bipartisan initiative it is co-sponsored by my colleague from virginia senator warner and its purpose is to help school officials to learn more easily about federal programs and incentives that are available to improve energy efficiency and thus lower costs for our nation's schools there are a number of federal initiatives already available to schools to help them become more energy efficient but in many cases schools are not taking full advantage of these programs the reason is that they are scattered across several agencies and difficult to access so i want to make clear to my colleagues that senator warner and i are not proposing the creation of any new programs to help schools become more energy efficient but rather more coordination and a streamlining of those programs that already exist our minimum would require the department of energy to be the leader of these programs and help schools identify and navigate them and that in turn would be a great service to our nation's schools mr president i would ask unanimous consent that my full statement be included in the record as if read without objection

first let me begin by praising the courage of the survivors of military sexual assault both women and men for coming forward and putting a spotlight on this issue in particular I want to commend the dedication of Jennifer Norris and Ruth more to Mainers who have made it their mission to change a broken system that does not put victims first I would also like to commend senator Gillibrand for her untiring leadership on this issue and for Senator McCaskill for her extraordinary leadership more than ten years ago when I was a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee I brought up the issue of military sexual assault and I will never forget the response of General George Casey to my comments he was completely dismissive said it really wasn't much of a problem even though these were serious crimes that traumatized survivors and erode the trust and discipline fundamental to every military unit now things have improved over the years and steps have been taken to improve the care that is provided to the survivors of such reprehensible crimes and to help ensure appropriate punishment for the perpetrators we've spearheaded many changes that Senator Gillibrand has mentioned that were included in the defense authorization bill last year but despite these important steps the work of translating the military stated policy of zero tolerance into reality he remains unfinished business as we will hear from the colonel today we are told repeatedly that we should just wait a few more months for a few more studies or even a few more years to see if the recently enacted provisions have made the difference I strongly disagree how many more victims are required to suffer before we take the action outlined and senator gillibrand bill which I am proud to co-sponsor how many lives must be ruined before we act rather than waiting for the results of yet more studies we must continue / to pursue reforms to increase the confidence of survivors to strengthen prevention efforts now and to ensure that justice will be done today fostering a culture of zero tolerance so that the number of assaults is greatly diminished remains a goal and not the reality ensuring that survivors do not think twice about reporting an assault for fear of retaliation or damage to their careers is still not fully a part of military culture and that must change

yeah Thank You mr. chairman and it's indeed an honor to have you all here today and talking about tourism in the United States and particularly I want to talk about tourism my district and that being Springfield Branson and Joplin Missouri southwest corner of the state and there was a lady named Herschend that her and her family found a little cave Marvel cave down in just south of us old probably 30 miles back in the late 50s and developed the cave people would like to take tours of this cave and then they decide well maybe they build a little theme park in 1880's theme park around it and that grew up in the Silver Dollar City and now they just announced a year ago that they're going to build the world's largest roller coat wooden roller coaster with the steepest drop 81 degree drop three inversions when they announce that to tell you the impact of tourism in this country and internationally when they announced that in Europe they had people from Europe literally that bought plane tickets came over got hotel rooms and rode the little train around Silver Dollar City where I used to ride with my grandmother I loved it when they'd hold her up on the trade and robber but and you'll hear static in the background but now those people came just to see where this was going to be built this large roller couldn't roller coaster from that I'd also tell you that my hometown is springfield missouri where a young college kid had a dream of putting a few fishing lures in the back of one of his dad's Brown Derby stores and said dad I think we can sell discount tackle that has grown into bass pro shops which is headquartered in springfield 3 over 7 million visitors to bass pro shops in springfield missouri last year and 1.9 million to Silver Dollar City not to mention all the folks in Branson which is the leading tourist destination in the United States in my opinion anyway I rest my case too long

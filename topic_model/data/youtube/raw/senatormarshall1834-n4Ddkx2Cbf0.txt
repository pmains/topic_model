today i'm honored to stand on this hallowed senate floor and share my gratitude for and the priorities of the people of kansas i want to start by thanking the people of kansas who believed in me and sent me here to represent them it's an honor of a lifetime to follow in the steps of heroic kansans who preceded me in this legislative body that includes sharing this to her duty with my longtime friend i've admired for decades and now my senior senator jerry moran as well as legends of this chamber my mentors bob dole and pat roberts but before i continue i want to say a special word of gratitude my family for all their support i would not be here today without the support of my wife of 37 years now elena our four children and their spouses our three grandchildren as well as my parents brother sister and extended family who in so many ways have contributed to our campaigns and the work we've done in congress i'm grateful for their understanding their unwavering support and sacrifice of privacy and family time but mostly i'm grateful for the values they passed on to me i'm grateful for the many teachers coaches pastors and personal friends who inspired me and gave me a solid foundation of values that have seen us through tough times these values provided the foundation for me a fifth generation farm kid to become a first generation college student and live my american dream as a physician in rural america and these values have become pillars the sturdiest of which in my life are faith family community education and hard work a faith that you live in your heart not wearing your shirt sleeve a family that loves and stands beside you no matter what a community where everyone looks out for each other an education that is the great equalizer leveling the playing field for all and finally a belief in hard work that paves the way to achieve your american dream as i traveled kansas this past year i carried these pillars with me while i heard from people all over the state and they gave me three very clear priorities number one provide for their safety health and security number two to bring back our jobs and economy and number three to protect our values and our god-given inalienable rights and i'm here in the senate to do just that to fight for the people of kansas for all americans but more than anyone else i'm here to fight for our children and grandchildren and like another great kansan the 34th president of the united states dwight david eisenhower the decisions i make will be most guided by the impact they'll have on future generations not by tonight's news or the simultaneous tweet that goes out as i raise my thumb up or down history will be the judge of my decisions not social media the model of the first infantry division of the united states army the big red one housed in my home state of kansas is no mission too difficult no sacrifice too great duty first it's with this fighting attitude i intend to fully fund our military secure our borders as the son and brother of a veteran and a veteran myself honor our commitment to those who protected our freedoms and values and as the son of a police chief fully support our law enforcement i'm so grateful for all law enforcement officers including those here at the u.s capitol they put their lives on the line every day and we join the entire nation in mourning those heroic officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice keeping us safe while we too often hear calls to defund the police and weaken our military readiness we are still a nation of law and order and we must advance president reagan's philosophy of peace through strength precovered we had the strongest economy in my lifetime thanks to republican-led policies put into place over the last four years lower taxes and deregulation resulted in historically low unemployment rates as well as american energy independence and affordable energy costs with agriculture being responsible for 40 percent of the kansas economy these policies along with strong trade agreements provided the tools necessary to ensure our farmers ranchers and producers remain profitable and our rural communities prosperous but here's what concerns me today like my grandma often told me at the family supper table there are three things you can count on from the current majority party they'll spend a lot of your money they'll raise your taxes and they'll increase regulations and just like my grandma warned within the first three months of this new administration we've seen an onslaught of harmful red tape proposed tax increases and an unprecedented spending spree fighting government red tape and working to ensure kansans keep more of their harder money as a means to harness job growth and help our economy recover will be what i work for each day lastly and most importantly as this was keeping me up late at night i was sent here to protect kansas values i was raised on these values are still held by the majority of americans and many of us are tired of being canceled censored and lectured to i acknowledge we all need to be woke up sometimes woke up for church on sundays woke as a child help milk the cows on my grandparents farm but we certainly don't need the woke mob to shake us out of bed every day like all nations and people we've made plenty of mistakes and we have room to grow but we kansans are still proud of our american history rather than cancel it we should embrace it america has accomplished incredible things and defeated enemies of freedom we should be proud of our history hang on to it learn from it god has given our nation enormous bounty and blessings to help feed the world maintain peace and protect human rights america has been called upon to be the salt of the earth and remain a bright burning candle not hidden under a bushel i believe our country will not fall from another military giant nor will succumb to economic failure created from foreign lands our greatest risk of failure comes from falling under our own weight if we continue to ignore the self-evident values our forefathers taught us indeed if we continue paying too much attention to silly hyperbole social media hype and political correctness this nation will struggle and not be the leader of the free world we intended it to be before i leave the subject of values i want to share how important and personal the sanctity of life is to me i had the honor as an obstetrician to deliver over 5 000 babies and i promise i will work as hard in this chamber to protect the lives of the unborn and our children as i did in the delivery room all those years i will always lead on this issue and protect our values leadership is the quality i most remember my dad looking for in praising in others and i've always tried to study and emulate great leaders and to this end as i sometimes wander the capital looking for solitude and inspiration i'm struck by one of my favorite paintings hanging in the in the capital rotunda in this portrait the artist depicts general george washington shortly after the revolutionary war surrendering his commission as an officer and behind washington resting on the otherwise empty king's throne are the robes of a king the robes he declined and the leadership lesson is that great leaders don't seize more power when they see the opportunity three months into this 117th congress it appears the power grab general washington decline is now the majority's primary modus operandi we've seen a record number of executive orders the first partisan coveted relief bill steps to grant d.c statehood to tip the scales of power and attempt to federalize elections and destroy election integrity with h.r 1 and now a commission to study expanding the supreme court like dorothy in the wizard of oz watching the grains of sand dropping through the hourglass additional partisan priorities remain on standby while the timing of dropping the ultimate power grab the elimination of the filibuster is carefully weighed the filibuster is meant to force both parties to work together to come up with long lasting policies which help americans without it we'll see tax laws and many other policies go up and down like a roller coaster creating uncertainty and making it impossible for long-term planning we are witnessing what may be the most blatantly hypocritical policy switch we've ever seen as most all senators and the president have been on record previously in support of the filibuster this flip-flop appears to be all in the name of greed and power so while i come to the senate intent on fighting against efforts to weaken our security harm our economy and diminish our american values i also want to discuss what i'm for my favorite memories of growing up were spending the great outdoors with the people i love the most my friends and family and make no mistake i will do everything in my power to leave this world cleaner safer and healthier than i found it and this can be accomplished while at the same time maintaining affordable energy and whether it's environmental policy or economic policy we need a level playing field both at home and abroad we must prioritize jobs for americans secure our supply chains and continue to develop fair and reciprocal trade agreements we must lower the cost of quality health care for all americans we must stop intellectual property theft along with economic coercion forced technology transfer and cyber espionage we must stop counterfeit products and elicit drugs from entering our nation in addition we must stop all censorship especially censorship of conservative thought that's under attack and for our grandchildren's sake we must modernize our polities surround surrounding big tech and social media before they engulf our society and so this nation still very young in the scheme of world history we have our challenges but as long as we stay true to our american values we'll get more right than we get wrong but we have to learn to forgive our past and forgive each other over this easter break one of my sons told me something that made my heart go pitter-patter he said dad capitalism keeps america at the tip of the spear capitalism keeps america at the tip of the spear you know he was spot on american innovation our pioneer spirit and hard work will always lead the way and bring victory over totalitarianism and singular thought and rule each and every american youth and young adult has their own story to write and my job here is to sure ensure everyone has their shot at happiness and their shot at their american dream while we cannot guarantee happiness for any of them those of us in this chamber can pave the way with an abundance of opportunity as the dreams of stories of so many americans are interweeved this american portrait this tapestry of blues and grays of pastels and earth tones will keep this republican this republic in good shape it's our diversity that makes us great and as long as we pass on our american values that have seen this nation through so many dark nights we will succeed through current and future trials and conflicts may god bless this great republic mr president i yield back

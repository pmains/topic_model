president trump's cabinet to invoke the 25th amendment to the constitution to remove him from office or for congress to impeach him again and this time convict him she's a member of the judiciary committee and she joins us now from washington congresswoman dean thank you so much uh for joining us and before i ask you about that i i do want to ask how you are uh we saw your own tweets and those of your son yesterday while you were in hiding it it was such a it seemed like such a deeply harrowing experience thank you for asking and i am fine i am well i am safe and i'm sorry i'm sorry that my family was so worried i'm sorry that staff was put at peril and risk i'm sad for our country that yesterday's disgraceful actions uh took place but i am fine and if anything judy i am more determined than ever to make differences to the good and and why is that what was it about yesterday that gives you that determination uh you know we saw in the morning we saw the president uh at a rally at the white house uh what i think of as lighting a fuse a fuse that was built along lies and disinformation that he spewed for the last four plus years and that others both in the legislature the house and the senate uh contributed to and in his administration uh it made me so sad to sit and i was in the gallery at the time of of all the uh insurrection and the attempted coup it made me so sad for our country but i will tell you over the course of the hours of the day i and everybody else was determined to get back into that chamber that had been so violently uh pierced uh that i call it a cathedral of our democracy i was so determined to get back there and finish our civic duty and make sure that we certified the election of joe biden which we did and now we see congresswoman dean you and i i as as of now i see 50 some other democrats in the house calling on the president to be removed by the 25th amendment or by impeachment but when it comes to the 25th amendment um what's what's is that something that you think is realistic i mean why why focus on that at this point well i if i think of the 25th amendment and the invoking of it i can think of no worse scenario that would call upon us demand us command us to invoke the 25th amendment he is unable unfit to discharge his duties as president as horrifically evidenced yesterday what more do we need he put this democracy he has over time put this democracy at pearl last night on the floor in defending the pennsylvania slate of electors all of the pennsylvania delegation had a chance to make very eloquent arguments but i chose to quote the words of john lewis he said that democracy isn't is not a state it is an act what we do as citizens elected or otherwise the acts that we take to build our democracy matter and what this president has done was the exact opposite he's working to tear down our democracy he is a threat to our peaceful existence and the world is watching and at this point given there just 13 12 13 days left in his time as president i guess my question is is it realistic we're hearing we just heard our yamiche alcindor reporting the vice president leaning against uh invoking the 25th amendment if you don't have him on board more than half the cabinet you can't get it done that means you'd be talking about congress impeaching we know what a long drawn-out process that is well we we know that we're very handicapped by the failed leadership of this administration uh vice president pence has been close up to this administration and knows better than you and i how unfit this president is the fact we also have the complication of a cabinet that is in disarray people are jumping ship many of them are not confirmed by the senate but the congress can play a role in invoking the 25th amendment if only we had some leadership from vice president pence but what you heard from speaker pelosi today was there are other tools at our disposal emergency urgent tools break the glass tools like impeach this president again we can move with greater speed i'm still here in dc i'm hoping we will be called back into session very very quickly to move forward with either the 25th amendment or impeachment if not i don't know the legal possibility the the possibility of both this man is an extraordinary grave threat uh to our democracy i i i i have to tell you how terrifying yesterday was terrifying for us as a nation not so much terrifying for me it didn't seem quite real uh even though it was quite real when they pierced the chamber of the house but it was terrifying for our nation the threat is now it is urgent it is past due i call upon vice president pence to invoke the 25th amendment failing that we should immediately impeach what is your fear that the president might do between now and january 20th well i never imagined judy frankly yesterday we all imagined disruption and chaos and protests but clearly that was not protests it would be wrong to call it that that was insurrection that was an attempted coup incited by the president the president has responsibilities and relationships or failed relationships around the globe so i worry internationally what mischief he might cause certainly i worry about his pardon power he's irresponsibly invoked it already this man is desperate he knows that he is criminally liable in many other places when he walks out that door so i don't even want to think of the nightmare scenarios of the havoc he could wreak he's already reached great havoc in our institutions in our our law enforcement and the department of justice there's much much more damage he can do at his fingertips we need to move swiftly and we i'm calling upon my colleagues in the house our colleagues in the senate vice president pence and this cabinet do what is right for this country protect our democracy it's precious it's fragile it's up to us what do you see how do you see the culpability of republicans in the congress who are supporting this president who went so far in the last few days to object to joe biden's electoral vote success thanks for asking me that i've tried really to process it judy over the course i've been in in congress just one term just beginning my second and of course served on judiciary through impeachment and so many other important pieces of legislation i've tried to process it so yesterday as i went into the chamber a little after one o'clock in the afternoon and the arguments began around arizona i stood there almost with my hand over my mouth hearing their arguments that were so false and they know it they were willingly spewing untruths stoking fear stoking ignorance smearing others and all i could say and i stood next to my colleague dean phillips and i said shame and i heard him say shame and we said shame shame that's before the insurrection before the attempted coup i do not understand my colleagues one thing i read upon was margaret chase smith if you remember she was an important figure a republican congresswoman who stood up during the mccarthy era and she called upon her and i'm going to paraphrase this she called upon her republican colleagues and said you can't search for victory political victory by riding the four horsemen of calumny she called them fear and ignorance and bigotry and smear you can't want to ride to victory on that four horsemen uh that's what i say to my republican colleagues are you willing to do that are you willing to sell your soul for political victory i call upon them to reject that and shed that representative madeleine dean of pennsylvania thank you very much thank you judy as lisa mentioned earlier there are serious questions today about the security in and around the capitol and why there

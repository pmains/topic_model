  CONGRESS -- AND CONGRESS CAN  LEAD ONE OF TWO'S:  ONE IN A  BODY BAG, TWO AFTER RIGHTLY  CERTIFYING TRUMP, THE WINNER. PETER CARLSON ADAM SCHIFF JOINS  US NOW. CONGRESSMAN, I HAVE TO SAY, WHE  I WAS WATCHING THIS AND SEEING  THIS UNFOLD AND SEEING THE TEXT  MESSAGES THAT E-MAILS, THE FACT  THAT THERE IS ADVANCE NOTICE,  FOR THE SECRET SERVICE, I  COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS  KNOWN AND WAS NOT A,  PREVENTED -- PREVENTED BUT B  THEY DIDN'T WANT TO BRING THE  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  AND SOME POINT OVER THIS AREA. WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS NOW THA  WE'VE GOT TO SUBPOENA VOTED ON? ARE YOU GOING TO TRY TO GET MOR  PEOPLE ASIDE FROM THE FOUR  PRESENTED TALK ABOUT THIS? >>> FIRST OF ALL YOU ARE  ACTUALLY RIGHT, IT IS REALLY  SHOCKING WHEN YOU SEE IN VIVID  DETAIL THE INFORMATION THE  SECRET SERVICE HAD. CANNOT WE GENERALLY ABOUT THE  VIOLENCE INTENDED AND TARGETED  AT THE CAPITOL, BUT ALSO THEIR  OWN PROTECT THESE, AND MOST  PARTICULARLY THE VICE PRESIDENT  OF THE UNITED STATES, AND THAT  THEY WOULD EVEN ENTERTAIN OR  ALLOW THE PRESIDENT TO ENTERTAI  FOR HOURS THE IDEA THAT HE WAS  GOING TO GO TO THE CAPITOL WITH  THIS ARMED MOB IS REALLY VERY  STARTLING. YES, WE INTEND TO BRING PEOPLE  BACK IN FROM THE SECRET SERVICE. SOME WHO MAY HAVE TO FIND A WAY  THAT WE DON'T FIND CREDIBLE KNO  WE HAVE OBTAINED THIS  DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE. BUT OTHER WITNESSES POTENTIALLY  THAT WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM AS  WELL. SO WE INTEND TO FOLLOW-UP IN  THAT WAY AND, OF COURSE, THE BI  WITNESS WE WANT TO HEAR FROM IS  THE FORMER PRESIDENT HIMSELF. I DO WANT TO GET TO THAT. CONGRESS AND ELLISON IS HERE  WITH LAURA AS WELL. I WOULD ASK YOU ONE MORE THING  ABOUT THE SECRET SERVICE:  WHAT  DID THEY DO ABOUT THOSE THREATS? SINCE YOU PRESENTED THIS  EVIDENCE THAT THEY KNEW, THEY  HAD A HEADS UP, THEY KNEW THAT  THEY WERE DIRECT AND CRUEL  THREATS AGAINST MEMBERS OF  CONGRESS TENDED TO REFER  GENERALLY SIX. >>> THE MORNING OF IN SOME  CASES. >>> I MEAN, FOR DAYS THEY KNEW  ABOUT THIS. AND SO WHY DIDN'T THEY DO  ANYTHING, WHAT SHOULD THEY HAVE  DONE, AND DID THEY LIE? DID SOME SECRET SERVICE AGENTS  LIE TO THE COMMITTEE ABOUT THIS? >>> WELL, THAT'S A VERY GOOD  QUESTION, AND WE ARE TO  DETERMINE WHETHER PEOPLE WORKIN  WITH US WHEN THEY TESTIFIED  BEFORE WE ARE ALSO LOOKING INTO  ISSUES WHICH I CAN COME INTO TH  PARTICULARS THAT THERE MAY HAVE  BEEN EFFORTS TO OBSTRUCT OUR  GETTING INFORMATION ABOUT SOME  OF THE INCIDENTS THAT WE TALKED  ABOUT AND AHEARING TODAY. SO THERE IS MORE TO GET TO THE  BOTTOM OF A. IN TERMS OF WHY THEY DIDN'T DO  MORE, TO TRY TO PROTECT THEIR -  THOSE THAT THEY ARE MEANT TO  SAFEGUARD AND GUARD, IS A VERY  GOOD QUESTION. THEY HAD ALL THIS INFORMATION. BUT, YOU KNOW, AGAIN, I THINK  SOME OF THE MOST POWERFUL  EVIDENCE IS THE FACT THAT THE  SECRET SERVICE TOLD THE  PRESIDENT ON THE MALL THAT DAY  THAT PEOPLE WOULDN'T GO THROUGH  THE METAL DETECTORS BECAUSE THE  WERE ARMED AND DIDN'T WANT TO  GIVE UP THEIR WEAPONS. AND HE WAS OKAY WITH THAT. IN FACT, HE WAS FINE WITH  WAS B

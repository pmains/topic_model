10 gop senators leaving their white house meeting without a bipartisan relief deal as democrats file a resolution to ram through the president's 1.9 trillion dollar plan without republican support south dakota senator mike rounds was a part of yesterday's meeting with the president and joins us now senator thank you for being here we appreciate it good morning good morning okay so how did you walk away from this meeting feeling did you feel like something could potentially get done in a bipartisan matter or do you think that this is going to get done without republicans well i think democrats are going to try to keep the heat on republicans but most certainly the president's not going to give up any of his strategic opportunities to put pressure on us but in the meantime i i think we had a very good dialogue i think he clearly understands that there is no such thing as a perfect plan and he listened to a lot of our concerns we did not expect going in that we would make a deal that's not what we went there for we went there to express our interest in trying to find a path forward that would be good for the country long term and not just simply a matter of republicans versus democrats and fighting it out and having changes that would last for a very short period of time and i think we had a president that understands that he's got a background with the senate so uh i came away thinking yeah there's look there's hope to try to find something in the future but it's not going to be easy clearly there's folks out there that would love to spend a huge amount of money and as long as it doesn't come out of their paycheck it comes as borrowed money for the next generation they're not afraid to spend it but it is senator refreshing to hear that word hope and i think that the full screen we're going to put up on the screen for the viewer sort of communicates that hope as well because when you compare the two plans there does look like there's some agreement let's pop this up and you can see right there 160 billion in each plan for covid they're close on the stimulus checks per person fourteen hundred dollars on the buy-in plan a thousand under the gop plan of course the big difference there is the income threshold it is much lower on the gop plan and then you have close on the weekly unemployment per person and a little bit of a difference as well of course 15 billion being a little in this context for low interest loans for small business if you're allowed to get into more specifics about what you learned in the meeting where was the agreement where was the disagreement yesterday well to begin with we wanted to be targeted and specific with regard to where we wanted to put resources we didn't want to go carte blanche across everything we we also recognized that that there were certain areas in which over an extended period of time we're going to need some additional resources and so we tried to extend out some of the areas in which we could use for vaccines for testing and so forth we're in agreement on those so when it comes to actually addressing the pandemic issues and fighting it and winning that battle and it really is a battle i think we were very close to being on the same wavelength as the president the place where we have differences is whether or not their plan is targeted enough they really wanted to spend a lot of money additional money on unemployment benefits for people that literally could like in south dakota by the time you're all done you could be making close to 90 000 a year in unemployment benefits that's not appropriate and it doesn't get people back to work so we wanted to target it we we've offered 300 additional per week on top of what you normally get with unemployment benefits and extending them through june 30th they wanted to extend them out over a longer period of time that's one area in which we've got a disagreement the other one is in as i showed them yesterday when i got home last week uh my wife showed me a check we got in the mail no i'm a member of the united states senate i got a stimulus check right that's not necessarily the way the stimulus checks that's the way it's supposed to work no it's not no offense i'm not against you making money but i think we all agree there are people that need it a lot more than senator mike rounds although we appreciate your time joining us this morning thank you thank you sir and thank you for joining us

>> JOINING US NOW IS DEMOCRATIC SENATOR, TIM KAINE OF VIRGINIA. THANK YOU FOR MAKING TIME TO BE WITH US TONIGHT, I HAVE SEVERAL THINGS I WANT TO DISCUSS WITH YOU. THE FIRST OF WHICH IS, YOU KNOW JOE BIDEN. WHAT HE SAID ON SATURDAY WHEN HE WAS APPARENTLY AD LIBBING WAS WUZHOU BIDEN MEANT. IT IS WHAT HE FELT. AND, FRANKLY, IT IS WHAT A LOT OF THE FREE WORLD FEELS LIKE RIGHT NOW THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS CROSSED FAR TOO MANY LINES NOW AND SOMETHING MORE THAN WHAT BEING DONE NEEDS TO BE DONE. >> ALI, YOU'RE RIGHT. JOE BIDEN WAS SPEAKING FROM THE HEART. THE WORDS THAT WE SPOKE. RALLYING FOLKS IN UKRAINE, AND ALSO RALLYING FOLKS IN RUSSIA WHERE THE OPPOSITION TO VLADIMIR PUTIN, BUT HE POINTED OUT TODAY THAT THIS IS NOT THE OFFICIAL POLICY, THE UNITED STATES HAVING LEARNED PAINFUL LESSONS IN THE PAST. DOESN'T PRESUME TO DETERMINE WHO LEADERS OF OTHER NATIONS SHOULD BE, BUT VLADIMIR PUTIN SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO EXERCISE THE SPIRIT OF INFLUENCE OVER ANY SQUARE CENTIMETER OF LAND OUTSIDE OF RUSSIA. THE RUSSIAN CITIZENS AND OTHERS LLLL DETERMINE HIS FUTURE THERE, BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT HE DOES NOT, IN HIS WAR CRIMES, AND EVEN IN THE ATROCITIES, HAVE A SPHERE OF INFLUENCE OUTSIDE OF ORDERS FOR RUSSIA. >> I GUESS THE PROBLEM IS THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA DON'T HAVE THAT RIGHT. IT IS NOT A DEMOCRACY. THEY DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE SOME ABILITY DEMOCRATICALLY TO PUT VLADIMIR PUTIN OUT OF OFFICE, THIS COULD HAVE A REVOLUTION WHEN IT'S THE SAME THING IN IRAN OR THE SAME THING IN SYRIA OR THE SAME THING IN A LOT OF OTHER PLACES IN THE WORLD WHERE THERE ARE ATROCITIES COMMITTED, SOMETIMES BY THEIR OWN LEADERS OR OTHERS. WHAT DOES -- HOW DOES ONE MAKE THAT ASPIRATION, THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN SHOULDN'T BE IN CHARGE INTO A REALITY, GIVEN IT'S NOT AMERIC POLICY TO REPLACTHE REGIME AND RUSSIA? >> IT IS IN OUR POLICY TO REPLACE A REGIME BECAUSE IF WE DECIDE WE CAN DO IT, OTHERS CAN  IT TOO, SO YOU OPEN A PANDORA'S BOX. ALSO, THE UNITED STATES IS OFF AND GOTTEN IT WRONG IN THE PAST. LET'S LOOK AT WHAT VLADIMIR PUTIN IS DOING. AFTER THE ANNEXATION OF CRIMEA IN 2014, EVEN IN THE RUSSIAN SPEAKING RUSSIAN AFFILIATED PARTS OF EASTERN UKRAINE, WOULD VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS DONE IS HAS PUSHED THE REST OF UKRAINE MORE AND MORE TOWARDS THE WEST, EVEN CITIES LIKE KHARKIV, THE RUSSIAN BORDER WITH THE RUSSIAN SPEAKERS -- THEY'VE LOOK AT WET RUSSIAN DOMINATION MEANS AND THEY SAID WE DON'T WANT ANY OF IT. SO VLADIMIR PUTIN IS THE BEST SALESMAN THAN WE HAVE NOW FOR DEMOCRACIES, FOR NATO, FOR ENDING TOGETHER AS ALLIES AGAINST RANTS, AND EVEN THOUGH HE CONTROLS THE RUSSIAN MEDIA, YOU WATCH WHAT'S HAPPENING IN RUSSIA, THEY'RE NOT ONLY ANTI WORK PROTEST, BUT YOU SEE RUSSIAN CITIZENS GOING TO BANG SAND ATMS IN WITHDRAWING THEIR PETTY SAVINGS AND RUBLES. THEY ARE GETTING IT. THE FLIP ON BANKS AND ATM'S IS A QUOTE, POLITICAL PROTEST BUT IT'S A POLITICAL PROTEST. THEY'RE REALIZING THAT THE MEGALOMANIA OF A WAR CRIMINAL AT THE TOP OF THE PYRAMID IS CONSIGNING THEM TO DEEPER AND DEEPER TRAGEDY, POVERTY, AND WE WILL NOT DETERMINE WHO RUSSIA'S LEADER IS, BUT THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE WILL. AND LITTLE BY LITTLE, THEY WILL SEE THAT THEIR OWN LEADERSHIP IS PUTTING THEM IN A PARIAH

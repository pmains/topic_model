well good morning what a pleasure to join you this morning thank you for being here thank you for having me here to join you I want to talk this morning about a very simple question why America what does it mean to be an American why did your family and my family come to America I asked that question because we're at a time of intense political division intense debates about who we are as Americans what it means to be American and what kind of future America's future is going to be now for everyone here we are the product of our family stories we are the product of the journey that brought us to this point here today for me many of you know my dad my dad if you go back to 1954 was a teenager high school kid he was involved as student council in Cuba when he got invited to be part of the revolution and the revolution in Cuba it was a lot of kids Fidel Castro was a student council leader in college by the way I did the student council in high school had no resemblance to a guerrilla movement we were much geekier in my student council but my father found himself as a teenager in 1954 and 55 and 56 and 57 being part of the revolution fighting a war against Batista a cruel corrupt oppressive dictator and when my dad was 17 but petit says police captured him and imprisoned him and tortured him they beat him halfway to death in a Cuban Dale he did jail he didn't know if he was gonna live or he was going to die now thankfully they ended up letting him out of that jail but when they let him go they began following him everywhere he went because they knew he was part of the revolution part of the underground they were hoping he would lead them to others in the underground at that point my grandfather said you just got to get out of the country if you stay here they're going to kill you so my dad at the time he applied to three US universities applied the University of Miami LSU and University of Texas UT was the first one that let him in which is how I came to be a Texan and so in 1957 my dad he got on a ferry boat from Cuba over to Key West they got in a Greyhound bus and took a Greyhound bus from Key West all the way to Austin Texas and an Austin 18 years old he had nothing had $100 in his underwear couldn't speak English his first job was washing dishes making 50 cents an hour now why did he have that job well because he couldn't speak English and you didn't have to speak English to wash dishes he could do that in any language now my dad had a pretty acute incentive to learn English why well he was enrolled at the University of Texas and his classes were all in English and if he didn't pass his classes if he flunked out they would revoke his student visa and if they revoked his student visa they'd send him back to Cuba and if they sent him back to Cuba they'd kill him so my father had an intense incentive to learn English and learn it quickly so he did a couple of things one of the things my dad did he signed up for Spanish 101 and he reverse engineered the class so the professor would be up front saying milk is leche and be sitting right okay let us milk okay that's good that's helpful the other thing my dad used to do is on Saturdays he'd go to the movies and he'd sit and watch the same movie three times in a row just spend the whole afternoon watching in the human mind is an amazing thing by the second or third time you start picking up the context you start understanding and you just start understanding language well history was of course continuing to move forward for everybody else so while my dad is in Austin getting started as a student my aunt might the asagna his younger sister was back in Cuba by the way and my family I also call a caller meet the a loca there's a reason my aunt is not allowed to talk to the press there's kind of a hierarchy in my family I'm the Comus most mellow one then there's my father and then there's my aunt God love her my aunt when I was growing up as a kid she used to have these shank lettuce which her daughter B B's B B's five years older than I am they the two of us would be playing and getting in trouble and somehow my Tia could pull off that that shank latha and you could be 30 feet away and just oh boom and she'd drop you to the ground but my Tia was still back in Cuban 59 when Castro would Castro wins the revolution revolution succeeds a brief moment of celebration and then Castro declares to the world he's a communist and begins lining up in executing dissidents begins seizing people's lands and Cuba discovered that they went from one SOB to an even worse sob so my aunt is still back there and she does the obvious next step she joins the counter-revolution fighting against Castro after he's taken over my tea among other things went and burned fields down in acts of protest to the new regime and then my aunt ends up being thrown in prison as well and tortured by Castro's goons and then a few years later she too flees Cuba comes to America comes to Texas now I tell that story because everyone here has a story like that everyone here has a story look some of us maybe it's you others maybe it's your parents or your grandparents your great-great great-great grand grandparents but the story of America is a story of risking everything for freedom and if you think about it if you actually design this country as a social experiment you sat down a group of sociologists and say we're gonna design a country and for four or five hundred years we're gonna sort we're gonna bring people from all over the world who are we gonna bring well we're not going to bring the richest we're not gonna bring the the smartest sorry about that that was not who we collectively were we're not going to bring the strongest we're going to bring the people crazy enough to risk everything for freedom and generation after generation after generation give me those across the globe who value being free above everything else and are willing to put it all on the line because your heart yearns to breathe free that's America that's who we are now there's all sorts of different manifestations of freedom there's freedom from oppression freedom not to the police our army kicking the door and throw you in jail and torture you our neighbors in Venezuela haven't experienced that freedom in a long time there's freedom of speech the right to stand up and speak whether you're right or wrong the right to call your president and ass that's true regardless of what party is and it's often been true regardless of what party they are [Laughter] but that freedom of speech what an incredible Liberty now think about the debates we're having right now on college campuses where college administrators say no no you can't be expressing that view no no we're going to censor what you say no those ideas are scary they're dangerous if you think about why your family and my family came to America it was precisely because you didn't have some higher power deciding what you get to say and what you don't get to say it was because we wanted that freedom of speech you wanted the freedom of religion that every one of us the right to worship to worship God to to live according to our faith and conscience a faith journey different for each one of us but it's not the government that gets to decide who and how and when we worship and then there's the freedom of our dreams you know most of the history of mankind has been a history of oppression it's been a history of kings and queens it's been a history of power from the top down and it's been a history of whatever station you were born into that is the station in which you shall stay if you're blessed and you're born into the family of aristocrats and royalty well then you can live the life of kings but if you're born into the home of a cobbler then a cobbler you shall be at the end of the day as a freedom that is right at the heart of what America is any one of us doesn't matter where we come from doesn't matter what we started with doesn't matter if we could speak English when we got started doesn't matter if we were washing dishes what matters in them in America is how big your heart is and how big your dream is and how hard you were willing to work to achieve that dream and how hard you're willing to work when you fail and note I said the word win and not if a few weeks ago my daughter Caroline who's 10 she played in her fifth grade basketball team I was one of the assistant coaches on the team they made it all the way to the finals and they lost by one point and I had a crying little ten-year-old asking me dad why did we lose and I said look losing it's part of life but it's especially part of an extraordinary life you made it to the finals and next year you're gonna win but I told her look I tell you something I had four years I kept a file folder labeled failures but I just collected everything I tried and failed I said you know Caroline if you don't ever fail at anything it means you're not trying anything here's an easy path to never ever ever fail sit in your room stare at the ceiling you'll never fail you will accomplish nothing but you'll never fail and that's the incredible thing about America is that you can go and fail and get punched in the face and then get yourself back up again and if you still have the burning desire if you still have the vision you can climb the mountaintop that's the freedom look small businesses if you care about jobs and economic growth you care about small businesses why two-thirds of all new jobs come from small businesses how do we get small businesses to grow well it ain't rocket science there are two major tools that government has tax reform and reg reform and history is real simple every time we cut taxes simplify the tax code every time we repeal job-killing regulations the exact same thing happens which is more and more small businesses are started grow expand create jobs and opportunity by the way the converse is equally true every time we go down the path of higher taxes higher regulations bigger government you see economic stagnation you see small businesses struggling and gasping we're seeing the results right now of an economy that's booming we own that we all know the basic numbers the lowest unemployment in over 50 years the lowest Hispanic unemployment ever recorded the lowest african-american unemployment ever recorded the lowest asian-american unemployment ever recorded the lowest unemployment for women in 70 years look these are incredible results but we shouldn't be surprised because if we understand where we started why America what is it that brought our families to America it's that most of the rest of the world you can't do what you can do here we're entering the 2020 presidential cycle on the Democratic side we have I think currently 386 candidates for president but they're just getting started and we are seeing a cascade to the left socialism you want socialism 70 percent tax rate I'll give you 80 how about 80 give me 90 this is a moment where a country has a debate who we are and what do we believe and I'll tell you in the Hispanic community we're blessed to have a reason to understand one of the ways you lose Liberty they should take it for granted our community is blessed that typically our journey to freedom is much more recent and acute than many other Americans that means it's harder to forget let me encourage you don't forget January 2013 when I was first sworn into office in the Senate the Bible that I was sworn in on was my father's Bible today my dad's a pastor and as I was taking that you couldn't help but thinking back to 1957 thinking back to that teenage kid washing dishes 50 cents an hour and if someone had come to my dad dad and said your son 50 years from now will be a United States Senator representing the state of Texas never could have imagined that that teenage immigrant that it was easier to imagine fly into the moon than that possibility and there my father was sitting in the Senate gallery with tears streaming down his face and as he said that day only in America [Applause] what we have here is special it is unique it is precious and it is very much worth fighting for and I'm proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with each of you fighting to preserve and protect the freedom that makes America that shining city on a hill thank you [Applause]

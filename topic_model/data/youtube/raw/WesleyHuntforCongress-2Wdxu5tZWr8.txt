border officials overwhelmed by migrants as the future of title 42 stays unclear and their struggle is putting all of us all americans at risk as we learn a suspected terrorist was released into the u.s by agents and was not arrested until two weeks later u.s congressional gop candidate out of texas wesley hunt is here now to react wesley great to have you on the program why wasn't this guy flagged as a suspected terrorist upon initial contact why was he given a gps and said on your merry way we hope you come back because we have an administration right now that doesn't believe in following laws we have an open border policy and for whatever reason this administration thinks that they have a mandate to behave like a socialist country and that's actually not what the people wanted president biden barely won the presidency they have a razor thin margin in the house and in the senate and they're treating this country as if it's venezuela especially with what we're seeing with our very poorest border and right now because of these poor policies this is the most i've ever paid for gas a couple of days ago i had to fill my truck up and it was so emotional that i felt like i had to pour one out for the homies okay this is this is the worst inflation we've seen in my entire lifetime look at what's happening at the border and to cap it all off on top of that there is an obvious assault on our oil and gas industry that impacts me right here in congressional district 38 right here in houston texas these poor policies are making us less safe it's the number one role the responsibility to preserve our sovereignty and to keep our citizens safe and that's why we have terrorists coming into this country carte blanche because we have an administration that does not want to adhere to the laws of this country yeah we want to talk to you a little bit more about oil and gas in just a minute but staying on the immigration topic for a moment hundreds of migrants were released into the u.s yesterday the day that title 42 was supposed to end governor greg abbott was talked to made a comment about how his plan is going to continue regarding bussing more migrants to washington dc take a listen to what he had to say yesterday we're up to our 45th bus now when you add a zero to that i think washington d.c is going to soon find out they're going to be dealing with the same consequences we're dealing with president biden has never once even tried to contact me about the border uh the the czar for the border kamala harris has ever once tried to contact me so there's governor abbott saying he's getting no federal help when it comes to securing the southern border there are some questions over whether governor abbott is doing enough regarding this issue some republicans are urging him to declare an invasion and then he could use state resources to deport illegal immigrants is that something that you would support right you know you know potentially but again this is actually not governor's abbot wrote governor abbott's role to protect the border and right now if we have a covet issue like the left is still trying to propose unless this administration is still adhering to then how can you possibly overturn title 42 this doesn't make sense it's it's this constant controversy that we're seeing uh from the top of this ticket that has this entire country confused and the governor abbott is doing the best he can to keep us safe but just like i said that's not his role this is the federal government's role to preserve the sovereignty preserve the borders of this nation and we have got to do better meantime wesley you've been spending the last few weeks visiting oil and gas companies across the country to discuss the challenges these companies and the industry are facing under joe biden yet here's what he said yesterday about quote unquote the transition on gas listen when it comes to the gas crisis we're going through an incredible transition that is taking place that god willing when it's over we'll be stronger and the world will be stronger unless we lie in on fossil fuels when this is over wesley what was your reaction and your reaction for the average american who's struggling right now to just fill up their tank when joe biden says the pain at the pump we're all feeling is an incredible transition well he's got his words wrong it's not about energy transition it's about energy addition i've been traveling all over texas i've been in the premier base and i've been in midland i visited new mexico or we're going to go to pennsylvania we're also going to go to the midwest and look at some biodiesel in iowa look the bottom line is this it's an all hands on deck approach to fulfill the energy needs of this country and what i am seeing from all the brave men and women across this country that provide energy for us every single day that allow us to put gas in our cars that allows us to turn our lights on that allow us to stay cool in this texas heat that's crazy right now is because they sacrifice every single day for us to be able to have it we need more of them and this administration is trying to kill our industry but we are not going to allow that to happen wesley hunt joining us on a very busy tuesday in his state he won his primary race but there are the runoff races happening in the great state of texas today you can sit pretty today and he is pretty [Music]

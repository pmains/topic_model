hello Jay streets so uh you would think that they've been sitting here a while according to the response yeah so uh I know you like short plenaries and short planners here we've been told to talk about setting the table for peace but I would be amiss if I didn't first just say how great it feels to be here on the 10th anniversary of J Street marabous been with us many times for me looking back when we were still thinking what the name would be drafting the first papers with Jeremy the first pitches and J streets grown from strength to think and a decade of amazing leadership by Jeremy ben-ami and if you'd have told me if you'd have told me ten years ago this is where we'd be I don't think I'd have imagined it could have been this much of an achievement but if you'd have told me ten years ago some other things that might also have given me a reason to pause to consider what the future holds and maybe it's my lack of imagination but if you'd have told me that Gaza would still be under siege Gaza and the West Bank divided the Palestinian leadership despite what we heard still bereft of a strategy if you'd have told me that the cast of characters in the Israeli government would look as it does that the narrative would so often be one that is offensive and racist if you'd have told me that a leader of the new Israel fund would be held for questioning at Ben Gurion Airport for her political views and affiliations or that another Jewish group jvp would be banned from entering Israel I look I also couldn't have imagined an American president who calls his former FBI director a slimeball or that the priestly duties of the Kohanim would include paying hush money to porn but in setting the table for this conversation what you know what worries me and where I think the challenge lies is it's gotten worse but the pendulum hasn't swung back nearly enough and what I really wouldn't have imagined is that there had been insufficient pushback and blowback and counter reaction across many France of course inside Israel and mihrabs here merabh can speak for herself I wish we had more memories and I wish we had a more effective opposition if I may say including the leader of your own party but you don't have to respond to that I will good on the Palestinian side I heard a lot but I'm not seeing a lot and what I what I heard one of the things I heard that was fascinating is that I heard listed all the villages in Area C where there's nonviolent resistance I heard about Gaza in Jerusalem that's all the areas where you don't have the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian security forces that's a real challenge on the regional side I'm we've seen a collective shrug not a collective roar and an attempt to do normalization without the Palestinians or even against the Palestinians the international community has again shown its robust fecklessness and in America it's perhaps the source of hope and also of course greater frustration because you see an administration so aligned with the most egregious policies of the current Israeli government but you also see what J Street has achieved I was moved by what we heard from Ricky of Jay Street you and the end the demolitions campaign I was a little older than six months at that rally in in Robin Square and the emergence of a group like if not now so let me just share with you Murr after to get us going the three things that have been on my mind in terms of what one might do in this current situation because I do not believe that right now in this precarious moment is a time for grand initiatives actually I don't think there's a silver bullet I do not want to do the injustice to the English language of coining the phrase Trump peace plan I have no expectations from this administration where that leads me to focus is three things number one hold the line hold the line on 67 on international law on opposing what's gone on with Jerusalem hold the line also of the logical sequence of the Arab Peace Initiative the future of Israel will be determined by how Israel interacts with the Palestinians those under direct occupation in the West Bank indirect occupation in Gaza in the twilight zone of East Jerusalem those are second-class citizens in Israel and the Palestinian diaspora it will not be determined by where the flights to and from Israel happened to cross Saudi airspace or whether on whether there are meetings official unofficial between Israelis and Gulf officials that's not going to determine our future so number one how do we hold the line number two for me this is so much about the incentive and disincentive structure how do you change and this is difficult I know and it's difficult for an Israeli patriot and for yourself how do you change the cost-benefit calculation it's great to have incentives for peace but what are the disincentives for continuing with the status quo how do we create accountability and I wonder how one and when one more effectively revisits the question of sanctioning and whether we should make common cause with some of the most regressive elements in the community and beyond we may disagree with fellow progressives on an endgame or some may but surely we have more in common and surely the instrumentalizing of anti-semitism and the miss defining of anti-semitism is undermining the struggle against anti-semitism Israel Israel should not be held to a lower standard and Israel should not be should not be used as the vehicle for launching attacks on civil rights and freedom of speech and I I disagree with something I heard earlier I think there should be a UN database on companies involved in the settlements and it should be published and it's the right thing to do and my third thing is Gaza is a humanitarian crisis but it's born of a political situation we have to address the politics Gaza can't be a mini state Gaza can't be a perpetual prison Gaza can't be a protectorate of Egypt now here you know I think there is much common ground inside the Israeli security establishment that thinks people are doing the wrong thing there and maybe even some possibility for movement within the government but um that has to be linked back into something political so those are the three initial thoughts I wanted to share with you but initial and and perhaps final as well merav and I don't know how you see the way out of the impasse that we're clearly in okay [Applause] well Dan Hill who became 10 years older during this time no not now not now I mean I mean since the first J Street convention seriously that's what I meant doesn't remember that he's responsible to bringing me to the first J Street convention a long before I was in politics or at least informal politics I had the privilege of being in Washington in the first J Street Convention and to remember if you think that you are excited and energized about what's happening now you have no idea those of you who weren't here ten years ago because you were far too young to be allowed to go out of the house alone and and this energy that was then and he's here now is part of the ability of this camp that believes in peace and believes in the two-state solution as a way for peace sustainable real peace and as a way for Israel to be sustainable and secure and the homeland of the Jewish people mind you all of the Jewish people without distinction this is a place for us to voice our beliefs and what we're all working for so hard but in those ten years not only did we get a little bit older but and and the things that Daniel mentioned have happened but also in these ten years we all of us are now in a much more unfortunately in a much more I would say defensive almost corner a lot has become much more difficult the situation in many in many angles has become much more dire and it has become more difficult for us to fight for what we believe in so when I said I will comment on your saying about the opposition in Israel I do want to make you think about Democrats in America in the last year okay and keep in mind that the opposition in Israel has been living under this kind of regime for 25 years already ever since the incitement is against its haka beam ever since the incitement against the also Accord that was supposed to bring the two-state solution with peace to Israel and Palestine and the people who did not want this to happen are still working to make sure that this doesn't happen and unfortunately ever since then most of the time they've been in power now the opposition in Israel which consists of the Zionist union which is labor and the movement of Tzipi Livni and labor with a big abayas chair right now and minutes and other partners have not strayed from its huh carbons way of working towards two states and peace and democracy and Israel as the Jewish Democratic home of the Jewish people not straight I want to assure you that because I know how trendy it is to speak about how the opposition is not good enough not loud enough not successful in our well sometimes we ourselves yes we wish that we had been able to throw away the government that we think is doing Israel wrong but you know what no opposition in the world ever managed to throw down a government it's always the government that brings down itself and I have news for you this government will bring itself down as well now keeping the line what you refer to Daniel is not as easy as well keeping not on either frontier because we have a government that works actively and formally they're not hiding it as they used to in the past they're working towards annexation they're working towards killing the mirror option of a two-state solution we are fighting that as best we can we are voting against whatever legislation proposal that they're bringing we are filibustering everything every initiative that they bring we are shouting as loud as we possibly can but we are facing the same incitement and dealing legitimization that it's hawk Robin had to deal with this is the same dynamic these are the same forces and there are even more self-confident today and we have to fight it even stronger than we had to in the past your partnership is super important for us to be able to do this so thank you [Applause] now I've been listening to you I was I'm here for two days I had the pleasure of speaking on some sessions and listening to you more than I mean I listen to the speakers but I listened to you and I heard you applauding so strong and so enthusiastically when people talk about the victims or the people that you consider to be the victims but I didn't it hurt me actually to hear you not applauding when the last speaker said that he believes in the State of Israel and its right to exist and its right to security and the importance of it it's easy to get confused I'm saying this because this is something that we have to deal with constantly but I think it was it's always attributed to him for your British author who said patriotism means to support your country at any time and it's your government only when it deserves it but don't mix between the two I said in my inaugural speech to the Knesset which took place five years ago Israel is in a strong and secure place maybe more than ever before thankfully it is in this position I strongly believe that from this place Israel must take initiative to find a solution for the conflict with the Palestinians specifically and with the Arab world and certainly there's a big part of the Arab world that wants it today more than ever and find a solution and work towards the possible peace [Applause] we should do that in partnership with our current enemies but we should not relieve them from their responsibilities to doing everything they they can on their part to contribute to an effort of peace I'll conclude for now by saying that sometimes I feel we are in the midst of a tragedy Israelis and Palestinians are too often like up marriage there is so much potential there we just need good counseling [Applause] unfortunately there isn't one right now around but I'm sure and certain and I know that there will be and one last thing this session is called setting the table for what was it settings table whose piece I believe yes yes you know when I was in eighth grade they split the classroom in school and the boys were sent to study electronics whereas the girls were sent to study household management now now don't boo don't boo for for civilizations it has been girls and women who have specialized in setting tables so this is one other thing that will contribute a lot to not only setting the table for peace but also getting one when we have more women [Applause] all I can follow that with is to promise you that when murabba myself normally sit down for a conversation it does not consist of two ten minute speeches at each other and then we leave and part ways unfortunately that's what today's conversation between Mira I'm invite you to come to a cafe in Tel Aviv to witness the other kind of conversation that we have I'll say one short thing in response to what you said there are that there is no I I do want to say this because merav made an important point about imagine what you're going through now carrying on for 15 years and my comment on that is do not let the abnormal become normal and one of the things that I think happened in Israel is that we didn't know how to pull back the conversation and people kept thinking okay we'll just move a little more here a little more here a little and you never know when to stop and that is a mistake I believe politically strategically that we have to pull ourselves back from so endeth the conversation between Daniel and there are [Applause] [Music]

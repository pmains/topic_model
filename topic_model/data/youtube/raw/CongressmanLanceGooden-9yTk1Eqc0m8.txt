I want to talk to you about this budget deal that you're hearing about I'm a no and here's why I campaign to reduce government and what this bill does is continues to grow up it was negotiated in a room with Nancy Pelosi Chuck Schumer Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy and our secretary of the Treasury I understand why members of my own party are pushing this deal it funds the military it keeps the Hyde Amendment there are several good provisions in this deal however what I campaign to do was to come to Washington is Washington DC and reduce government not just vote to go along to get along I do not agree with the way this process has happened if this was such an emergency and such an important thing that we needed to do why was it done in the final two days we've known for months that this debt ceiling increased limit problem was coming around the corner and here we are rushing to do things at the last minute people back home are frustrated with that I didn't campaign to come to Washington and vote to rubber-stamp Nancy Pelosi steals people back home are sick of politicians that come home and try to sell whatever bad deal they voted for and that person is not going to be me I'm not gonna come back to Texas and try to tell you why I supported a bad deal which is why I'm a no vote on this budget deal

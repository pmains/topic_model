we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we old we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw all right welcome back folks and uh we are back to talking about one of my favorite subjects which is climate change environmentalism and what to do about it what does rational environmentalism look like as opposed to let's say radical environmentalism and every couple years the the un comes out with the report they call that report the ipcc report the inter-governmental panel on climate change report and every time they do this uh the media calls it a code red says look this is exactly what we're talking about look at the scientific consensus we're all going to die it's all a catastrophe uh everybody should be worried uh stop driving your car immediately buy a solar panel and um or i don't know just stop doing everything uh and green new deal okay just a lot of uh hair on fire exclamations and uh i want to talk about what the truth is behind this report uh does it really say the things that the media claims it says and uh we've gone through it of course on on my committee on energy and commerce uh we we had a quick briefing on this and that briefing was filled with supposed experts who really could not stop talking about the catastrophe that awaited us uh everything is worse uh than it possibly ever that it ever could have been before and uh it's only going to get worse if we don't take immense action right away um cost and benefit analysis be damned uh one person who's been really great on this subject and has been on this podcast before is bjorn lomberg from the copenhagen consensus copenhagen consensus center and uh is an expert on this subject and is going to help us unpack this report bjorn thanks so much for being on hey dan it's great to be back so this is oh this is your third time on i think uh really appreciate it look you've written a lot of great books on this the skeptical environmentalist cool it had to spend 75 billion dollars to make the world a better place the nobel laureates guide to the smartest targets for the world 2016-2030 and prioritizing development to cost benefit analysis of the un's sdgs so i think i think one of the main themes of your work is okay everybody calm down this is real we're not saying it's not real but what do the numbers actually say what does the science actually say and now let's do a cost-benefit analysis about what we actually do about that uh and for some reason that's like heresy to what what is increasingly the mainstream um even the scientific community maybe of a different opinion on that uh but but certainly the political community and certainly the international political community the the the kind of folks at the un and then of course our mainstream media um the ipcc recently came out with this report okay they call it ar6 the physical science basis after it was published the secretary general of the un summarized the report as a code red for humanity others one so far is calling the western world guilty of climate crimes so i mean let's let's just start from the beginning um your general take and then we can get into some more specifics does it really show that there's a code red for humanity what was your what's your initial reading of the report so first things first uh it's it's actually a pretty damn good report it's a very very long report it's almost 4 000 pages long and i i was called up immediately after it came out and said can you go on the radio can you go on tv and talk about it i was like i actually need to read this i don't know how other people do this uh but yeah i haven't read all of it but i've certainly read very large parts of it and most of the science is actually pretty good but it in no way support what the un secretary general calls a code red it doesn't talk at all about that actually if you want to get all technical about it this report doesn't even tell us about the impacts for humanity that's what the second and third part of the report they'll be published later this year and uh next year so it's not in that report but of course the report in that way didn't really matter nobody actually read the report uh they simply wanted to say the u.n climate panel has once again pointed out that global warming is real hey we knew that we've known that for decades and that it's a man-made problem we knew that and that's absolutely true and therefore it's a catastrophe no you can't make that connection and that's not what they're telling us they go carefully through all the different things that are likely to happen and some things are getting worse other things are getting better and we need to hear both of those points and we need to have a calm conversation instead of of course saying let's dismantle the entire western civilization as we've grown uh since the industrial revolution 200 years ago everything that's made us rich and do something else before you you know do that maybe you want to just be common listen to what the science says yeah and the science is complicated it's um it's it's wrought with uh likely scenarios most dangerous scenarios unlikely scenarios the the whole nine yards it really seems to me like um like our media chooses the worst case scenarios and and runs with that as if that's as if that's expected but i think a reasonable scientist would say well it's pretty hard to expect that one question i have too is it how different is it from the 2018 report um it's slightly different in in the sense that the uh 2018 report was actually a a a a commandeered report it was something that the climate community uh if you remember back in paris in 2015 uh the politicians decided we're going to limit the warming to 1.5 degrees centigrade which is by any reasonable estimate impossible to do and then they said given that we've come up with this very round and arbitrary number can you make us a report that shows that this is a good choice that was what the 2018 report was and they basically told it told uh the politicians look uh any number that's lower is better from a climate perspective of course not from an economic perspective but from a climate perspective uh you probably can't do that but if you want to you have to change the entire world and really really fast that's where aoc got her her we only have 12 years left um so the current report is actually better because it's not trying to uh uh answer a politically uh uh commandeered question but it's simply trying to tell us what's up with climate change and in that way it tells us pretty much what all the other reports have told us namely that global warming is real it's man-made it is a problem but it's not the end of the world let me let me give you an example because you you mentioned that there you know the science is fraught and there's all these worst case scenarios and and uncertainty and all that and that's absolutely true and and we also need that conversation and we don't have that conversation in the media but i actually think in some way it's much much simpler so let me just give you one example so the un starts out with saying what are the big things that happen when global warming happens two of the main things that we know is happening because temperatures are rising we are seeing more heat waves and fewer cold waves now both of those things are sort of obvious if temperatures rise you would see more heat waves you'd also see fewer cold waves notice how you only heard the first part in the media coverage that's your first warning signal but the second thing is what how big of an impact is this well it turns out that a new landsat paper so in the very esteemed landsat journal came out about a month ago so way too new to actually make it into the euro climate panel report but they looked at what has been the impact of global warming in this century so the last 20 years so over the last 20 years temperatures have risen so we've seen more heat waves we've seen fewer cold ways how many extra people have that killed and they actually looked at that so they found that over the last 20 years global warming has increased the number of heat waves so that a hundred and sixteen thousand more people die every year from uh from uh from heat that's definitely a problem that's something we should be aware of but what they also found was that every year because of increasing temperatures we see fewer cold waves and because many many more people around the world die from cold than from heat it's actually reduced cold deaths by 283 000 people so if you do the math and it's really very simple the overall impact is that every year because of global warming 166 000 fewer people die you never heard that right and i think is a fundamental point it's it's you know there's lots of uncertainty and all this stuff but really on the core outcome temperatures rise so you're going to see more heat waves fewer cold waves we only hear more heat waves which is absolutely true but we don't hear about pure cold waste we only hear that more people are going to die from heat waves we don't hear that fewer people are going to die from fewer cold waves right and it doesn't matter because many fewer people are more many more people are saved by temperature rises then are sacrificed by temperature rises we need to know this i i'm even and even then i'm still skeptical of numbers that say a hundred thousand people have died of heat waves i mean you die because you don't have air conditioning are you really dying because it's a few more degrees hotter than it was yesterday even if that's a record temp you know that's i wish people would kind of take a step back and think what exactly is happening here how are you measuring the these deaths and then because there was an interesting sort of debunking report that i think oren cass did a while back when about the clock costs of climate change and it turns out that the majority of the costs are human death and he looks into this and he's like how are you how are you coming up with these numbers and basically you know to simplify it for people and i've said this many times in the podcast but here we go again to simplify this this report for people you would you would basically have to assume the following that in 100 years if philadelphia finally reaches the temperatures that houston has now in current times then philadelphia heat deaths are going to increase by like 50 times now is that reason is that a reasonable assumption that just because philadelphia yeah they're just they're just all gonna be just ah it's like you know like these these apocalyptic movies i mean give me a break no they're just gonna turn on where i see people die because they don't have ac or heat that's why they die um it's not because the temperature's like a few degrees warmer or colder than it was you know yesterday uh which is which is what a wave is you know it's just it's it's a quick jump but it's not like you're in an oven it's it's it's not like you're just to give a context than this uh because it's much easier to uh to measure now uh uh rather than what's gonna happen you know in 80 years in sort of a hypothetical uh and and most people don't die because it's extremely warm or extremely cold they die a little more because it gets colder or a little more because it gets warmer you dive more from heat simply because you're a little more likely to get heart attacks and because everyone gets them you just need a little change that's really what drives us in the same way with cold deaths especially for older people you restrict your uh your arteries to keep your inner core body warm and that means you increase your heart uh blood pressure and that makes it more likely that you get heart attacks that's really what drives us so so most both heat deaths and especially cold deaths don't happen on the incredibly frosty days and incredibly hot days but they simply happen more when you're off the optimal temperature which surprisingly to most people is in the upper range of where you normally is so i would imagine in houston it might be in the 70s or the 80s uh so so it really is a question of saying if you're away from your optimal temperature you will likely have a slightly higher risk of dying but again if we care about people it's not about the spectacular heat deaths or indeed the spectacular coal deaths but it's the fact that many more people die from cold and from heat and therefore we should actually say when you see more extreme weather with heat deaths but fewer less extreme weather with cold death we should all rejoice because it's actually working out in our favor as of now and that's a great point um it's similar to the point about the greening of the earth uh is it did i read that right that the the size of land double the size of australia has been basically become more green uh because of warmer temperatures or not just warmer temperatures but more plant food which is co2 yes co2 is a it's a plant fertilizer again this is absolutely uncontroversial and again you typically only hear bad stuff happening from climate change and of course that's a cartoon version of of climate change climate change will have negative and positive impacts they're going to be more negative than the positive that's why it's a problem but to simply ignore the positive is not a good way to inform people neither is a good way to end up spending trillions of dollars so global greening is something that we can see almost everywhere on the planet over the last 30 years because we pumped out lots of co2 it simply means we put out more plant food which means that there's more green on the planet now the researchers actually look at this as area of leaves so they actually and don't ask me exactly how they do that they measure all the trillions of leaves and the area of those leaves they do that with satellite and what they can show is that over the last 30 years we've actually gotten and and we used to say two now it's almost three three continents the size of australia or three continents the size of the continental u.s the lower 48 states of more green leaves over the last 30 years because of global warming again this does not mean that they're not also problems global warming but everything else equal everyone should be rejoicing for the fact that we've gotten a lot more green on the planet does that this is kind of a layman's question for for the scientific community does anybody study um this this sort of feedback effects i mean does there an equilibrium that becomes reached because as more co2 gets pumped into the air you get more green you get more plants which obviously suck in co2 they're the ultimate co2 scrubbers on planet earth um does does that ever lead to a to an equilibrium or do we need to be planting a lot more trees and is that even a reasonable suggestion that's something you know republicans have suggested the trillion tree project for instance um is that is that a reasonable way to go yeah so so they do suck up more suit too it's not very much in the total uh uh scheme of things and yes they have calculated that so you know roughly speaking uh mankind puts out about 35 gigatons of billion tons of co2 and half of it is soaked up and half of that in the ocean half of that in leaves basically and so it does soak up a little more but it doesn't do more than that and it's really just for one year so this is not what's going to drive it i know that a lot of people are saying oh let's just plant lots and lots of trees uh and and look there's nothing wrong with planting trees but let's be realistic this is not how you're gonna solve this problem uh basically because we need land for a lot of things mostly for nature and for food and planting a lot of trees just to feel good about yourself may very well end up making food prices go up and making nature have less space both of which is probably undesirable so no this can be a little bit of the solution and we should certainly love having trees where we like them but don't think that this is the primary solution yeah you're saying it it's it's like every solution that you and i have talked about okay let's let's take a measured look at it um don't don't don't plow down of acres and acres of farmland just to build trees uh urges to plant trees when in fact there might be better ways to do it which is fair enough um but now that granted you know a trillion trees i don't know where they come up with that number i think it just sounds good it sounds good like many other numbers yeah um but you know you could you know you look around at any given city and you're like i could fit like 16 trees over there why don't we just plant them i mean sure why not um but you know it's it's one so it's a great idea to plant trees in cities because cities are the place where the world is hottest mostly because there's lots of asphalt lots of dark surfaces little water features if you plant trees it becomes cooler and it becomes a nicer place to live and it actually also is likely to reduce the uh the temperatures uh over over reasonable periods so it's a very simple way to both make people happy and and cool the essential parts of the planet along with making for instance uh uh rooftops or or or even just uh asphalt surfaces uh more white and hence make them more reflective and make them less hot yeah i mean the little things can make a huge difference and they come at a low cost it also makes cities look nice um that's for sure so it it maybe let's go back let's take let's go back up to the 30 thousand foot level is because this is you know this entire conversation's about narratives it seems and that's why i framed in the beginning is rational environmentalism versus radical environmentalism and you know it and i think that both sides are coming to the conclusion that the climate change is real there's a cost to it but what is it but what one side asks which would i just be my side let's call it the political right because unfortunately just everything every discussion falls along those lines whether it's covid or the environment it always falls along these political right and left lines on the political left it's well yeah there's not only is there a problem but it's a catastrophe not only is it a catastrophe but it's right around the corner it's a swift it's a swift catastrophe um but the ipcc report doesn't really say that um what what what are some of the effects it does lay out and you said there's more reports coming out in the next in the next year um but those reports have coming out come out in the past uh from from previous reports so you know what what are some of the basic numbers that we should keep in mind when about the cost of climate change according to the scientific consensus yeah so so again the un tells us that we're going to see more heat waves as we talked about fewer cold waves they tell us we're going to see more sea level rise and that's a significant challenge but again one we have eminently shown that we know how to tackle over a century we know how to handle uh sea level rises of one to three feet uh this is you know holland obviously is a as a prime uh uh proponent of that but it's something that almost everyone knows how to do and fairly cheaply too and board on that subject and we're kind of going on a tangent but it's a worthy tangent is there the real question is can you prevent one to three uh feet of sea level rising yeah can you prevent it so no no you so you can do very little even if you know even if the u.s and all the rich world uh cut their carbon emissions uh down to zero tomorrow it would have a fairly small impact on where uh sea level rise would be in 2100 it would have a bigger impact uh in the coming in the following centuries but again it starts to become a little silly to start thinking about planning sensibly into the 23rd or 24th century the second bit is that it's very very cheap to tackle now people think you know if if it was an onslaught of three feet of sea level rise tomorrow uh you know it'd all be kevin koster and waterworld kind of thing but the reality is if this happens over 80 years we know how to tackle this and actually studies show we're going to safeguard virtually all land that's valuable that has humans or that have things that we want to preserve so we are going to tackle this and you know again louisiana is a great example you just had a hurricane four hit uh louisiana and most of the sea defenses held because we know how to do this now obviously it would have been nice that we had already thought about doing this in in 2005 and there's a whole learning period remember in holland uh they also had huge floods back in 1954 and that was what set them on the path to the country that they are today where they've actually you know safeguarded pretty much all of holland know how to do that for the next uh couple of centuries so this is gonna happen at very low cost so when you predict this catastrophe no you're predicting it if you assume nobody does anything but of course with any realistic outcome you will see much less impact in the future so just to give you one number uh right now we estimate uh that about one and a half million people are impacted by global flooding every year just 20 years ago that was three million people and part of the reason we've stopped having three million people being impacted only one and a half is because we're much richer we're much more resilient towards the end of the century because we're richer because we're better able to tackle this we'll be bound to perhaps 10 or 15 000 people being impacted every year we are on the right track and global warming make a slight change in that track that is it makes better slightly slower that's a problem but that's of course not what you're told you're told it's the end of the world but that only comes if you assume nobody's going to do anything their common phrase is the world is on fire i mean that's that that's been the that's been the new catchphrase for a while now and this gets into other questions and they're really tricky with this stuff like i said we just had a hearing on well it wasn't a hearing it was a briefing uh with some experts and they're very tricky and you've got to listen very carefully to what they say to understand their trickery on these things um you know for instance maybe you can shed more light on this because i i do not have these these facts built into my head the way you do um but on the sea level rising one look our sea level's rising yes have they been for a long time yes are they accelerating uh it appears to me yes uh the question is how much and how and how much they'll keep accelerating is this an exponential acceleration or is this a slight and but what they what they do is they often cite um a specific year and they say like since 1960 or 70. did you shed light on that why why do they always choose that year with respect to sea levels rising do you know what i'm talking about i i certainly do i'm not sure i know about this for sea level rise but they certainly do for instance for hurricanes because hurricanes maybe that's what i'm talking about we're at a global low in the uh around the 1970s and so it's very very easy to say oh since the 1970s everything has gotten worse well yes but that's also because we're very good evidence that the 70s and a little bit of 60s a little bit of the 80s were a global low for the last 200 years or so so most of the 20th century was high hurricane season then the 70s came around and of course that was right when satellite started so this is not un necessarily trickery but it certainly an unwillingness to say but if we actually look before and we we know that very very well for the atlantic and for the us there is not an increase in for instance landfalling hurricanes for the us there's actually a slight decrease it's insignificant but it's not an increase and likewise for strong hurricanes that is you know category three and higher they're declining slightly not increasing and when you're being told these stories there's two things you need to look out for one is what you just talked about if you just pick a specific time period and this is very very much cherry picking when you do that for for for hurricanes but the second part is you also gotta ask how much of an impact will this have and of course the truth is if you're a poor nation or if you're a poor community the impact of any given hurricane is going to be much much more devastating because you don't have the resilience and so the reality here is to say if you want to help people in the future do you want to help them through climate policy that is make sure you have slightly less higher temperatures by the end of the century or do you want to help them by getting out of poverty because if they get out of poverty they're not only more resilient to hurricanes and many many other things but they're also more resilient towards hunger and lack of education and their kids dying from easily curable infectious diseases and all these other things that also matter so again the point here is not just to recite what impacts us but how much can we change of that with social factors and the answer is we can change a lot if we make ourselves richer we can change very very little if we just focus on cutting carbon emissions that's why i think it's you know in in so many ways there there's something wrong when people see a hurricane hit a city or a fire hit somewhere and say you know what i'm gonna do something about it i'm not gonna drive my suv tomorrow that's that's like the least impactful thing you can do that will have a marginal impact in a hundred years instead of actually helping these people to become resilient in so many different ways you mentioned fire let me just uh say that yes they say there's more going to be more fire weather which is a one of these other tricky things that simply means it's more likely that if all of the things were equal there'd be more fire yeah it's going to be drier it's going to be higher temperature which is true uh for many things from global warming but actually we also have data for how much fire there is in the world and fire has been going down for the last uh uh 12 decades so from 1900 till today both for the uh registered period so the one that we have uh reasonable data for and certainly for the satellite era where we have accurate data for the entire world it's very contrary to what you think so what happens is fire weather goes up but because we're much better able to avoid fire because we're smart and resilient species we see less and less fire now again this doesn't mean that there's not a good argument in saying we should make sure that global warming doesn't overwhelm our fire abilities one of the ways obviously is by uh uh uh um what is it they call it now predict preventive burns they here's another forest management just just general forest management where you're clearing under brush and doing preventive maintenance that you stop having enormous build up of of fuels that means you get uh fires that basically run out of uh of control when it comes to forest management ironically one of the main problems is this desire to keep nature pristine no don't touch it don't touch it don't look at it don't don't walk in there don't do anything because that's nature and there's some like beautiful thing there and it's very romantic but it also it's bad for the forest because that's how it gets burned yes there's there's also a lot of rich people who don't want these controlled fires because that means air pollution and they don't want that so instead they get a catastrophic fire that burned down their house uh yeah so so the reality is here we're smart and we know how to deal with most of these issues again it doesn't mean that global warming is not a problem it doesn't mean that we can't do something about global warming but there's a huge difference from saying what the un climate panel tells us this is a problem so let's find a solution that cost less and solve most of the problem to saying this is the end of the world so let's throw everything in the kitchen sink at it which is a bad policy plus of course it's actually not going to happen because nobody will reelect political leaders that will confer you with tens of thousands of dollars of climate costs so it you know another number you point out often is is the according to the data we we assume that our global gdp will increase which is you know an indication of well-being let's say in reduction in poverty so our global gdp will increase by 450 percent by the year 2100 with the cost of climate change we might expect that to only be 434 percent increase in global gdp so that's still pretty damn good um and so again it begs the question okay well that is a cost it is a cost undeniable a cost but it's certainly not the cost of you know the world being on fire right and it's it's not this exaggerated cost that we're talking about and if we're going to try and mitigate that cost we certainly want to wouldn't want to pay more money than we're going to lose that wouldn't make any sense it's just not how you would invest in anything but there's but there's just but unfortunately there's just a very emotional argument and the other thing that strikes me about the the radical environmentalists is is there they're they have non-falsifiable arguments meaning they can never be wrong no matter what the data shows it shows that they're right if it's too cold it's because they're right if there's a rainstorm it's because they're right everything that happens they can they can they can they can finagle their way into saying that they're that this just proves my point and that's that's a really good sign for people that somebody is probably lying to you or at least being somewhat dishonest when nothing you can say can can falsify their arguments it's it's it's a tricky it's a tricky little game i think it's a good point at least to to emphasize and you know look i i try to get people to pay attention to data and facts uh so i actually think it does have an impact uh and when you point out to people well the data only shows this part you know it tells you that there's going to be fewer cold waves you can't just say you know like uh uh secretary kerry did and uh in february when you had that huge uh snowstorm in texas you can't just say oh global warming no all models not just most models not just most of them all models show that you get less cold i mean there's a reason why it's called global warming you can't just make this up it doesn't mean that you don't get more heat waves that's true go with that but you can't say oh and the cold wave was also because of global warming and i think you lose people and you lose trust and you lose people's willingness to listen to you when you engage in this sort of trigger and just say everything is because of global warming that's why it's important to get the data back and say look what is actually happening here and how big of a problem is it and i think you're absolutely right to say fundamentally the world is going to be a much better place by the end of the century people often think oh gdp especially if you're rich you're so like oh but money's not everything well let's just remember to a lot of people live on a dollar a day or something money is a lot of new opportunities and and ways to avoid you know just terrible tragedies but the fundamental thing is we know that when you're better off you just simply have better outcomes than pretty much all your parameters you have fewer kids you're a better health uh your better education your kids die less you have more healthy choices you have more opportunities there's so many things that we associate with better outcomes from a higher gdp so fundamentally when we're much richer by the end of the century and the u.n expects us in all scenarios we're much better off there's going to be a lot less poverty people are going to be living much longer they're going to be educated much more global warming is not this is all going to end and we're all going to you know go into some sort of uh uh dystopian future global warming mean we will achieve all of those goals slightly later that's still a problem but it's not the reason why you should throw everything else overboard and just do global warming uh i want to go over a couple things you know that that people hear a lot and maybe would like to know how to respond to and and again i'll bring up some of the comments i heard from my own briefing in congress and and and the comments went something like this everything is worse than thousands of years ago whether it's heat waves or droughts or flooding or extreme weather everything is worse than thousands of years ago the acceleration in sea rise worse than thousands of years ago but again is that a telltale because does if we're talking about man-made global warming and we can only be talking about man-made global warming because if it's man-made that means there's in theory something we can do about it but if it's not man-made then there actually is nothing we can do about it except to adapt so is it really reasonable to be talking about thousands of years ago or is it only really reasonable to be talking about comparisons to you know about a hundred years ago when when when maybe the first that was the first indications that more co2 emissions might actually start to affect the climate so it's obvious that you can only really talk about uh you know the co2 emissions that we've had have only really been going on for the last hundred years or less so it doesn't make sense to talk about thousands of years except for very odd sort of comparisons or sometimes it might make sense but i think the the crucial bit is when people say everything is worse that's just simply untrue and i i think the right thing to say is oh so it's worse that we have a lot fewer cold waves that kill the most people in the world yeah cold waves or cold kills sorry about 4.5 million people every year that's almost 10 of everyone who dies every year in the planet how the hell is that not a good thing that that doesn't occur quite as much and and and i it's not that i'm asking them to sort of admit that everything is good or that most things are good that's probably not true global warming overall has more bad than good but it's simply to say when you only say bad things are happening you're not being honest and of course also when you say and this is another favorite trope everything is worse than we thought well that almost by definition means that you weren't very good at thinking just before you said this were you because apparently you've been surprised by data the reality is and this was also one first thing we we talked about when you read this report it's just like most of the other reports we've known most of this stuff pretty well for the last 20 30 years and it's not surprising because lots and lots of smart people have been working on this for a very long time we are not dramatically surprised about most things there are few things and that's fair but when you say everything is worse than we thought that's just false and when you say everything is wrong is bad that's also just false yeah and global screening good example cooling uh another good example yeah it it of course my question is it's this gets very specific and technical which is again they they they just they they always they always they always talk about um being worse in general terms but then when you actually unpack the data you find out things like well actually it might hurricanes might be more extreme by about five percent but they're but they're but their frequency decreases by 25 percent and it's like yeah so technically you're right hurricanes are getting worse but it's it's not even a noticeable amount you know and there's you know to to to somebody who's not prepared for a hurricane uh it doesn't matter if the hurricane's five percent stronger or five percent weaker it's it's it's still a freaking hurricane and uh i i feel like they also they also make this they make these arguments as if we never had extreme weather in the past yeah you know it it's it's a very strange thing to say to be honest uh but but that is sort of where they appear to be coming from and then the last thing i would say is that people would like to know how to respond to maybe you can address this is you know somebody like aoc is saying look see look at the subways flooded in new york you think climate change isn't happening now and you think we don't need a green new deal now because every weather event again proves their point no matter what the weather event is if it's the if it's the the polar vortex in texas it's it's global warming if it's if it's a heat wave in texas it's global warming and the absurd thing is everything was worse in the past again not because of global warming but simply because you were a lot less rich remember what was the biggest natural disaster in the u.s that was a galveston hurricane in 1900 because nobody knew it was coming and it flooded the whole city and it killed about 8 000 people that is a real disaster that had nothing to do with global warming everything to do with the fact that you were poor and had very little resilience that's why we're much better off look these these uh uh subways have flown all the time there's great data that shows that we've seen these floodings both in new york in new jersey in most of the country uh remember the mississippi famously flooded for more than 100 days in 1913 uh created an enormous amount of cost for the u.s it actually cost two and a half percent of the us gdp that year now floodings every year cost in the order of 0.05 every year it's gone down by 10 times because we're much more resilient and so there is there's a recency factor that goes on but i just saw this on tv and yes you didn't see uh the uh the mississippi flood in 1913 because you weren't even around but it doesn't mean it didn't happen and we're badly in we're badly uh informed if we don't actually hear this now had this been about other things where there was a strong interest in actually making sure the narrative was clean and true of course this would be the job of media to come in and say yes but actually it was much worse in the past many more people so you know about three times more people used to die from flooding around the us we've gotten a lot better at not having people die from flooding from not from dying from hurricanes not getting terrible impacts from from hurricanes or flooding and many other things we've actually seen this across the world so when people tell you everything is worse it's because they're looking at a very specific factor very specifically and without looking at what will happen for for human resilience in truth the world is much better and it's just you know it doesn't pass the smell test where would you rather live would these people seriously rather live in 1900 of course they wouldn't it and is it reasonable to say okay so we have a hurricane that just made landfall in louisiana there was it was a big hurricane is it reasonable to say um and of course they often say it that this wouldn't have happened without man-made climate change or that it would have been about half as bad without man-made climate change can any can any reasonable scientist actually say something like that so so they are making an argument that you can say this i think it's a fundamentally flawed argument and i'll tell you why uh because what they do is they say let's run the climate models with and without co2 in the atmosphere and show that you know for instance it's hotter over uh the uh uh the uh caribbean uh over the caribbean uh and and that's why it blew into a category four you can do that and actually show that see it would only have been a category three had we not had you know global warming but why is it then that we can't see this overall that's of course because they don't look at all the hurricanes that didn't happen because there's too much for instance wind shear is one of the things that prevent hurricanes from happening and we also know that becomes stronger because of of global warming so fundamentally the reason why we see declining numbers of hurricanes hitting the u.s is a very good indicator that currently we are not seeing the impact of global warming when you then say ah but i can run a specific model and show it here you've got to ask and this is a simple question why the hell can't you then see this overall in in the data of of the real world as opposed to modeling and the other question i always have is okay i understand that you're saying higher temperatures uh might produce a stronger hurricane then let's ask the question have the temperatures are the temperatures we're seeing this summer in the caribbean are they have they never been matched before in history because i'm pretty sure that those temperatures have been matched before let's say 100 years ago 200 years ago so unless that's wildly different now i'm not really sure how that modeling argument makes any sense so so i i think that's that's probably not a winning argument i mean overall we have good evidence that temperatures have risen uh and it's not a question of saying you know if it only happened once a a year back in 1800 but it now happens 30 times a year it's more likely that you get a hurricane the point is a hurricane doesn't just come from hot water which is what most people would like you to believe because if it was just hot water sure more hot water more hurricanes but that's not what happens because hurricanes are inhibited mostly because of wind shear so the wind going in different directions and different layers which basically makes it impossible to sustain the the hurricane which is probably the main reason why despite that we see hotter water we don't see more we actually see slightly fewer hurricanes hitting the us and so again it goes down to saying so you're going to tell me you'd rather trust your model which tells you that there is more hurricane rather than looking at the data that tells you there's less and i think it's obvious to at least to me which one ought to win out yeah um let's finish this up by talking about the um the cost of solutions um and reasonable solutions and reasonable approaches to looking at the year 2100 and so you know for instance worst case scenario the ipcc lays out we go through a business as usual warming to three degrees celsius and just to clarify for everybody it's three degrees warmer than like the early 1900s right yeah okay and we've already warmed about 1.5 yeah one degree okay we've warmed about one degree celsius so this would be an additional two degrees and in that worst case scenario what do they say happens um what and and i guess more importantly what would have to happen for us to prevent it so again i think it's a sort of recap of what we talked about before uh for instance they'll say there's going to be fewer but stronger hurricanes so we'll have slightly more damage but remember because we're much richer and much more resilient we'll actually have less damage but we'll have slightly more or less damage than we otherwise would have slightly more or less did that's a great way to put it simple right now hurricanes globally costs about 0.04 of of the global gdp every year because of global warming it will only decline to 0.02 by the end of the century had we had no global warming it would have declined all the way down to 0.01 so yeah it's worse because it could have been even better but it's still a lot better we're still going to be impacted a lot less likewise with fire so the epa has actually done an estimate if you do all the things that people are talking about with climate change you will see slightly less fire by the end of the century so you will see the fire that we used to see in the early part of the 2000s instead of the fire that we used to see in the 2010s yes that's a problem no that's not the end of the world and again it tells you we need to get a sense of proportion the other part of this conversation and this is just a new finding i don't know if you saw this but um so nature just published a study of what will it cost to do biden's policies they didn't brand it as that and nobody's actually picked up on that but they they sort of explicitly say what will it cost to go net zero by 2050 they don't actually say that because net zero is 100 reduction they only look at 95 reduction so it's a little less than what biden is promising they find that the cost in 2050 every year is going to be more than 11 000 per person in the united states so a family of four will have to pay 44 000 every year for these policies now i challenge you to believe that that will ever ever happen of course it's not this this sort of shows that we're trying to solve a medium scale problem with policies that are going to be more costly than medicare medicaid and social security times two yeah how what that's just ridiculous quoting you uh talking about this subject you say each dollar spent on the paris climate accord uh would likely produce climate benefits worth 11 cents it's not a good it's not a good no it's not a good solution again it's not that all these people are not well intentioned i think they're really you know they say here's a problem let's try to fix it but trying to fix it by making ordinary people pay large sums of money to do a little bit of environmental good in a hundred years is not the right way to go about it for two reasons partly because it's economically stupid but also because it will actually lead to wide scale political protest yeah way before politicians and remember there's going to be what five or six presidents at least after biden up to 2050. uh you know way before you get to a point where you have to pay eleven 000 per person you will have voted that guy or gal out of office and you will have picked someone who will likely say stuff that we're not going to do anything at all so in in the likely outcome is that you're actually going to make it harder to do the smart stuff and the smart stuff again is the ways that you can cut carbon emissions at low cost we know that if you could re if you could you know drive renewable energy or other green sources way down and renewables for instance together with batteries if you could drive the price of that down dramatically everyone would buy it not just rich well-meaning americans in california but also the chinese and the indians the reason why they don't do it is because you know not surprisingly yes seoul is great in when it's sunny but the rest of the time it's really really crappy and likewise with wind you know it's not that you can't use it somewhat and you can actually there's there's places and there's places and times for renewables but but you're not going to cover 100 or anywhere close and when you try to get near that you're going to get those enormous costs as what the nature studied and as um as uh shellenberger just pointed out on a tweet thread that i retweeted and you got gavin newsom um shutting down diablo canyon nuclear facility in california and he says that the reason is is because the environmentalists say well because there's slightly warmer water which is perfectly clean but slightly warmer water going out into the ocean this is an environmental hazard that which is which is insanity that's that's a nonsensical thing to say i mean i think river water coming out is colder than the pacific ocean too you know just blockade the river um you know so they're going to shut that down they're going to replace it with fossil fuels uh or or unreliable renewables and we'll have worse problems and we'll probably have more heat related deaths because people will not have power and therefore not air conditioning um it's just kind of the silliness of the solutions um actually the thing i want to end on because sorry can i just add one one small comment to that because it's not just if you drive up power cost yes it has the impact that you were going to see more heat deaths but you're also going to see a lot more coal desk because that's really what keep old people especially warm in the winter we had a great experiment natural experiment when when the us did fracking back in the 2010s you dramatically dropped the cost of gas then researchers looked at people who use gas to heat their homes what they found was when the gas price dropped people could afford to keep their homes much better heated in the winter that means every year because of fracking 11 000 americans didn't die from coal deaths because they could afford to heat their homes if you drive up the price you're going to see another 11 000 people die just like that so there are real world impacts for these things last thing i want to end on because this this entire podcast has been about the premise okay we didn't talk a whole lot about the solutions but we've talked about that in past podcasts and i think people who listen to me regularly know what those are um but it's important to get the premise right because that's that's a it's a big part of the debate and while well i think a lot of republicans have basically come around to the to your position which is look yes it happens it's real there's a cost but now we're now we have to quibble over the extreme the extremity of that cost and and and and that is arguing the premise to an extent one thing so this is the last thing i want to end with because this is an interesting tweet thread you had about the u.n report claiming climate-related disasters are five times what they have been you have this graph which is really interesting um where it actually shows that all disasters whether they're technological like a train derailing whether they're weather related whether they're earthquakes or volcanoes starting in like 1980 they just all skyrocketed um and it's like it's like we had no disasters from 1900 to 1960 according to these numbers uh and this gets back to your point before in the 60s and 70s so there's something going on on around the 60s and 70s but but what it seems to me is is it is it just the fact that we could actually measure where all of these things are happening with things like the internet and satellites this is the documentation issue and it's a well-known issue so look the world's premier disaster database and they're doing a great job there in belgium and you know it's a few researchers that are basically trying to collect all disasters that ever happen in the world can you imagine trying to do that for the 1930s in the congo it's impossible you'd have no idea you're only going to hear about the very very biggest things that happen maybe you're probably going to miss quite a few but what happened in the 80s and 90s and onwards is of course the internet exploded everything is now possible everything is documented so basically what they're doing is they're finding a lot more clippings of all things that go wrong we call things disasters that wouldn't even have been mentioned in local papers let alone being known in belgium that this was a problem what we're simply seeing is better documentation so when people come out and say ah so global warming caused five time increase in uh you know in weather related disasters first of all that's that's just hokum uh but most importantly if you really want to make that point and use bad data to uh to to support it you also have to expect an and assume that global warming made volcanoes five times more likely or trained derailings five times more likely know what's happening of course is that we have a lot more clips and one of the reasons we know that is because when you compare it to for instance good us data uh for instance tornadoes they hear very very few tornadoes from the us back in the 1960s but then you know it gets easier and easier to read reports about dangerous tornadoes so their database actually shows that tornadoes shoot up i believe it's 13 times whereas of course the reality is they've reduced by 50 percent how's that possible because in belgium they read more american newspapers from the 2000s that it's this is not rocket science but it says hokum when you come out and say ah global warming is causing all this the last thing i just want to say is if you actually look at the only thing that's really hard to uh to uh fudge which is deaths instead of talking about you know what happened oh there's a train re-railing nobody you know got hurt but oh it looked really bad on the news if you actually look at deaths deaths have gone down and especially so not so much for volcanoes and and uh and uh uh earthquakes but dramatically so for weather related disasters why not because global warming hasn't made it been a problem but simply because resilience has made all the difference in 1970 we had the world's worst hurricane in bangladesh that killed about 300 000 people mostly because nobody knew and we didn't have prediction and there's you know a lot of political opera so lots and lots of people died today the same kind of hurricanes kill a couple thousand people because bangladesh even though they're incredibly poor know how to do that you have you know centers where people congregate you have better information your warning systems all these kinds of things the simple truth is if you care about the future do stuff that works instead of just doing stuff that makes you feel good you know bjorn i i hope all the young people who are not able to sleep at night because of climate change listen to this podcast and uh they'll get a better night's sleep the world is not ending the world is not ending and there's vast agreement um to make the world cleaner also so everybody can calm down i think that's the uh i think that's the uh the main message here bjorn thanks so much for being on as always dan great to be on here thank you i really appreciate it

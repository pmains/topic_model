again that's the reading of a house uh major piece of legislation they're considering voting as soon as today that would take away normal trade ties with russia in fact more than normal uh it is among a select few that have the title of most favored nation when it comes to trade status in other words they can move to the front of the line on uh trade regulations and the like uh if this passes the house and it's expected to and moves on to the senate and gets similar approval it would allow for even steeper tariff penalties and the rest on a country that is already now the most sanctioned on earth and for good reason would cynthia limits the wyoming republican senator support such a move she's kind enough to join us now senator i'm hitting you broadside with this and i apologize for that but what do you think of that would you support such such legislation absolutely i do support that legislation we have to take every means possible to limit our trade with russia and close ranks in europe and the united states to make sure that their opportunities to trade are very limited and put the squeeze on russia for this aggression all right now uh oil prices of course have been the big bugaboo they're back over 100 bucks a barrel i'm sure you watch this closely north dakota of course wyoming or you know some very important energy states but i'm curious what you what you make of elizabeth warren now targeting oil companies for these spiking prices well the companies don't set those prices you know only about five percent of refiners own gas stations uh it is the individual gas stations that set their prices uh it is generally been true that when there's an incident a crisis such as the ukraine situation gas prices go up very quickly they spike quickly and it takes a long time for them to come back down because these gas stations are trying to figure out how much gas is going to cost them in the future they don't want to lock in prices now that is below their ability to sell later so we're above their ability to sell later no i understand what i understand what you're saying um are you for because even some of your democratic colleagues have expressed support for this dropping for a period of time the federal gas tax no that is a short-term fix that will have very little impact on overall gas prices what we need to be doing is re-engage in permitting on federal lands we need to permit the lng terminals that are headed for europe there are four of them apparently just in the last 24 hours two of them were for permitted there was tremendous foot dragging about that we need to make sure we have more natural gas pipelines being permitted so we can get the gas around our country we need to make sure that there are more outlets for our natural gas including rocky mountain natural gas that can go to asia there are so many constraints on our ability to get our very abundant very clean natural gas not only around the world but around our own nation all right senator i will watch it closely senator cynthia alumnus from wyoming following those

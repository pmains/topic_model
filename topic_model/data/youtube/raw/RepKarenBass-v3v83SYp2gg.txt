all right another big issue today in a few hours president Trump expected to announce his decision on whether or not the US will pull out of the Iran nuclear deal joining us now to talk about it congresswoman Karen bass Democrat from Los Angeles a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee congresswoman good to see you yeah let's talk for a moment about what you think the president is going to do it and why folks at home who maybe don't know that much about this should care about this issue well I think people should care a lot I think all the indications are is that the president will pull out of the Iran deal and I think that that is going to be a terrible signal to send to the world remember he's in the middle of perhaps coming up a deal coming up with the deal with North Korea why would anybody in the world do a deal if the United States if from one administration to the next we might pull out of the deal so I think it would be bad to pull out for the Iran deal but I also think it's bad precedent for future deals the Republicans say that it was a bad deal in the first place and that you're essentially setting up Iran to get a nuclear weapon in 10 or 20 years what do you say to that well I actually say that's false and I literally just came from the Foreign Affairs Committee where we're talking about the Iran deal right now and I'm not really sure that the Republicans here believe that we should pull out of the deal meanwhile you'd mentioned the North Korea situation we had some big news on that front overnight with Chinese President Xi Jingping meeting with kim jeong-hoon there's a photo of that on our screen right now we're expecting to have this summit between President Trump and little Kim or I'm sorry with kim jeong-hoon what would you say of what happened with China last night what do you make of that development well hopefully it's moving the ball forward but I do have to tell you that I just worry about the president because one minute he says one thing who knows where he'll be a month from now and I do think that what he does with the Iran deal is actually connected and so what signal it will send today I think is going to absolutely impact the negotiations in the future and it's possible that Kim jong-un will say forget it if you avoid one deal you know why would I make a deal with you interesting perspective congresswoman Karen bass thank you so much for joining us from Capitol Hill we appreciate you sharing your views

Florida Congressman Greg stuby forced to miss last night's State of the Union Address as he continues to recover from injuries sustained after falling off a ladder at his house in Florida last month but that didn't stop him from providing a once in a lifetime opportunity to the Good Samaritan who came to his Aid after the accident Daryl Woody attended the address last night as stuby's guest and they both joined us right now guys good morning to you good morning Congressman stuby this is the first time you have been on television since the accident I know you were up on a big one I've been on TV in three weeks so glad to be on with you guys it's great it's great to finally hear the story what happened well I don't remember much so Woody's better to tell you the the play-by-play I don't remember being in the spot that I was in but I was trimming trees on our house and uh it was a big huge branch on one of the trees that got hit by uh the hurricane that we all experienced here in Southwest Florida and was hanging over an area that I needed to trim a very large Limb and I was on an extension ladder about 25 feet up with a chainsaw in my hand and started to cut the limb and the limb Broke Free hit the hit the extension ladder ejected me up in the air and I fell about 25 feet to the ground okay so that's that's from your point of view Daryl you actually saw it because you were driving by you were making a delivery in addition to working uh part-time for Congressman Vern Buchanan also of Florida you were also an Amazon guy who just so happened to be making a delivery to the stew B place right now pick up the story yes I've been to stewby's house approximately 30 times sometimes he'll come out and we'll talk at the gate um well I was delivering a practice package and it was addressed to his wife and I was standing there I put the package down and I heard the chainsaw going but I didn't particularly know that it was Congressman stewby I thought it was a lawn service yeah and so as I begin to turn away to head back to my vehicle I heard a limb cracking and I quickly turned around it was it was a blink of an eye type of thing right and I as it was cracking and hit the ladder and then of course doobie which he made the small eye contact with me but it was so immediate and I kind of didn't figure that looks like stoobie but I seen him through the branches so he went upwards and um it was pretty high and um I I really visioned that he that he had wings um he was so high and um um it's like the wings wings of an Angel so to say and and yeah and so it was lucky that you were there because you immediately called the ambulance and they were there in no time Congressman what is the extent of your injuries right now because you're you're not in uh our nation's capital because you invited Daryl to the State of the Union Address but you've got to be down there for Rehab right yeah and I just want to thank Woody for for you know healing the the word of God and being obedient to to the word and everything that God God's hand was all over this I suffered a concussion uh I tore the ligaments in my neck thankfully I was able to take the neck brace off that I've had on for three weeks yesterday today is three weeks from the day of the incident I have a punctured lung so I can't fly I won't be able to fly until March I've got another three or four weeks and then I cracked my pelvis thankfully I didn't have to require surgery I went in and put they put me under to try to see if there was some movement in that hip socket area where the crack is and thankfully there wasn't so I don't have to have surgery but I'm non-weight-bearing on my right side for another three to four weeks so um from head to hip I've got injuries but uh through God's grace I'm healing every day and thanks to Woody being there and seeing and being obedient and uh and calling the ambulance I was very quickly got some of the best care that Southwest Florida at Sarasota Memorial Hospital that's great and and Daryl uh the silver mining is you you knew him before but now you've become very good friends right yeah um pretty good friends with Greg and his family and um I've been to his house a couple times um like I said the the biggest part is uh listening to the spirit speak to you concerning that situation so I had some insight on kind of like what to do and all so it wasn't just me alone you know it was from the help of God if you could understand that well I completely understand you were his Guardian Angel and Greg we are so glad that you are on the mend uh any chance you're going to be able to play in the Congressional baseball game this year you're going to have to sit this one up that is June 14th and I have every anticipation of being on the mound for the Republicans I'll spend March rehabbing and then April I think we'll start we'll start doing the baseball thing but I have every anticipation I talked to the surgeon yesterday and he says he doesn't see any problem with me being on the mountain well you're gonna have to more home runs to come for this Republican that's right you made history there you're going to have to invite Daryl to the big game in D.C guys thank you very much it's really great to hear the stories and we're glad you're on the mend thanks guys thank you thank you all right 14 minutes now before the top of

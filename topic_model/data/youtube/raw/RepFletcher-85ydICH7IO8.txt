good evening everyone thank you so much for joining us for this community conversation my name is erin mintzberg and i am the district director for congresswoman lizzie fletcher uh the congresswoman and our panelists will give opening remarks in a moment and then we'll move to question and answer on the bottom of the screen there is a q a logo at the bottom of the webinar screen there's a q a little symbol you can click on that and add your question into the queue and once we move to q a i will call names out and unmute you and you can ask your question yourself to the group so with that i will hand it over to congresswoman fletcher great thanks so much erin um and thank you to everyone who is with us uh today as we mark four years since hurricane harvey uh it is really hard to believe i was looking out my window uh just a few hours ago watching the rain come down over here and thinking about what it was like four years ago today and of course now i have my eye on developments in the gulf as i'm sure many of you do as well and i know that this time of year has and always will involve a hurricane watch um and that's why i'm so glad to have this great panel assembled tonight to talk with us about what we have done in our community um since harvey what we're working to do right now and what we still hope to do in the future and i am really glad to be joined by three people that you all have come to know i'm sure uh as i have and who i've had the privilege to work with as your congresswoman uh colonel timothy vale from the u.s army corps of engineers the commander of the galveston district alan black harris county flood control district's interim executive director and steve costello the city of houston's chief recovery officer so thanks to all three of you for being here and sharing your thoughts and being available to answer questions from the residents of texas's 7th congressional district um you know i don't have to tell everyone here um but i i do think it's worth repeating that harvey was one of the worst storms in our country's history 125 billion dollars in damages more than any other disaster in u.s history other than hurricane katrina across our district on the west side of town people suffered tremendous damage during harvey and for some people it was the second time their homes had flooded in as many years and for some it was the third as we also know the tax day and memorial day floods and you know this was true from jersey village to the memorial villages to meyerland land and you know many folks who are here with us tonight and many people across the district still worry that that could happen again every time we see rains like we've seen this year we see hurricanes out in the gulf and you know we remember what we saw and what we experienced um and you know here in houston right you don't have to say hurricane before you say harvey because we know what it is and we also know what we saw in the immediate aftermath of the storm we saw our neighbors coming together to help one another in really innovative ways um you know with just incredible caring and compassion from rescuing people in boats to feeding people in shelters and mucking out houses we saw what we can accomplish when we come together and it's critical that we apply these lessons in our continued efforts as we prepare for future storms how we manage the threat of flooding and our recovery from natural disasters will shape our region for the future and so that's why i'm so glad to have all of you here tonight um we have been and must continue to coordinate at all levels of government in order to be successful and we have all worked together i've had the privilege of working with folks from the city the county with federal officials and elected leaders on both sides of the aisle to make sure our region gets the resources it needs for recovery and mitigation to implement policies that will allow us to respond to disasters better in fact the very first bill i introduced in the house came from a discussion that i had with steve costello about some of the barriers we faced after harvey and the challenges i was so proud of that bill because it was really just born in our district um and also working together uh to to rebuild in a smart and strategic manner so i've been really grateful for all of your partnership in this effort as well as the partnership of this community um and before i turn it over to you i wanted to give just a very brief um overview of some of the things we're doing in congress to help with recovery and resiliency efforts just to get that kind of update from washington um and i guess it's an update from houston too this summer i was really glad that i got to announce two major fema grants that will be provided to harris county flood control specifically for harvey recovery efforts uh 36.7 million dollars to repair addicts reservoir channels and 9.8 million to repair the barker reservoir watershed as many of you know addicts and barker were built to reduce flooding risks along buffalo bio but harvey deposited large amounts of sediment along the banks and this federal funding will be used to restore the reservoir and channels to pre-harvey design capacity and function helping protect homes and businesses in our district um also just this week i've just returned from washington uh where we in the house voted to begin consideration on the bipartisan infrastructure bill uh that invests in resiliency infrastructure providing funding that will benefit our region uh including their seven billion dollars to the army corps of engineers for resiliency infrastructure projects including set-asides for coastal storm risk management and hurricane and storm damage reduction projects uh there's nearly 10 billion dollars to the army corps for waterway infrastructure priorities including more than 5 billion dollars for backlogged construction projects and specific funding for repairing damages to core projects caused by natural disasters there's another three and a half billion for fema flood mitigation assistance to provide financial and technical assistance to states and communities to reduce the risk of flood damage to homes and businesses through buyouts elevation and other activities that we are familiar with here in the 7th congressional district and as some of you know and i i hope evan mintz is out there listening um i've also advocated for more dedicated funding for coastal resiliency projects like the texas coastal spine that we'll hear probably a little bit about from colonel vale as well also known as the ike dyke it's really important that congress knows the national significance of our region and of this project uh that's been long in the making so i'm really glad to report uh on that as well as um that working with some of our local leaders here and some of the folks on on this uh zoom meeting i was also able to obtain funding this year in congress's annual appropriations legislation for key projects relating to storm water detention and conveyance including nearly 10 million dollars in funding for the development of the meyer grove detention basin um and that's located at 610 and bracewood will help protect against flooding uh there in an area that has been repeatedly flooded um so great work with the the team here um and also a special shout out to our council member um abby cayman for her work on that project as well um and i just feel so lucky to have these great partners um here there are a couple of other projects that uh that we worked on for improvements in uh in bel air and jersey village and we'll be talking about those a little bit more this week but um things to improve stormwater conveyance uh in bel air and jersey village as well so i should note these projects uh still have to pass the senate one still has to pass the house but i'm very very optimistic um and getting them in the bill was the critical step so i'm really excited about that and uh before i turn it over the panel i want to comment on one more development that i i suspect you are all aware of um but like many of you i was shocked uh and outraged earlier this year by the texas glo's announcement uh that neither houston nor harris county would be awarded any of the disaster mitigation funds that congress sent to texas after harvey out of a billion dollars they announced that they were awarding houston and harris county would get zero that's the opposite of what congress intended when it allocated the funds after harvey and i want you all to know that our congressional delegation along with our city council members our county commissioners our delegation to the texas legislature are all standing together to ensure that houston and harris county get our fair share of the funds and just this week the glo posted an amendment to this mitigation state action plan for these funds and it is for a federally required 30-day public comment period among the changes it does award about 750 million dollars to harris county but it leaves the city of houston out entirely so there's much work to be done here my team and i are reviewing it right now and i intend to submit comments on the proposal to make sure that houston and harris county get our fair share and i encourage you all to comment as well throughout my time in the congress i have been able to work in coordination with the city of houston with harris county harris county flood control the army corps working with them to identify and facilitate these important projects um and i'm really grateful for the the partnership that we have um among all of us and i think it is uh exactly the message i want to bring to washington about how we here in houston work together to solve problems and i think you'll be pleased to hear from from our panelists about the work that they're doing right now and that they have done in these four years since harvey and of course over a much longer period of time as well to protect our community to keep it safe and to mitigate damages from flooding and disasters so with that um i'm going to turn it over i i'd love to ask colonel vale uh maybe to go first and then turn it over to the other panelists we'll get an update from them and then we'll turn it back for your questions thanks so much colonel vale thank you congresswoman fletcher i just really appreciate you hosting tonight's session it's great being with you and it's great being with my additional teammates it's good to see alan black and steve costello you know it really looks like the dream team here in terms of everybody that i know lives and breathes trying to get at reducing our flood risk across all of harris county and houston um you know it's great being with them largely because we recognize that it does it does take a team working together just as how we responded during hurricane harvey was an all hands approach uh to response uh ultimately long-term recovery is that same all hands approach where it's going to take a comprehensive intergovernmental and interagency approach to really reduce flood risk across the 22 watersheds across harris county i think most of us know most most of those participating tonight you either know me or know of me in the corps of engineers we largely oversimplify things sometimes um which is kind of unique for an engineering organization but but you know quite simply why is it flooding and why is it flooding so much across harris county really gets at the the two issues that we we struggle with every day as the corps of engineers either the ocean gets angry and decides it's going to come ashore or we just can't get the runoff to the ocean fast enough or in the worst case scenario it's a combination of both and that's really what we're constantly struggling with and what we're trying to overcome as as a collective to get that comprehensive resilience and i'll touch on on both of those uh potentially through the evening but quite honestly while projects matter the most important thing going forward is to continue to mature our governance this team approach when it comes to comprehensive flood resilience as it stands if you didn't know there's more than a thousand agencies or entities with either funding or authority to deliver a piece or pieces of a comprehensive solution across harris county but no one agency has the authority for it all and but we're seeing great strides and great opportunities um every day since the texas legislature provided the authority to the texas water development board to establish regional flood planning groups it gives us an opportunity to plug into a state level entity that's got a regional focus specifically for harris county that helps us with our planning and prioritization purposes at the same time the corps is delivering the metro houston regional watershed assessment as our effort to build a sustainable exchange of information and knowledge to to get us all all thousands of those agencies and entities to to really fight off that same common operating picture of problems i'm personally extremely proud that the army has incredibly close relationships at the federal level with the texas water development board with the general land office with our congressional offices and our county commissioners so that we can continue to help identify those authorities that are going to need to get at a comprehensive solution set very specifically to the corps of engineers our engagement with the public not just through our partners but also through the public at large has really been instrumental in informing us specific to the federal authority on the buffalo bayou watershed and as most of you know we are we have taken a tremendous amount of public input both from uh advocacy groups um economic development groups and the private citizens citizens to really take a hard look at what's the best way to move forward on the buffalo bayou watershed and we're moving away we're moving away from what we proposed in the interim report based on public feedback and right right now we're seeking permission to really adopt um a significant amount of that input that we receive publicly and we're seeking permission to extend kind of the study to to really adopt and incorporate most of that public input that that guides us on our study of the buffalo bay and its tributaries going forward and that's going to mean we're going to extend our study period but it'll allow us to really incorporate all that valuable feedback that we've had today so as it stands we've asked permission to extend that study to december of 23 and we've intentionally coordinated with harris county flood control district to to have them do the engineering analysis for the biggest pieces of public input that we've received which is to truly evaluate a tunnel rather than a complete above ground in expansion of the existing buffalo bayou channel but really a tunnel to allow us to convey water to the ocean faster and at the same time we're exercising all the authorities we already have to partner with local groups local communities uh so that we can we can free up space in the reservoir so we can increase that capacity and potentially reduce the rate of rise and decrease the frequency of water leaving government on land behind that reservoir so those things are moving forward with a serious commitment from the corps of engineers to be part of that solution set with our partner in harris county and then at the same time we're about to finish and submit to congress the final chief's report for the coastal texas and resiliency study and shorthand known as coastal texas most of you refer to it as the coastal spine or ike dyke but we're very excited that we've got a comprehensive resiliency study that gets at the whole of the texas coast that places a premium on engineering with nature looking at our ecosystems how to restore our ecosystems to provide the greatest amount of resilience going forward and at the same time not shying away from building out some of the more substantial infrastructure that will really protect the city of houston and harris county from a substantial storm surge event going forward happy to talk or answer any questions about that coastal texas study but probably most importantly is we you know we're on a good timeline for authorization of of the coastal texas projects within the next water resource and development act by congress in in fiscal year 22 and we're moving ahead full steam ahead for for project implementation we still have the general land office who will be the coors partner for delivering all of the ecosystem restoration components of that project and then the governor abbott signed the legislation to create the gulf coast protection district that had its very first meeting last week and signed a letter of intent to be the non-federal sponsor uh for the bulk of the coastal storm risk mitigation features associated with that project so we're excited we have different authorities to move the project forward as early as next year and we're excited about that opportunity taking place with that i'll probably stand by for for most questions uh but just want to thank everybody for having us tonight thanks so much colonel vale um alan do you want to give us an update of course uh hello everyone good evening and thank you congresswoman fletcher for the invitation to be here uh thank you as well for your support and your advocacy for all of us up there in dc now as you might imagine we've been extremely busy that's and that's not to say that we've got a monopoly on being busy because everyone else speaking here tonight has been two if not more so um but i'm extremely proud to say tonight that every single project in the bond flood control bond program has now been initiated that's five billion dollars worth of projects and recently with commissioners court approval of the flood resilience trust we now also have the certainty that all of our projects will be completed even for those where a planned partnership doesn't materialize now i i do need to explain briefly what i mean by initiated so the average project life cycle at flood control uh from inception to completed construction is somewhere between three and five years some projects have only just started that cycle but at least they're all started in planning and executing our projects we always have an eye on the short term the midterm and the long-term projects and that's what i wanted to dig into a little bit here in the short term we're all we're already well underway with our 40 million dollar effort to restore capacity to channels upstream of the addicts reservoir and the the awards that congresswoman fletcher just recently mentioned regarding additional sediment removal will help to complement that even more now the midterm includes planning design and construction of projects that we do all around the county uh locally that means widening and deepening channels like bear creek and also includes excavating large storm water detention basins such as one that we're working on over on 529 near barker cyprus now in the mid-term we're also coordinating with the corps of engineers on various efforts as colonel vale mentioned we've been meeting regularly and the two of us just met on friday with commissioner ramsey to discuss how we can move forward with excavation of additional conveyance volume within attucks and barca reservoirs so as he mentioned there is more to come there and more to come relatively soon looking to the long term again working closely with the corps as they wrap up the buffalo bayou and tributaries resiliency study with the intent of moving forward with that actionable project when he talks about us moving into the phase to look further at our exploration of large diameter underground storm water tunnels that's really to complement and to continue the efforts that we've had underway locally looking into the technology does does it work in our soils can we make that work hydraulically do we have enough fall across the county for the for the water to actually flow out to the ship channel and the bay the short answer is yes and so we're ready to start taking those next steps and so part of that discussion with the colonel and commissioner ramsey discussed how we can start federalizing that study and what we've accomplished so far it will take a lot of time it'll take many years to get where we need to go eventually but we have to start somewhere and the close coordination we're having with the corps of engineers is fantastic and we really look forward to continuing that partnership but getting back closer to today the progress that we've made at the flood control district so far on the bond program has been tremendous since harris county voters approved the bond our construction projects have removed the 100 year floodplain from approximately 11 000 homes and businesses and we're only in year three so there's a lot more to come a lot more projects to put in the ground finally i'll close with my my usual public public service announcement and that is to please get flood insurance if you live in harris county you are at risk of flooding pay attention to the tropics there's a lot of activity out there right now but while hurricane season is from june to november flooding season in harris county is year round so please go out and get your flood insurance thank you again for having me here tonight i really look forward to the continued conversation and the questions you all may have tonight steve i'll pass it on over to you thank you thank you alan and uh colonel it's good to hear from you it's uh always welcoming when we have our partners here and congresswoman thank you for putting this together i'm going to be very brief because i want to get to our residents questions as quickly as possible but today we had city council the mayor gave a four-year report on the status of the activities of the city relative to harvard recovery for those who are on this call who don't know who i am i'm steve costello i'm the chief recovery officer for harvey recovery my role is to get into a lot of people's mess kits and kind of move projects along that's both internal and external i do appreciate the partnerships that we have with harris county flood control district in harris county as well as with the federal government and we do appreciate everything you do for us in advocating for that in washington uh just a really quick summary the difference between flood control district in the city of houston is the way i categorize it is regional flooding flood damage reduction and versus urban drainage so our role is to get the water to the facilities that the county manages and then hopefully they were able to convey it further downstream without potentially damaging anybody so a real quick summary we have spent nearly 780 million dollars in drainage improvements since hurricane harvey in reaction to some of the drainage and flooding some of it is outside of the congressional district we spent over 120 million dollars in state and federal funds up in the kingwood area in dredging in lake houston we've completed a little over 400 excuse me 140 projects inside the city limits but i think what's really kind of unique is the future projects that we're working on our hazard mitigation grant projects which are really flood damage reduction projects with partnerships with harris county flood control district txdot and our local tours so your residents can be assured that it's not just one entity working we're always working together to solve flooding and drainage problems so i'm going to stop there and let's get to the questions as quickly as possible thank you congressman

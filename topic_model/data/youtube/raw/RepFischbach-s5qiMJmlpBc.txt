madam speaker h.j rez17 is not a resolution to revive the equal rights amendment it is a messaging vehicle that's why democrats bypassed the judiciary committee and brought this resolution directly to the floor a common theme for this majority there was no process for this resolution a resolution that democrats claim is a priority we are here today for a headline so the democrats can say they supported the era when it was in the house but the fact is madam speaker that men and women in the united states are already equal under law the 5th and 14th amendments to the constitution require as much guaranteeing equal protection for all under the laws of this country to me the era is unnecessary redundant and divisive the only thing it will do is empower the far left special interest groups to lead and lead to activist litigation just last year the head of planned parenthood declared and i quote there is no equal rights for women without access to abortion plain and simple or according to nayral pro-choice america with its ratification the era would reinforce the constitutional right to abortion we should take them at their word for years groups like planned parenthood and others have advocated for the adoption of the era so they can use it to pursue their pro-abortion agendas if the era became law it would allow these organizations to advance their radical policies through the courts without being in full view of the american people these groups have hijacked the era and are seeking to use it as a tool to challenge states pro-life laws but the reality is that this resolution is unconstitutional article 5 of the constitution empowers congress to propose amendments to the constitution by a two-thirds vote of both the house and the senate after congress proposes an amendment the amendment is sent to the states for ratification three-fourths of the states must ratify the amendment in order for it to become effective the equal rights amendment was proposed in 1972. the amendment set an explicit deadline it gave the states seven years until 1979 for ratification setting a deadline for ratification is part of congress's authority to determine the mode of ratification under article 5. in 1920 the supreme court held in dylan versus gloss that there was no doubt that congress can set a date for ratifying an amendment the deadline to ratify the era has long since passed and the amendment fell short of the required number of states when proposing a constitutional amendment the deadline for ratification is just as important as the substance the district court for d.c less than two weeks ago denied an effort by virginia nevada and illinois to force the adoption of the era despite the 1979 deadline in denying the effort of those states the court said that a deadline for ratification still receives the ascent of two-thirds of both houses of congress and putting it in the resolving clause does not evade articles v procedural requirements in any way because setting a deadline takes a two-third vote of congress it would be absurd to say that changing that deadline requires anything less if a simple majority of congress could alter a proposed amendment after it has been sent to the states the two-thirds requirement of article five would be meaningless a partisan majority cannot rewrite a proposed amendment at will after there has been an agreement in congress however that's just what h h j res 17 and the democrats proposed to do the era expired in 1979 and this joint resolution is a legal fiction advanced for political purposes i urge all members to oppose this resolution and madam speaker i reserve the balance of my time

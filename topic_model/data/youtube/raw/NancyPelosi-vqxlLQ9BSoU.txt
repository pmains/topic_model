thank you very much mr. speaker Mr Speaker I thank the gentleman for yielding and for tremendous leadership on behalf of feeding the American people it seems a very fundamental thing biblical in nature family-wise the most a very important priority for all of us except maybe not in this house of representatives I want to thank congresswoman DeLauro for her relentless persistent advocacy to feed the hungry in our country but I rise today and I thank them over and over again to once again thank the Congressional Black Caucus when they came to the floor today to speak in the manner that they did against this legislation and for values that our country shares about being a community they spoke not just for the Congressional Black Caucus and for their constituents they spoke for America they spoke for America they have fought this fight over and over again the inference to be drawn from their leadership on this is not that the black community is the community that benefits from food stamps some people in the communities you overwhelmingly their people in your districts in rural America there are people in rural America who really need us to pass this legislation you are taking food out of the mouths of your own poor constituents poverty in America poverty I'm staying a word on the floor to have poverty poverty poverty poverty poverty in America seems to be a word that people get nervous about poverty in America among our children is something shameful but it is a reality and it has an impact on children to have the uncertainty in their lives at poverty brings and when that poverty says to those children one and four of you are going to sleep hungry tonight just wrong and it's wrong for America it is not consistent with our values it does not represent the sense of community that makes America strong and that makes America great so to Marcia fudge the distinguished chair of the caucus Marcia fudge for mr. cleaver the former chair mr. Clyburn our distinguished assistant leader to all of my colleagues and of CBC and champion on the poverty issue congresswoman barbara could name all of you because you've all been out there on the forefront of this our democracy is as strong as we are as a people the middle class is the backbone of America the aspirations of all Americans to become part of the middle class is what we should be addressing in Congress and what are we doing a hundred and ninety days we've been in this session and no jobs bill yet the leadership of the Republican Party says they want regular order they want regular order they passed a budget bill over three months ago the Senate passed a budget the regular order would be to go to conference get rid of the secrets the sequestration the sequester and to proceed with the building invest in America mr. Hoyer's Make It in America invest in innovation in America build the infrastructure of America create jobs and to do so in a way that builds community strengthens the middle class bros our economy with jobs there's the distinguished leadership of this republican party in the house says they want regular order and they have respect for their committees well the Agriculture Committee in a bipartisan way in a bipartisan way passed a bill out of the committee I didn't like the bill the wooden bit of a lie would have written but it was in the Republicans had the leadership Democrats cooperated a biplane out of committee the rumor was and I guess it was just a rumor but it floated that then it would respect that bill as they could come out with a bipartisan bill it would be taken up on the floor the bill that we have here her as little we know about it because it emerged in the middle of the night bears no resemblance to the bill that came out of committee actions of the Republican leadership have been disrespectful to the committee process so don't hand us the regular order argument the audacity to split off the nutrition parts of this bill is so stunning it would be shocking except this is a house of shocks I would say it's one of the worst things you've done but there's such stiff competition for that honor that I can't really fully say that but when you take food out of the mouths of baby and you prevent a bill from going forth that addresses our food banks and our nutrition needs and the rest for our country what are you thinking or are you thinking or are you thinking so so I just I thank you CBC for your leadership on this I thank you Jim McGovern rose it along all of you because this is a fight that you are making for every person in America to live in a country of values of values that include our faith and our faith tells us that to minister to the needs of God's creation is an act of worship to ignore those need that this bill does is to dishonor the God who made us this is very wrong this this even in this place crosses a threshold that we should never go past Jeanette asked this is totally out of the question I'm a mom one of the reasons I involved in politics as I see it as an extension of my role as a mother five kids and now many grandchildren god blessed us but what drove me to this was that I saw all that my kids had all the opportunity all the love all the concern all the rest of it and I thought the best thing that we could all do is make sure that our children for their own welfare grew up in a country where all of America's children were treated with respect and mess as we meet their needs that's just not happening here today I call upon our friends in the faith community and they're here on this issue as well as most of the farmers groups and all the rest there's nobody there's nobody outside this body who supports this bill who cares about the values that we all profess to have within these walls so again taking food out of the mouths of babies that's a good policy I don't think so vote no on this rule

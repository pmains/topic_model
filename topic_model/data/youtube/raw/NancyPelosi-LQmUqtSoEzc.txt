mr. speaker mass shootings have become daily occurrences in this country we see horrific gunfire not communities every day if this isn't a national problem I don't know what constitutes a national problem our silence is just inconceivable how can we remain silent this is the kind of weapon that the suspects fired in San Bernardino these weapons are designed for war and designed to kill as many people as fast as possible there were 355 mass shootings in the first 336 days of this year as the year draws to a close it's apparent that this Congress has little appetite to end gun violence the cost of inaction in Congress is borne by thousands of mourning families here in America last week House Republicans voted three times to block debate on Republican Congressman Peter King's denying firearms and explosives too dangerous terrorist act since 2004 more than 2,000 suspects on the FBI's terrorist watchlist watch list have successfully purchased weapons in the United States seriously terror watch list buy a gun of your choice whenever you want we're better than that need to keep guns away from people who shouldn't have them it is time for Congress to act getting assault weapons out of the hands of criminals and potential terrorists is a good place to start if we do not act this week how can we go home how can we go home and look our constituents in the eye and tell them that we are doing everything we know is enough no more violence no more silence

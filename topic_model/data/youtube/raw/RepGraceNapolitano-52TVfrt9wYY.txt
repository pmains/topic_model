state of the mental health uh the u.s military uh and i'm here's a uh honestly with my colleagues uh which i still appreciate the opportunity to work with uh on a lot of issues but this one's near near to my heart more than anything else i'm actually here this morning as an army dad and i'm one of the parents that got one of those calls before bc before congress probably back in 2007 her son was deployed to the third infantry division and uh it's one of those quotes you don't want to get it wasn't the worst of calls obviously because they were calling to see my son was wounded uh but he was alive uh but from there you know we make uh uh connection with uh logan or son who's i'm proud to say it's now a uh a staff sergeant um in the states of san antonio uh he uh uh it was a fair he lost one of his best friends in that id and uh and to see what he experienced uh with that with that loss and and uh and the call was really hard for penny and i first of all when your son's injured but more than that the fact that it was a delayed call because somebody had died and they had to contact the you know this uh his first sergeant's wife and family and so uh and then i got another phone call uh probably uh after i was elected um what the initial one that would be after election uh but uh that was uh in my first year it was it was a phone call that he called me to talk about all the um all of his friends he had served with when the third id had been in iraq that that that later deployment all of his friends who committed suicide either on post or in our home communities that they were discharged following that that deployment and so uh and that that that was my entry into working with these issues and and we've got a great panelists here this is such an important issue

outreach campaign and now it's my privilege and honor to uh turn the program over to uh a gentleman from ohio a good friend and a colleague congressman tim ryan thank you so much we've got a great plan so i'm going to be very brief and let our other colleagues paul thomas say in order too but just to say thank you for coming i think you know those of us who work on these issues and i think the country as a whole are very concerned about what's happening uh to our men and women in the military and then also what's happening to them after they are discharged and become veterans and start to access the va system and we've been pushing very hard from this caucus and in other ways to promote the kind of approaches that we're going to hear about today the integrative health approaches that um that are i think having a great effect and how we can work with our men and women in the military to build the resiliency that they need to help them better deal with the stressful situations that they're going to find themselves in so we've got a wonderful panel here i'm so thankful uh to always work with you uh and to have you here to spread the word and thank all of you for being here to learn a little bit more and get the word out to you the member of congress so thank you so much and with that my partner and a lot of the mental health work that we're doing thank you so very much to tim and my colleagues thank you for all of what you're doing thank you continue on uh on mental health month this very important issue and ronnie romero is my mentor and also uh a specialist unfortunately won't be with us too much longer so feel tiny towards us we're going to be continuing work that we've been doing for many years and as you know we've been always focused for at least over a decade over the issue of mental health whether it's children veterans seniors create every aspect of what we deal with because at the end people go home from service and they affect the communities that they live in and we need to be able to ensure that we continue reducing the stigma so we can continue the work that needs to be done at every level this 22 veterans die in a day is intolerable we need to reduce we need to reduce it to zero and we need to make sure that we all work towards that and you're going out and talking to other folks about what is trying to be done here in congress and supporting the bills that are being proposed to be able to help the military help the mental health service providers and their families be able to ensure that they have a productive life when they go home um we need to do a better job in transition and sign up for the military including uh imposing upon the military to include them in the va immediately instead of having to sign up for it but to be more forthcoming on working with us at the local level at the state level at federal level because it's this partnership that is going to be able to be more productive to everybody the we have a military legislation that 4305 that both of my colleagues and i'm co-sponsor on the assessment of all incoming military recruits we need to ensure that everybody understands that this is something that is not it's nothing to be ashamed of that we need to ask for help and reach out so i thank the panel for being here i wanted to excuse myself to be on the senate side but i really thank you look forward to working with you in the future especially when it deals with services to the families and of course the bts and tbi are very very much in the forefront of the work that we do so thank you for coming and thank you for being so open and coming and talking to us about this thank you and i'll turn it back over to i believe you're the first one i believe yes thank you so much thank you thank you and thank you for the opportunity to be here this morning i am when they temple i'm with the department of veterans affairs veterans health administration and at va we have both the opportunity and the responsibility to anticipate and to respond to the mental health needs of returning voters as they reintegrate into their communities as they go on to try to live the most fulfilling lives they're able to it's our responsibility to ensure that if they need mental health care that we are providing them with the highest quality care possible so what i thought i would do this morning first is introduce a couple of colleagues from va that i'm accompanied by dr dean kran is the deputy director of va mental health operations and dr alazanian these two gentlemen in the front row here are is the assistant deputy director of va mental health operations um and what i thought i would do with the time that i had to speak with you this morning is trying to answer three questions who is the veteran population that we're seeing in va what are we doing to mba to try to help service members as they transition from dod from active duty to va to veteran status um and third what happens in terms of mental health care once they come to va if someone does need mental health care and they choose to seek that care of va what is it that they're going to receive there i in this time can't give you a full in-depth uh overview that i think can hit some highlights and um and then i think we have some time to answer questions if it raises questions so happy to do that so um the first question who is the veteran population that we're seeing in va since 2002 approximately 1.8 million um veterans who have served in iraq and afghanistan have become eligible for va healthcare so that's about almost 1.8 million service members who have left service and are eligible for va healthcare a little bit over a million of those have actually sought healthcare at va so that's about 58 of those individuals have actually obtained healthcare within va and those veterans from the recent conflicts in iraq and afghanistan are presenting to va with a wide range of difficulties the most common of which is musculoskeletal so outside of my mental health realm um muscle and and joint pain but second on that list is mental health concerns so mental health is the second most common type of diagnosis that those veterans who are presenting for the current conflicts are coming to va and seeking care for among those mental health conditions post-traumatic stress disorder is the most common diagnosis depression and other mood disorders as well as anxiety disorders are also quite common and those are then followed by substance use disorders so those are the most common sorts of mental health concerns that we're seeing in va amongst returning veterans and then if we step back a little bit further and consider all veterans who have used va healthcare not just those returning from the current conflict and and just you know those returning from the current conflicts comprise about 10 of who va is seeing at this point um so still the bulk of the patients that we're seeing in va healthcare are um veterans from previous service eras prior to the current conflict so um but so stepping back and looking at the whole the asia population in 2013 over 5.5 million veterans used va healthcare and i'll stop with the boring numbers in a second i just thought i would have sort of set the stage of who are we seeing um sorry i realized as i'm spouting these numbers that um so of those 5.5 million veterans who were seen for healthcare in 2013 in va about one in three have a possible mental illness that is somewhere in their chart the mental health diagnosis appears um and about one in four have a confirmed mental illness that means that they are seen for either an inpatient or residential care visit or at least two outpatient visits with a mental health diagnosis in their chart for those visits so um so that's about 1.4 million veterans in 2013 that we're seeing in va for mental health care so we have a lot of work to do in this area and are trying hard to do it and one of the areas that we're working on is trying to facilitate when someone is leaving active duty when they're leaving service and army navy air force marines coast guard that we are helping them transition to va care as smoothly as possible and one so i want to i'll just highlight a couple of efforts in that area one is actually a dod program that we work closely with it's called the in transition program it's a coaching and support program designed to serve service members who are undergoing any sort of transition in their career whether they're leaving the service whether they're transferring to another health care system whether they're trans you know going to a new duty station within dod it's focused on helping those who are already identified as needing behavioral health or mental health care and helping them support them in those transitions so they're already in care and making a transition how can we help support them in that transition and ensure that they get the care they need on the other side of it and so the in-transition program from a va perspective we've worked closely with that team to develop joint trainings to make sure that va providers are aware of this resource and um are able to make referrals to it and and readily receive referrals from the program and get patients into care um so and and the program has had the of service members who have responded to satisfaction surveys on intransition about 95 have said that they were pleased with their services that they received and that they would recommend it to others and i think even more striking to me is that 93 said that they were more likely to engage in treatment on the other side of their transition as a result of their experience in the transition program so that's a program that we work closely with in va as i said it's focused on those who are already identified as needing mental health care already in mental health care they're expanding their efforts a little bit to um more than a little bit they're expanding their efforts to reach veterans who are service members who screen positive or so answer some questions indicating they might have mental health concerns and the post-employment health reassessment process um but who aren't yet in mental health care those service members also can receive over for our company and transition program um a couple of other va programs i'll mention a couple of other va programs that i'll mention one is be in liaisons for healthcare and um through that program va has 41 liaisons who are mostly social workers and nurses stationed at 21 military treatment facilities so they work side by side with the dod care providers providing on-site consultation educating service members and their families about what resources and treatment options are available to them once they leave the military and helping facilitate the transfer when someone is leaving a military treatment facility and going into va care and to date those liaisons that are part of that program are facilitated or coordinated upwards of 52 000 transfers from military treatment facilities to va either inpatient or outpatient indicator um a second program within va that i'll mention is the transition and care management teams that are located at hva medical center these are teams of providers that are specially trained in addressing the needs of returning combat veterans of identifying not just va resources but also local community resources to help them and their families readjust to civilian life and get engaged in any care that they may need whether it's medical care mental health care whatever kind of care it is that they might need and help them recover from whatever injuries they might have and as i said readjust to civilian life both them and their families so i will also just mention quickly that va another thing that va is actively engaged in with dod is outreach to service members who are transitioning to va there are a lot of service members who as they're leaving military service as they're leaving active duty they may not be in need of mental health care right that minute but they might discover later that they're having a problem or problems might emerge later or they might be aware but not necessarily want to seek mental health care at va at that time and so for those people which is a large number of people if we can make sure still at the time of transition that they're aware of what is available to them if they do determine there's a need or if they do decide that the va is where they want to go to help address any amount of health concerns they have then we have provided a tremendous amount of outreach and assistance as part of the transition assistance program and other sorts of outreach programs as service members active duty national guard and reserve are transitioning from active duty status into veteran status and so that's that's an important component of what we do because not everyone we're not seeing people necessarily at the moment when they're raising their hand and saying i have a mental health problem and i think i need some help no matter when we're seeing them we want them to know about the resources that are available so um i wanted to just mention that and then so that's a little bit about what we do related to transition from service into va lastly i'll just try quickly to answer a little bit of the question of then what happens if someone does come to va for mental health care what is it that they will receive what services are available um for veterans who if they have mental health needs choose to seek their care at va and i will say that over the time i've been in va for about 14 years and over the time that i've been in va i think our system has made strong progress with regards to improving mental health care we have a lot of work to do we will always have a lot of work to do to make our system better and to make that care better and we are working to make that happen but i think we have made a lot of a lot of progress within the va system there are lots of different entry points into care there are 151 va medical centers there are 820 community based outpatient clinics and there are 300 vet centers all of which offer a full range of mental health services and once someone comes to us for mental health care that care we endeavor to make that care veteran-centered recovery oriented to focusing on recovery and leading a fulfilling life and evidence-based what is the evidence what is what does the research show is effective it's going to be effective for this person who is sitting here for me with a need um va offers a full continuum of mental health care from inpatient and residential care to specialized outpatient care to mental health care that can be provided in primary care clinics and mental health care that can be provided in various other settings we work closely with the homeless program office we work closely with veterans who are involved in the justice system because of mental health concerns we work closely with student veterans on college campuses and so really the full range from you're in the hospital acutely in need of mental health care too you're out in the community and experiencing some distress having some challenges that are not quite sure what to do about them being able to address that full continuum is what we try to do um va as many of you know has undertaken a tremendous amount of effort in the last several years with regards to suicide prevention and has a veterans crisis line that's available 24 7 to with experts trained in dealing with crises and in suicide prevention that line is open it's a toll-free phone line it's available through text and an online chat service as well and it's available to veterans it's available to active duty service members it's available to a family member or other person in the community who cares about an active duty service member or veteran and through the crisis line is another way that people can get linked into the care that they might need another thing that i'll mention and then and then i'll stop the is that va clinicians also proactively screen for post-traumatic stress disorder depression substance use disorders as well as military sexual trauma so even if someone's coming to va for health care they will get screened for those things so that we can help proactively identify if they are having problems even if they're not spontaneously reporting them or coming to va just for that reason um we think that will help people get into treatment earlier and more proactively before things get um worse and harder to deal with for them so um and we also have um made efforts around the country to offer longer clinic hours and offer things like telemedicine to make it easier for veterans and their families to take advantage of the services that we do have available realizing that people can't necessarily come to the clinic you know between nine and five how how can we make the if we you know have done all this work to improve the services that are available how can we make sure that um that it's convenient for veterans to receive those and that they're able to receive those better those services in a way that's most helpful to them um so one last thing i will mention is um a few resources that are available so i've been talking a little bit about services that are available once someone comes in to va there are also a number of things we've been working on in recent years a lot of which we've been working on with dod recognizing as i said at the very beginning with the numbers i threw out there was a 58 of um oef oif ond veterans who are eligible for va care have come to va for care that's what that means 42 of those who are eligible for care not walk into the door of a va so we've done a lot of effort over the last several years to make resources available to veterans regardless of whether they're coming to va for care if they if they need them and especially information so that they know if they need care and know how to get that care if they do need it so for example we've developed a public outreach campaign called make the connection which is the focus of which is trying to reduce the stigma associated with seeking mental health care to educate veterans and their families in the general public frankly about mental health concerns and to encourage those who might need mental health care to seek that care and the focus of that is doing that through veterans and their family members telling their own stories of having sought care and how that care was effective for them so that's the make the connection campaign i mentioned the veterans crisis line being available even to veterans and service members who are not seeking via care or indian care developed a variety of mobile phone apps that are available to the general public all for free things like ptsd coach provides education and mechanism for tracking ptsd symptoms either as part of treatment or just on someone's own their apps for insomnia their apps for helping to stop somebody's stop smoking um etc and then and there are also some web-based self-help courses that are available 24 7. anybody who is interested and wants to work on a problem but doesn't necessarily think they need to or doesn't necessarily want to go into va one of those is focused on parenting and it's focused for veterans and service members on parenting and specific issues related to parenting that come up um related to military service and the other one is focused on an evidence-based intervention for problem-solving training and so whatever challenges somebody might be facing they can go online and do and learn very specific skills that will proactively help them manage and deal with those problems themselves and again those are these are just some resources that are available regardless of whether somebody's in vaca or whether they want anything to do with the va um but that are specifically veteran focused and focused on the mental health needs that we know um exist among veterans so with that i will stop babbling and pass the mic over to lieutenant colonel ivany and then i think we'll all do our um comments and then do a question at the end so happy to take questions thank you wendy thanks everybody for the chance to be here today um i'm here as a officer in army medicine and i think it's appropriate that we're here to talk about the forward movement within this this area army medicine has been uh very engaged in trying to transform from a health care system a traditional health care system uh to a system for health it means that trying to to transition just from a mindset of a hospital-based disease-focused treatment entity to one that extends beyond the walls of the hospital to to proactively influence those within within the army uh towards health to hopefully uh keep the rates of incidents of of common conditions uh health conditions mental health conditions lower so that we can bend the cost of health and and more importantly help keep people uh healthier so army mental health has been on the forefront of that larger army medicine effort now for first several years to best understand uh where we're at now it's probably helpful to look back a few years and if you would have looked at army behavioral health about five years ago uh in the midst of the two ongoing conflicts army medicine leaders realized at the time that the system was not the army army behavioral health system was not adequately staffed and was not properly designed to handle the volume of in the type of mental health conditions that soldiers and their family members were dealing with and so over the course of the next several years probably two to three years uh it was a emphasis mostly at the local hospital level on all of our installations to innovate and to develop new programs and new ways with new resources that were allocated to better take care of mental health care for soldiers and their family members uh and we had quite a few successes uh uh over over the total total army force but this challenge was that it was very hard to tell which programs were actually the most effective ones there were actually 211 different ways in which mental health care is being delivered depending upon which installation you were you were going to uh so the challenge for army medicine over the course of the last two to three years has been to find the best practices among the entire force replicate those practices at all other army army locations to make sure that beneficiaries at fort drum new york did the same best practice treatment as they do at fort park in colorado and that has been our our focus we have narrowed the list of programs down to uh ten key clinical programs and one key medical i.t system uh that helps to support all those things uh together so we've had we have identified what those best practices are based on uh standardized outcomes and clinical metrics and now implementing those across the course we're probably about two thirds of the way through that process and i want to highlight a couple of those programs that we have have identified as best practices and are moving forward with across across the whole army one is the placement of behavioral health providers within the primary care clinics so this is part of the patient-centered medical home initiative there's actually a national level initiative that is through dod and down to the army so the importance of having a behavioral health provider actually physically located within a primary care clinic is several one obviously is that improves access to care for those folks they don't necessarily have to if they mention to their primary care doc they have a mental health concern they don't have to they don't have to go through the referral process of putting a note to the computer and then getting called back later they can simply go down the hall to make their first contact with a mental health provider which which is in some clinics to the 30 or 40 percent um nationally if you wait for a referral system board you're going to lose 30 to 40 of the people that you know uh need mental health care so that's that's that's that's one aspect secondly is the focus of those folks in the primary care clinic these health psychology trained mental health providers is not just to treat mental illness but to help primary care providers and the rest of the patient center medical home team to to focus on wellness so to focus on exercise nutrition sleep smoking cessation other things that we know precede mental illness or it can be complicating factors towards mental illness uh the role of that that that forward position behavioral health provider in the primary care clinic is to try to help influence on the very very front end so that's that's one thing secondly within the first level of specialty specialty mental health care so meaning when when soldiers uh are have had a mental health condition that has been identified that's going to need some type of treatment it used to be that those soldiers used to have to be referred up to the main hospital typically or some large clinic on our large coast but a program that was started um about five years ago four years ago now is now being replicated across the course is one which brings mental health professionals multi-disciplinary teams of psychiatrists psychologists social workers tax nurses out of the hospital and puts them in small clinics which are actually located in the unit's footprint so you're in a particular brigade located on fort hood texas let's say you don't you don't have to go figure out how to get all the to the hospital across the road which is a pretty big place and if you're a private you may not have a car uh and you have to figure out a way to get across there now at 50 different locations where we have constructed these new clinics and have these teams out forward in the brigade locations simply have to walk out of your barracks and maybe pass the motor pool or pass the where you eat lunch every day into the mental health which is located right in your area one of the other advantages of having mental health care out in the unit footprint is that we're able to develop much more effective relationships between our behavioral health providers and the unit commanders and the unit leaders so those that know the army know how important the influence of leaders are at the company level at the small unit level in other words if you're you're a sergeant uh if you are a private or a specialist let's say your sergeant or your sergeant major has a huge influence on your life they determine what time you wake up in the morning what time you get to eat what time you go to bed when you're going to the field when you're coming out of the field and just about everything in between so we know that as effective as many of our treatments for mental health conditions are both the traditional and and and other other newer approaches uh are what is actually that our data has shown very clearly it's much more important actually is how you're treated in your unit and the conditions that your unit leaders are setting for you uh to either to to get better if you have a condition or even prior to having having a diagnosis of a mental health condition uh there's been good data that's shown that if you expose the same type of infantry units to the same levels of combat and you look at the incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder that comes out of those those folks a year or two later the most important variable is the quality of the small unit leadership and how the unit leaders treat those soldiers in other words do they support them when they have when they have uh problems right do they make them do extra tasks do they do they help them get to their premium clinic all those kinds of things that you sort of take for granted are magnified within the army because of the the structure that that is in place within the military so the importance of bringing behavioral providers and bringing them out to the unit footprint is not just to make access easier for soldiers but it's also to build relationships so that mental health providers can help advise commanders and first sergeants and company commanders young guys 25 28 years old who are leading groups of soldiers and trying to make decisions about how to best lead their unit balance their mission with taking care of their people and so when you have relationships ongoing working relationships our mental health folks can be much more effective in helping those commanders and those young starters to make good decisions that take care of their soldiers help them get better quicker or hopefully prevent them from from getting sick in the first place third i wanted to highlight the child and family mental health section of how we move forward we we over the course of the last you know 10 years have focused almost exclusively within the direct care system in most places on the needs of soldiers due to the high volume of mental health that was coming out of our soldiers what has been what has been we've used the tricare network more and more to take care of the child and family aspect just give you an example i'm a child trained psychiatrist i spent two years in a fellowship to train specifically after my residency in child psychiatry since i graduated from philadelphia over almost 10 years ago i've seen about five children and told all the rest of my clinical practices uh and similar things have happened across the rest of the course so about three four years ago folks realized that we were working within the context of a national shortage for child trained social workers psychologists and and all mental health providers and we needed to do more within the direct army uh health care system to take care of decisions so we developed uh several ways to do that one is by through school behavioral health care so this is this is prominent a couple years of the country in maryland and other places where we have positioned mental health care providers actually within the schools on army installation so we have small clinics so that kids who are identified by their parents uh or through the school uh leadership team can access mental health care right there physically within the school and over the course of the next two years we hope to have at least one mental health care provider within every school on an army installation secondly we've also uh we've also greatly expanded its health behavior health capability for our primary care providers to be able to much more easily access mental health care for for tough to handle child psychiatric issues with which they may not be trained uh as well and we need consultation rapidly and all that has led to a great expansion in the use of mental health we had about in fiscal year 2008 there was less than one million total contacts between army beneficiaries and and army mental health care last year there was over 2.1 million uh contacts with more than double the number of visits of all types for all beneficiaries that has occurred we think that has has greatly helped uh in getting mental health care to folks early in the course of their conditions so that we can prevent bad outcomes from happening bad things that happen down the road one of the things we watch very closely there is how frequently our those mental health care so our goal obviously is to identify conditions and treat them in the outpatient setting as much as possible and most conditions can be treated in the outpatient setting uh last year in 2013 was the first year since since 2004 that we've seen a downturn in his requirement for inpatient hospitalization despite a continued increase in the outpatient utilization uh so we feel like these programs that i mentioned to you and several others that are part of our uh the army behavioral health corps uh 10 clinical programs uh are making difference uh we still have a long way to go to get where wherever we want to be uh thank you that's uh great my name is wayne jonas uh army doctor for uh 24 years institute and nonprofit research foundation there's a lot of work with the va and the ufc especially on mental health give a little bit different perspective here uh the programs that dr eddy and others have mentioned are fabulous and they're going in the right direction there's no question about them when i was trained as a physician i was trained so at the top of the heap to know everybody to write all the orders and everybody else just followed okay uh and uh the medical home says no we need to do something different in which the delivery members like the mental health professionals mentioned here actually out in the field or in the community uh helping individuals where they're at in other words what the patient needs uh it's a great idea uh it's very hard to implement for folks like we work for a system that is actually structured not to structure to actually deliver what they think is the needs of the patients uh with the communities instead of listening to them and then trying to go back to that lieutenant karate mentioned the mental health coaches that are now helping with wellness and that's fantastic to get them trained in the ability to develop wellness but that's a different specialty actually than mental health and most people know that uh as a health coach the behavioral change that's needed as part of that is not part of your without own training my training i was trained uh to see if i the quickest way i could get people through so my productivity would be up uh and that meant 15 to 20 minutes or five minutes in sick call and that's still the way the system is set up the system is still a vast majority of things deliver those those types of things so the statistics you've heard you know about uh you know there are a huge number of those with post-traumatic stress disorder with depression and anxiety we've mentioned that have come back in the last 10 years of the war that brain injury which then is a results in a conglomeration of forms that come together they're called comorbidities in technical language they have to do with pain they have to deal with cognitive difficulties they have to do emotional problems and they have to deal with the problems of encountering the medical system and getting drugs so opioid dependency etc the study will come out in the next month that shows in the in a unit that came back from afghanistan 45 of those uh actually resulted in ended up with chronic pain problems fifteen percent of those are opioids six percent with no pain autopilots uh in those areas we have a huge drug industry that keeps writing scripts and keeps telling us to do that it's the easiest simple thing the programs that were described both in the va uh and in the uh in the army in the military are moving trying to turn that battleship trying to turn the tide to provide more self-care drugless approaches to enhance these areas but i can tell you that it's not fast enough it is not fast enough about eight years ago we did a study showing acupuncture had an effect size for treating ptsd as we've got walter reed without with our investigators and those in the deployment health center the effect size of acupuncture for alleviating ptsd was just as large as any other treatment that existed but it didn't use drugs it was very easy to deliver within a month and a lasting even after it was stopped there hasn't been a single additional study funded by the dod and agriculture and context this is it's trickling in okay we need to market and accelerate these areas did another study at uh camp adjourned with marines showing a simple mind-body technique uh human touch and guided imagery to train individuals to help manage their own emotional volatility reducing aggressiveness improving cognitive function uh reducing depression and needing those medications in those areas in that study published in military medicine there's not been another single follow-up of that in those numbers areas military says you can get these kinds of services self-care services drugless approaches in these areas and you can in some places but it's completely unsystematic it's not centralized it's not evaluated and it's not emphasized in these areas and so you can go down to the national center of intrepid near walter reed bethesda and if you go in there you can get them as soon as you go back out to the field it depends on if there's a champion there's somebody that's been trained maybe they've been trained correctly correctly i mean they haven't uh and frequently they're not available so they're there but they're not available to the general population and to the folks that meet in those years so there really needs to be an increased emphasis in those areas you know the basic message is that war is hard we all know that right it's difficult people get hurt a lot of people get hurt and it isn't just those who go to war there's eight to ten uh individuals family members that end up being the caregivers or end up being involved and helping for the rest of their lives managing and working with these individuals when they come back that affects a huge population recently the costs of doing business as usual simply providing more services more medical services in these areas are going to be the biggest national threat according to the kennedy school of government over the lifetime of the those service members that have come back and transferred to the va simply providing more medical services and benefits are going to cost us nearly five trillion dollars i mean we already paid for that our children are going to be paying for that we need to bend the cost curve we need to emphasize things that truly retrain individuals to come back into society we spend a lot of time training them for war we empower them to be good service members and soldiers and they do a fantastic job when they come back we provide them with medical services we disempower them what happens when you walk into a hospital you make decisions about your own health care up until that point but then you put in a road right and somebody's telling you what to do you get disempowered our system is set up to do that we need to reintegrate retrain them and spend at least as much time in the self-care kinds of practices and making the integration of those efforts so the efforts that were just discussed are all moving in that direction and attempting to do that we have a system that isn't set up to do that we have a system that's we need to rethink how to do that uh so that those services can become widely available in those areas we recently mapped fitness practices uh down at camp insurance marine base down there i found there were somewhere between actually didn't know all the programs that were down there there were somewhere between 80 and 120 programs established funded programs uh but less than two percent had any evaluation whatsoever so i'd love to hear the ten practices that the army's now evaluated and said these are the best practices in those areas because very few are actually getting evaluations and as the as the eob shrinks uh and as the budgets get cut we're not going to know actually what works and what doesn't work in those areas there needs to be some kind of centralized emphasis on self-care practices on drugs approaches in these areas uh that where the research needed to actually figure out how to implement this is adequately funded and not simply more services usable as usual and we need to evaluate them to know what works and what doesn't work so that we're not simply uh cutting them in those areas so i'll uh all in there and turn it over to the next candidate good morning can anyone hear me good because in real life i'm an audiologist i am dr vinnie and morsel i'm the writing spouse of lieutenant colonel richard as you know died suddenly but i have two children when i received the message that i was requested to participate today my case alone could have sufficed but that's not why i'm here i decided to pulse the community the community of winsters winsters is what we call ourselves we're widow sisters we're a a new sorority of military surviving spouses that bond very well so i pulsed the community with students and said you tell me tell me what's the good the bad the ugly but i really want to focus on what works well we all know the baby's ugly there's no reason to spend thousands of dollars and say it didn't work let's look at what does work and perhaps either make it better or expand on it or share the news so i would talk a little bit about us and the consensus was that there is no one stop shop to have our support for grief not one organization but it's really made up of multi-classes support of many different organizations whether it's the not the ngos the military the va everyone had great support and things to say about all the organizations so we really need a multi-class support there are many different reasons why one would work for the other there are independent variables that influence our greeting process the types of death long term knowing that the train is going to wreck if you know your husband's going to die with a long illness but our debts are not like that outfits are sudden or they're violent and that has an adverse effect on how we're going to agree but whether or not the grieving process is going to be prolonged besides the type of death you have to think about whether or not we had children or no children which is actually for a lot of these surviving spouses that is worse yet because they miss the opportunity to have a child and that can never change their life experience under their balance is going to vary so some will be more resilient than others depending on age of course and it's difficult to predict how we handle our grief as there is no timeline some may put it on the back burner until they get done with certain things in their lives and then the grief will come up so just because someone's died three years ago and also being said in the face of the grief that was when they decided to work with them but due to our typical deaths that are said and invited i make this unique complicated and complex reading counseling must be made available and appropriate so i'm going to go in and describe who you know who is this widow well i did some research and there's not much out there but there is an article at all about the statistics of the past 10 years it's been 11. there's been about 16 000 deaths of the 16 000 deaths um 95 percent were male of those male 50 were married they had at least one child so we can make an educated guess that that widow is going to be young and with a small child so with that said that young widow probably doesn't have again a lot of life experience under the belt or tools to work with next thing we're talking about is what how does death has an adverse effect on our optimal well-being well-being is quite important as you know that um with the mental health if our optimal well-being isn't intact there will be repercussions um soon what happens is a death there is an identity change we are no longer the military spouse we lost that identity we are now the widow and losing a husband is one facet but losing also the military family it's another loss the fight family dynamics we have a widow whose husband was married before so there was a step child involved well once that that happened that step child is no longer a part of her life she lost her husband and she lost her child that's two losses it's another dynamic to grieving decisions decisions are having to be made quick decisions are having to me they they're going to affect the rest of their lives deciding whether or not they should have an option for benefits spouse option or is it going to be a child option and for you those who don't know are the benefit issues it's like where's the acorn now you've got a ba payment you've got a do payment dod payment do you do both you can't if you do you offset it it's so confusing but within the first week or two those widows are having to decide unfortunately they regret the decision that was made for them or they made under the following brief i one of the recommendations i'd like to see is dod consider that the first year that made a decision that haunts them today they have an availability to change within that first year at grace period to say i would like to have the spp unfortunately offset by my dic these are these are terms right now but um it's the dependency of any compensation and it's about the benefit plan but they would like to change it but it's too late but those those decisions that were made early on adversely affect how they are today with their anxiety because they worry they can see the financial nightmare lumen on the horizon however though now so that's another story we have many different behavioral changes we have physical changes we have cognitive changes we have spiritual changes we are if you put it all together it's not a pretty look we really go through a lot of different uh changes and the best way to describe it if you if i used to explain to anyone what we have to go through we end up aging like dogs for every year you've been a widow you've aged seven it is not a simple life it is very complicated you know even our sleep many widows i don't know if we many of us have good night sleeps and i tell many people that after a death widows sleep like babies every three hours we wake up and cry and if that doesn't take a toll to your to your physical well well being it it will so those are i know you all talked about it easier sleep is very important to our health and if we're not getting the right sleep then it will have an adverse effect every video is unique for the situation financial challenges and reading process as well as whether or not the husband left money and you think well this is all about money well unfortunately there are some hiccups during their death and it does impede the ability to grieve and get the care for some the surviving spouse was not left the sgli insurance or there was a divorce so the widow now is has a complicated grief she despises the man who died who was killed but grieves and mourns for the man she fell in love with so there's not just one case of one widow there's many different types of issues that can come up what i'd like to talk about now is what what challenges did we face and i really try not to perseverate on all the bad it's not the bad it's just the challenges the challenges that we had were guessing um care of military treatment facilities and we knew this because depending on where you live maybe it was too far or the hospital itself wasn't prepared to support the children now mind you it's the input has changed the inputs today but the times of the deaths have changed so there's been a lot of growth and so if it wasn't available then i know it's been improved but that was a challenge for a lot um the stigma the icd-9 code of depression nobody wants the icd-90 depression and that's how we rebuild for grief if you went for a medical appointment you tell them you know i lost my husband three years ago but i want to talk about it the only way i care would pay for that was to go ahead and put icd-9 on on depression that's going to change with the new ic the 10 code so that works out well um somewhere just drove from fredericksburg to walter reed why because the care was good but the challenge was the drive it took a day off work and a day out of school difficult getting referrals because not understanding how tricare works did was it a direct referral was a non-indirect referral in the civilian sector um the vietnam widow she missed the opportunity to have a councilman available but the vet senate has provided them well i did get input from the vietnam winners what worked really well and this is really important is the professional medical mental health support taps with grief seminars good week camp for children the focus program families are becoming under stress the va vet center military treatment facilities after that center these are programs where they can get professional help for peer support peer support is phenomenal as part of the healthy process with us sharing lessons and provide support when needed with their fellow listeners as part of their peer support helping others less fortunate and looking in the rearview mirror these will look back and recall this is what was hard for me and i can help someone else our social media is phenomenal and this is where everybody gets to bed and they're private and closed many organizations provided support but sensitive understanding is no one should go through grief alone regardless of location and circumstance of death they provided emotional healthy physical activities bringing winners together along with their children building healthy relationships allowing the women to be a widow allowing them to breathe and this is really important for the suicide spouses surviving spouses there is a big there's a stigma a lot of organizations did not include them in their um in their programs because they were the survivors of suicide and tax is one of one of the first organizations that welcomed them in with open arms and it made a difference for one of the families that submitted their input there are such groups such as co-star rights of america taps crisis hotlines seminars good with camps especially for suicide survivors tabs army post the spider outreach services and and the army post is a wonderful um place to go they provide services for all branches of the services they may not give the service there if they can tell you where to go to get it and that's important so as long as there's a place where they can um to contact with and i think that i hope the army will keep up that sos programs having simple access to counseling without referral sources tax military one stores a quick connection or the need of crisis which i must say i have used and it works well the takeaway is the recent winner from this current conflict is young without a lot of life under her belt to help her breathing counseling and connecting with other peer mentoring groups should be available with easy access and is imperative early on when the debt is fresh we need to assure our coding for treatment is appropriate and so it does not interfere with our future to bring your attention to this also that thousands of uh vietnam widows are not seeking support but hopefully the va will put out a message saying that that center is also open for them if they have the benefit we don't believe our dad starts sudden sometimes violence our reactions vary yet wide range but we should continue to strive to improve our benefits and with your support with the community we can provide the support for the fighting spouses and their families um i thank you for the opportunity to speak today and i will tell you right off the bat i didn't think i could talk for 10 minutes but i can talk forever and stop and i'll take any questions you have to offer thank you um so we'll just take questions now if there's any questions actually a question um so other than the um social outreach social media outreach and then missing um make a connection kind of what is the va doing to make people more open to going to the va for help and are there suggestions on what we can do to kind so the question was about what is what is va doing to make people more open to going to the ehrl one thing you mentioned make the connection is a national outreach campaign to really help people understand i think if people understand that what they're experiencing is something that is treatable that treatment is available that treatment works though other services or support is available that they're not alone and they're much more likely to seek out some sort of care um you know va would love va has worked hard as i said to make our care high quality and make effective treatments available but um i honestly if someone is struggling you want them to get care or support or treatment wherever it is that they feel comfortable getting that care and i think the community at large can do a lot to try to reduce the stigma and support those people who are struggling and may or may not want to seek care you know at all or with the va i think there's a lot there's a lot that the community can do outside of va to encour again to encourage people to get care if they need it but also support them in the community um things like you know jobs and relationships and other things that affect your quality of life also affect your mental health and so to the extent that the community and our services are supporting those at the other elements of people's lives then we're also supporting them any other questions good morning andrew caspar i represent substance abuse treatment counselors and including those in the armed forces and i'm curious if you could uh address the treatment of substance abuse and any progress in terms of a single diagnosis for substance abuse rather than having it as a subset of mental health for those who present with addiction or substance abuse issues that may not necessarily have a co-occurring mental health disorder the army certainly does not set the the national diagnostic practices right so we follow the diagnostic crisis that are that are laid out at the national level and uh so that's i think that part is one step beyond what we can control however some of the key aspects of ensuring that substance use full screening for substance abuse conditions and then easy treatment or easy access to treatment for substance abuse conditions is very important one one thing that the army has done uh recently is is instituted uh screening for substance abuse conditions uh as as a part of the routine mental health and physical screening uh that occurs uh at all the touch points when soldiers are screened so it's not it does not require but a subspecialty level assessment so you can go right from the initial screening right to substance through mental health for example and you mentioned the dual diagnosis uh patients so you you don't need to have a mental health condition for your referrals sort of substance abuse there's also been steps made within the military and maybe another service as well to provide confidential access to substance abuse treatment so army substance abuse treatment centers are open off hours and require any kind of command notification and referral to use those services as long as there's nothing illegal going on or endangering somebody else then that treatment is not revealed to anybody and the efforts were made at the clinic hours and saturdays and after hours to make sure that especially folks that are more senior ranking are the ones that are typically most reluctant to access substance abuse treatment so there has been some additional access to substance abuse right so those are actually on post but it is health american occupational therapy association and i was wondering if you all were seeing the link between traumatic brain injuries even like low level traumatic brain injuries and now issues further down the road especially in that cognitive changes small changes leading to depression and if so is there extra outreach for people who've had that kind of injury you know from the va is that one of your target groups and certainly that individuals veterans who have experienced a traumatic brain injury and are experiencing any um symptoms or difficulties as a result of that we are reaching out to every um as i mentioned the proactive screening that we're doing for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder and military sexual trauma alcohol use um every patient who comes into the va also gets screened for whether they've experienced a traumatic brain injury so we certainly are looking at that and reaching out with our colleagues in the rehabilitation community to make sure that we're identifying and providing the full range of services that are needed by individuals who might have um you know either both a traumatic brain injury and a mental health condition or some of the symptoms that you mentioned can be associated with a traumatic brain injury um that psychosocial interventions can be helpful for so we certainly are looking at those things together thanks great question anyone else great i want to thank our panelists for coming and for all of you guys for coming to the briefing and if you have any follow-up questions um you can contact them or you can contact me in congress from ryan's office um you can kind of pull amanda montana's office

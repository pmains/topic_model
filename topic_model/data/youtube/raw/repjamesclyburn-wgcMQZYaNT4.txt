thank you very much mr speaker i thank you lady uh for yielding me this time thank you very much i do have some prepared remarks here which i uh don't tell my staff that i'm not going to use them i want to speak just a little bit about what i just heard and what i think some of our challenges are in this great country of ours and it is a great country does not need to be made great again our problem is making this greatness accessible and affordable for all of its citizens and i think one of the ways that we do that is to recognize that we have a shared history in this country but it's a history they spotted with a lot of inequities inequalities and a lot of things that we ought to be about the business of working to try and level off the so-called playing field and one of those i think is really about the ability to communicate when we talk about juneteenth i often equate the history of unity with our country's inability to communicate because after uh the emancipation proclamation uh signed by abraham lincoln in 1862 to be effective january 1 1863. freeing all the slaves in the former of the union states former slave states uh not on the union control now when that happened uh there was a big meeting down on the banks uh a river in beaufort county south carolina near port royal four thousand slaves came to listen to general saxton read the emancipation proclamation on that day they were free however it was june 19 1865 two and a half years later before it was communicated to those who were enslaved in texas the failure to communicate kept them in slavery for another two and a half years the failure to communicate is what seems to keep us from coming together as one people today if we learn the lessons of history as george santiano once said to us when we learn the lesson of history we are bound to repeat them if we don't so i would hope that as we turn this piece of legislation into law and create a national holiday for june juneteenth i hope we'll keep a couple of things in mind it's not lost on me that this building we all meet in was built by slaves and one of the little known facts was a man named philip reed who was enslaved in charleston south carolina and who came after being bought to washington dc worked in the foundry and the statute on top of this building lady liberty when the foundry made the statute of liberty they couldn't get it up on top of the building all of those learned people who had been free all of their lives could not figure out how to get that statute on top of this building philip reid enslaved figured it out and he showed them how to get that statute on top of this building he was able to communicate some lessons that only he could teach though he was unlearned in fact it was against the law to even teach him to read and his name was read spelt a little differently by this name now i would hope that we would pass this law i suspect we won't do what the senate did and did it unanimously so i think it will be a tremendous demonstration of unity for every one of us to vote to pass this law recognizing june 19th as a national holiday speaker i reluctantly yield back the balance of my time

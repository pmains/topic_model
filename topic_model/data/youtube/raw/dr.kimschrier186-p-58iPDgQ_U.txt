I've been in law enforcement for over 36 years
and I've seen a lot of politicians talk about police. But Kim Schrier is different. She listens to us, and she delivers. It's Kim who got more money for law enforcement
to fund equipment that we need like new bulletproof vests and more funding for mental health resources
for an integrated approach to serve our community. We need to increase funding to police and
that's exactly what I've done in Congress. Kim has our back, and she has my support. I'm Kim Schrier and I approve this message.

RATCHETING. THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. [APPLAUSE] >> JENNIFER, MY ONLY REQUEST IS THAT YOU BE THE PERSON TO INTRODUCE ME WHERE EVER I MIGHT SPEAK ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY. I BRAD SHERMAN FROM CALIFORNIA'S BEST NAMED CITY, SHERMAN OAKS. [LAUGHTER] IT'S AN HONOR TO BE WITH YOU AND I HOPE THAT I'VE BEEN INVITED TO SPEAK BECAUSE OF THE WISDOM I HAVE A COMMITTED OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS IN CONGRESS, AND NOT JUST BECAUSE I GOT TO THE ROOM. BUT BY DEFINITION DEPENDING UPON YOUR DEFINITION, THOSE WITH DISABILITIES ARE THE LARGEST MINORITY GROUP IN THE COUNTRY, AND ONE OF THE FEW THAT YOU MAY JOIN AT ANY POINT IN YOUR LIVES. ADDRESSED ALL OF US ARE TABBED TEMPORARILY ABLE-BODIED. IS ALSO THE MOST DISADVANTAGED ECONOMIC GROUP IN THIS COUNTRY. 28.7% OF THOSE WITH DISABILITIES ARE LIVING IN POVERTY. THAT EXCEEDS ANY OTHER RACIAL OR ETHNIC GROUP. 22 MILLION WORKING AGE DISABLED ADULT LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY, ONLY ONE OUT OF THREE HAVE JOBS. YOU'VE GOT OTHER EXPERTS TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT DISABILITY AND ABOUT HOW TO, AS A COMMUNITY, TO OVERCOME THE DIFFICULTIES THAT YOU FACE. I'M HERE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW TO PERSUADE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, HOW TO LOBBY WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE A PACK. I'LL GO THROUGH SOME POINTS. FIRST, HAVE ALLIES AND CREATE A COALITION. WHEN YOU HAND THAT PAPER TO A MEMBER OF CONGRESS OR A SENATOR, YOU ARE GOING TO WANT TO SAY THIS IS ENDORSED BY THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY. THE ONE THING THAT WILL MAKE A MEMBER OF CONGRESS RELUCTANT TO HELP OUT IS THE FEAR THAT THEY ARE GOING TO SIGN ONTO YOUR PROGRAM ONLY TO HEAR FROM OTHERS IN THE SAME COMMUNITY THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE GONE IN ANOTHER DIRECTION. SECOND, KEEP IN MIND HOW BUSY AND THINLY SPREAD A MEMBER OF CONGRESS IS YOUR I'M TALKING ABOUT DISABILITY ISSUES NOW. I WILL BE WORKING ON 19 REGULATION WOULD I GO BACK TO MY OFFICE. BY BEFORE THAT I WAS FOCUSED ON THE PENINSULA. IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT IS, THAT'S FINE BUT IT JUST ILLUSTRATES THAT JUST AS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS DOESN'T KNOW A LOT OF WHAT YOU KNOW, THAT'S BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO KNOW A LOT OF THINGS YOU DON'T HAVE TO KNOW. SO THEY ARE AN INCH DEEP AND A MILE WIDE. MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, WHEN YOU MEET WITH THEM, WANT TO MAKE YOU HAPPY. FIRST OF ALL IT'S A CONGENITAL THIS -- PERSONALITIES OR DO. SECOND, IT'S AN OCCUPATION NECESSITY. WE NEED TO MAKE AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE HAPPY. AND THIRD, YOU ARE THE GOOD GUYS. BUT WHEN PEOPLE COME TO TALK TO US WE ALWAYS FEEL THAT IS NOT A NO-BRAINER. THE PEOPLE TALKING TO US ALWAYS THINK THEIR PROPOSAL IS A NO-BRAINER. OF COURSE. AND INVARIABLY WHAT THEY ARE PROPOSING IS EITHER GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF POLITICAL CAPITAL AND TIME FOR THE MEMBER OF CONGRESS THEY'RE TALKING TO OR IT'S GOING TO HAVE STRONG OPPOSITION IN THE BUREAUCRACY OR THE IDEOLOGIES THAT RUNS AROUND WASHINGTON, OR IT'S GOING TO COST GOVERNMENT MONEY. SO THERE ARE VERY FEW SLAM DUNKS. THERE ARE MANY MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO PERSUADE, BUT IF THEY REALLY DIDN'T COST ANYTHING AND WAS SPECTACULAR AND EVERYBODY AGREED ABOUT IT, IT WOULD PROBABLY BE A SUSPENSION BILL THAT OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS AGO. NOW AND THEN THERE'S A MAGICIAN WAS THROWN OUT OF SOCIETY FOR REVEALING HOW THE TRICKS ARE DONE. I'M ABOUT TO GET THROWN OUT. BECAUSE I WANT TO TELL YOU NOT WHAT YOU LEARN IN POLITICS 101 BUTTON POLITICIAN 101. HOW TO DEAL WITH THE MEDIA, HOW TO DEAL WITH THE REQUESTER I WAS TOLD THIS BY A POLITICIAN IN HIS 90s BACK IN MY AREA BUT I'M SURE HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE. HE SAID, BRAD, NEVER PUT IT IN WRITING IF YOU COULD JUST SAY IT. NEVER SAY YES OR NO IF YOU CAN JUST NOD. NEVER NOD IF YOU CAN GET BY WITH A SMILE YOUR AND BEST OF ALL, SEE IF YOU CAN GET BY WITH JUST A WINK. [LAUGHTER] WHAT YOU DO NOT WANT OUT OF A MEETING AS A SMILE OR A GENERAL BELIEF THAT THE PERSON YOU'RE TALKING TO LET YOU VERY MUCH AND WANT YOU TO LOVE THEM, BUT REALLY HASN'T COMMITTED TO ANYTHING. NOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE, AND THEY'RE JUST REAL HAPPY TO SEE A MEMBER OF CONGRESS. I WANT A SELFIE, THAT'S FINE, THAT MAY BE IMPORTANT. AND SO MANY OF YOU HAVE INCREDIBLE STORIES OF HOW YOU HAVE TRIUMPHED OVER AN IMPEDIMENT. AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT STORY. AND YOU MAY WANT TO PROVIDE GENERAL INFORMATION, BUT EVEN IF YOU PROVIDE GENERAL INFORMATION, BY THE TIME A MEMBER OF CONGRESS HAS A CHANCE TO USE IT, THERE HAVE BEEN 500 OTHER MEETINGS ON BANKING REGULATIONS AND THE JAFFNA PENINSULA. THEY MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN. WHEN YOU CALM, THE QUESTION I ASKED THE GROUP THAT I LIKE IS, IF YOU CONTROL THIS RIGHT HAND AND HIS VOTING CARD AND THE PIN, WHAT WOULD IT DO? IF YOU HAVE A SOLID ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION, THEN YOU BELIEVE THAT MEETING WITH SOMETHING TANGIBLE. SO YOU GO INTO THE MEETING SAYING, HERE ARE ALL THE GROUPS IN OUR COMMUNITY AND THEY ALL WANT YOU TO COSPONSOR THIS BILL. THEY ALL WANT YOU TO PUT OUT A STATEMENT SAYING YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE AGAINST THAT BILL. WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO SIGN A LETTER TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE SAYING TO FUND THIS PROGRAM AT NO LESS THAN $116 MILLION. WE WANT YOU TO SIGN THIS. WE WANT YOU TO VOTE THAT WAY. WE WANT YOU TO COSPONSOR. IF WHAT YOU WANT IS JUST AN UNDERSTANDING AND AN APPRECIATION OF WHAT YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE THAT CAN PROVIDE THAT TO YOU. ONLY THE MEMBER OF CONGRESS CAN PROVIDE YOU WITH THAT LETTER, THAT COSPONSORSHIP OR THAT VOTE. SO ASK FOR SOMETHING SPECIFIC, DON'T LEAVE UNTIL YOU GET A VERY SPECIFIC YES OR NO, HE DIDN'T SAY NO, JUST DON'T LEAVE. [LAUGHTER] AND THE FINAL THING YOU MAY WANT IS A LETTER TO AN ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY SAYING FUND THIS GRANT, OR CHANGE THIS REGULATION. IF YOU ARE IN THE TICKET CONGRESSIONAL ACTION, PASS A BILL, GET AN APPROPRIATION, YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A BALANCED GROUP OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ON YOUR SIDE. AND IF ANYTHING OF REPUBLICAN IS MORE VALUABLE TO YOU AT THIS TIME THAN THE DEMOCRAT. IF YOU ARE TRYING TO INFLUENCE AN EXECUTIVE AGENCY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BALANCE, AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE MORE POWERFUL THAN THE REPUBLICAN. SO KEEP THAT IN MIND. SO WHO YOU WANT TO SIGN THE LETTER DEPENDS ON LITTLE BIT ONTO THE LETTER IS ADDRESSED TO. AND IF WHAT YOU WANT IS A TELEPHONE CALL OR SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN'T SEE BEING DONE, THE QUESTION IS WHO ON YOUR STAFF DO WE CALL TO GET A REPORT ON WHETHER YOU MADE THAT PHONE CALL AND HOW IT WENT? YOU MAY SEEK IMMEDIATE IN WASHINGTON. YOU MAY SEEK IMMEDIATE EVIDENTIARY. IF YOU WANT A MEETING IN WASHINGTON YOU MAY JUST WANT TO MEET WITH THE AIDS. FRANKLY, LAUREN IS WITH ME HERE. SHE DOES ALL THE THINKING, PLANNING, DECISION-MAKING. MY JOB IS TO STAND BEHIND A MICROPHONE AND LOOK PRETTY. I WOULD LIKE TO THINK I DO IT WELL, BUT TALKING TO THE LEGISLATIVE ASSISTANT MAY BE MORE IMPORTANT. YOU MAY BE ABLE TO GET THAT MEETING LONGER AND MORE RELAXED DURING THE DISTRICT WORK PERIOD LIKE TODAY. I RECOMMEND TRYING TO MEET WITH THE MEMBERS IN THEIR DISTRICT OFFICE. FIRST COME IF WE DON'T GET THE MEETING YOU CAN SHOW UP AT THEIR MEETING. AND STAND UP AT A TOWN HALL AND SAY, WILL YOU DO THIS OR WILL YOU MEET, PROMISE TO MEET WITH US THIS WEEK PERSON-TO-PERSON ON THAT ISSUE? ANOTHER ADVANTAGE OF THE DISTRICT OFFICE MEETING IS THAT I HAVE EXPERTS IN MY WASHINGTON OFFICE ON VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE MATTERS SO I DON'T FEEL BAD IF THE GROUP MEETS HERE IN WASHINGTON WITH ONE OF MY LEGISLATIVE ASSISTANT. I DON'T HAVE LEGISLATIVE ASSISTANCE IN CALIFORNIA, AND I KIND OF FIGURE I'VE GOT TO DO THE MEETING MYSELF. YOU WILL WANT TO E-MAIL, E-MAIL A PETITION, MAKE SURE THAT YOU LIST BOTH THE PHYSICAL ADDRESS AND THE E-MAIL ADDRESS. THE REASON YOU WANT TO PROVIDE THE E-MAIL ADDRESS IS WHAT YOU WANT IS A VIRTUAL CYCLE. ASK THEM TO DO SOMETHING. GIVE HIM AN E-MAIL LIST OF PEOPLE WHO WANT THEM TO DO IT. WHEN THEY DO IT TELL THEM TO TELL THE E-MAIL LIST THEY DID IT. THEN TELL YOUR E-MAIL LIST TO THANK THEM FOR DOING IT AND THEN TELL YOUR E-MAIL LIST TO ASK THEM WHAT THEY'VE DONE FOR YOU LATELY. THE BEST THING YOU WANT IS A SITUATION, I SENT OUT 400 ENOUGH TO GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT CARE ABOUT SOMETHING, ONE OF THEM CATCHES ME IN THE GROCERY STORE AND THANKS ME FOR DOING IT, AND THEN I GO TO LAUREN AND I SAY, WHY HAVEN'T WE PUT OUT ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE E-MAILS TO THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY? AND SHE WAS A BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING RECENTLY AND YOU FOR THAT COMMUNITY. I'M A RESPONSE, WELL, TO BE A LIST OF WHAT I NEED TO DO. SO THAT VIRTUAL CYCLE, DO SOMETHING CAN REPORT SOMETHING, BE ENCOURAGED, HAVE A LIST OF PEOPLE TO TELL THAT YOU'VE DONE IT. I'D LIKE TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES WOULD BE VIRTUOUS TREE FALLING IN THE FOREST WITH NO ONE TO HEAR THAT MOST OF US WANT TO DO GOOD THINGS WITH PEOPLE WHO AGREE WITH THEM NOTICED. AND THEN FINAL I WOULD URGE THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY WITH SEVERAL ORGANIZATIONS AND A COALITION TO RATE THE PHONE RECORDS OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. AND THAT RATING CAN BE NOT ONLY HOW DID YOU VOTE, BUT WHAT DID YOU COSPONSOR? AND GIVE AWARDS NOT BECAUSE OUR SHELVES ARE EMPTY BUT BECAUSE IT ISSUE, THAT'S A POWERFUL THING YOU CAN DO THAT WE CAN THEN USE TO BRAG TO OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING IN WASHINGTON. I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING THE NEXT PANEL. I'M ALMOST JEALOUS THAT I DON'T, I TOOK IT TO COMMENT ON THIS UP BECAUSE I HAVE THE MICROPHONE. [LAUGHTER] I'LL JUST MAKE A PREDICTION ABOUT THIS ELECTION. THE BERNIE SANDERS AND DONALD TRUMP TSUNAMI IS, FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT, FOR THE ELITE, THAT FIRST HEART ATTACK THAT YOU MAKE IT THROUGH. AND ALL KNOW THE GUY WHO A MONTH AFTER HE'S OUT OF THE HOSPITAL IS EATING A CHEESEBURGER ON THE COUCH. I THINK THE ELITE'S WILL SURVIVE THIS, AND THEY WILL GO BACK TO TRYING TO PASS TPP IN A LAME-DUCK SESSION. WHICH IS THE EQUIVALENT OF HAVING A BIG RIB DINNER ON THE COUCH A MONTH AFTER A HEART ATTACK. AND IF THEY SUCCEED, THEN IN 2020 THE ELITE'S WILL HAVE A SECOND HEART ATTACK. SO WHAT HAPPENED THIS YEAR WITH BOTH BERNIE SANDERS AND DONALD TRUMP WAS WAY OUTSIDE THE THINKING OF WHAT THE ELITE TO BELIEVE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. AND THEY WILL EITHER ADOPT THE POLICY CHANGES OR THEY'LL GO BACK TO THE SAME OLD BEHAVIOR.

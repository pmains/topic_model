[Music] that story of my birth which is a true story has been my my guiding light born in El Paso Texas congresswoman barbara Lee was supposed to enter this world via a c-section but the hospital refused to admit her mother because she was black Lee's grandmother had to fight to get her in they rushed her in and it was too late for a c-section and they couldn't do anything and someone weather almost died and they had to deliver me using forces I came into this world fighting just the breathe to survive my mother almost died and so this is kind of how I came into America and that is just fighting to be alive in high school she fought to be a cheerleader at San Fernando high she worked with the n-double-a-cp to get the school to change the rules so all girls could try out she was the first african-american cheerleader at San Fernando High when she attended Mills College in Oakland Barbara Lee was a single mother raising two boys still remember 401 Broadway that was a welfare office and go through all the changes that people took me through just to get you food stamps give medi-cal card your public assistance and all the the intimidation and the shame that was that came with that you know so it was a really very difficult period trying to do all of this at one time but I did it she worked with the Black Panther Party and was president of Mills College Black Student Union she found her passion when she met shirley Chisholm the first black congressman when luminaries and elected office the entire game changes and that's what makes shirley Chisholm said she that if you don't have a seat at the table bring a folding chair Lee has been an elected office since 1990 serving in the State Assembly state Senate and now Congress she was in the Capitol on September 11th and was ordered out of the building when the planes hit the World Trade Center and then the Pentagon the congresswoman was the only member of the House or Senate to vote against the authorization for the use of military force following the attacks however difficult to spot maybe some of us must urge the use of restraint our country is in a state of mourning the pastor at the church the National Cathedral when I went to the memorial service he said and this is what convinced me that I had to be settled as well no he said as we act let us not become the evil that we deplore and so after my vote the present bitterness the threat the intimidation the phone call it was awful it was terrible but I tell you one thing it taught me a lot because what I learned was there some who really don't understand democracy and that the right to dissent is key in our democracy that's the beauty of a democratic society congresswoman Lee has been fighting since the day she was born and she knows she'll be fighting the rest of her life I have a champion a lot of issues around women's rights abortion rights the right to choose women's reproductive health here because I remember the days before Roe vs. Wade I remember back-alley abortion very clearly I know what that's about personally and so you know I've got to keep fighting for women not to have to go back to those days I know what domestic violence is just like so many women who may be listening believe you me I hear you and I know what what you're going through while it's very difficult to talk about those things personally I think my public life has to be about trying to make sure the women don't have to go through what I went through [Music]

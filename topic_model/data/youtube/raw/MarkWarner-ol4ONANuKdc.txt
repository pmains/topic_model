thank you all for coming this morning uh we have with us today come in i just want to get a question so your your words would be heard okay thank you i appreciate that very much thank you all for coming uh this morning we have uh here a bipartisan uh and bicameral group of legislators that have been dubbed the go big coalition that has been urging as i'm sure you're all aware the super committee to go big we all believe that it needs to do that if we're going to stabilize the debt in this country and start paying down our debt and we want to encourage the super committee although there's just a week left before they have to report this is not rocket science they can do this they can get they can go big and they can help us solve this problem so we want them to know that there's a bipartisan group of legislators on both sides of the aisle and on both ends of the capitol that want to work on this and want to want to make the tough votes that are necessary to get us out of the situation we are currently in we're going to have a few speakers this morning i'm going to reserve my remarks because i have some other people that i'd like to speak so go ahead steny thank you very much speaker simpson that was history history ladies and gentlemen mike simpson's from idaho uh former speaker of the idaho house uh he and i had a relationship because i was president of the maryland senate and we started a relationship early in his career not in mine because i'd been here sometime but i wasn't alive this is the kind of comment that undermines cooperation in the congress the united states mike simpson has been my partner along with heath schuler and others and peter welch and others uh and mark warner and saxby chambliss saxby chambliss happens to be my fraternity brother we're both sigma guys we've been good friends the public doesn't believe that we have good friends across the aisle that's not accurate nor do they believe we can work across the aisle we're here today to say we must work across the aisle in both houses to get this country on the right track last year then chairman of the joint chiefs admiral mike mullen said that and i quote our national debt is our biggest national security threat that is why we all stand here on this podium republicans democrats house members senate members we must do something to start paying down the debt and that something is the hands of the joint select committee on deficit reduction two weeks ago a number of us from the house some 100 democrats and republicans stood together to send a message that we want the joint select committee to send us a deal that is big about four trillion dollars in deficit reduction and is accompanied accomplished through a balanced mix of reductions in mandatory expenditures and additional revenues mike simpson said when we had that press conference it cannot be done any other way today we return and are joined by senators from parties who share our concern about deficits and agree that committee members for the sake of our country and and its sound fiscal future should recommend a package of cuts revenues and reforms consistent with a bowl simpson domenici riblin and gang of six proposals we have the greatest chance we've seen in a generation to strike a bold agreement that will move us forward on a sustainable fiscal path and spur economic recovery to do so of course as we have all seen is not easy and we recognize the pressures committee members are facing from multiple directions but we want them to know that there is a large and significant number of us in both chambers who want such a deal and are ready to give it a fair shot that is why we are standing together today democrats and republicans united to send a message of urgency and support more than 100 of us in the house split nearly evenly between parties have already sent a letter to that effect none of us none of us want to risk the immediate and long-term effects of sequestration that it will bring if the committee fails in its task see question is not a worthwhile option at-risk is more than just the economic impact but also the trust the american people have in their government to solve the most pressing problems we face as a nation i want to thank all my colleagues senate house republicans and democrats i want to thank all the house and senate members who have come together to send this message that the seriousness of the debt challenge can only be met with an equally serious and bipartisan determination to do what needs to be done to do what the american people expect of us and i'll now yield to my friend uh saxby chambliss well thanks denny and uh let me just say to heath schuler and mike simpson as well as my good friend steni hoyer how much we appreciate their leadership and their willingness to step up and show their support along with all of our colleagues in the united states senate who have committed to say to the super committee the right thing to do is to go big go big may mean three trillion it may mean four may mean five may mean six to some people but if we don't get to that level of deficit reduction then we are not showing to the world marketplace to americans and to other people around the world who are watching closely what's happening in the united states congress today and over the next week that we are serious about this issue of the debt and the deficit that we're not going to send the right message i'm very proud to stand here with these folks today and say super committee we got your back we support you we look forward to working with you on whatever course you decide to take to make sure that we do the right thing for the american people as well as to continue to show that america leads the financial free market and we're going to be there to back you to make sure that that leadership continues with that i'll turn to heath schuler with this many people on here i'll take the podium when i get the opportunity so zaxby thank you uh incredible work that has been done the house working group uh through multiple leaderships of both democrats and republicans and what the gang of six has been able to work together and now look at us we have a substantial amount over 150 members that that may not all be here because the room but over 150 members of the united states house and senate have come together to say we want to go big that time is of the essence we can't kick the can down the road that has been going on for a decade now now is the time and they have the support of these members of congress this is the true statesmen and women before you it's not about their elections it's not about what's on the horizon politically for themselves this is about the american people and this is about the next generation we can't turn our back on the next generation we must leave this country better than we found it and the way that's going to be done is through working together in a bipartisan way so i'll turn it over to mark i'm going to set a record and be the briefest of anybody because i want to make sure all these other colleagues get a chance failure can't be an option the whole rest of the world is watching and the notion of what's happening in europe and and their lack of stepping up we can't have the repeat of that here in in this country and whether we like it or not this debt and deficit debate has become an effective proxy for whether our democratic institutions are up to the job in the 21st century and i think you're seeing behind us here a growing bipartisan group in both the house and senate that want to get the job done so let's make sure we hear from some other folks the world is watching we know that the economic future of our country and the world rests on decisions that will be made in the next few days this is a circumstance that requires us to work together we know it's tough but we know it's been done the group of six did it simpson bowles did it rivlin domenici did it this group can do it and they need to know if they are bold if they are brave if they go big we will stand with them and the american people will stand with them you've heard the message but there's really three critical points to make here we are here to support the super committee to make sure the super committee knows that we've got us back and that we will come together on a bipartisan basis to help america find a solution number two the four trillion dollar figure the effort to go big is not just an arbitrary number it's what we've all learned is what we must do as a minimum to achieve the kind of fiscal reform in america that will help keep us the greatest nation and the greatest economy in the world and to make sure that those on the super committee and those in the in the congress and frankly that the world markets know that we have the ability to develop a bipartisan solution and that we are ready to back it good morning my name is jeff fortenberg congressman from lincoln nebraska in spite of our current impasse at the moment we're here as a non-partisan group of senators and representatives to simply say it's time to go bold it's time to get our nation's fiscal house in order i'm convinced if our super committee our joint committee were able to achieve a substantial reduction in spending and the right types of reforms this would unleash the power of our economy entrepreneurial confidence would increase and the united states would have to stop would stop standing on the world's doorstep begging and borrowing from other countries nebraskans are interested in common sense solutions they're not interested in washington's dysfunction it's time to go bold it's time to be big it's time to get our nation's fiscal fiscal house in order let's get it done dick durbin lamar and we want to get some other house members thanks so much most americans if they saw this scene behind me would say i didn't think that was possible i didn't think you could bring together so many democrats and republicans from the house and senate to agree on anything let alone one of the most challenging issues that we have ever faced on capitol hill but it's a fact the men and women here today have taken a hard look at the challenge that faces the super committee and have said we stand behind you we want you to succeed we'll do everything we can to help you but we encourage you to be bolder in your mission to look beyond the 1.2 trillion or 1.5 trillion to 4 trillion dollars going bigger is better in terms of the impact it will have that says the world we get it we're turning this economy in the right direction so that we can grow in a fashion that inspires confidence around the world and going bigger is easier politically doesn't sound right does it sounds counterintuitive but when you start putting enough on the table that both political parties house and senate realize that this is historic it is worth the political risk and if we stand together and lock arms together we can achieve something as a group which no single individual can achieve i hope that we will keep what we have in mind here uh moving forward first with the super committee we wish them well but beyond that that we take this challenge which faced the bull simpson commission the gang of six domenici rivlin and others and accept it as the challenge of our political generation this is our chance to step up and make a difference there may not be another chance there may not be an issue of such gravity and magnitude at least on the domestic side that any congress has faced in modern times this is our moment let's seize that moment and working together let's succeed for the good of this nation let's hear from lamar and a couple more house members this is about more than money it's about whether the president the congress can competently govern about whether we can face up to the biggest problem facing our country and working together can we solve that problem and of course we can we've already had three bipartisan groups who've laid out a framework we now have republicans who put revenues on the table we have democrats on the super committee that put entitlements on the table both need to put more on the table and get a result and we're here to support them peter welch you know there's something in this for everybody i'm a progressive democrat i believe strongly in the importance of medicare and those of us who believe in medicare have to take the lead in making sure it's sustainable this go big go bold effort is the best way where everything is on the table that we can make the tough decisions that will mean that folks who are counting on medicare folks who are counting on medicaid will have it revenues are on the table social insurance programs are on the table there are sensible reforms that we can make and will make by working together and it will be done much more easily if we go big and go bold congressman grimm excuse me freshman member from new york good morning for me it comes down to one word confidence we're all standing here today because we want the super committee to have the confidence that we're there to support them and we're there to urge them to do the big and bold things that this country expects it's also about the confidence through our representation that america is expecting all of us to work together we need to instill that confidence that we are not broken they're not completely dysfunctional we can work together and lastly it's to instill confidence not only domestically but throughout the world internationally that we can control our debt we understand we have a crisis but we have answers to the solutions and by working together we have the best and brightest minds america can still do anything thank you john good question anybody else questions the super committee's deadlocked right now the reports are they're struggling to get to 1.2 trillion dollars do you have a big bipartisan coalition right here why not put together a four trillion dollars i think we need to give the super committee the time to finish their process we hope they'll be successful we want to show as much as we can that we got their back clearly there's been previous work done that i think could be a template for that uh but let's let this uh let's let them get to the 23rd and again let's hope they produce a big product the reason you have all of us here on this stage is to say to them at a time when we understand it's a struggle and dick durbin said it best and others have said it i think everybody here agrees going big is better and it is better for both sides both perspectives in terms of how we get to where we need to get so i think this this group here is i think a very very impressive group of people who say we're going to support you so get there and you'll have your as somebody said we'll have your back i think that's the whole purpose of us being here today on taxes at the same time you have republicans saying they haven't gotten a democratic counter proposal in more than a week i think we're here again to express our support for success that failure is not an option sequestration ought not to be an option our country needs us now uh and uh that's why we're here urging uh them to succeed uh i i know what the public comments have been but uh i also am heartened i will tell you and i've talked to all 12 of the members of the uh committee and i talked to the speaker yesterday i believe that all of them feel the importance of this effort and the necessities come to a conclusion successfully i think it's already been done three times you know so it's you know the fact is you know as some and i've suggested if they're not successful one of those plans could could get a vote but let's let's hope that the super committee you know the leadership of both parties i think took a courageous step in early august and set up this super committee they felt the four leaders felt that this was the way to reach resolution you know we want to be we're we're not only supportive of the super committee we're supportive of that leadership's effort and we loved you know the leadership and everybody else ought to get behind this effort to make sure that it gets across the finish line i would ask what i would ask one of my senate uh colleagues uh mike would you like to talk yeah each of us have stated our preference for the way we would do it if we were doing it ourselves and the republicans who have said that they really don't believe that raising taxes right now is the right way to approach the solution come from that perspective what we are here today however to say is that we are ready to make the compromises and build the solutions that can help bring all the parties together and several of those here have made the point that if we go big it actually becomes easier to put the issues on the table and find the solutions that can help us move forward so the fact that you may have members standing here who have different ideas about how far they would personally like to go on taxes or how far they would personally like to go on entitlement reform does not mean that they are not ready to stand here and make the kinds of decisions that will help us as a nation to solve our fiscal crisis this is a guy who this is the guy who supported not only simpson bowles but was a key member of gang of six we're all have to give i think we'll end on that note thank you very much

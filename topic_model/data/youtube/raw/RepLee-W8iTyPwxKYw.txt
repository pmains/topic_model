a insufficient number of misleads recognized amendment at the desk Lee amendment number 2 the clerk will read an amendment offered by mr. e at the end of the bill section none of the funds made mislead recognized for three minutes Thank You mr. chairman I rise to offer an amendment which would prohibit federal agencies from unduly penalizing financial institution please give miss Lee the courtesy please chairman this miss Lee very important amendment although I have to say I probably would draw it at the end but I'd like to engage in this lady that misleaders Irv's the courtesy of being heard please proceed Thank You mr. chairman this amendment would prohibit federal agencies from unduly penalized in financial institutions for providing basic banking services to marijuana businesses and states where it is legal it would ensure that legitimate business owners can comply with state regulations and help ensure the regulator's and law enforcement officials can hold businesses accountable for the 47 states and jurisdictions that have passed marijuana reform laws this amendment would provide important financial certainty to business owners employees government agencies and financial institutions now regardless of how you feel about the legalization of marijuana I think we can all agree that each state has made their own decision to take action and pass a range of various laws pertaining to medical or recreational marijuana 47 states it has become increasingly apparent that there is a need to align federal and state law when it comes to addressing the banking crisis last year the legal marijuana industry was worth six point seven billion dollars but this is largely forced to operate exclusively in cash in many ways it's an underground economy these outdated and predatory policies are a major obstacle to these small businesses and only serve to undermine their financial security moreover enforcing small business businesses excuse me to operate as all-cash businesses which is what they do it suspense event please give miss Lee your attention thank you Thank You mr. chairman I I don't know if any of you are from any of these 47 states but if you are you are you know you probably know what I'm talking about in terms of these cash transactions which also are very dangerous but they make the jobs of state regulators and tax collectors unnecessarily difficult and it leaves these entrepreneurs their employees and the business itself vulnerable to dangerous criminal targeting so let me be clear it is a matter of Public Safety and economic necessity in fact the California State Treasurer John Chiang has called for action on the marijuana banking industry saying we all have an obligation to take reasonable and necessary steps to protect our citizens and ensure that businesses operate legally within California or any of the other 47 states and that they're able to eat - legally engage in banking commerce I visited small businesses many maybe you have visited some of your dispensaries and businesses in your home districts and I know how the impact of the lack of access to financial services can have so I would like to hear your comments okay from the other side and see if we can work on this as we move forward thank you Miss Lee mr. grazier the commenter with all the amendment or I intend agree with dr good manager yeah great I enjoyed your presentation I'm ready to roll along okay we'll talk is this mr. quickly and then we're going to roll on and I appreciate her willingness to withdraw but I think we need to add the fact that allowing legal marijuana businesses access to the banking system makes it easier to identify individuals operating illegally in states that do not have marijuana laws on the books and regardless of how each of us may view the legalization of marijuana I think we all agree that financial institutions should be allowed to serve businesses that are operating legally thank you we support her cause it's Lily close by just reminding you that in I believe was 2015 and I'm firing financial services bill this amendment was passed with broad bipartisan support on the floor so I hope that as it moves to the floor that we can work on something to make sure this is part of that billion gets included thank you sweetie withdrawing your Amendment we accept that further amendments

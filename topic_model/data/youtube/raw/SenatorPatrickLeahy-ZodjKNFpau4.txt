mr president um thank you i i know in a couple hours we'll be voting on the repeal don't ask don't tell now that we've been able to go past the filibuster of it now i'd like to speak about that just for a few minutes partisan rancor seems to seize the senate on so many issues this year but on at least this one count i'm encouraged and i'm hopeful there's yet sufficient bipartisan agreement to repeal the discriminatory don't ask don't tell policy before this congress ends and i commend the senators who have pledged to support the repeal of course i renew my own commitment to this worthy effort it is well past time to put an end to this discriminatory and harmful policy today in the united states senate the stage is set again for one of the major civil rights victories of our lifetimes and years from now i hope that historians will give good cause to remember this day as the day when the two parties overcame superficial differences to advance the pursuit of equal rights for all americans after much effort and just as much study and discussion the senate will finally proceed to an up or down vote on repealing this counterproductive policy for too long we have said let's vote maybe he's not quite ready for a vote let's keep the filibuster going well mr president i think most americans expect united states senators after all there's only 100 of us they expect us to come here and either vote yes or vote no not vote maybe a filibuster is voting maybe so senators who keep saying i want to think about more i want to go longer we've had years of study this afternoon mr president it's time for every man woman in this body to step forward and vote either yes or no and for those who still harbor concerns that enact in this repeal would somehow harm readiness one simple fact is the clearest answer gay and lesbian americans already serve honorably in the u.s armed forces and they've always done so there's no doubt that they've served in the military since the earliest days of the republic the only reason they could do so then and now even under today's discriminatory policy is because they display the same conduct and professionalism that we expect from all our men and women in uniform they're no different than anyone else they should be treated no differently as one combat veteran said i don't care whether the soldier next to me is straight or not i care whether he can shoot straight or not and ending this policy will bring to an end years of force discriminatory and corrosive secrecy giving these troops the right to serve openly allowing them to be honest about who they are will not cause disciplined service members to suddenly become distracted on the battlefield it is pandering to suggest that they would be but that's not only my view the chairman of the joint chiefs admiral mullen has it time and time again that this is the right thing to do that will not harm our military readiness mr president gay soldiers and straight soldiers have fought and died for our country throughout the history of this country gay soldiers and straight soldiers have fought and died for our country in iraq and afghanistan i think of one of the editorial cartoons showing parents at a military graveyard and they look at the grave of their son and one says they didn't ask and the other said he didn't tell look at this look at this mr president look at this three coffins draped in flags and the caption is which is the gay one mr president like so many other senators i walked on a quiet day to the graveyard at arlington national cemetery i've seen dates going back long before i was born i see people have died in our world wars who died in korea died in vietnam to die now in ireland in uh in iraq and afghanistan now look at the name some from my own state and like everybody else who walks through there i think of the sacrifice of these people the sacrifice of their families the life that would not be lived the children who might not know a parent the brother who might not know a sister or sister might not know a brother parents who are bearing their child and of course in the natural order children bury their parents here parents have buried their child does anybody look at those graves and say move this one because we just found out that soldier died in battle was gay mr president if anybody asked to do that there would be an uproar in this country so i asked why any question about them serving every member of our armed services should be judged solely on his or her contribution to the mission repealing don't ask don't tell would ensure that we stay true to the principles on which our great nation was founded we ask our troops to protect freedom around the globe that isn't it time mr president that we protect their basic freedoms and equal rights here at home throughout our history the senate has shown its ability to reflect and illuminate the nation's deepest ideals and the nation's conscience is my hope that the senate will rise to this occasion by breaking through the partisan den to proceed to debate as we have and now vote on repealing this discriminatory and counterproductive policy mr president i see my good friend a neighbor from across the connecticut river senator shaheen and i and i and i see the good my friend uh and colleague and i apologize i don't see him uh senator from north dakota and i know he's waiting i'll yield to him as my understanding senator shaheen will be recognized after senator thune i yield the floor

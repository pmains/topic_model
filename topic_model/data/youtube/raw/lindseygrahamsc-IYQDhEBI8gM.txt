well now what's going to happen in the senate republican senators like ted cruz and others are asking everyone to stand with them to do two things fund the government but do not fund obamacare so what now republican senator out of south carolina lindsey graham with me now in the studio nice to see you in person to be with you yes you actually have legs i do you see in the monitor it's like it's just there's a guy with a head right there apparently i'm taller in television i'm in real person nice to see you and thank you for your time what in the world does happen well here's what i think will happen i think we'll take up the house bill because it's a good bill i can't imagine filibustering the bill that i like from the house there will be a vote by to take out the defunding of obamacare it'll be a majority vote and i'm hoping some democrats will side with with all republicans to keep the defunding in place but i doubt it but here's the good news we'll have a vote where every republican votes to defund obamacare and practically every democrat will keep it in place and that will be the defining issue in 2014. this is an albatross around their neck obamacare is going over like a lead balloon in the economy the only way we can screw this up is to make it about us okay you said a lot there how many democratic votes do you expect in the senate i think if any i think all of them will rally around keeping uh obamacare fully funded we said is that a zero then zero because we spent no money i think there are five votes we could have gotten if we'd really had a strategy to break our democratic friends and give them an opportunity to join with us to start over in obamacare but all the money and the energy has been spent on republicans we haven't spent any money trying to pick up five democratic votes but this time next year i think there will be more than a few democrats looking to republicans finding a way to take this monkey off their back and if i read between the lines that's where the pressure is now being cranked up on moderate democrats who are living in red states and want to be really good strategy you know in uh november 2014 so but in the near term this is going to come out of the senate right it's going to go back to the house right the clock is ticking right does the government shut down i don't think so i think the house colleagues along with senate democrats and republicans in the white house can find a way to delay parts of obamacare maybe repeal the medical device taxes hurting that part of the economy i think we can we can take a hit obamacare will take a hit but it won't be defunded i don't think the government's going to shut down i think there will be a deal doing something uh to delay the individual mandate maybe a year might be a good competition you're looking at the the medicare cuts the employer mandates delayed and the subsidy verification delayed out-of-pocket caps delays bill sorry if bill sucks it really does and and it's really an albatross around our democratic friends and they will slowly but surely if we don't screw this thing up come to us because they can't it's more than they can carry in the election cycle of 2014 and 2016. i think the pressure will be that great yes it is beginning to collapse economically people losing jobs they're getting part-time employment people health care costs are going up it's not playing well in the real world eventually it will hit washington we just need to be patient keep fighting but fight smart you sent a tweet friday afternoon quote i support the house pass bill to defund obamacare hashtag senate must act was that an about face for you no i've always supported i thought it was smart to defund obamacare in the house send it to the senate and try to pick five democrats off i didn't think it would be smart to send a house bill to the senate and we filibuster our own bill what i want to do is have a vote on the defunding obamacare and get our democratic colleagues on record i think over time they're going to start joining with the republicans because this is such a burden for them to bear politically all right senator thank you quickly i want to talk to the breaking news that's happening now at night kenya it is awful and to watch it your heart really goes out to the people who are struggling through this yeah there's a report that came out over the weekend possibly americans living here have joined the al-shabab movement in somalia are are fighting clearly as if they're al-qaeda terrorists they're allowing muslims to walk out of the mall and if you cannot prove you're a muslim you are shot and killed on site now this american connection how real is it that americans could have gone to somalia and joined the fight that we're watching unfold in nairobi they're doing two things in our backyard radical islamic groups they're trying to recruit people to hit us fifth column movements to get radical islamic terrorist american citizens to join their cause to hit us here at home and actually recruiting people to go overseas to the fight they're doing both in our backyard there's a perfect storm building for this country to get hit we've got a weak president a war weary public embolden enemies shaky allies in a dysfunctional con congress we're reducing our intelligence capabilities to pick up these attacks we're uh sending all the wrong signals to our enemies and friends alike and they're recruiting in our own backyard what you saw in boston could be our future what you saw in kenya could come back to us we're letting our guard down when it comes to dealing with the radical islamic threat in our own backyard just to be a little more specific peter king over the weekend said al-shabab is the only known terrorist group that is actively recruiting americans is that the case no i think there are other uh al-qaeda affiliates at you remember the times square bomber he was trained by the pakistani taliban he went that guy went to pakistan and received training came back here and tried to blow time square up thank god the car didn't explode but that was done by the pakistani taliban the detroit guy was done by another group so there there are more than one group trying to get americans to turn against us at home and go overseas and fight and we're ignoring this threat we're letting our defenses down at a time we need them the most we're getting a report from our bureau in jerusalem suggesting most of the gunman hiding on the top floor it was ascribed to us as a four-story shopping mall big expansive area uh they're in nairobi kenya they believe the last gunman has been cornered but they thought that last hour too so we'll have to see how this soft target is what we're talking about soft targets indeed sir thank you for your time senator lindsey graham from south carolina here in new york thank you

thank you mr chairman i'm i appreciate the majority's focus today on equitable opportunities as a part of today's hearing title uh what we've seen in the past from democrat congresses as well as the administration has been more of a uh i think an assistant uh insistence on massive government subsidies and top-down mandates that unfortunately pick winners and losers when we think about policies to advance clean energy solutions to lower emissions it should be technology neutral and allow private sector innovation to occur free from the government mandates and without having to com compete on unequal grounds i look forward to working with my my colleagues on this committee uh republicans and democrats to really uh identify the solutions that are going to lower emissions but do it free from the government mandates and and really make it more more equitable um as we consider policies to to promote renewable energy technologies compared to other energy solutions it's critical that we examine their entire life cycle and the impact their manufacturing components and materials have on the environment uh dr micho foss mentions in her testimony that nearly 80 percent of lithium battery manufacturing capability for electric vehicles is in china whose grid is overwhelmingly powered by coal-fired plants a similar percentage of global supply for solar panels also originates in china dr micho foss how should we consider the impact of the manufacturing process on these renewable technologies uh the impact that they're having on the environment when we are evaluating their efficacy for reducing emissions globally especially coming from high emissions countries like china and how do we mitigate these issues i would have to say that one of my biggest concerns is that if you try to accelerate by any means either market incentives or direct policy interventions subsidies whatever the process of speeding up the integration of of certain technologies that we we don't produce ourselves opponents of which we don't produce ourselves all we're doing effectively is shifting our emissions abroad now we've been doing this for a really long time um all of the more developed countries have been doing this for a very long time um and so the net improvements that everybody hopes to gain in terms of of whatever it is that we're after uh reducing greenhouse gas emissions or um achieving more equitable um access to energy universal access to energy whatever the targets are all become diminished if that's what we end up doing this is a really difficult conversation with china i think everybody's got to be honest about that um we're all hopeful um those of us who have studied the country for years been there um that they'll continue to make improvements in their own energy system i mean they're they're doing certain things but they also have a very strong stand of self-determination and and a very little um willingness it seems to engage in ways that i think others would like them to so i think that has to be part of the of the conversation it's part of the reality check on all of this um i would point to an example over the past few days angela merkel germany got her reality check on this um because the germans would like to be very assertive and stronger in terms of what they're doing and and they would like to be able to meet their policy goals and policy targets but it's meaningless if what they're doing is effectively um having to rely on china for a lot of their inputs um and the chinese are not willing to make the same kinds of commitments i mean that's that's where we are i think in the discussions yes i i appreciate that we're also seeing issues arise at the end of these technology life cycles uh according to some estimates there will be six hundred thousand ten of weight materials and manufacturing clean energy technology recycling can help us reduce waste and increase our ability to compete uh dr mitchell some have said that recovering visible materials from discarded devices remains impractical especially if you think well do you want me to answer the talk is over um let me just say quickly um there are a lot of ideas um there's good work that's being done on recapture and recycling um i gave you all the figure that we know or that we think we know which is five percent of recovery of lithium batteries i mean it's really hard to track this stuff very very difficult lack of data lack of information lack of transparency um there are huge issues in tracking waste in general but e-waste in particular and then frankly um when it comes to things like and i'm sure the other panelists um uh dr saha for instance would be aware of this when it comes to to recapturing and recycling or properly disposing of waste associated with renewable energy components there's really an unwillingness to talk about that and engage on it probably for a whole variety of reasons but but it's something that we have to own up to and we have to figure out it's going to be part of the problem solving um in order to be able to move forward the right way so it can be done um people have to be realistic about the timing and and and the cost and whether it's profitable or not okay thank you thank you okay the general

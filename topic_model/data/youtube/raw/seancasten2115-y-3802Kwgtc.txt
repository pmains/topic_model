it represents everything that is wrong with the morally bankrupt Republicans in Washington like Peter Roskam it is cynical it is undemocratic it goes against our values and it is based on complete fantasies and set of facts Peter Roskam the Donald Trump we're cutting taxes for the super wealthy and for large corporations they're using this bill also to undermine the Affordable Care Act let's put this in perspective this is going to kick thirteen million people off of their health insurance but let us understand what that means the most credible estimates out there are that about 10,000 or more Americans every year are going to die when they lose their health insurance 10,000 American lives are going to be needlessly lost every year that is the trade that Peter Roskam is willing to make in order to appease his donors in this election cycle I'm a scientist by training I'm a clean-energy entrepreneur and I've spent my entire career understanding and dealing with facts some of those facts are unpleasant you deal with them anyway I've also built over 70 clean energy projects I know a little bit of something about what it takes to invest in infrastructure and create jobs this tax bill will do neither it will boost corporate profits it will raise shareholder prices there will be some nice dividends next year it will do nothing for the economy Peter Roskam has proved again that he only cares about serving a special interest and his campaign donors all while he's punishing families seniors the disabled senior citizens we need to replace Peter Roskam when I get to Congress I'm going to I'm going to represent the people of Illinois sixth congressional district not special interests that I'm going to represent the people of Illinois sixth congressional district not special interests the days of putting politics before facts and donors before voters must end now [Applause]

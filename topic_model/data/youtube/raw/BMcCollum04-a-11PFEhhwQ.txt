good morning to all our attendees we're gonna let a few more folks get logged in here and then we'll turn it over to the congresswoman one moment okay good morning to all thank you for being here i'm going to turn it over to congresswoman mccullum for introductory remarks thank you and good morning i especially want to thank you for joining us on this law enforcement leader conversation today on gun violence awareness day and in fact gun violence awareness month sadly recent events have made us all too aware of the epidemic of gun violence mass killings and their devastating families they're ripping apart communities and forcing all of us at times to question our own safety during the coming weeks i'll be talking with gun safety advocates elected leaders and others about this preventable crisis but today i'm starting with the people you see on this zoom why because they are the first to respond when gun violence occurs in our communities the common denominator is guns are easy to access and individuals are using these guns to commit acts of violence over the years i voted in the u.s house of representatives time and time again to ban assault weapons to ensure universal background checks to block access to firearms to those who shouldn't have them but common safe gun safety provisions are obstructed every step of the way by the gun lobby and their allies in congress in fact states like texas are making it easy to obtain and carry firearms even assault weapons in public without a permit or even training in congress my voice my vote my values are all focused on common sense measures that reduce gun violence keep guns off of our streets and eliminate access to guns that are designed for mass murder the safety of our families and our communities is my priority we are all heartbroken and outraged at the mass murder of elementary school children and the teachers and the students in texas only days after the buffalo new york massacre which deliberately targeted black americans in a neighborhood grocery store and this week another atrocity this time in a health care clinic at the wake of this tragedy and every tragedy every member of congress needs to be held accountable for their actions on effective gun safety laws more than a year ago house democrats acted by passing two major pieces of gun violence prevention i co-sponsored and voted for both of these bills that make our families and our communities more secure one was the bipartisan background checks act of 2021 and it made uh background checks on every gun sailor transfer and of course we had common sense measures in there gifts to family members or transfers for hunting rifles target shooting and self-defense but there still was background checks for these weapons that are being used in our community right now today to murder people enhance background checks back to 2021 strengthen background procedures by providing the fbi additional time to do background checks we believe that that would have prevented what happened in charleston that's why it's often referred to as a charleston loophole but when it went over to the senate the senate republicans continue to block action on even what i believe are these very very basic common sense life-saving measures their obstruction in my opinion is causing more preventable gun deaths more and more we're seeing the dangerous ideology of hate including white supremacist beliefs and that is motivating and inspiring mass shooters to target communities of color and that was clearly evident of what just happened in buffalo new york the u.s house of representatives has passed the domestic terrorism prevention act of 2022 and we did that to combat the growing threat of domestic and violence extremist groups and individuals including racial and ethnically motivated violent extremists like white supremacists now i'll continue to urge the senate on action on the legislation we've passed but in the house we know even with what we pass there's more work to do i'm proud to be a member of the gun violence prevention task force and i'm working to advocate gun safety measures i'm the original co-sponsor of the assault weapons ban prohibiting the sale transfer manufacturing and import of semi-automatic weapons and ammunition feeding devices over 10 rounds and to allow the use of burn grants for gun buybacks i've also signed a letter to president biden seeking an executive order on the importation of assault weapons now my role in congress is as an appropriator and so i'm proud to help lead to make sure that we have more money billions of dollars available for burn grants and other resources to for safer communities and the funding law for fiscal 2022 and you have my support to those in law enforcement to increase burn grants and i hope we have that as part of our discussion but before we turn to you i just want to make sure folks know that what's going to happen in washington d.c when i return next week the house will be voting on protecting our children act this package will include raising the minimum purchase age for semi-automatic weapons from 18 to 21 outlying the purchasing age for semi-automatic weapons uh from 18 to 21. in minnesota we have some provisions on that but other states have nothing and then we know these guns cross across state lines all the time outline high-capacity magazines and bump stocks for civilian use they only make mass shootings happen quicker faster it's and they become more deadly subjecting host guns subjecting ghost guns purchases to background checks and requirements cracking down on gun safety trafficking and straw purchasing and strengthening the safe storage requirements like gun locks to protect children from accidental shootings in my opinion there's no excuse for gun violence being the number one the number one killer of children and teenagers in this country so i'm hoping the senate will enjoy us will join us in protecting children so also next week we're going to take another vote on the federal extremism risk protection order act and this legislation will keep guns out of the hands of those who threaten themselves or others nationwide and and is going to encourage uh states to enact their own laws minnesota has enacted many of those so we've got other bills coming to the floor about the active shooter alert it's an amber style alert notifying when a mass shooting has a is occurring or has occurred and it's widely supported by law enforcement so we thank law enforcement for their input on these bills and then we're also going to move once again in the house on an assault weapons ban so um before i turn it over to folks i just want to really say why i believe we need to have these discussions as a community and i'm so glad so many of you are listening and to hear from our first responders we must put the lives of school children shoppers church goers hospital patients staffs our neighbors at movie theaters or concerts ahead of the gun lobby and gun makers profits and that's why i want to hear from the first responders today when the unthinkable happens the men and women in your departments are the first to respond whether it's a suicide an accidental discharge of firearms that result in a death or weapons crime sadly this is at the top of my mind in april when roseville officer ryan dubrey was shot and seriously injured while responding on a police call i look forward to hearing from all of you i would wish you to be direct and frank about what your first responders are experiencing on our streets and in our neighborhoods but before we get into that discussion i would like each of you to take a minute to introduce yourselves because we have a wide representative of our communities here and others uh just couldn't join us today unfortunately but we are in constant contact with them so um i don't know how the screen looks to you so i'm gonna let

african-american leadership council naacp i work closely with black ministers and youth groups all these things you're talking about here today have touched me and i'm very passionate about that i look forward to our conversation but i've also lived through and you brought up what happened in roseville um three st paul police officers that were killed by individuals that should not have had weapons tim jones ron ryan i was there one of my best friends in life jerry vick by was killed by an individual who should not have had a firearm and a stolen firearm to boot should not have happened so thank you this is an important conversation and especially to protect our children thank you chief egg thank you congresswoman just to echo what you've already heard i'm really happy to be here and thank you for for the invitation um i'm the police chief in the city of woodbury public safety director i've been doing that job for 15 years and i've been with the city for 33 years so tom thanks for being the oldest guy in the room and taking the pressure off that was handy this is a really important topic for all of us i don't care if it's small town big city suburban area it affects all of us and it's nice to see all these faces here kind of united to try to find some solutions and appreciate your continued passion on this issue congresswoman thank you well and i want to thank all of you having been on a north st paul city council with a very small police force i learned about mutual aid real quick and real fast and i am so proud of the east metro team the way the mayors police departments firefighters all their first responders public works everybody pitches in together to make our community safer we all have each other's back in the east metro and i just wanted to take a moment to recognize all the hard work that you do in your own in your own capacity with all the hard work you do together and i told mr mcrae that right away when i met him in my office how proud i was of the way everybody worked together i'm going to start this out kind of out of talking about some of the things that i fund and i'm going to be going back working on on the funding bills besides voting on some of these gun safety measures that i talked about so one of the tools that we have in the toolbox are burn grants and there's some other resources so maybe and i won't call on anybody you can just start or you can just raise your hand and and then i will call on you but how have burn grants and other resources from the federal government not only helped maybe in the capacity working with the state government tom but with local units of government and then mr perry if you want to add anything on about some other federal resources that maybe we could congress could enhance to help your work at the times that you're called in to work with local law enforcement well i can just say very quickly that um burn grants are just one of the most critical things for all of our law enforcement partners in the state of minnesota they have helped us to do amazing work before and also what a lot of people don't understand is burn grants can also bring our community partners into doing some of this work with us it doesn't just give us tools for law enforcement but it gives us tools to work with the very stakeholders that we're trying to protect so i i will end with that um without the burn grants in and again i'm going through from when i was a sergeant a lieutenant all the way up to chief of police at every level burn grants helped us to reduce violence also do some outreach work and it's one of the most critical components nationally for any of the type of work that we do in law enforcement at every single level anybody else want to comment on burn grants so one of the things that when i was on the city council in north st paul and the work i did at the state and now i do here there's a lot of talk about schools and school safety and police liaisons and you we hear you know parents talk about you know school active school shootings and drills and all that but behind the scene if that's going to be uh a drill or a communication or or reliance on on how we come to an aid when this type of tragedy is happening what what is some of the the things that you think would be helpful for you either in your capacity working with schools working with communities um having training available i was at century college when we did an active shooter uh training i i got to observe that but those are very expensive to put on it's you know working mutual aid it's getting first responders and and community involved what are some of the things um that are on a lot of parents mind right now and i'm not going to comment on what happened with the police department down there we just saw a great first responder at a medical clinic so this is not this is not about criticizing anybody but what are some of the tools that would be helpful for you or what are some of the things our schools should have because we put legislation in after all these school shootings to try to do things and um are there any things i should be looking at and or reaching out to our school districts on or even large community areas we have hospitals and and other places we had that terrible shooting down at uh down on west seventh so any anything about tools that might be beneficial that i could bring to the table go ahead yeah congresswoman i can uh speak a little bit from you know we haven't seen the the uh the level of gun violence that some of the other cities have and so my colleagues on here but i can tell you as a city that has you know hundreds of thousands of people coming to visit every year a ton of schools and in a hospital really concerned and so the training aspect is is significant for our officers as well as the equipment and so we battle every year on whether or not we can get equipment including ballistic vests including armor through uh federal avenues and and every few years that seems to come under scrutiny and whether or not that is going to be allowed and that is something that is super important because those items are extremely expensive and sometimes outside of the scope of a current municipalities levy and so having access to some of those items on east metro we have a great collaborative out here and we've been able to access life-saving equipment for our tactical officers and our street officers to be able to respond to these types of events um and then lastly not to take up all the time but i would think you know as we start talking about gun prevention and access to weapons as well as mental health issues threat assessment groups kind of the third leg of this uh stool is really spending time in collaborative groups having access to mental health data medical data and working on i can tell you in the chief bag and some of the groups that we sit on we can name three or four individuals that we have no doubt without the collaborative group including doctors social workers law enforcement working together to get people the services that they need might have ended in a tragedy so these threat assessment groups and really doing that research on the front end is really significant for our for us i'm going to be familiar here and just use first name so we'll do erica and then we'll do um um william so uh uh erica i just want to just to piggyback a little bit on what brian just said um you know what what just has recently happened now is you know even in buffalo we had a person who was trained a good quote unquote a good guy with a gun who was not only outgunned but when he went to use his it wouldn't have been as effective as most people would have thought because of the body armor that the perpetrator was wearing so i just wanted to tag that on and and and and hear your comment son on this issue yeah and i'll kind of piggyback on what uh chief mueller said that the funding for uh the training and for the equipment is so important um after our tragic event event involving officer duxbury we've identified a number of equipment needs and so now we're trying to scramble to figure out how to how to fund those you know rifle plates for all of our officers additional shields um really life-saving equipment that we need to have but finding ways to fund it is always challenging we're really fortunate we were able to do active shooter training uh this past about a week ago and we're able to use funding through ramsey county uh to be able to fund that so the continued support of that funding is really important not only for the equipment but also for the training so william you wanted to add something and then tom i do thank you and to be clear atf takes no political positions on anything if congress enacts a law we faithfully enforce it um i do want to let everybody know um that we are bringing in uh more crime gun intelligence uh including a knight van national integrated ballistics imaging network van to saint paul in the next couple weeks so that when you have crime guns that you've recovered at a scene we can put those casings in put the trace amount the trace information from those guns in and build the networks of where folks are getting their crime guns and identify the active shooters the ones who are actually going out not in so much of like a school shooter type but the ones who are shooting every night or every other night and disrupt the violence cycle that way so there is three diamond machines in the state right now we're getting another one in our division that i'm actually going to have in my office um so for those of you who have crime guns on the shelf or that are that recover crime guns overnight we'll be able to very very quickly turn those around and get information back out to you on that that has been very helpful tommy you had your question uh hand up on this and then i'm going to toss out another question for discussion yep real briefly into sac mccrary's point uh at the bca as well uh that traveling nigen's truck is important and they're purchasing two machines as well but i want to talk just for one second about the front end and and to chief mueller brought something up that resonated with me as a training director at the bca we need to highlight and congresswoman if you can help us with this so the fbi in our local field office uh and they have task force officers randy mcallister awards for cottage grove they have threat assessment teams and i put that training on virtually um for the bca and we need to push at more and those threat assessment teams all they do the fbi helps to organize people from schools from hospitals from mental health services where they can share information about individuals that have red flags that maybe we would have stopped the buffalo minnesota shooting all those things came up after the fact that training is there but we have to be able to push it out to all law enforcement agencies in minnesota there's 434 law enforcement agencies that includes 87 sheriff's departments the last thing i'll say about active shooter training or response to incidents like this the support whether it's through burn grants or whatever congresswoman if we could do regional training because there are so many small agencies throughout minnesota there's no rhyme or reason where these things happen just like in uvalde a very small town so if we could do that training not just jeremy chief ellison and i were used to doing this training with saint paul we're a big agency we'd host other metro agency to come and do that training but what about southern minnesota and middle uh in northern minnesota they don't have those opportunities so if we could do regional training and whether we sponsor it through the state to bring that training so we have all those agencies there i think that would help us tremendously so training and mental illness sometimes the uh you know kind of coming together for response so there's there's training to when you know the shootings taking place there's training to work with the community to identify things like that you know our schools and i think a lot of our community organizations and i'm going to include our first responders because we have a different mix of way people respond on scene sometimes it's police paramedics sometimes it's fi sometimes it's fire with mental health and all the talk about what we wanted to do with mental health sometimes i feel like i hear more talk and i don't see the dollars or the resources really out there to help because you need mental health counselors which we're short of mental health beds sometimes what we're short of we need to have conversations with with with doctors and families because you know red flag logs only as good as the family knows how to access it or feels comfortable accessing it or no knows the police department is approachable could you maybe talk about some of the challenges um that i need to hear from you as we work with community leaders and and physicians and that about about mental health because you've got a big job to do and i know departments are really focusing on how to reduce you know conflict when approaching a car or going into a situation all that is is important but all that comes with extra training and i'll go back to north st paul we had eight officers taking somebody off to do training that we invoke mutual aid so we had cover you also have to go to court and other things like that so this puts a real strain not only in dollars but at times uh personal hours when you're doing your shift scheduling what what should we know about how you are really working hard to get the mental health component done and what the community can do and what elected leaders like myself can do go ahead oh i'm sorry i'm looking right at you on the zoo making eye contact except you can't see me making my comments i see you go ahead yeah thank you so one example would in our city is we've got an embedded social worker now that works right alongside our officers she's works for the county works with our city officers and they're part of a community support team to try to help on the prevention side on the front end of this getting contact with people before the crisis call happens and sometimes after and then trying to figure out a safety plan for that family or for that person it's it works we know it's a great model but there's only so much funding and for that model to grow and just become a standard in our in our industry it's going to take some financial support um and i think it's a great place from on a on a national and federal level to be helping your local police departments to make this thing happen so that would be one example of something congresswoman that we would love to see some additional financial support and see this type of model grow throughout our communities in the state anybody else want to add to that go ahead i do i'm actually out at the major city chiefs meeting and the police executive research forum on the west coast today and this was a very big topic of discussion over the last two days one of the things that came out of it was that there are some of the cities that are providing conflict resolution training for people in neighborhoods so that folks who are in violence plague neighborhoods are able to access different ways of responding other than shooting other than um getting together a group of folks for an insult over social media and that's something that we really haven't explored very much i just heard about it two days ago and i've been taking notes frantically since so that might be something that that could be very effective tony you had your hand up yeah one thing i was going to mention that we've undertaken here in ramsey county and so speaking on behalf of my my peers as well but we share a consolidated dispatch center of the ramsey county emergency communications center and so they provide all the 911 services for police fire and ems about a million calls per year so they're a busy and big place but thanks to some of the federal level funding that the county has leveraged they've committed um dollars to actually embedding social workers potentially within the 9-1-1 center kind of on the front end so when you think of it right now you call 9-1-1 and there's really kind of one bucket of resources police fire and ems and how can we expand those buckets and decide are there other more appropriate responses whether they be mental health responders social workers community responders or other uh institutions that that can be involved in that response so that we're not um you know burdening you know local law enforcement with all these types of calls for which they might not be the appropriate responder or necessarily trained uh as the best responder for the incident brian you had your hand up and then i'm gonna ask uh jeremy a question yeah really quickly my partners uh really eloquently describe you know some of the the great things they're doing just to break it down if uh i would also put substance use disorder along with that mental illness as they're obviously always co-occurring but the issue is bed space an issue is resources and so if you break it down to two in the morning a 24 year old officer that's coming across an individual who's committed a minor crime and they are left with a 72-hour hold mental health and welfare hold or jail neither one of those are really the the resources that we need and so we are stuck with how do we get access to those individuals and that is where things are falling through the cracks because even with the mental health worker that she beg has that individual isn't working 24 7 7 days a week and so there is a time where we have someone in crisis that says i need help and having someone from my family that you know we have a ton of resources and are able to access the best and brightest sometimes it takes a week even for us to get our family members into the treatment that they need so what are our officers going to do when there are no beds for substance use disorder there are no beds and doctors available to get someone the help they need when they need it so um jeremy we talked a little bit about community and one of the dialogues i'm going to have later with community and i'm i i've lived in uh north st paul grew up in south st paul right right down the street from the police department um and i live in in an area in selby and frogtown where there's uh more more uh more activity that's negative sometimes that's happening we've had the carjackings and which have escalated in in with with violence um tell me a little bit about some of the things that maybe congress could either help with or the community can help with or the state what can we do with some of the community groups that i know really are out there some of them very effective some of them trying to be more effective what kind of training do they need interaction because uh and i'm not gonna you know i i well i'm gonna just go ahead and mention the god squad's out there quite a bit and i know quite quite a few of them and i know you have a good relationship and liaison worked with them at times when we needed it um so how do these community groups what do we need to do to nurture and sustain them so we have those partnerships either recognize a red flag somebody who needs an early intervention or maybe even somebody who knows somebody's in in mental health crisis because i know unfortunately you all too often have to even respond to suicides yeah thank you for the question um so you know we understand and we share the community's concern um reducing violent crime and interrupting the cycle of violence is really our top priority right now um you know our our police officers are out there responding to shootings every single day in st fall it's taking a toll on the officers it's taking a toll on our neighbors neighborhoods and our city's overall sense of safety our officers are usually the first ones on scene they hear the screams they apply the tourniquets and they're giving comfort to both the victims and their loved ones you know we we're there with these victims from the first response all the way through the investigation and even through the court cases and we share their their frustration and their sadness and that's why we're really starting to focus on interrupting this cycle and i'm really glad you mentioned the community partners i was fortunate last night to be a part of a community meeting that was hosted by the naacp the god squad was there um a whole host of uh the community partners that you just are describing and um we talked about that that um you know the police department can't solve this this violent crime problem alone it really is going to come down to every single partner every single community member asking themselves what can i do to help solve this problem um and so there were some really good discussions and and honest conversations last night about um we're gonna stop pointing fingers at each other and blaming this group or that group or the police or whoever for the problem and really getting down to let's focus on strategies that are working um we talked a lot a lot about the youth and young young adults in our community and trying to give them resources um give them opportunities and and treat them like human beings and and help them be successful um and i think what i heard last night from those multiple organizations was um about funding um having opportunities um we talked about some of the challenges with the local or the state government and and and not being able to fund some some of those programs to the level that would be effective um so that that is definitely something that would be helpful is if we can kind of open up that um those opportunities for funding those those organizations and like i said you know from all of us on this call we we all realize that collaboration and partnerships is what's going to help make our community safer and i think you know there's not one specific idea or one specific thing that's going to solve the problem it really is everybody sitting down and and working together and that's why you know in st paul uh mayor carter has been extremely supportive um with the community first public safety uh launching the office of neighborhood safety um and we've been uh working very closely uh with them on partnering and really trying to examine um what laser-focused ideas and solutions that we can come to to help reduce the violence in our community so i'm going to talk about children just for a second because this can happen anywhere i grew up with a grandfather in montana huge hunter and when we were coming up to see him the guns got stored they got put up they chained you know i mean we knew he had him uh when we'd go out uh driving in some of the grasslands he did have a rifle with him just in case you know he had an antelope or you know to put something down but you know and he went over everything about what to touch what not to touch you know a guns never not loaded a lot of a lot of gun safety um and my son was exposed to you know um to guns in in through scouting and through some of the hunting programs that the dnr does even though he doesn't hunt or own a gun now but a lot of a lot of families take the time to make sure that their children understand what this weapon's capable of other people are purchasing handguns or things like that for their own personal safety and sometimes not getting trained in the responsibility of how to handle and and how to treat this weapon and so we find unfortunate instances of kids discovering the guns sometimes taking them to school sometimes thinking about the play and hiding it because they don't want their parents to know that they're playing with it right and then we have a tragedy happen and then i had a student when i was teaching or saint paul high school who was who committed suicide and i know that there was a lot of talk about what if there had been a trigger lock would have slowed him down the family blamed themselves it was it was tough to watch you're the first on call for those kinds of scenes if you could go back and do a re-run and do a loop what are some of the things that we as a community or families or members and i know some of you have trigger locks available you know just you don't even have to ask for one they're just kind of sitting out there i saw that when i was in newport back a couple years ago what are some of the things that that as as i talk to parents or even training that we need to do with with community members for gun safety not at so we won't talk about banning anything or some of the other legislation that i just talked about but gun safety and gun storage because we're really missing the mark on this a lot with first-time gun buyers who are getting no training and aren't realizing um that that they think that they put it in a safe spot kids find everything they find their chris they find the christmas present right they find things in the house and they aren't going to tell you when they find them so could you just maybe take a moment if if you were talking to you know a group of folks about how to make if you have a gun at home to make it more safe erica you put your hand up right away yeah um actually later today the roseau police department is going to be announcing a um it's not a buyback but a gun turn-in day and what we find a lot in our community is people inherit guns they've got guns in their homes that maybe they don't want or are worried about getting into the wrong hands and so we're just going to have a day where people can come in they can actually do it any day but we're going to do a designated day where people can come in and turn in any guns that they just don't feel safe having in their home and then we'll be destroying those so um we also obviously have the gun locks available at any time but we just want people if they if they've inherited them they've got them sitting around they no longer want them it's a place to get to have that gun destroyed that happens a lot of municipalities people come people come in and and and network with with guns i did that when my grandfather passed away to montana every else raffle ticket that he won that that had a rifle or a shotgun he wanted he had given him a lot of them way to young hunters but i was a little taken back when i opened up the chest with when i found the locks and everything and everything was chained but how much was in there lots of times people when they are cleaning something out from a family member i find a lot of things and there's no questions to ask when you come into the police department to turn those in and can you you can return in ammo too can you not correct yep and you can do that any day we're just gonna have a designated day where we'll have it out in the parking lot and people can literally just drive through and we're gonna make it as convenient as possible so yes tom a congresswoman i just want to say real quick because this dovetails nicely um two days ago we had a meeting with the governor's office with the department of public safety here in the state about what can we do locally um not getting into specifics where on either side of the aisle either locally or federally people we're going to run into things here's something i'm very passionate about and we discussed we need to do let's just talk about minnesota let's get out and do an advertising campaign right now here's what we know for sure right to your point um firearms um safe storage of firearms we should be doing a campaign we talk about it all the time let's get some billboards let's do some things on tv um and it also gives some strategic value as well the people that understand that the majority of guns and i think chief ellison and the other chiefs will agree with this the majority of guns that i know in my time at the state that have been stolen and used in criminal activity or using criminal activities have been stolen from somebody's house that the gun was not um secured in or somebody's car i mean we should be doing a campaign about this number two we've seen just some horrific incidents over the last just year of little children being killed to your point congresswoman um by guns that were just laying around in an apartment they were not secured sometimes the person that had that firearm wasn't illegal in the first place but safe storage of firearms um both in your house and unless you have a gun lock in your car you shouldn't have it in your car i mean those are things that we can do right now and they don't cost much and there's support on both sides of the aisle for that i just think that if we want to educate the public we need to do it right now more than ever before and i'm going to leave with a real incident that just happened um i can't say much because it's an active investigation but an individual has killed a judge over in wisconsin but the individual that has been taken into custody had a list of people throughout the country and um on that list was also some people from minnesota that gets back to the mental health piece and the red flag laws and i can't get into anything else about that you all hear about that in the media later today that's why it's looking down but advertising now to protect our children safe storage of firearms so that they're not using commissions of felonies for all the chiefs that that their people are out there arresting those felons i mean those are real stats and we can do that right now well i we experience in our in in our office it'll come as no surprise to people threats and saint paul pd is has our has our back all the time and when i've done town halls a lot of your cities have been involved in making sure that the town halls are conducted safely that every time one of these shootings happen and as more and more of them happen with these mass shootings and people sometimes know that i could be a target um i'm having more people tell me that they really don't want to um you know come to come to meetings because they're afraid people are going to bring guns to them and so we've been doing more zooms and and more outreach like like that and i know the churches now in synagogues and even some of the um we've seen some thefts now in some of some of the islamic centers um you know people in places of worship are starting not not to feel as safe as they should be so this issue really needs to be addressed and i like what all of you said this this is a whole of government it's a whole of community approach but i think it can i'm i'm you know ready willing and able to work on on the things that are just common sense that don't take you know don't have a partisan label to them yes i want to go farther than some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle do with assault weapons bans but that shouldn't prevent us from doing the things that we all agree on the things that make the most common sense to do and i know that um you know that that'll make your job safer it'll make our community safer and we'll be able to focus on on other things rather than responding to mass shooting in in in just uh because this takes a toll and a couple of you mentioned it on um on officers um are we doing enough to give your officers and um you know sheriff flushers and on but we have you know washington washington county well represented here are there things that we need to do for mental health both as community as a community member as a person who lives in minnesota as a federal legislator to make sure that you're getting the resiliency training to get up and do your job every morning what more can the community do to support you in your first responder role and as i said everything from a tragedy with a suicide or an accidental gun being discharged to dealing with the carnage of some of these mass shootings what can we do to help you so you can be more effective and steady in your jobs in working with the community and that's the last question i'll jump in i mean i think part of it congresswoman is just is just recognizing what you just said that um everything we're talking about here uh has its has its toll and effect on those first responders that are out doing the job and while we choose to do this job and well you know the fact the matter is we need men and women that will continue to choose to do this job in the future and so we um we remain very proud of the work that our that our officers do and we want to make sure that this is a sustainable thing down the road that we continue to have young people that want to get into this line of work so we're all trying to be really creative and we're all trying to recruit and and uh you know steal from each other on occasion there's all these good officers but we all got to be in this together so community support goes a long ways and it can be very small gestures but i think each chief here could tell stories of officers who have been out in the public who've had positive interactions with community members community members have gone out of their way to say thank you or just whatever little interaction it is those mean so much to our to our men and women that are out on the on the front lines so those little gestures of support are a big deal i know that's not a big picture thing but it does kind of help sustain us get through some some difficult times and it's very meaningful to our officers thank you well i want to thank all of you uh from the fourth district law enforcement leaders who joined us here today i know how busy your days are it was a good

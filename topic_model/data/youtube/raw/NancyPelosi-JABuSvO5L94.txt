I guess it's still morning good morning everyone as a member of the leadership of the Congress of the United States it is my official privilege to welcome so many of you to Washington DC to the steps of the Lincoln Memorial I join my colleagues and associate myself with the remarks of those from Congress who have spoken before me that's officially personally it is my very personal pleasure to be here with each and every one of you because I was here 50 years ago so who among you is going to be the Speaker of the House the President of the United States or whatever you're a beautiful sight to behold and at that time 50 years ago we heard dr. King inspire us with the I have a dream part of his speech the part that though was the call to action was the fierce urgency of now part of his speech in that time dr. King says we refuse to take the tranquility drug of gradualism we must move forward and forward we will if it was fierce then the urgent it certainly is now 50 years ago there were only five african-american members of the House of Representatives there was no congressional black caucus today there are 43 members we want more but they're 43 African Amendment marriage and they are led by congresswoman Marcia fudge whom you've heard from and they are the conscience of the Congress and in that black caucus we have the privilege of serving with John Lewis some of us for over 25 years in the Congress and aren't we proud of that i also want to mention that 50 years ago though he was not a member Congress at the time that John Conyers was one of three people invited to the White House to meet with president john f kennedy following the civil rights march the march for jobs justice and freedom who is with us fifty years ago we had the first Catholic president in the White House today we have the first african-american president and the first african-american first family leading our country so beautifully from the White House you know we come together here at a time when there is a monument to Reverend Martin Luther King on the mall here he sits with presidents of the United States so appropriately we have a day set aside as a national holiday to celebrate his birthday but he would want us to celebrate him his birth and his legacy by acting upon his agenda by realizing the dream by making the minimum wage a living wage by having not just family and medical leave but paid sick leave for our workers by having by having quality affordable childcare so that our families can be the power of women can be unleashed in our economy and in our society and you know what this just happens to be women's equality weekend when women succeed America succeeds when people of color succeed America succeeds he would also want us to be fighting for voting rights certainly we must pass a bill in the Congress to correct what the Supreme Court did but we must also be sure that every person who is eligible to vote can vote and that their vote would be counted when I was here 50 years ago people said oh and that includes voting rights for the District of Columbia when I was here 50 years ago people say what do you remember most and the music is playing so I'll say this dr. King said this 50 years ago the music of the March the harmony of the civil rights movement the notes of doctors Kings inspirational words must continue to inspire us to compose as dr. King said on that August afternoon a beautiful symphony of brotherhood are you ready to beat the drum for that beautiful symphony of brotherhood are you ready to realize the dream thank you all very much you

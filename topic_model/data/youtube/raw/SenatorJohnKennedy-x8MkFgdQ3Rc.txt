senator kennedy uh mr evlo i'm i'm pleased we're having this hearing today but uh it just seems to me the timing is bad uh the house is on fire and we're discussing new tires for the tire truck does a tire truck need good tires sure is that important of course but not when the house is on fire i don't want to talk about the house fire i um i've been to the border 45 okay mind i um i used to have a beagle his name was roger i loved roger i cried like a baby when he died but roger like most beagles was in carbs ball about every third day he'd run away and eventually he'd come home and he he liked to collect roadkill and he'd bring that roadkill into my backyard and hide it under my back porch and the border enforcement that i've seen looks like some of the road kill that roger kept hidden under my back porch um why are we having a crisis now at the border in one minute it's the administration policies that we've seen since the first day after inauguration with the first executive order to halt deportations with executive action to destroy i'm sorry not executive order but the executive order to uh make things easier for immigration with the department of homeland security halting deportations with uh ice guidance to uh return to prosecutorial discretion where only certain types of offenses can be prosecuted i'm sorry can be enforced and can be put into immigration court or or set for removal where we ignore the fact that there are over a million people in this country with final orders of removal none of which are none of which seem to be a priority for let me interrupt you i apologize if we had the same policies in place today that we had on december 31st 2020 and you're considered judgment would we be having this crisis no did the biden administration strike that let me try it another way did you meet with representatives of the biden administration to talk about border security uh i i can tell you that i had at least one meeting with uh the the transition team with uh orjadou who was running the transition team and i know that that team met with many different uh peop at uscis and same with other uh agencies within dhs did did uh the the the people the good people on the biden transition team uh express an interest in changing border policy i i don't based on my conversation with them senator no it was more just trying to understand what was going on and where where things well did you and your colleagues explain to them what would happen if we changed border policy uh i did not and that was not the questions that were being asked to me but i know that others within the department did have that frank conversation with those with those team members so so the the members of the biden uh the transition team knew if they changed the border policies we would have a crisis i i think any change in in border policy that that's uh that is so uh uh extreme would result in this and and i think they had to have known that but they did it anyway correct especially the the withdrawal and the the ending of the mpp migrant protection protocols why do you think they did it if they knew there was going to be a crisis if they knew that that people from all over the world were going to be able to walk into our country we don't have the slightest idea who they are um why why do you think they would allow that to happen it could be several reasons it could have been a a tactic a political tactic to then come back and try to fix the border themselves it could have also been the what we've seen time and time again that trump equals bad so anything that the president would have done uh the former president would have done had to be overturned no matter how successful and how important it was in maintaining order at the border and that's what i see this as president trump did a phenomenal job of of giving the right people the keys to to make sure that we could uh we could address the crisis along the border that we could make sure that enforcement was where it needed to be and unfortunately that was just derailed on january 20th thank you mr chairman

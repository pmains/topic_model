  ORDER SO WE CAN HEAR THE  GENTLEMAN. THANK YOU. THE GENTLEMAN FROM TEXAS IS  RECOGNIZED. . >> I RISE IN RISE IN SUPPORT OF THE BLACKWELL SCHOOL. IT IS LOCATED IN MY DISTRICT. WE ARE VOTING ON LEGISLATION THAT MAKE THIS LANDMARK A NATIONAL HISTORIC SITE UNDER THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE. WHEN IT COMES TO RECOGNIZING LANDS AT THE NATIONAL HISTORIC SITE, IT IS PARAMOUNT TO LOOK OUTSIDE PARAMETERS. WE MUST PRESERVE OUR HISTORY FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE AND SHARE STORIES INCLUDING THE HISTORY OF MEXICAN-AMERICANS AND THEIR STRUGGLE FOR EQUALITY. THE BLACKWELL SCHOOL OPERATED FROM 1909 AS A SEGREGATED SCHOOL. WHILE IT WAS MANDATORY, IT WAS OPTIONAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THEY CHOSE TO SEGREGATE. CHILDREN WERE BANNED FROM SPEAKING SPANISH AND HAD TO BURY SLIPS OF PAPER WITH SPANISH WORDS IN A MOCK FUNERAL CEREMONY. THE SCHOOL OPERATED DURING A TIME IN AMERICAN HISTORY WHEN SEPARATE BUT EQUAL DOMINATED OUR CULTURE. THIS IS AN UGLY STAP AND WHILE WE HAVE PROGRESSED WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THE PAINFUL WRONG THAT SEGREGATION PLAYED. ESTABLISHING THE BLACKWELL SCHOOL AS A NATIONAL HISTORIC SITE ENSURES THAT THE BUILDING IS MAPPED PROPERLY SO GENERATIONS TO COME CAN UNDERSTAND ITS RICH BUT COMPLICATED HISTORY. ESTABLISHING THIS AS A HISTORIC SITE GOES BEYOND INFLUENCES. MY DISTRICT IS HOME TO 8-16 OF THE TEXAS NATIONAL PARKS SUCH AS THE BIG BEAR NATIONAL PARK. I HAVE SEEN THE POSITIVE AND ECONOMIC IMPACT. ESTABLISHING THE BLACKWELL SCHOOL AS A NATIONAL LANDMARK WOULD BRING INCREASED TOURISM AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY TO THE COUNTY. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MY FRIEND BAYLOR AND NATURAL RESOURCES CHAIRMAN AND BRUISE WESTERMAN FOR PRIORITIZING THIS LEGISLATION. MOST IMPORTANTLY -- MR. WESTERMAN: I YIELD TO THE GENTLEMAN ANOTHER MINUTE. >> I THANK THE CONSERVATION ASSOCIATION FOR THEIR COMMITMENT TO GIVING THIS LANDMARK THE RECOGNITION IT DESERVES. THE SCHOOL IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF HISTORY FOR WES

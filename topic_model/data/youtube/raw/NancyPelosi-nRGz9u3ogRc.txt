the gentlewoman from California the Minority Leader is recognized thank you very much mr. Speaker I thank the gentleman for yielding for his leadership on behalf of America's working families and for bringing as the opposition to this legislation to the floor today mr. speaker and my colleagues more than 75 years ago President Franklin Roosevelt signed the bill which created the national labor relations board and said he did so to give every worker the freedom of choice and action which is justly his today we say which is justly his or hers that was a very important moment for workers because it said that they could negotiate they could bargain collectively giving great leverage to workers in our country and it was necessary the freedom of choice in action has rested at the core of a growing thriving American workforce it has created the American middle class that has made our country great and is the backbone of our democracy this legislation lord today undermines freedom of choice in action it will weaken our middle class and again weaken our democracy for months in a Wisconsin Ohio and other states nationwide Americans have seen Republican governors and legislators attack teachers firefighters and police officers and other public servants and we've seen American workers union and non-union alike fight back inspiring the nation my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have promoted many myths about this their misguided legislation which they're bringing for today and how it will impact the National Labor Relations Board so I'd like to clarify a few facts first the bill meant the dis bill mandates delay rather than minimizes it it encourages frivolous litigation rather than discourages it it convolute sand distorts elections rather than simplifying them simply put this legislation would deny workers their right to a free and fair election to form a union it adds extensive delays to the process as workers organize with the clear intention of as my colleague congressman George Miller the ranking member of the labor education and Labor Committee has said wearing down workers so they give up fighting for a better deal it's an age-old tactic it must be rejected at a time when Americans are demanding jobs and job growth economic growth for our country today's legislation is the wrong priority we need to be solving the problem and challenge of creating jobs and not adding to the problems as this bill would do there is a great deep to be done to reigniting the American Dream igniting American Dream is what Franklin Roosevelt did when he signed this bill and many other initiatives of that era and they corrected many ills in our economy and our society and communities across the country in terms of fairness fairness an American value so we want to reignite the American dream to build ladders of success for all who want to work hard play by the rules remove obstacles to fuller participation in our economy so that many more workers can participate in America's prosperity this is about again strengthening the middle class the backbone of our democracy instead this legislation will have the opposite effect of eroding rights and opportunity I urge my colleagues to vote no I yield back the balance of my time gentlelady from California yields back the gentleman from California reserves the gentleman from Minnesota is recognized

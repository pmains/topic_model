mr. speaker on social media a new generation of parents and grandparents are sharing the joy of new life posting pictures of baby bumps and sonograms for friends and family to view now more than ever it's easier to see and understand that an unborn child in the womb is a person with tiny toes and fingers in a heartbeat created equal and entitled to an animal rights however recent event demonstrated that these rights are being violated and that the public's trust has been betrayed millions of taxpayer dollars have supported the horrific practice of allowing babies to be taken apart dismantled and sold piece by piece in response house investigations are underway and more needs to be done to protect our most vulnerable citizens House Resolution 3134 restores trust for American taxpayers it provides more funding for qualified health centers that offer pediatric care immunizations mammograms and more life-saving health care services that protect mother and child these better options are worthy of taxpayer funding and will make a positive difference for women and children across our country thank you

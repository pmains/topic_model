thank God thank you both again for your testimony today as I'm sure you know under the paperwork reduction Act the Office of Management and Budget must review and approve federal collections of information before they are I guess conducted the after enjoying the the agency request OMB may approve or disapprove that request or they can go ahead and define conditions that need to be met for approval OMB is required to ensure that any information collection maximizes practical utility and public benefits and protects integrity objectivity and impartiality of collected statistical information last month I let a letter with 34 of our colleagues both in the House and the Senate requesting information from the Commerce Department and awara as to how they plan to ensure that the paperwork reduction Act requirements were met with respect to the addition of a question on citizenship on the 2020 census that was last May a year ago we have not received a response to that letter let me ask first if I could miss cat soon as you know concerns have been raised about adding a question on citizenship citizenship do the potential negative consequences including a lower self-response rate which would lead to a less accurate and more costly census and I would just ask could you please weigh in for us and explain a wiris role in reviewing information collections in what a wire I should be reviewing with respect to the citizenship question and the 2020 census could you take a shot at that I'll try guys thank you thank you under the paperwork reduction Act any question being posed to the public to ten or more people has to receive a in effect a hearing by the agency and then if they decide to go ahead with it they will then send it to OMB which has a second comment period for people to comment and as you correctly stated one of the conditions is to maximize practical utility there is also minimize burden it's a modified cost-benefit analysis are we going to get something from this paperwork requirement that will be useful and well worth whatever offsetting value there is now with the decennial census for 2020 there has been a lot of publicity and I've actually read the three district court cases one of which is 267 pages so I have some knowledge about the specifics of that particular paperwork requirement I think the most significant aspect is that the primary purpose of the decennial census which is embodied in the Constitution it's the only paperwork requirement embodied in the Constitution is for the enumeration every ten years that is the primary purpose the addition of a question relating to citizenship is a question which it least pretextual ii has been justified by assisting the Justice Department in better enforcing voter rights cases that's a secondary condition if the secondary condition is going to have an adverse effect on the primary purpose one would have a very hard time justifying it under the paperwork reduction Act because every past census Bureau director and vast numbers of statisticians including the National Academy of Science has said that this will decrease the response rate significantly from the for the enumeration purposes and that the data are not needed in the decennial census because there are alternative places where this data reside in the ACS study and other kinds of things with that it is hard to see how the decennial census with the question would pass muster under the paperwork reduction Act now there's all sorts of politics policies whatever but I was just trying to focus on the PRA Thank You mr. chairman your generous with your time I would like to ask if I could for the witnesses to each give us like maybe one change or memory you would suggest to to the legislation that's this hearing is designed it with just one change I think in the nice I said early I never introduced a perfect bill or probably a perfect amendment and the as good as easy to legislators are these two senators are there's probably room for improvement can you think of one thing that you'd suggested that we amend as we take it to a markup miss Dudley perhaps the the ten-year window for a review it provides for one one review at ten years and then nothing thereafter and that may be appropriate for some types of regulations but not for others so I think I and I know I disagree selenite disagree on this I might like to see a continued requirement for that retrospective analysis that would continue to measure and continue to observe whether we're achieving the desired objective all right thank you just one one idea Sally if you weren't Susan is correct that I disagree with her suggestion I was looking at what was supposed to go in the ANPRM and I I came across something which I I questioned its utility and that was in the ANPRM to list the legal authority under which a major rule may be proposed and then the following language including whether a rulemaking is required by statute and if so whether by a specific date whether the agency has discretion to commence a rulemaking and I can envision circumstances where the discretion is reduced with greater incidence of death or harm or safety of some sort and and I had not really sort of focused on that particular language but I'm not sure that if I were giving you one thing that I think I might want to change from the latest draft which looks very good indeed it might be to to stop that little three whatever it is little three sooner all right thank you for some people are saying this is about as excited talking about an experience in their life they said it was about as exciting as watching wet paint dry I suspect for some people a hearing on this subject is like just like that I think it's a terrifically exciting hearing and I applied our chair and ranking member for bringing us together and look forward to working with you to what does they say in the Constitution we the people United States of America in order to form a more perfect union to maybe work with you to see if we can form an even more perfect though thank you for efforts by the way I

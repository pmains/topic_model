  YIELD ONE MINUTE TO THE  GENTLEMAN FROM INDIANA. >> I THANK THE CHAIRMAN FOR THE  TIME. I EXPRESS MY SUPPORT AND  APPRECIATION THAT THE HOUSE IS  CONSIDERING THE CHIPS ACT --  CHIPS AND SCIENCE ACT. INDIANA'S FIRST CONGRESSIONAL  DISTRICT IS HOME TO INCREDIBLE  MANUFACTURING, STEEL, AND  INDUSTRIAL WORKFORCE. THIS LEGISLATION TAKES HISTORIC  ACTION TO SHORTEN SUPPLY CHAINS, INCREASE AMERICAN-MADE  SEMICONDUCTORS, AND PROTECT OUR  NATIONAL SECURITY. I THANK MY SENATE COLLEAGUE FROM INDIANA, SENATOR TODD YOUNG, FOR HIS STEADFAST LEADERSHIP. MR. MRVAN: THIS BIPARTISAN  LEGISLATION INVESTS IN R&D AND  STEM. IT MAKE US LESS RELIANT ON OTHER COUNTRIES FOR CHIPS AND  SEMICONDUCTORS. IT INVESTS IN THE AMERICAN  WORKER AND INGENUITY. IT ALLOWS FOR AUTO WORKERS TO  COMPLETE PRODUCTION WITHOUT  STOPPAGES. IT ALLOWS FOR CONTINUITY FOR OUR STEEL INDUSTRY AND STEELWORKERS  AND PRODUCTIVITY. AND IT STRENGTHENS OUR NATION'S  SECURITY. IT CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR  INDIANA IN A BIPARTISAN  CONGRESSIONAL MANNER AND THE  DELEGATION TO COME TOGETHER TO  COMPETE FOR A TECH HUB. AND IT CREATES A FUTURE FOR THE  NEXT GENERATION OF WORKERS. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE  GENTLEMAN'S TIME HAS EXPIRED. MR

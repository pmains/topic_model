this time of introducing our next speaker like I said before a lot of things have changed since our last meeting in February the night of our annual Lincoln Day dinner the US Senate voted to approve the stimulus bill the legislation proved to be as ineffective as it was unpopular in Pennsylvania that set into motion a series event of events the lead senator arlen specter to make a calculated decision to abandon our party with the hopes of salvaging his political career that is right contrary to what he said he left our party all in all I think the situation has taught us an important lesson we should never compromise our principles and support candidates to clearly don't support don't believe in our party's most basic principles of lower taxes less government and fiscal responsibility and let's face it senator Specter abandon those principles when he chose to support the big government left wing agenda our party in this common won't want to it want to elect a u.s. senator that will work for the best interests of the people of Pennsylvania not just someone interested in furthering their own careers we want to elect a u.s. senator that believes in limiting the role of government reducing taxes restoring fiscal responsibility to the US Capitol we want to elect a u.s. senator that will serve as a leading voice against the Democrats left-wing policies and end our country support of a socialist agenda I think our party in our Commonwealth are fortunate to have a candidate running for this office at Fitzy's criteria former US congressman Pat Toomey is a man who has the courage to of his convictions to stand up and fight for the principles of our party and this country were founded upon recently I had the opportunity to sit down for a while with Pat and I've tell you these incredibly impressive with his agenda is exactly the type of leader we need in Washington without further ado ladies and gentlemen please help me welcome head coo made thank you very much thank you thank you so much thank you thank you very much thank you thank you very very much for that very warm reception and chairman thank you for that very kind introduction thanks for giving me a chance to share some thoughts with you tonight I appreciate the chance that chairman has turned over the podium to me despite despite my obvious shortcomings as a public speaker I've got to share with you a quick story which will give you an insight to just how challenged I am chairman you'll appreciate this and you may not invite me to speak again but we have my wife Chris and I have two small children an eight-year-old in a nine-year-old and when my daughter was in second grade her class had a program whereby this school invites parents to come in and speak to the assembled second graders and tell them what it is you do for a living so being the dutiful father that I am on the appointed day I showed up at my second-grade daughter's classroom and I stood up in front of 25 7 year olds and explained what i did is the president and CEO of the club for growth a national political advocacy organization dedicated to promoting economic freedom and prosperity through limited government I I thought I'd done pretty well a little girl walks up to me and she looks up at me and she says mr. to me I said yes she said I just want you to know that was the worst speech I ever heard in my life now my daughter is standing next to us and she overheard this and she looked up at me and she said daddy don't listen to a word she says she just repeats whatever all the other kids are saying so so with that caveat I do want to share a couple of brief thoughts with you first of all and thanks again for all you do and for the tremendous reception let me say I am crisscrossing the Commonwealth on a very regular basis as you might imagine I've seen many of you across across the state and I have to tell you political environment has changed enormously it has changed for the better it's continuing to get better the energy and the enthusiasm that I'm seeing four Republican candidates for myself or others who are running under the Republican banner is tremendous and it's encouraging and as a result I am absolutely convinced that those dreary days of dreadful elections are behind us now we're going to start winning we're going to start winning this far I'm sure of it we've got just so that everybody is reminded we've got an important special election coming up just next week and we've got a we've got an opening we've got a great candidate his name is representative bob bensch and chris and i happen to live in that Senate District I was at an event for him just last night he's a terrific candidate he's doing well the state committee is doing a strong effort to help win that it's vitally important that we send Bob mention as reinforcements to Joe Scarnati and Dominic Pileggi who are doing a fantastic job but they need the reinforcements and we need a win next week in the 24th district and I've had the privilege to get to know the judicial candidates and I have to tell you I'm so impressed and grateful for the chance to campaign with them to get to know them and to be able to without qualification to vouch for their intelligence their integrity the experiment we are blessed to have the slate of candidates we have and of course leading leading this ticket is Joan Orie Melvin she's going to make a great Supreme Court justice and we've all got to make sure that that happens these these elections these judicial elections in particular are incredibly important in their own right and and that's enough reason for us to do all that we can to help them win but I will tell you they are also important for the momentum that they create going into 2010 when we have a big win this November which I'm convinced we will it sets the stage it creates the momentum it creates the environment it makes it possible for us to win big races in 2010 like the governor's race like a US Senate race like congressional races this is this is part of that process and I will tell you my campaign is off to a tremendous start I am so grateful to the many of you have been so supportive let me just share with you we have already over 5,000 people have volunteered for my campaign over 20,000 people have contributed to my campaign I am the number one challenge or fundraiser in America I am the only challenger in the country that the National Republican Senate committee has endorsed and if you look at the publicly available polling in this race and you average out the last few polls I'm already ahead of either Arlen Specter or joe Sestak and that's a good place to be with with your help with your help we're going to win this race now we're going to win this because pennsylvania voters do not support this liberal lurch to the left you know i Ronald Reagan speaking of liberals you know Ronald Reagan said about liberals it's not that they don't know anything it's just that everything they know is wrong but pennsylvania voters know better and they don't support this liberal agenda what they do believe in our fundamental republican ideas which are American ideas belief in limited government and personal freedom a free enterprise system traditional values a strong defense defense of our nation and our sovereignty those ideas are at the core of the American idea their Republican ideas and they are the ideas that are embraced by pennsylvania voters and they will be this fall so we're going to have a terrific win I hope you have a terrific weekend thank you very much for your support you

thank you very much mr. speaker today I joined millions of my fellow Americans in recognizing national estuary week that extends from September 14th to September 21st we know that estuaries are those places where our freshwater or our rivers meet the seas estuaries are also places where by it but where biodiversity is often at a zenith they are the ecologies of our coastal communities whenever a watershed empties into the sea we find an estuary my home in Florida is part of an estuary called the Indian River Lagoon where the fresh and salt waters mix behind barrier islands to form what experts recognized as the most biodiverse estuary in the United States of America my community and district depend on the lagoon to support a broader way of activities to meet our economic environmental and recreational needs my neighbors and I understand how much we depend on the lagoon we strive to protect the sea turtles and the habitats and the manatees when they're thriving we know that fishermen boaters businesses and most importantly our families will thrive for years I work for the health of the Indian River Lagoon and tried to help other communities keep their estuaries healthy the challenges of the Indian River Lagoon are the same challenges faced by all the other estuaries last Congress I joined with congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici to found the congressional estuary caucus to support the National estuary program foster research and estuary restoration and protection and bring other resources to bear on sustaining our estuaries national estuary Week is a special time for a national celebration of our estuary efforts and for local estuary programs within the national program to bring the importance of estuaries to their communities and involve other citizens in their work an important part of these goals is to communicate the value and importance of our estuaries and our coasts to key decision-makers at the local state and federal levels that's what we're doing right now our friends that restore America's estuaries tell us that last year's celebration was a tremendous as organizations have volunteers from across the country gathered at their local Bay's or River fronts and classrooms to celebrate and learn about the importance of our estuaries and how they benefit our daily lives more than 30,000 volunteers across 21 states Canada and Guam participated in over a hundred and five different estuary events many of this year's events are posted online and they give us a stunning picture of how each estuary while being a national asset is also a unique treasure to its communities for example in Palm Bay in my district the Marine Resources Council the Indian River Lagoon estuaries program the Nature Conservancy of Florida Act two technologies and a Tampa Bay Estuary program held a rain barrel workshop an auction heard from a variety of distinguished speakers on water quality experts and dine on a fine barbecue meal as a speaker's panel open forum focused on audience participation facilitating questions and concerns as well as the opportunity to present ideas of potential problems and solutions for our waterways we also celebrate national estuary Week as a time to recommit our effort in the caucus to achieve full funding for the National estuary program and to bring those resources to the communities who live on the estuaries edge we can and we must work to assure that our estuaries in our environment are sustained Thank You mr.

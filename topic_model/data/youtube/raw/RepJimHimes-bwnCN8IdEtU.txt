now is democratic congressman jim Himes of connecticut he also serves on the House Intelligence Committee served first questions to the u.s. changed the strategy against Isis after the massacre in parent in Paris we heard the president today saying that there would not be in advance of any type of boots on the ground or an uptick in military strategy wouldn't people think that what's taken place now has been a failing strategy well honestly there hasn't been much of a strategy to date I mean remember how its evolved right a year and a half ago we were going after Assad and then we were going after Isis and then we were doing both and the Department of Defense was going to arm moderates which we're going to go after Assad and go after Isis who are going after each other you know what we haven't done or what we haven't done until very recently of course is think about the endgame here which is the refugee problem Isis they get worse until the Russians the Turks the Europeans the Americans Jordanians everybody involved there comes together and says here's what a post-assad Syria looks like now when you have the end game when you know what that now you can start talking about things like how you get together to actually militarily defeat Isis but as long as we're kind of fighting on both sides of a Syrian civil war we're going to produce the results that we've produced to date we know the president Hollande is called the Paris massacre as an act of war President Obama hasn't gone that far do you think the u.s. in Paris is on the same page what's your opinion is this an act of war well you know I do think it's worth being careful about language you know so people are characterizing this as a you know terminal clash between civilizations we need to remember that we're talking about psychopathic evildoers here that we probably don't want to elevate to the level of being at war with NATO however that said we also need to be conscious of the fact that no amount of air strikes will eliminate these guys and if we're serious about destroying them there will be a Ground Force a very substantial Ground Force which ultimately ends them now we don't want to go there obviously until we get that end game that I'm talking about frankly as Americans we don't want to go there until the Congress has a debate about exactly what we want to commit to that but whatever you want to call it until we militarily wipe this group out they will be active congressman jim Himes of connecticut sir thanks to your time

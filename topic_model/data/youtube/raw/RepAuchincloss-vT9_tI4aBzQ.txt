SUPPORT FROM ALLIES FOR  POTENTIAL SANCTIONS ON CHINA IF  BEIJING WERE TO PROVIDE LEGAL  AID AND WE COULD PROVE IT. JOINING ME NOW IS CONGRESSMAN  JAKE AUSTIN KLAAS, AND A MEMBER  OF THE CHINA SELECT COMMITTEE. I APPRECIATE YOU COMING IN.  YOU ARE ALSO A VETERAN.  THAT IS IMPORTANT FOR FOLKS TO KNOW.  LET ME START WITH, SIMPLY, THE MISSION OF THIS COMMITTEE. HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE MISSION OF THIS COMMITTEE, AND WHAT DOES SUCCESS LOOK LIKE? >> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.  THE MISSION OF THIS COMMITTEE  IS TWOFOLD.  WE WANT TO RISE ABOVE DAY-TO DAY POLITICS TO CHART LONG-TERM  SOUND STRATEGY FOR COMPETITION WITH THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY, AND THAT REQUIRES,  NUMBER ONE, CREATING SHARED  AWARENESS OF THE SCOPE AND SEVERITY OF THAT CHALLENGE WITHIN CONGRESS, AND NUMBER TWO  IS PUTTING FORWARD DISCRETE  POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAN  GET BUY-IN FROM A SUPER  MAJORITY OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. 70% OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS GOING FORWARD, SO WE HAVE A  STRONG BIPARTISAN CONSENSUS. >> IT SEEMS AS IF, IF YOU READ IN BETWEEN THE LINES OF THE  CHAIRMAN'S WORDS, MIKE GALLAGHER, I THINK WHAT HE HOPES TO GET OUT OF THIS IS A  CONSENSUS THAT WE HAVE TO  DECOUPLE FROM CHINA  ECONOMICALLY.  WHAT DOES THE COUPLING LOOK  LIKE?  THAT IS A CHALLENGE. NUMBER TWO, WE HAVE TO BE  PREPARED TO DEFEND TAIWAN. DO YOU THINK THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHY WE WOULD GO TO WAR WITH CHINA OVER  TAIWAN, IF WE DID DO THAT? DO YOU THINK THEY UNDERSTAND THIS YET?  DO YOU THINK THEY'D -- DO YOU  THINK MORE EDUCATION IS  NECESSARY ON THIS? >> I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE,  AND I WILL ADD THE TAIWANESE PEOPLE, FROM WHICH I JUST  RETURNED, BUT IT IS IMPORTANT  THAT WE AVOID WAR OVER TAIWAN. IT MEANS CHANGING THE COST ANALYSIS FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF XI JINGPING.   WE NEED TO EXPEDITE ARMS SALES TO TAIWAN. WE NEED TO INVEST IN THEIR MILITARY STRATEGY. WE NEED TO HELP THEM ACHIEVE ENERGY INDEPENDENCE SO THE CHINESE CAN'T BLOCKADE THEM AND  ASPHYXIATE THEM. WE HAVE GOT TO MAKE TAIWAN READY TO FIGHT FOR ITS INDEPENDENCE AND AUTONOMY, SUCH  THAT THE CCP DECIDES, NO, IT'S NOT THE RIGHT TIME.  >> IT WAS GOING TO BE AN ECONOMIC TRADE -- TREATY, THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO SERVE AS A CHECK ON CHINA.  IS THERE WAY OF PUTTING BACK TOGETHER AS A SECURITY PACK? SHOULD THERE BE ONE? >> IT'S A TERRIFIC QUESTION. IT IS WHAT I RAISED IN MY  COMMENTS DURING OUR FIRST  HEARING OF THE COMMITTEE.  I THINK WE CAN HAVE A PARALLEL APPROACH HERE. ON THE ONE HAND, WE HAVE THE QUAD, JAPAN, THE UNITED STATES,  INDIA, AND AUSTRALIA, WHICH IS A SECURITY COOPERATION IN THE  END OF PACIFIC TO ENSURE A FREE  AND OPEN ENDO PACIFIC. WE SHOULD BUILD ON THE QUAD. GET NEW MEMBER COUNTRIES TO  JOIN THOSE MILITARY EXERCISES  AND JOINT PLANNING.  SOUTH KOREA, FOR EXAMPLE.  NUMBER TWO, WE HAVE TO RESUSCITATE THE TEAM. WHETHER  THAT STARTS WITH A BILATERAL TRADE AGREEMENT WITH TAIWAN, AND WHETHER THAT LOOKS MORE  EXPENSIVE, REMAINS TO BE SEEN. PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS RIGHT. FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IN THE  ENDO PACIFIC IS THE BEST WAY TO  CONTAIN CHINESE AGGRESSION AND EXPANSIONISM ON THE PACIFIC  OCEAN. >> LET ME GET SOMETHING THAT A FELLOW DEMOCRATIC MEMBER OF  CONGRESS, JUDY CHU, A CHINESE  AMERICAN -- SHE VOTED AGAINST  THE CREATION OF THIS COMMITTEE,  FEARING THAT IT WAS GOING TO --  FEARING THAT IT WOULD, INEVITABLY, LEAD TO MORE XENOPHOBIA.  GIVEN WHAT SHE EXPERIENCED WITH  THE CRITICISM SHE GOT, DOES SHE  HAVE A FAIR POINT HERE?  >> WE ALWAYS NEED TO BE ON GUARD THAT LEGITIMATE, AND INDEED, NECESSARY FOCUS ON THE STRATEGIC THREAT FROM THE  CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY DOES NOT DEVOLVE INTO, ONE, A CASTING OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE  AS OUR ENEMY.  THERE ARE 1.4 BILLION CHINESE  PEOPLE.  WE WISH NO ILL ON THE CHINESE  PEOPLE.  TWO, DEVOLVE INTO XENA PHOBIA  OR HATE TOWARDS CHINESE  AMERICANS OR AMERICANS OF ASIAN  DESCENT. THEY DESERVE TO FEEL WELCOME IN  THEIR COMMUNITIES, AND IT'S AN EXPECTABLE TO BE CASTING DISPERSIONS ON A MEMBER OF CONGRESS.  THAT IS WHY IT EARNED  BIPARTISAN REVIEW, AND IT IS NOT WITH KEEPING WITH THE  SPIRIT OF THIS COMMITTEE.  THIS COMMITTEE IS MEANT TO BE A  BIPARTISAN EFFORT TO RISE ABOVE  AD HOMINEM POLITICS, AND GET SERIOUS ABOUT WINNING THE 21ST CENTURY. >> THERE WAS A COMMENT THAT I  SAW ONE PERSON MAKE THAT SAID, IF YOU WERE NOT WORRIED ABOUT  THE THREAT FROM THE CHINESE  COMMUNIST PARTY, YOU ARE NOT GETTING GOOD INTEL BRIEFINGS.  IS THAT A FAIR WAY TO PUT IT?  >> YES.  THE MORE ONE LEARNS ABOUT THE  CCP'S ACTIVITIES OVERSEAS, AND INDEED, IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY,  THE MORE ALARMING IT IS. THEY ARE THINKING IN FIFTY-YEAR  TIMELINES. THEY ARE INCREDIBLY  SOPHISTICATED ABOUT HOW THEY TRIED TO MOUNT DISINFORMATION  CAMPAIGNS AND INFLUENCE  CAMPAIGNS. THEY ARE PATIENT.  THEY ABSOLUTELY WANT TO TAKE THE MODEL THEY HAVE USED ON  CHINESE MAINLAND AND MAKE IT A MODEL THAT SETS THE RULES FOR  AN INTERNATIONAL ORDER.  >> THAT BRINGS ME TO TIKTOK. DO YOU THINK THIS IS REASON  ENOUGH TO NOT JUST BAN IT FROM GOVERNMENT DEVICES, BUT DO YOU THINK TIKTOK IS A THREAT TO  AMERICANS, GENERALLY, AND THAT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE IT AVAILABLE ON OUR PHONES? >> THERE IS ONE ANGLE ON TIKTOK  THAT RAISES A POLITICAL ISSUE. INDEED, IT DOES HAVE TIES TO THE CCP, AND THAT IS CONCERNING. I THINK THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO LOOK SERIOUSLY AT WHAT NATIONAL  SECURITY CHALLENGES IT POSES,  AND TAKE ACTION ACCORDINGLY. THEN, THERE IS A SECOND ANGLE, WHICH TO ME, IS MORE IMPACTFUL.  IT IS WHAT TIKTOK, INSTAGRAM,  FACEBOOK, WHAT THEY DO TO KIDS MENTAL HEALTH. WE HAVE SEEN A DECLINE IN  CHILDREN'S SOCIO-EMOTIONAL WELL- BEING IN THE LAST 10 YEARS.  IT IS IN LARGE PART BECAUSE  THESE COMPANIES ARE MONETIZING OUR CHILDREN'S ATTENTION SPANS WITH NO CONCERN WHATSOEVER FOR THEIR WELL-BEING, AND IT IS  UNFAIR FOR PARENTS TO HAVE TO  TRY TO STAND UP TO $1 TRILLION COMPANY WITH 10,000 ENGINEERS  CREATING NEW ALGORITHMS. CONGRESS NEEDS TO TAKE CHARGE. >> THIS SOUNDS LIKE THE  CRITICISM I HEARD OF TOBACCO COMPANIES IN THE '70s AND '80s.  >> THE ACTIONS AGAINST THE SOCIAL MEDIA GIANTS NEED TO BE EQUALLY MUSCULAR.  >> WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE? >> I HAVE PROPOSED AN AGE LIMI , 16, THAT IS ENFORCEABLE AND  VERIFIABLE TO USE THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. PARENTS SHOULD BE THE  GATEKEEPERS. ENOUGH WITH THIS 13 YEAR AGE LIMIT THAT NOBODY TRIES TO ENFORCE AND IS UNVERIFIABLE. WE HAVE TO PUT TEETH BEHIND IT.  WE HAVE SEEN THAT ADOLESCENT BOYS AND GIRLS ARE SUFFERING ON  THESE OUTLETS. >> WOULD YOU PUT A TIME BETWEEN  16 AND 18? WOULD YOU SAY, OKAY,  YOU ONLY GET TWO HOURS IF YOU  ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 18? >> I THINK THE KEY IS THAT THE DEFAULT SHOULD PUT PARENTS IN  THE DRIVER SEAT. RIGHT NOW, YOUR PARENTS THAT HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE  THESE APPS AND CONTROL THEIR KIDS AND MONITOR KIDS USAGE, AND THAT IS A DISADVANTAGE.  THAT IS NOT FAIR.  PARENTS NEED TO BE IN THE  DRIVER'S SEATS.  >> IT IS ON THE TECH COMPANIES TO MAKE THAT POSSIBLE FOR US.

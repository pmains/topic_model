you're watching CNN I'm Brooke Baldwin a CNN is getting more clarity today about what happened in the hours before that ambush attack in the air that resulted in the death of these four American soldiers accompanied by troops from Nazaire US military officials tell CNN that these soldiers were gathering intelligence on a terror leader they came under attack on their way back to the operating base when they stopped in a village to enable the Nigerian troops to replenish supplies they also met with local leaders as a courtesy a remotely piloted drone arrived overhead within a couple of minutes of request for help but was unable to carry out airstrikes because it wasn't armed five Nigerian soldiers were also killed the Senate Armed Services Committee received a classified briefing today from the Pentagon and my next guest is a senior member of that committee he is a Republican senator Roger wicker who was with me now senator thank you so so much for the time hello Brooke glad to be with you all right so I know there's a lot you can't say is this was a classified briefing but of the information that you can how can you describe to us what you learned today well I think you have a you've given a pretty good gist of what happened let me just say in a general sense I think we were right to be there and we have some 800 troops in the air about a hundred of them or special operations and and and they are there in the American national interest they're assisted greatly by our French allies and by British allies and what we are doing is trying to prevent this area of Africa from becoming another staging ground out of the training ground for terrorist groups like Boko Haram and al Qaeda so if we want to prevent another 9/11 being staged from a place like Afghanistan we need to be where we are now in Africa and so I think it's a it's an important mission and and we got specific details about this tragedy but also some overall guidance about where we are in the region senator I just jotted down when you said off the top there you said we were we are right to be there do you think we should have a greater presence there based upon what you know well we're going to listen to the generals on that but we're there in a train assist and advise capacity we're not there to have combat troops and clearly if we're fired upon as we were in this situation we're going to engage and defend ourselves but we continue to listen to the top experts in the Pentagon and when they say we need something to get the mission done and prevent terrorism from coming to our shores we'll listen to these generals and give them what they need give our troops what they need senator wicker obviously there are questions and I'm sure you all asked about this this 48 hours later when when sergeant Lee David Johnson's you know body was found you know separated from a team found about a mile away did you get any clarity into why that was no we didn't actually know and that clarity the clarity we got is that the Pentagon acknowledges that that they need to drill down more on that particular question and get back to us get back to the families the the the information that we have indicates that he was killed in that exchange but it wasn't some hours later or some days later but we don't have that information and they are not able to to tell us but I know they they owe it to the the families and to the American people to get better information and expect they will I thought that they were being very forthright with us they told us what they knew and they told us what we we still had questions about still need to dig further we heard from the president yesterday and he addressed this and he said he himself did not specifically authorize this particular mission in Nazaire but that he had given his generals the authority to make these sorts of calls is that at all a concern for you well the this this particular exercise was what was it turned into kinetic activity when they were fired upon but certainly the the commander in chief knows that we have troops in the lake chad area and they and he knows exactly why we're there and what why were there is to fight international terrorism and to protect Americans here in the homeland so that particular event would not have required authorization our our folks were attacked and they fired back and tragedy happened let me also add I heard today and one of the news stations that that these particular Americans were not highly trained and I do want to to make it clear that that is not accurate that these these were Special Operations personnel they they volunteered for the most dangerous type of military action and they were highly trained and they're there all the more honored because they step forward into something very very dangerous absolutely and we thank them and their families for their service I hope we and the families and you get the information that we're all looking for senator wicker appreciate you they owe us some more information and I do think we'll get it keep keep asking for it Thank You senator very much thank you

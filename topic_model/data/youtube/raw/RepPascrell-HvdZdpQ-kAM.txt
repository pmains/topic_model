now by Congress a bill Pascrell of New Jersey Congress are good to have you with us tonight always good to be here is that the big trender is Paul Ryan he is considered the numbers guy and he has been relatively quiet and kind of in the backdrop of all of this but now he has stepped forward and he has made some comments when it comes to abortion and what the deal should actually involve is he just beholdin to the social conservatives well yeah I think he's looking at 2016 and the presidential races a lot of these folks are they have every right to do that the problem here is that we're talking about the debt limit which is going to go on effect in a few days and we're talking about opening up the government and of course they're going to try every string to attach it to whatever we fast I'm glad that Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell are stepping up to the trying to put a package together not complicated something that will take us into 2014 that'll be sensible and that we can have bipartisan support with and I you know what I I feel badly for John Boehner is not a bad person I happen to like them but John's missed it I mean he let these guys and gals get away with everything since 2011 and now he's paying the price so we got the bill in out too well congressman why would the Democrats agreed to something that Mitch McConnell would put his name to after what he has done to President Obama what why would the Democrats say that all of a sudden Mitch McConnell's an honest broker and give Boehner that opportunity when the public is clearly with the Democrats right now you have all the cards the public is clearly with us but we got to get a resolution of the problem adding you know that this as well as I do and even whether a custom Mitch McConnell and whether it comes from mr. Boehner as long as we can do that in not simply talk about saving face but standing on our principles the president and is supported by the Democrats in both the Senate in the house is not going to negotiate the debt deal and he's not going to negotiate whether we have a budget or not we need these things these are necessities then we could debate later on we're not backing off that principle that by any stretch of the imagination kind of deal we talking about here and what kind of numbers are we talking about we're talking about a deal that'll bring us to January both on the debt and the continuing resolution which will be in the number which the Republicans have pushed which we compromised on yes which is the lower deal which includes sequestration between now and then with negotiable parts of that within the next four or five months that's something we can begin to live with as long as we can open up this little Burt government again and never sand not and not agree that sequestration is going to be a game over the next two years well you know congressman this as I see it and I respect your take in a big way you and I have had some good conversations on the radio over this yes if the Democrats do this this opens the door for a fight on the left because obviously we're going to be pushing Democrats to hold the line on the big three and and and not take the cuts in the food stamps not take the cuts to the social programs Medicare Medicaid and Social Security and this buys the Republicans more time to look like they are negotiators in good faith they are not they won't happen what this president out at all costs yeah I watched those clips from yesterday they weren't up to absolute disgrace with the sign in the background impeached the present he just got elected you fools you can you don't know the time of the day and we thank God you have nothing to do with the negotiations will lead that to reasonable people in both parties and I am Telling You ed if we can live with this sequestration for a few more months change it because many Republicans do including chairman Rogers he wants to change it he knows it can't work when you when you're cutting right across the bow and you're cutting everything the same doesn't make any sense well but in order for us to get a deal a clean deal ed we may have to swallow something not as we did with the number that were agreeing on which is less than a trillion dollars this is no you cut the deficit in hand we cut the deficit in half they won't agree with then i can look they're not going to give them a pattern about the president for anything it doesn't matter what it is that he knew and i are going to talk to her blue in the face it ain't going to work well we need to do is reconcile our differences by thursday here's the the best place in my opinion for the democrats there's this thing called the continuing resolution that passed in the senate Boehner has to bring it or they won't do it okay then we default I mean it's on them it's on their party and and this is the way it is I hate to look at it that way but this is because this means that they're going to be able to come back to this point again again and again and do the default do the shot down to get what they want to piecemeal it right back and slowly try to get the American people on their side the only way not only what he's dealing with I think he should have known from the very beginning that there are certain members of his party that are never could agree on anything yeah because if you give them one thing it's not enough to go to the next thing this is performance over the last two and a half years I'm not making this stuff up look at the record no that's true Mitch McConnell not an honest broker not on a record number of filibusters and all of his stated goals politically congressman great to have you with us tonight I appreciate the pleasure thank you sir coming through

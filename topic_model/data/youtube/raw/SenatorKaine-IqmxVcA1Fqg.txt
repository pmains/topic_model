and I rise today to introduce my first bill as a United States Senator it has been delivered to the desk the bill is the true talent Act of 2013 and I'm happy to say that it is co-sponsored by senator Saxby Chambliss and Senator Max Baucus the bill begins with a problem that I know concerns all Americans and it is the unemployment rate of our veterans currently the national unemployment averages at 7.6 percent but the unemployment rate for veterans is nine point four percent that unemployment rate is particularly acute for veterans who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan we can't be comfortable if we see that statistic that our veterans have a higher unemployment rate than the national average it should be otherwise and in Virginia where one in nine of our citizens one in nine of our 8 million citizens from birth to death are veterans this is a particularly acute challenge and frankly it's only going to get worse as more and more people exit military service in the drawdown from Afghanistan what is the reason for the veterans unemployment rate being higher than the national average well some of the reasons have to do with medical challenges and issues that are in the province of the VA but I learned of another reason as I was campaigning across the state for 19 months I heard stories from veterans and they would say the following I I was in the military I was a battlefield medic and I got out of the military and I tried to get a job as a physician's assistant or nurse and I was told I got no credit at all for my military experience as I tried to transition into the civilian world I maintained Navy aviation engines for 20 years and then when I finished and tried to come and do the same thing on the civilian side I was told I had to go back and start as if I'd had no experience in doing this I operated heavy equipment but I was told I would need a commercial driver's license many of the members of our military all of them are gaining skills along the way but they go into a civilian workforce where their skills and talents are not recognized in some ways this is a feature of an all-volunteer military when we had a draft and when men were compelled to serve someone departing military service would go into a workforce and say I was a gunnery sergeant in the Marine Corps or I was an e5 in the Navy and someone in the workforce would know what it was they had done but today only 1% of our adults serve in the military and so so often we appreciate what military members do but we don't understand their technical skills and we don't understand their leadership talent and so that is the genesis for this troop talent Act of 2013 it's to make sure that military members while they are active are getting recognized credentialed credit for the skills they obtain that will help them get immediate traction back into a civilian workforce the troop talent Act has three pillars the first is the credentialing of military members for the skills they obtain and the sharing of information between the military branches about the skills that they have with servicemembers with the private sector and with agencies that would credential you with the civilian credential that's the first pillar credentialing people for the skills they obtain the second pillar is a little bit of a policing function sometimes folks will prey on people leaving the military pay me $500 then I'll administer you a test that will give you a credential but it turns out that credential is worthless it used to be that the VA had a working committee to police these credentials granting agencies to make sure no one was being ripped off that committee no longer is in service this bill would restart it and finally the last thing this bill would do would be to take one particular industry sector information technology where there's huge needs to hire people and where our military members have significant skills and try to accelerate the credentialing in traction for those particularly military members back into the civilian workforce there's a current pilot project that DoD is working on with certain specialties but not IT this would seek to expand the pilot programs to add IT to the list where people are credentialed in conclusion mr. president what I'll say is this this is about doing what the nation should do for our service members and making sure that they can get the traction that they deserve for the service they provided but it's not just about the members themselves it's also about we have invested in our service men and women and they have skills both technical skills and leadership skills that can help our society be more successful to the extent that we do not allow them traction back into civilian life we're not only depriving them we're depriving ourselves of their strengths and talents I'm excited to introduce this introduce this bill and glad to have senators Baucus and Chambliss as co-sponsors and mr. president I yield back the floor

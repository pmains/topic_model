when my boys were young we have two sons Zach and Travis and it was pretty wild two jobs two kids two cars I always said we were fine until the kids got sick and the cars broke down I've known Annie since before a week could remember knowing each other I've known her my whole life family is very important Annie Annie was the kind of mom that absolutely wanted her kids to be involved in activities but she also was really important for Annie that she went back to work we leaned on each other and we leaned on friends that's what moms do you help each other out I can remember rushing to the daycare and trying to pick up my kids on time and that's what I think about every day now it hasn't gotten any easier and I talked to young families about affordable childcare or having access to a job that has benefits or maybe a flexible work schedule I want to make sure that we have high quality affordable childcare across the state I want to make sure that we have great schools where our kids can learn and really grow and thrive and that's my goal every single day you

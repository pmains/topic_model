Maryland the distinguished Democratic whip mr. Hoyer gentleman's recognized for two minutes I thank the gentlelady for yielding initially I want to say that I hope that very soon in a bipartisan way we've been a doc a bill to this floor let me quote what President Trump said hey Trump tweeted that he wanted to quote legalize daca another call to action and further muddled weather where the administration stood what it would do he said we need to come together and do this and we really have no choice now ladies and gentlemen I want to speak about this bill as the chairman knows and as the ranking member knows I served on the Appropriations Committee for 23 years I've taken leave of absence because I'm one of the leaders on our side of the aisle for most of those years we've worked in a bipartisan fashion this is a partisan bill sad and it is not regular order at all regular order is doing one bill after another until you pass the 12 bills in fact I don't think I've ever seen this process done in this fashion when I was the majority leader the first year we passed all 12 bills individually discreetly separately and sent them to the Senate before the August break Hal Rogers the former chairman of this committee said of the President's budget while we have a responsibility to reduce our federal deficit I am disappointed that many of the reductions and eliminations proposed the president's skinny budget are draconian careless and counterproductive I think the same could be applied to the budget that is before us the omnibus appropriation package the house is considering this week is as all of us here recognize all of us recognize the Chairman I have great respect for and I'm not gonna ask him publicly whether he thinks the Senate's gonna adopt any one of these bills but I know his answer one additional minute let me say to my colleagues this is not the way to do it John McCain gave a compelling speech on the floor floor of the United States Senate as he was challenged with a brain tumor and thinking deeply about what we ought to do and he said we need to act together we need to be bipartisan we need to do the people's work in a way they expect us to do it together mr. chairman this bill is not going to get a Democratic vote that's sad it's sad for the house it's sad for the country and it's sad for the people who would be shortchanged by this bill I urge my colleagues to vote no and I urge the majority party to return to the table as surely we will to work in a bipartisan fashion to construct bills that we can all be proud of they will be compromises we won't get all that we want but they will be bills that the American people can be proud of and that this house can be proud of let us return to the bipartisan comedy and respect for one another that's so long prevailed in the Appropriations Committee how sad we have fallen to this place and I yield back the balance of my gentleman's time has expired the gentlelady from New York

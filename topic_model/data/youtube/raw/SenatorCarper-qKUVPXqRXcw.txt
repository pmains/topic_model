among the priority said I'd like to work on in the second half of this Congress i think is while our economy starting to come back we're starting to see jobs begin to be creative again and banks lending money and some of the signs are actually fairly positive we still have high levels of unemployment and I think we're gonna have to continue to focus throughout this year on getting the economy moving faster in a fast enough so that we're creating a lot of the new jobs we can bring down the unemployment rate but even I think one of the keys to to getting the economy moving in the right direction in sending a real positive signal to the businesses large and small as long as to take a critical action two on the healthcare side to rein in the growth of health care costs to improve outcomes to reduce number of people that they're out there without health care coverage within the end costs all of a sudden some money so I think job creation clothes from first of all and doing a very good job one on health care reform legislation I've worked on that all last year like to work on that tour beginning of this year working on it right now another thing that i think would could could be to be helpful it's for for us to do three things that may not make work sense to people with first first glance but we want to put a price on carbon number two to put a price on carbon number three put a price on carbon by that that we mean let's take some steps that good actually enables to reduce our dependence on foreign oil let's help me move our country toward energy independence let's find ways to use relying less on fossil fuels let's try and find a way to to create a stronger economy by I enjoy more people are working to create renewable energies from weathers wind solar geothermal or others to to help build the next generation of nuclear power plants and cars trucks vans use less less energy that sort of they those are in to the extent that we do that in one of the ways to do that is through market mechanism using market forces like we did we reduce to ask a dream to do that to to use to reduce the level of carbon dioxide in our air we can do that without storing our economy we could do that and we're that creates a lot of new jobs let me job opportunities lettering technologies and products that we can export around the world so that will be a real smart thing to do how tax credits that encourage businesses to hire folks so new folks happen to the payroll I think that's probably a good idea and actions to incentivize banks to be lending to businesses not that's large businesses but small business as well and to make sure that people's unemployment benefits are expiring that we don't let them expire entirely until the employment numbers are better and to ensure that people who need up to now be able to eat have access to those and those are losing their health care that they they will buy through Cobra where they paint but I don't know about almost a third of the cost of your health coverage from the previous employer we're going to make sure that doesn't go away over overnight those are some things that we can do too i think that strengthening economy to help reach out and humane kind of way to the people who are suffering already why would otherwise be worse if the lesser unemployment benefits if they loves food stamp benefits they lost ability by their health care coverage through Cobra

thank you chair murray overturning roe versus wade was a historic occasion that signals a new beginning for millions of unborn american babies now the future of saving lives rests with the american people and their elected officials in the states but this work is not finished family planning opportunities need to be expanded and mothers need greater access to services that will support them and their baby throughout and after the pregnancy i'm looking forward to informing the american public why the supreme court's decision is a positive development for our country and setting the medical record straight in the face of non-fact-based pro-abortion fear-mongering i appreciate ranking member bure for yielding me the opportunity to lead this hearing to use my knowledge and background as an ob gyn who delivered a baby nearly every day for 25 years as well as held the hands of hundreds of women suffering miscarriages ectopic pregnancies infertility and life-threatening obstetrical complications having delivered more than 5 000 babies and started and supervised multiple family planning clinics i'd like to dispel several myths that are being heaved at the public myth number one overturning roe is a federal ban on abortion no no that's not true overturning roe actually sends the issue to elected state officials allowing the citizens of each state to address a highly emotional issue via their elected officials nevertheless we will hear this false battle cry multiple times this morning myth two women will not have access to abortion that's not true even the new york times reported after overturning roe abortions will decrease by only 14 percent it's also worth noting that after texas passed its heartbeat law two studies showed that abortions fell around 10 percent after row 27 states and washington dc continue to be largely unaffected while 19 states will have protected limits the other states will most likely fall somewhere there in between myth 3 overturning roe means health care professionals in hospitals cannot treat women with miscarriages ectopic pregnancies or when the mom's life is endangered these are all scare tactics preying on the emotions of people listen every state abortion law triggered by overturning roe includes an exception to save the life of the mother treating miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies are not the same as performing abortions in fact no abortion law in any state in america prevents treatment for women with ectopic pregnancies and or other life-threatening conditions i remember my first year in residency when we were learning about ectopic pregnancy and our motto was to never let the sun set on an ectopic pregnancy that model will be continued throughout america every pro-life physician i know of every physician that i know of including myself has always and will always care for these clinical conditions and there are no laws that prevent such this is a total fabricated myth myth 4 i quote members across the aisle on this month overturning roe is devastating to women's health members will imply today carrying a baby to term is more dangerous than an abortion so using their logic should we abort every baby should we stop all child bearing presenting abortion as the life-saving solution for women facing challenging pregnancies is a warped view of health care it denies the modern medical science that can bring both mother and baby safely through even a high risk pregnancy myth five americans don't support limits on abortion a recent poll from the ap and newark center for public affairs research finds while 61 of americans say abortion should be legal in most or all circumstances in the first trimester of a pregnancy 65 percent said abortion should usually be illegal in the second trimester and 86 said that about the third trimester and from a june mon mouth poll only 36 percent of americans support abortions as always legal while only thirty percent believe it should be legal with limitations myth six many claim that the united states fell behind our international peers on abortion access look only seven nations allow abortions beyond 20 weeks including china and north korea the final myth i'll talk about this morning here's the myth republicans want to end contraception and family planning nothing could be further from the truth in my first year in residency if i delivered several babies that were 13 their moms were 13 years of age i made a commitment to make sure that there was early access to prenatal care for everybody and access to contraception as well regardless of a woman's ability to pay in any community i practice and that's why i set up and volunteered at prenatal family planning clinics and residency and that's why i oversaw three community health centers in rural kansas and accepted all comers to our prenatal clinic and this is why every year we fight for robust funding for community health centers and health departments so what does obstetrical care look like after all we've dispelled many of the myths women with miscarriage and ex-topic pregnancies will be treated in every state without exception life of the mom will continue to be honored and plan b remains over the counter republicans and democrats must work together and continue to fight for more and earlier access to prenatal care and proper nutrition especially in rural and urban settings as well as as well as child care and intending to all the social challenges that i've seen so many times that a young single or married mom faces this is why i co-led the preventing maternal deaths acts of 2018 and more recently worked with everyone here on this committee to pass legislation the maternal health quality improvement act which was also recently signed into law and this is why i lead annual appropriation land letters supporting vital maternal health programs at hhs and the wic program while such centers as the stanton center which you'll soon learn about already outnumber abortion clinics four to one in this country we can and will do more to help such clinics i look forward to bipartisan cooperation to being part of the solution to maternity issues which have all precipitated prior to this supreme court decision finally we recognize family planning and access to contraception will be as important as ever as i have in the past i will continue to support robust funding for community health centers and county health departments like the ones i once volunteered and oversaw thank you madam chair and i yield back thank you we will now

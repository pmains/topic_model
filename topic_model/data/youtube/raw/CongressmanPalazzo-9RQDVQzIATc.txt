thank you mr chairman um minister at lightfoot it's great to see you again congratulations on your retirement thank you for your leadership at nasa and your your decades of services it doesn't go unnoticed and it's very appreciated thank you sir um so i'll just jump straight into it uh my first question is can you please describe how the fixed price programs have encouraged innovation while controlling costs um specifically referencing the cots program yeah so we what we've seen is that through the fixed price processes is we've we've relinquished a little bit of uh our what i would call our control right and but we've also learned from those programs those those folks have come in with new ideas and new ways to approach the the what they're what they're doing for us from a delivery of hardware so we're learning from them but we're also providing them feedback in areas that we haven't we have enough insight and oversight in the process to allow us to actually say okay no that won't work but they've also challenged us on our requirements and so i've seen i've seen learning going both ways and i think that's what's been the most positive thing about it to me is we're we're learning from from some of the what i would call different suppliers than we've had in the past and and they're not i would say they're not constrained by our history in some ways um but we're also able to articulate why our history is what it is and and where we can do that so we've struck a pretty good balance there it's been it's been interesting to see both sides learn from each other i assume nasa found it essential to pursue other ways of having you know because with the limitation of funds and nasa's the flat and stable budget uh you know you had the and we want to focus on deep space and going further and deeper that this was just a natural ascension to for commercial companies to come into low earth orbit yeah we think the public private partnership process is working pretty well for us and think we can extend it but we still have to make sure we have the right level of oversight from our perspective going forward so with uh president trump signing the 2017 transitional authorization nasa act uh has the attitudes or the morale in nasa how would you gauge that as the administrator um because because i kind of feel like the seven years i've been involved in nasa it seems like when there was no mission no road map it was like where are we going it just didn't seem like there was a a lot of motivation and can you tell me now that there is a road map we're putting funding you know into the systems which what you're just your thoughts are what are you seeing yeah i think what i've seen probably the the biggest impact on that congressman is that the national space council and the vice president's engagement obviously the president's engagement but the vice president's engagement has been a tremendous boost to our teams he's been to four of our centers or three of our centers but one of them twice since he's been on board his his he gave us the action nasa the action to do the 45-day study on the lunar plans and that's what's codified in this budget so i would say historically not even in the last seven years but my experience in my 29 years is we do a lot of those kind of studies and plans and they end up on a shelf these guys actually put it in the budget and so that's a pretty exciting thing for us and our teams are from a human space flight side they're rallying around in a big way the aeronautics guys are excited because they've got first big explain they've had in a while so it's it's um i think that the morale is pretty good and people are pretty focused on what we want to go do i think what this plan did um from the administration was really which we provided them and they supported with some you know with their own tweaks along the way was it really provided us this these this kind of road map for what we want to do in the decade of the 2020s that was probably we kind of knew what we did in the 30s is get to mars and we knew what we're doing now with the international space station this really filled a gap for us in terms of defining the mission set that we need to do in the 2020s and so i think people are excited about where we're in yeah that's good that's fantastic i've been reading in the news this week where there seems to be a lot of articles talking about there's probably going to be some form of war and space and in the future and and you know we're constantly struggling and having a defense background form of being on the armed services committee and career reservist and guardsmen you know we know there's near pure competitors are challenging us russia china others maybe not in the civilian space domain even though we do partner with russia a lot on the international space station um going back to the history of nasa was was very vulnerable and theft of secrets compared to other military and scientific agencies um you know there was 2015 langley um chinese uh actu you know a chinese someone was sponsored that and he was had access to a laptop there was the network hacking that we thought the russians and chinese were involved in and so this is you know the the absolute theft of uh our information on satellites rockage engines or our space systems and you know we spend billions of dollars we spend you know the appropriation of billions of dollars and we're putting all this money all the work into it the the brain uh energy and and and then they just come in and steal this stuff and and what we've noticed previously under the prior administrator was that there seemed to be a lacks attitude at some point can you tell me or have we cracked down on that um you know is is the scientists and the nasa employees are they taking this seriously that um you know you we can't let laptops walk out of the buildings and aims or langley and places like that yeah i think i think we've got we've had a pretty good campaign internal to the agency about those threats and about the protection of that um when when the situation occurred in 2015 we brought in napa to do an assessment for us uh on our foreign national access program for instance um and we learned a lot from that we're still implementing some of those recommendations it was like a you know we had to you had it was kind of sequential you couldn't do them all at once so you had to get this done then you could do it and we're about done meeting all those and we've met all the milestones required in the cyber world our teams are working really hard our cio we actually increased the budget for that this year in our 2019 submit to try to try to help make sure we've got all the tools in place we need to know when we're being when we have the potential uh releases that the challenge honestly for us is culturally in 1958 we were stood up as a wide open share everything organization if you read the space act it's supposed to be civilian and share and so we've we but we've had a lot of we've had a lot of progress in that area because we had to we had to right when 1958 nobody thought this was the kind of thing we'd be we'd be dealing with um but but yeah we've had a lot of progress there and i think we're making i think our cio's making great progress i've also stood up what's called an enterprise protection program inside the agency which looks at ground systems the integration of ground systems flight systems and and the potential threats to those so that we have a way of uh managing and we work with other government agencies to understand the threats that we might not know because we're not again we're a civilian agency but we work very closely with other agencies to understand threats to our systems here on the ground but also in space and in the air thank you administrator thank you mr chairman i yield back

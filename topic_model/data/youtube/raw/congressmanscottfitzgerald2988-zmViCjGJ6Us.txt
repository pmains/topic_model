this kind of goes in line with some of the other amendments that we've already considered here this afternoon so obviously what's happening down at the border is that a crisis point has been for some time uh but along with that is obviously the oipi opioid epidemic and um i know that many members when you've been down there if you specifically if you talk to homeland security i mean they can tell you just how many drugs are coming across but i introduced a bill last year that would designate fentanyl as a schedule one drug which in my estimation closes the loophole in current law and as most of us do we have a strong record with with on veterans issues but it seems that the bill targets continues to target kind of sympathetic populations and what this would ultimately do is erode the ability for law enforcement to get a handle on immigration right so uh this part and let me i just wanted to go back to something that we were talking about earlier because i think there was a question as to you know how do non-citizens uh end up in the military so uh to join the u.s military non-citizens must be living permanently and legally united states non-citizens must also have permission to work in the united states which means you possess an i-551 permanent residence card and you have to have a high school diploma and you have to speak english i think all those requirements are up to date uh so there's there's kind of this group that's been carved out i think and we're going back to kind of should secretary mayorkus have this magic wand and suddenly say that um those otherwise be that would be removed for obvious reasons because they've committed some type of crime and specifically the one that this amendment addresses is trafficking fentanyl that that there would not be a way for them to simply say just ignore all that and uh and move forward so this amendment would prevent both the advisory committee from blocking removal of these convicted of drug crimes as well as granting uh green cards to illegal aliens so let me and let me summarize even further so the the amendment um quote the illicit trafficking in a controlled substance what you'd be doing is adding this to the list of crimes for which a deported veteran cannot receive a green card from the dhs secretary and preclude the advisory committee for making a recommendation for an exercise of discretion from the advisory committee for the same offense the other thing i just want to mention is because i think honorable discharge and general discharge have been thrown around a lot today as well you know for somebody that's been discharged because they would not take the vaccine for them to get a general discharge the only other place that it's commonly used that i'm aware of is if you've got somebody that a kid that signs up and joins the army and then within a two week three week period they realize that suddenly it's not a good fit this kid's not a good fit for the army the army agrees it's this kid's not a good fit and they just give a general discharge because you know no harm no fault everybody just kind of goes on their own way but when you take a veteran you take somebody that's served honorably for like mr roy said example 19 years i mean high ranking and has probably been deployed and then you simply say to them oh by the way we're going to give you a general discharge that is a slap in the face it's a slap in the face i don't care how you frame it up it's something that that obviously should never happen and i think that's what's really sorry i'm getting off of the topic of the amount a little bit but that's that's what's really irritating i think to many of these individuals that have served honorably as well as their families is that you literally have left them out in the cold and it's something that needs to be addressed my office is inundated still with emails from these individuals that are currently being separated as we sit here today and it's something that should be addressed and i wish the majority would take it more seriously so and i yield back

joining us to react we welcome kansas congressman tracy mann uh congressman thanks so much for taking the time i see you shaking your head clearly upsetting allegations made by the texas governor here uh what are your thoughts on what's happening at these facilities and maybe the reason why you believe we are dealing with the crisis at our southern border right now outrageous heartbreaking i just returned last night from the southern border related delegation was some other freshman down to mcallen texas um this is a disaster this is a humanitarian crisis there's some pictures from our trip you know this is the result of biden and harris's open border policies this is disastrous uh we learned a lot about sexual abuse of these migrant children all the way from the southern border of mexico as they're traveling through done by the cartels they're the cartels are making hundreds of millions of dollars on our open border policies the mexican cartels are the winners innocent children are the losers this is absolutely the wrong policy needs to end now yeah as you say innocent children and you think about the journey that these kids have had to make of course uh you know parents wouldn't send their kids alone through the desert unless they thought they would be taken care of in the united states and as you say sort of the promises that were made along the campaign trail might lead to that but keep that in mind because we are hearing now from house speaker nancy pelosi saying uh this about how the way situation at the southern border is being handled listen we're on a good path at the border under leadership of joe biden president biden there is it's about it's about restructuring how we do what is happening there because we were in a very bad situation under the trump administration where do you think she's getting that idea you you visited the border is it on a good path a different planet i mean we were i was there yesterday i looked in the eyes of these kids this policy is disastrous um the speaker needs to wake up the administration needs to wake up to how we are hurting these children i saw them i talked to them i heard about their sexual abuse as they're traveling through mexico she's either turning a blind eye or is misinformed either way it's bad for america our country should be the shining city of a hill on the hill and a beacon of freedom to the world but these open border policies are declining our nation this is not who we are um she needs to go and see it firsthand as does president biden as his vice president harris they need to understand and get real about this issue yeah we know they haven't made a trip quite yet waiting to see if perhaps they will especially uh the so-called borders are kamala harris who has been appointed to oversee it still not taking a trip but but you know before we get to that specifically too we're also hearing that the government is forcing so-called sanctuary cities to now cooperate with ice potentially to handle the overflow the surge that we're seeing at the border but this does make you wonder if perhaps this would expand the crisis not just to border states but all states with sanctuary cities within our country is that how you see it every city should be cooperating with ice they're here to protect us what needs to happen are three things number one we need to end these disastrous open border policies that again are enriching the cartels that are hurting innocent children number two we need to secure the border uh it's ridiculous that that the border construction the wall system construction has stopped for no reason other than politics and number three we need to work to develop a legal immigration system i'm for illegal immigration we need workers for agriculture and other industries but these disastrous open border policies need to end and they need to end now we've heard previously from members of the biden administration sort of explain what we're seeing the surge at the border right now blaming it on the prior administration trump's policies also saying perhaps that it's a cyclical trend the fact that we see surges and dips uh you're shaking your head again clearly that's not how you see it when you're there and you talk to these kids the trip um takes from honduras guatemala around 28 30 days um they said that they a lot of them saw facebook ads from the cartels saying if they come to america they can get in it is absolutely not true um that that this is a result of the last administration we did not have this crisis um in early january this crisis is here now and it's getting worse and it's because of the failed policies and signaling and messaging from president biden vice president harris uh this open border policy is disastrous it's caused a human crisis they need to acknowledge their mistake for what it is and work to fix it i want to just bring in partially some of our our top news of the day we're awaiting an announcement from the president on executive orders regarding guns um again this is coming at a time where you're saying we're dealing with the current crisis at the border talk to me about the timing of again this executive action we're waiting to come through and also um you know the priorities that we're seeing from the fight into the community we're seeing the wrong priorities these executive orders you know the bite administration has issued more executive orders their first few days in office than the last seven presidents combined i released legislation they would put a waiting period on all of these executive orders what they're getting ready to do today now they're weakening our second amendment while they're weakening our borders why they're stretching them why they are strengthening the mexican cartels and hurting innocent kids these policies make no sense as congressman tracy mann of kansas joining us here on national report congressman we appreciate it thanks so much thanks for taking interest in these issues you got it

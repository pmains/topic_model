I'm Ken Calvert and I approve this message What will happen if Will Rollins is elected? Will Rollins' policies would make gas even more expensive. Grocery prices would go up. With inflation soaring, we can't afford Will Rollins' polices Will Rollin's policies would drive up the cost of everything.  Will Rollins says he would support $1 trillion in tax hikes on workers and businesses.  That's crazy! Will Rollins is endorsed by an organization that wants to raise property taxes by $12 billion per year. Will Rollins is wrong for us.

good afternoon everyone and thank you for tuning in for those of you who may be new to our facebook live discussions i'm congresswoman laurie trahan and over the past several months i've been hosting discussions like the one we're about to have on a wide array of issues important to folks across the third district these discussions are designed to arm you and your family with information from trusted experts about the pandemic and the economic fallout from it if you've joined one of our previous telephone town halls or watched or read any major news outlet reporting on covid then there is a very good chance that you'll recognize our distinguished guest today dr ashish ja it's wonderful to have him once again share his insight and the latest news about the public health response including the new vaccine for covet 19 as well as what we can expect in the coming weeks and months as many of you know the food and drug administration recently approved the pfizer vaccine for emergency use and as of monday frontline medical workers and the most vulnerable in our communities have already started to get vaccinated i'd be remiss if i didn't take a moment to commend the workers at pfizer's facility here in the third district at andover they've been working around the clock to help get us to this point so thank you for everything you've done and continue to do the fda is also considering an emergency use authorization for another company with bay state ties moderna headquartered in cambridge modena's vaccine should receive a decision from the fda about a possible emergency use authorization status any day now now i've been getting a lot of questions over the past couple of weeks about how the fda can be sure that these vaccines are going to be safe after being developed under these unprecedented timelines as well as what the current distribution plan means for us here in massachusetts everyone is wondering when we'll be able to return to something that feels familiar and normal now i'm no expert on infectious diseases or nor am i a physician but we're fortunate to have one of the best there is someone i'm proud to call a friend with us today he's here to answer some of the most frequently asked questions about the vaccine and what all of the recent developments mean for communities here in the commonwealth so without further ado i'll introduce our expert guests dr john is the dean of brown university school of public health and a practicing physician recognized globally for his groundbreaking research on ebola and as an expert on pandemic preparedness and response as well as on health policy research and practice before becoming dean of the school of public health at brown in september doctor zhao was the director of the harvard global health institute the kt lee professor of global health at the harvard t.h chen school of public health and a general internist at the west roxbury va today dr ja is leading the charge on the front lines of the coven 19 pandemic advising federal and state policy makers on our response while also leading national and international analysis of key issues that have emerged as a result of the outbreak dr ja thank you so much for being here congresswoman thank you for having me back i always uh love being on with you and love the questions that people in your district throw at us so i'm excited to be here well everyone's craving answers and i know we don't have you for too long so let's jump right into the questions you know we've been hearing a lot of concerns about how quickly these vaccines were developed and their authorization for emergency approval by the fda and i think it would be helpful to understand what this entire process entails would you mind just explaining the steps that companies like pfizer and modernity have to take to get these approved and what the fda is looking at and weighing when they consider approving emergency usage of these vaccines yes absolutely and and this is a question that i get a lot people say well how if a typical vaccine might take three or five years to develop how did we do this so fast and did we cut any corners i'll give you the short answer the answer is we did not cut any corners but let's talk about what a typical development process might be might be somebody comes up with a vaccine idea we might go test it in animals first then you have to start human trials there are three phases of human trials each of them is expensive takes a long time to recruit and it ends up taking as i said three to five years for a typical vaccine sometimes longer now why we were able to do this so much faster so if you think about it human trials and three phases of clinical trials we did all of them there was not a single step that was skipped in fact the phase three clinical trial that we've done for the pfizer vaccine and the median vaccine are these huge trials that would take years to just to recruit people but because we've had so much volunteer effort of people who want who are willing to be recruited for these clinical trials who signed up for the clinical trials we were able to recruit people very very quickly that made a huge difference on timing and so these clinical trials that we have done are actually bigger than most of the clinical trials from most vaccines so we have more data going into this than most and then of course fda has made this priority number one for review so a typical you put in an application six months later fda might review it get back to you none of that is happening right the moment the application went in 150 fda staff working 24 7 reviewing all the data to get us to an authorization so the good news here is every single safety check has been there we've done them it's been done well i have to tell you i cannot believe how well these vaccines are turning out in terms of both safety and effectiveness we've gone fast because it's an emergency and we want to go fast well that's definitely reassuring uh to hear you describe the expedited timeline and you know so many of us have seen the photos and watched the videos of nurses and doctors getting vaccinated already this week i mean it's so uplifting to see our heroes on the front lines get the vaccine and many are just wondering what the timeline is going to be for the distribution on a massive scale who will have access to the vaccine after our frontline workers uh governor baker has estimated that vaccines will tentatively be available to the general public starting in april um can you just explain why it's so important that we prioritize different groups having access earlier than others and and what challenges we could experience in the coming weeks and months when it comes to the distribution of the vaccine yeah absolutely so um basically i believe that by next week we'll have two vaccines i do think the moderna vaccine is going to get an authorization from the fda don't know for sure but that's my expectation because the data looks really good and what will happen is for the rest of december and into probably the first half of january it's going to be healthcare workers and it's going to be nursing home or long-term care facility residents and workers um why those two healthcare workers we need them safe and protected and we also want to make sure they don't spread it to other people and then obviously long-term care facilities are where so many of the deaths have happened and if in order to save lives i think prioritizing them is really important then the the bucket sort of opens up a bit more we go to other essential workers front-line folks uh police officers emts firefighters um you know other essential workers and then also other high-risk individuals people who are older with chronic diseases every state is going to make these decisions a little bit differently but the goal will be to try to get both essential workers and high-risk individuals a you're trying to slow the spread b you're trying to protect lives and you want to try to do both my take is those groups get us well into february probably into early march these companies are making as much vaccine as they can but they can only go so fast and we want to make sure obviously we're doing it well there is a bit of a game changer possibility here which is our two other vaccines astrazeneca and johnson johnson which will probably get reviewed by the fda in the second half of january if those go well let's say the data looks good and they get approved then we actually may have four vaccines as we head into february or march and then i can imagine the general public having access to vaccines possibly by the end of march so somewhere between end of march and end of april is when i think people at normal risk would be able to get the vaccine earlier end if we have more vaccines obviously later end if those two new ones don't end up coming online wow well then we all know what we should be uh you know wishing for when we have the opportunity uh and there's you know always take this uh as an opportunity to say that we're not out of the woods just because folks are in the process of taking the vaccine and still you know the most important thing that we can do for our medical professionals who are serving on the front line uh tirelessly is to continue doing what we have been doing since march and that's wearing the mask staying socially distant washing our hands staying home uh when possible uh it's it's so important until we're you know until we actually do round the corner and and put this behind us you know uh dr jar you testified before the house education and labor committee a few months back uh and when i had the opportunity to ask you questions we discussed the dangers of misinformation and disinformation campaigns surrounding covid19 now it seems like similar uh attempts to spread disinformation about the the virus are are teaming up with the anti-vaccine movement that's led some to make preposterous claims about other tried and tested vaccines like flu shots and polio vaccines i think folks would appreciate hearing from you uh about some of the most common false claims about vaccines and what we should all be wary of when we're when we're seeing those claims on on our social media feeds absolutely so let's start off a bit just talking about more generally why vaccines kind of engender this kind of stuff obviously we always want to be extra careful with vaccines because we're giving vaccines to healthy people and the because we give vaccines to healthy people the scientific process by which we develop vaccines actually has to meet a much much higher bar than the development of regular therapies because we're giving it to healthy people we're giving it to children and so the rigorousness with which scientific you know kind of development of vaccines happens is unlike anything else we do just the sheer level of review the examination of the data and vaccines have been lifesaving i mean they really are if you think about all the childhood illnesses we don't talk about we don't talk about polio and we don't talk about measles very much we only talk about it when vaccination rates fall below a certain level so vaccines work and they're incredibly helpful and and i of course have always gotten my children vaccinated uh along the the vaccination schedule the problem is anytime there's a new vaccine there's a small group of people who for whatever reason their anxiety their issues like to try to stir up a lot of confusion i've been getting a lot of confusing uh messages and questions about you know the mrna vaccine these pfizer and modern vaccines are they going to somehow reprogram your genetic code so let me tell you about the mrna the little bit of genetic material uh that goes in the vaccine your any one of your cells makes five to seven thousand of these mrnas at any given moment these are ubiquitous throughout your entire body it's how your body translates its genetic code into proteins this is not going to get into your genetic code it can't these mrna things that are going into the vaccine for short periods of time will get your body to make a protein that will elicit an immune response that's all it's doing and we've seen it now from the data it's very very safe these were developed by scientists uh here at nih in germany like these are all um the pfizer vaccine the main scientific work was done in uh in um in germany the the moderna vaccine was done right here uh in cambridge by scientists say you know and so i am looking at the data i find it exceedingly safe and my general approach to people who come up with these kind of uh theories of you know is this gonna uh do some harm or is it some there's some nefarious agenda is to just talk to people openly and honestly about what we know and we don't know and i feel personally very confident about these vaccines i plan to get vaccinated as soon as it's my turn i have planned to get my elderly parents vaccinated and i encourage all of you when it's your turn to get vaccinated yes and i think that's a very important message and i'm sure part of uh you know a campaign um you know as we head into the the next phases is get your parents vaccinated i know that my parents we haven't spent a holiday with them uh since march and this christmas is you know especially tough i think for families and so uh they'll be you know first in line when it's their turn and uh and i will too with uh with my children so uh we obviously have so much work ahead of us to make sure that everyone has access uh to the vaccine and there's no question that it will continue to require partnerships at the federal state and local levels you know as you know we're still in the thick of negotiations over additional relief although i just landed in washington and hope to be voting on uh this package very soon i'm a firm believer that additional federal funding for vaccine distribution should be part of the final package and it looks as though it is but more than that we also need to reach a resolution that delivers additional aid to local governments so that they can do their part to help get people vaccinated much like they currently do with flu shots can you speak to the importance of continued federal investments in vaccine distribution but also in empowering our local governments to make it as easy as possible for folks to get the vaccine once it is widely available yeah absolutely so i think federal relief right now is actually pretty critical in lots of different ways you know you see governors and mayors having to make these very difficult choices of what do they do with businesses and can they afford to shut down businesses because infection levels are so high but if they shut down those businesses workers and small business owners lose their livelihoods again i think that's the kind of place where we need congress to step in one of the key things people need to understand is we're not going to be in this very difficult period forever really the next six to eight weeks are going to be the hardest weeks of the pandemic things will start getting better as we get into february and march we need to really make sure we're providing relief for the next three four months and then things will really kind of start getting back to much more of a sense of normal in terms of funding for vaccine distribution i mean my gosh if you think about all the incredible work that's gone on you know the the old line that i like to say you know vaccines don't save lives vaccinations do the scientists have built the vaccines that's great now we got to figure out how to get it into people's arms it's a huge logistical challenge at the federal level certainly but states they they get the vaccine they've got to get it out to cvs's and walmart and walgreens and all these other places and doctors offices and there's a ton of work that needs to go into that we have to put in particular a campaign to educate people like this is not the stuff to skimp on right like we've got to spend the money to make sure that happens because that's how we get our that's how we save lives and that's how we get our economy back so i think it's an incredibly important investment that will pay for itself you know many hundreds of times over and i'm glad to see congress doing it yes there's uh there's no question um that everybody wants to talk about stimulus and recovery um but the path to that is uh containing uh and getting vaccinated and coming out of uh the woods if you will um you know dr ja that was my last question um and i it's so great you know to have you as an expert answering these tough thorny questions for folks who are tuning in but if you feel like there's anything else that we haven't discussed yet today that folks should know i want to be sure to give you the opportunity before we before we end our our precious moment with you well let me just take a minute to talk about this moment wherein um congresswoman we are heading into the holidays this is obviously a really important and special time of the year for everybody no matter which faith uh of which faith you are what you celebrate this is a really really important moment and and we usually tend to spend these days with our families our extended families and our friends and just like thanksgiving i am again foregoing the opportunity to spend the holidays with my elderly parents and my brother and my extended family and same on my wife's side and we're doing this because things are really bad right now in terms of the pandemic the level of infection in the community the spread is very bad and here's the point we want to protect people now because anybody we protect now is going to be around to get a vaccine in four weeks or eight weeks or 12 weeks so we're so close to the finish line and what i've been asking everybody including friends and family who call me and say well can i just go do this i'm tired of waiting it's been such a terrible year i get it we're right at the finish line and what i ask all of you is hang tough wear your mask avoid gatherings including family gatherings at the holidays which is like makes me feel like a grinch saying it but i promise that the upside will be you'll get through it you'll get through it safely and we'll all have a much much better 2021 and i think that is something to look forward to so congresswoman thank you again for your leadership in washington in all that you've done and for the opportunity to speak uh with you throughout this whole year and i hope we get to do more together in 21. oh same here i mean look you you all heard it straight from the doctor himself uh you know the develop the development of this vaccine is a huge step forward uh in the fight against this virus and it's something for all of us to be very optimistic about but we still have a long way to go until we're out of the woods and that that does mean uh that no matter how tired we are of this we have to continue behaving responsibly and doing our part to stop the spread of this virus and it's up to it's up to each of us uh to keep ourselves and others in our community safe uh dr jab your generosity in sharing your expertise with all of us is uh it's a gift and i know that everyone watching deeply appreciates your willingness to take time to share your insights uh with us so i just want to i want to thank you and i want to thank everyone who tuned in you know staying informed and taking all the precautions are still the best tools we have to prevent the spread of covet 19. so please keep doing what you're doing wear your mask maintain a safe social distance from others make sure you're washing your hands regularly you know i know it's tough but please um you know have a smaller celebration than normal with just your immediate family and those informal gatherings uh we know how dangerous they are in the spread of this virus so forego them please one more one more time and finally as you spend time on social media please continue to be wary of misinformation in your feeds and on your timelines depending on what folks are saying the implications of sharing posts with bad information it could be fatal especially in the middle of this pandemic so your vigilance online is just as important as it is uh when you leave your home for a trip to the grocery store or pick up uh dinner uh when you support your favorite local restaurant so i'll i'll leave you the three words these three words when it comes to your social media feeds consider the source uh so thank you all again for tuning in this afternoon thank you dr ja i hope you all have a wonderful holiday season stay safe stay healthy and stay home if you can thank you thank you bye

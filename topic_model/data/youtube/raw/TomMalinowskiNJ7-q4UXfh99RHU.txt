democratic congressman tom malinowski a member of the house foreign affairs and homeland security committees and former assistant secretary of state for democracy human rights and labor it's so good to see you congressman we just learned the house is going to get a classified briefing from the president's national security team later this afternoon what are your big questions right now look i i think the administration is doing everything that any of us could have uh could have asked for and it's quite inspiring the ukrainians are fighting with the weapons that we have been able to give them they are being supported by a nato alliance that the united states rallied to their side far beyond anything i might have expected with with switzerland uh joining in with with even the most recalcitrant members of the european union supporting the the harshest possible uh sanctions um we're going to want to know about uh the the the flow of weapons to the ukrainians how that is proceeding obviously we can't fly them into kev in the way that we might have before what are you hearing right now how much is that being hampered and how concerned are you about that well i it you know the the the evidence of what's happening on the ground suggests to me that we are getting uh to the ukrainians what they need and not just the united states but our european allies and it's extraordinary that that europeans are willing uh to uh to give them fighter jets right now no one would have imagined that a week ago and that is a product number one of the evil of this invasion but also really good american diplomacy over the last several weeks to build this coalition so i'm very curious what you think when you hear and i'm sure you saw a lot of the coverage over the weekend where we saw people huddled in bunkers people in underground train stations uh folks who are trying as we just saw with kelly kobie are desperately trying to get on trains people trying to get out of the country and begging the united states begging the west for more help to you what more can the u.s do what more can the international community do when they ask for more help what does that look like right now you know there are some people who talk about a no-fly zone and i'm not sure if they understand that that would mean direct military conflict between the united states and russia which i don't think would be in our interest or even in ukraine's interest in in the long run the sanctions sanctions move more slowly than tanks but these are the harshest sanctions that have ever been imposed on any other country by the united states and our allies if the ukrainians can continue to hold out that gives the sanctions time not just to change public opinion in russia but just as important to to practically materially diminish the the putin regime's capacity to hold on and to keep fighting and and right now the ukrainians are doing their part they are giving us time uh to allow these sanctions to to take effect and we can help them by continuing to give them the types of weapons they can actually use the anti-tank weapons that a single infantry soldier in the forest can use to take out a tank the stinger missiles that again a single infantry soldier can use to take out a helicopter or plane that stuff is making a difference so we got to stay the course but also be ready for this to continue to be and in fact to get even worse for the ukrainian people that is the part that worries me that when putin is frustrated on the battlefield as he is right now he may resort to increasingly ruthless measures targeting civilians targeting the cities that he is unable to take by force so we have to steal ourselves for that as well congressman tom malinowski thank you so much for your time sir appreciate it and still ahead

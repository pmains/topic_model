O  OPPOSE  THE AMENDMENT AND TO COMMEND THE CHAIR FOR INCLUDING IN THE  P.R.O. ACT PROVISIONS THAT WILL  END THE FREE RIDER PROBLEM  CAUSED BY SO-CALLED  RIGHT-TO-WORK STATES. RIGHT-TO-WORK PROVISIONS  UNDERMINE THE RIGHT TO UNIONIZE, BECAUSE OUR BASIC LABOR LAW  REQUIRES UNIONS TO REPRESENT  THOSE IN THE BARGAINING UNIT AND EVERYONE IN THE BARGAINING UNIT  BENEFITS EVERYONE IN THE  CONTRACT. IF YOU SAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO  JOIN, YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY THE  UNION DUES, YOU DON'T HAVE TO  PAY A FEE AND YOU STILL GET ALL  THE BENEFITS, THEN RIGHT-TO-WORK IS REALLY CODE TO  RIGHT-TO-FREE-RIDE. STATES WITH SO-CALLED  RIGHT-TO-WORK LAWS HAVE HALF THE UNIONIZATION RATES THAN OTHER  STATES. DOESN'T JUST HURT THOSE THAT ARE IN A UNION, BECAUSE IT HURTS  EVERY WAGE EARNER IN THE WHOLE  STATE. AVERAGE WAGES DECLINE. THAT'S WHY AVERAGE WAGES IN  RIGHT-TO-WORK STATES ARE 87%  LESS THAN OTHER STATES. IT DOESN'T AFFECT THAT STATE. IT AFFECTS OTHER STATES WHO  ADOPT RIGHT-TO-WORK LAWS IN THE  RACE TO BOTTOM AS THEY FIGHT FOR BUSINESSES. IT EVEN HURTS US IN CALIFORNIA  WHERE WE HAVE TO COMPETE WITH  LOW WAGES -- LOW-WAGE EMPLOYERS  IN ANTI-UNION STATES. I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS  PROBLEM FOR DECADES. THAT'S WHY I INTRODUCED THE  NATIONWIDE RIGHT-TO-UNIONIZE ACT IN THE 110th CONGRESS, 111th,  112th, 113th, 114th, AND NOW THE 115th CONGRESS, WITH DOZENS OF  CO-SPONSORS. I WAS JOINED BY SENATOR WARREN. WE INTRODUCED OUR BILLS WITH 30  ORIGINAL CO-SPONSORS AND THE  SENATE WITH 16. THE P.R.O. ACT IS TO BE  COMMENDED BECAUSE IT SOLVES THIS FREE RIGHTER PROBLEM. WE HAD THE STATE DEPARTMENT  TESTIFY BEFORE MY SUBCOMMITTEE  OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS THAT  RIGHT-TO-WORK LAWS OR SO-CALLED  RIGHT-TO-WORK LAWS ARE A  VIOLATION OF THE U.N.  DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS  BECAUSE THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE IS A HUMAN RIGHT AND RIGHT-TO-WORK  LAWS MAKE A MOCKERY OF THAT  RIGHT. I ALSO RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THE AMENDMENT WE'RE GOING TO BE  DEALING WITH, NUMBER 10, BY MR.  MEADOWS, WHICH IS A  SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTITY --  IDENTICAL WHAT WE'RE CONSIDERING NOW. THE RULES COMMITTEE IN AN EFFORT TO BE INCREDIBLY BIPARTISAN HAS  ALLOWED TWO SUBSTANTIVELY  IDENTICAL AMENDMENTS TO BE  INTRODUCED IN THE HOUSE. THEY ARE BOTH EQUALLY  REPREHENSIBLE. DEFEAT THIS AMENDMENT. PASS THE BILL. END THE RACE TO THE BOTTOM. AND RAISE WAGES NATIONWIDE. A COUNTRY WHICH EVEN LAST YEAR  SAW WAGES RISE JUST 1% MORE THAN INFLATION NEEDS UNIONS. WE NEED THE RIGHT

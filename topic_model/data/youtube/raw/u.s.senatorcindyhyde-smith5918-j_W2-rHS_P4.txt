christmas is a joyous occasion as families and loved ones gather for the holidays this year i hope it is especially joyful for those who weren't able to gather safely last year because of the pandemic as christians we come together to celebrate the birth of our savior jesus christ jesus teaches us to live our lives full of grace love and compassion all of which reflect the true spirit of christmas it is in this spirit that we recommit ourselves to care for those in need and to share our many blessings with our neighbors we also know we would not be enjoying so many blessings if it weren't not for the brave men and women in uniform many of whom are sacrificing their own holidays to keep our nation safe i pray for them and their families and in this holiday season we must express our incredible gratitude to first responders and health care workers who remain steadfast in their dedication to our protection and care i hope all mississippians will enjoy a warm and safe christmas enriched with festive traditions and surrounded by loved ones i wish you and yours god's continued blessings merry christmas

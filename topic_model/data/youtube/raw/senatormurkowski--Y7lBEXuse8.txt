so there is nothing better than being home in alaska whether it's coming home to fairbanks a community that i grew up in went to high school here family home is still here whether it's down in anchorage where vern and i raised our boys or whether it's down in southeast where i was born and spent all of my early growing up years i have such a depth of love and a compassion for this extraordinary place and it is where where i come home to just be lisa washington dc is an important place to do business but it is not it's not my home my home my home is here and that's why it's so important to come home to come home frequently to come home to be with people in their homes in their place to see exactly what is on their mind what is motivating with them what is what is energizing them what is making them frustrated and and then taking that from the people that i love and the place that i call home taking that back to my work in washington to try to do good for alaska so there's no place like home and that's alaska [Music] you

hybrid hearing of the Senate subcommittee on Securities insurance and investment will come to order thank you for being here today a few reminders before we begin for those who are participating virtually once you start speaking there will be a slight delay before you are displayed on the screen so don't get terrorized thinking we won't see you we will also to minimize any background noise please make sure you remain muted until it's your turn to speak now turning now to the subject of today's hearing we are here because our economy has a fundamental problem across Corporate America those in charge are overwhelmingly white and disproportionately male in a recent analysis of over 3 000 United States firms listed on either the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ researchers at Cornell found that racial minorities held only about 12 percent of board seats in 2019 with over 40 percent of all U.S boards composed of only white directors in Asset Management we see a similar story of the 70 trillion dollars in Global Financial assets under management less than one percent are managed by women or minority owned firms now some may wonder why is this a problem why should the federal government have an interest in the diversity of publicly traded companies the answer to me is simple it's because it is material information that investors should have when deciding where to put the money and in study after study including those conducted by the consulting firm McKinsey researchers have found that a diverse Workforce leads to a more productive and profitable company the reasons for this are varied but whether it's because of smarter and more inclusive decision making increase creativity and problem solving or greater Recruitment and Retention the bottom line is this a company whose governing structure looks like America is a company that can compete on the global market which brings us to this hearing the current lack of diversity in capital markets businesses and financial institutions creates a ripple effect across the financial ecosystem it negatively affects entrepreneurs and investors makes companies less competitive installs our nation's progress towards a truly Equitable Marketplace in short a lack of diversity diversity means that American companies are fighting to compete with one hind tied behind their backs it's an issue that I have been personally following for years and in the past my office has issued corporate diversity surveys of Fortune 100 companies and what we have found is that while many of these companies believe in the idea of increasing diversity among their senior leadership very few have made any real progress on the matter that's why I introduced the bill the improving corporate governance through diversity Act of 2021 my legislation would promote greater transparency in Corporate America by requiring public companies to disclose specific information related to the racial gender ethnic makeup and Veteran status of corporate boards and Senior Management and whether they have policy in place to promote diversity in their leadership it's a bill that I'm proud to say has strong support across the ideological Spectrum from the U.S Chamber of Commerce to the National Urban League and it goes hand in hand with what sec's asset management advisory committee has urged the asset management industry to adopt the AMAC subcommittee on diversity and inclusion is pushed for greater disclosure of the gender and racial makeup firms this increased transparency would not only improve performance to the benefit of investors it would also further the sec's diversity and inclusion goals and its mandate to facilitate fair and open markets it's my hope that the SEC soon enacts all of these recommendations and that we can pass by improving corporate governance through diversity act lastly I'd just like to note what greater diversity means for investors and entrepreneurs in minority communities I say this because I know it's of particular interest to both ranking member Scott and myself the fact of the matter is that underrepresentation has a trickle-down effect when corporate leadership at the top does not diverse unsurprisingly the firms that manage their pensions are also not diverse when corporate leadership only reflects one thin slice of the population their decisions will only benefit one slice of the population and despite contributing trillions of dollars to the economy being among the most likely to start a small business many minorities across the country still lack access to the capital they need to thrive we all saw this firsthand during covid when minority business owners struggled to access the PPP program so the goal of today's hearing is to explore these issues further to discuss solutions that work for women and minority communities who are too often neglected by traditional financial services and in the capital markets and with that I want to thank our Witnesses for appearing for sharing their testimony with it today and I'm pleased to turn over now for his remarks to my friend the distinguished ranking member Senator Scott for his opening remark

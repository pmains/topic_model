let's talk about inflation uh we just got some new numbers out uh this week any relief in sight no and and it's similar to energy fred there's there's no there's no plan there's no strategy coming out of the white house right now which is which is really unfortunate i have i have never in my lifetime seen uh just as a white house uh cabinet officials that appear so wholly unprepared for the jobs that they're in uh this is just it is amazing to me we've got worker shortage issues you've got millions of americans that still haven't returned to work the workforce participation rates well below where it needs to be in excess of four million workers haven't returned to the workforce 11 million jobs open available right now the supply chain problem there is nothing going on out of this administration trying to address some supply chain issues if we haven't learned anything from this putin invasion of ukraine we've got to have a secure supply chain we've got to produce more things domestically we cannot rely upon china and some of these other countries that are always going to do things in their own self-interest this is these are huge mistakes and unfortunately we're seeing president biden just double and triple down on these bad policies that we should have reversed uh long ago and and so i think one of the major contributing factors to inflation is what's going on in energy look it doesn't matter if you're a retiree if you're a high schooler driving yourself to school it doesn't matter if you're ordering things off of a mail order or through the internet every single one of those if you're if you're getting on an airplane if you're getting on a train all of these things are affected by the higher energy prices and this is one of those things that really just reverberates through the economy no matter what sector you're in we've got to get energy prices under control and by continuing to stop shut down prevent domestic oil and gas production and shutting down mines and other things that are producing minerals for for renewable energy production this administration's energy policy is no to everything and and the prices you're seeing today is exactly what happens when you carry out these flag strategies and of course the major influence on why we're seeing record inflation

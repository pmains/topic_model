madam Speaker I rise today in remembrance of Timothy McDonald and Deb Schott who both tragically perished in a helicopter crash at the Brainerd Minnesota Airport last month both Timothy and Deb dedicated their lives to helping others Timothy was a medical pilot for North memorials air care unit and had previously served in the United States Army he did two tours in Iraq Deb was an emergency flight nurse for North memorials air care unit she had worked in the medical field since she was 19 years old Timothy and Deb both had outstanding reputations in the respective fields and were both beloved by their co-workers my thoughts and prayers are with their loved ones madam Speaker our first responders are often the first on the scene hope in times of crisis we must never take the work they do or the sacrifices they make for granted and I yield back

for what purpose does gentleman from north carolina seek recognition i ask unanimous consent to address the house and revise and extend my remarks without objection the gentleman is recognized for madam speaker last week i held a telephone town hall meeting with my constituents and towards the end of that call i heard from a constituent who had already seen her hours cut at the local grocery store from 36 hours down to 28. now as a result of obamacare industries corporations people are opposed with this very tough challenge either they pay for very expensive health care or cut people's hours or lay people off and unfortunately her grocery store decided to limit hours and make more part-time workers sadly as a result of this she lost 140 a month and that prevented her from be able to pay for the very affordable health insurance plan she currently is on other co-workers could no longer afford car payments for instance and this devastating effect is a terrible result of bad public policy and that's why we must repeal obamacare and i yield back

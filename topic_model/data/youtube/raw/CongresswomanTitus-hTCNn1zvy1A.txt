  MR. SHERMAN: I YIELD TWO   MINUTES TO THE GENTLELADY FROM   NEVADA, MS. TITUS. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLELADY FROM NEVADA IS  RECOGNIZED FOR TWO MINUTES.  MS. TITUS: I WANT TO THANK THE   GENTLEMAN FOR YIELDING.  WANT TO THANK CHAIRMAN ROYCE   AND RANKING MEMBER ENGEL FOR   BRINGING THIS LEGISLATION, BUT   ESPECIALLY MY COLLEAGUE,   CONGRESSWOMAN FRANKEL, FOR   BEING SUCH A CHAMPION FOR  WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND ISSUES NOT  ONLY IN THIS COUNTRY BUT AROUND  THE GLOBE. I'M PROUD TO BE A CO-SPONSOR OF  THIS BILL, THE WOMEN'S   ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND ECONOMIC  EMPOWERMENT ACT, WHICH AS  YOU'VE HEARD BY THOSE MORE   ELOQUENT THAN I, WILL HELP   ENSURE THAT THIS IS A  FUNDAMENTAL TENANT OF U.S.   DEVELOPMENT POLICY.  WOMEN TEND TO SPEND MORE OF  THEIR MONEY ON EDUCATION AND   HEALTH CARE THAN MEN DO. UNFORTUNATELY, THEY LACK ACCESS  TO FINANCIAL SERVICES AND MUST   RELY ON RISKIER AND LESS   RELIABLE MEANS OF BORROWING AND  SAVING.  IF THE GLOBAL GENDER PARODY AND  ECONOMIC ACTIVITY WERE   ACHIEVED, WE CAN ADD AS MUCH AS  $28 BILLION TO THE ANNUAL  GLOBAL G.D.P.  SO THAT SHOULD BE INCENTIVE  ENOUGH FOR US TO WORK TO ENSURE  THAT OUR GOVERNMENT UNDERSTANDS  AND HAS THE CAPABILITIES TO  MEET THE UNIQUE ECONOMIC NEEDS   OF WOMEN, PARTICULARLY SINCE   WOMEN REPRESENT MORE THAN HALF   OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION AND A  MAJORITY OF THE WORLD'S POOR.  NOW, IN ADDITION TO SERVING ON   THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE,   I'M PROUD TO BE THE CO-CHAIR OF  THE MONGOLIAN CAUCUS.  WE'RE WORKING WITH THE   MONGOLIAN GOVERNMENT TO SUPPORT  THE CASHMERE PRODUCTION  INDUSTRY.  NOTABLY, AN AVERAGE OF 90% OF  THE WOMEN IN THE MONGOLIAN   TEXTILE SECTOR ARE FEMALE. SO IF WE WORK TO ENSURE THAT   THESE WOMEN IN THE CASHMERE  INDUSTRY HAVE THE SUPPORT,   RESOURCES, AND FINANCIAL   LITERACY TO PROSPER WILL NOT --  WE'LL NOT ONLY BE BOOSTING   INDIVIDUAL WOMEN, WE'LL BE   BOOSTING AN ECONOMY AND  MONGOLIA.  THIS IS WHERE UPLIFTING WOMEN  CAN HELP PROSPERITY WHICH  FOSTERS DEMOCRATIC STABILITY.  AS LOIS SAID, WHEN WOMEN   SUCCEED, THE WORLD SUCCEEDS. SO I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO   SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION.  I YIELD BACK.  THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLELADY

mr. speaker with all that we should be doing to help address middle class anxiety to help the economy along to help with student debt to help with the challenges that all of our constituents face what will we be doing this week we will be repealing the Affordable Care Act for the fifth sixth I'm 56 now I get it the first couple of times Mr Speaker I get it first couple of times the Republicans believe that this was a government takeover of health care that there were death panels that it was unconstitutional that it would raise costs in the health care sector that it would be a job killer none of that turned out to be true in fact the opposite turned out to be true Supreme Court said it was constitutional it actually helped lower costs in the overall health care system and we're now adding jobs in the private sector faster than we have added them in ten years none of that was true what is true is that the Affordable Care Act has given ten million or more Americans the security for the first time of having health insurance it's cut the uninsured rate in my state of Connecticut in half you know what that means it means that an Chrisman 51 years old single mother could never afford health care insurance now she has it she went to a doctor and her breast cancer was diagnosed early she said the cancer has been detected at a very early stage which with a ninety-eight percent survival rate has saved my life respectfully let's leave it alone

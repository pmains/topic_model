usually agree with my friend from Louisiana I think we may be on top of something that is transformational and I don't think you can separate the underlying distributed ledger or blockchain from some of these crypto assets and if we looked if we had the same rate of increase that we've the next two years that we've had the last couple years we're talking now a couple hundred billion we be at north of twenty trillion dollars caught up in this area by 2020 and I just I think you I remember back I was lucky enough to get into cell phone business back in the early 80s and everybody thought it was gonna be a small business and they were wrong and I got rich I think we're looking at the same kind of transformation about to take place and we are gonna have to wrap our arms around we've talked about some of the consumer protection issues but we got money laundering issues we've got cyber security issues a third of the the Bitcoin exchanges have been cyber half between 2009 and 2015 I'm not exactly sure what the right regime we ought to be but I would argue that while I commend the Treasury secretary for putting a working group together I would argue this is the reason we created eff sock in the first place that this Rises potentially to the level of a systemically relevant event and I'd just be curious whether that you believe and I commend what both of you are trying to do but I whether this ought to elevate to an eff sock level analysis so sir I I had the same question you had which is there's a there's a big rise here if it does keep going so is this a systemic issue which is one of the reasons we brought it up at eff sock talk to better def sock I again commend the Treasury Secretary for forming the working group I want to go back to separating icos and and crypto currencies icos that are securities offerings we should regulate them like we regulate securities offerings end of story wanna make sure because I got a couple more points will you thank you senator just real quickly on the issue of disclosure sometimes what we're seeing is not a problem of absence of disclosure it's false disclosure false disclosure is often fraud and I think we need to step in there but just in terms of discussion chairman Clayton mentioned we have begun discussions that have sought in addition there's also been discussions led by chairman Clayton at the Financial Stability Board and also at IOSCO which is the international organization of securities commissioners so these discussions are taking place at the right levels of debate but there's so much more to be done but and again to my friend from Louisiana point we've got this we will focus on a lot of Bitcoin and crypto assets cryptocurrencies and I think there's even definitional issues here but you've got a whole new platform called etherium where they're creating you know file sharing or extra computer time I'm not sure what what kind of assets those fall into are they are they potentially regulated within your realm or if there is a trade a trading exchange tokenization exchange between excess computer time not sure where we where that fits at this point I the definition of a security I believe the people who wrote the 34 act in the 33 act they were smart they they did it on a principle basis and they they basically said if you're giving people money in exchange for a future development of a business with the hope of a return and whether that return comes in the form of server time or your ability to sell server time it's a security but there are Ben and I concur with the approach you've taken in terms of the IC OS and I think there's been some very bad behavior yet certain I see owes the SEC has not stopped others they have stopped you know and are you gonna go back and reread you the ones that that have gone forward let me let me say another thing about the 33 and 34 act when they were written there was a great recognition that there was a tremendous amount of securities activity in this country and that we were going to rely on gatekeepers to help us enforce those and liability to help us enforce those rules accountants lawyers underwriters sellers and the like I'm counting on those people to do their job and I've made that clear let me ask chairman Giancarlo you know what we did and one of things I'm concerned about was that we I think we may have moved too fast on allowing for example futures trading on Bitcoin and I just wonder well you know you've allowed future trading contracts on Bitcoin yet we've the SEC is not allowed ETF I'm just worried that we need a much more coordinated effort because I think the potential writ large amongst crypto assets and the underlying botching could be as transformational as Wireless was years ago and I think we're gonna need a much more coordinated effort I know my times expired but if you could both quickly comment on that I appreciate it I believe it is critically important that we coordinated this I believe that we are all both individually and collectively understanding our authorities understanding this new technology working working around it there was a communication amongst myself chairman Clayton the Treasury secretary and others in connection with Bitcoin futures and you know Bitcoin futures have dumped are quite different than the Bitcoin market the Bitcoin is an anonymous area Bitcoin futures is fully transparent to the regulator Bitcoin retail Bitcoin futures mostly institutional and high-net-worth know Bitcoin futures regulated Bitcoin futures regulated Bitcoin unregulated and with Bitcoin futures we're now having visibility into underlying spot markets and data from those markets we would not otherwise have completely agree on coordination like I said I break it down into three areas there's this great technology that I agree with you has promised there are these pure crypto currencies which we need to we need to take a look at across FinCEN Treasury CFTC Fed and then there are securities offerings that are called icos that should be should be undertaken as security offerings consistent with our regulatory regime

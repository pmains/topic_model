I'm Kim Schrier and I approve this message. Dangerous. That's how voters describe this out of touch
politician Matt Larkin. Because Larkin said he'd cut veteran's healthcare
and supports a national ban on abortion, overturning protections here in Washington and putting
women's lives at risk. Larkin even said he quote "aligns with Marjorie
Taylor Greene" and said quote "this isn't the time for moderation." That's Matt Larkin, the definition of dangerous.

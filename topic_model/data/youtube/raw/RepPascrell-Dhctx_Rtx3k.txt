we are listening in as president obama addresses about 140 uh what described as youth leaders but quickly i want to go back to congressman bill pascarel who's here um it's an interesting point to note congressman yesterday the president said the same thing as long as he's president this law will not be repealed he is moving a full steam ahead and today we're hearing from speaker boehner's office and the strategy it appears for house republicans is they say to continue to highlight individual stories about canceled plans and higher costs not reacting to the president's uh challenge um and asking if there's a better idea propose that what is your reaction well look speak speaker boehner would move advance his position a lot further if you put in the good examples as well as the bad examples we can all pick out situations that are horrific and casting and fun the american public the president is on course this is not going to be rebuilt the president is making changes the administration's making changes and they should we don't only have a problem in terms of rollout of this legislation of the aca but we also have problems internally we all know that but look how how long it took the social security system to get moving look how long it took medicare and now let's look to just plan d as i mentioned before we cooperated though even though we voted no on plan d the the drug bill we cooperated out there i went back to my district and met with my seniors and told them look that's the law of the land now right and if it's the law of the land let's implement it and not make excuses and the president is right i said this in a hearing this morning what in god's name is their plan they don't have a plan it's a rowan director set that's what it is today on morning joe your colleague congressman tom cole of oklahoma says that the republicans are putting ideas on the table but the quote was but frankly the president has not put very many ideas on the table this is his legislation it's not worked well i would expect the corrective to come largely from him but he is saying or claiming that republicans are putting ideas on the table your reaction yeah we've had ancient ideas uh there's no question about it tom cole's a great friend of mine one of the few republicans who are not afraid to look at ideas of course they are but tom is dead wrong on this and i'm i told him publicly and i will tell him again after his uh talk this morning and i watched that very carefully this morning the point is that they they have no bill they've ever voted on before the the house i haven't seen any this year i mean we haven't voted on many things this year uh bring it forward let's see what happens uh somebody held it up in a meeting two weeks ago and they just had signed on five days before that they have no plan this is this is a whole hodgepodge of ideas that were voted down a long time ago starting under the bush administration privatization privatization privatization look this is within the private market let's make it work let's come together unlike my governor in the state of new jersey who took the medicaid money at least got a half right in order for the many people who are eligible for that and then took seven million dollars over seven million dollars from the aca act to begin to educate folks in new jersey when we should have had an individual plan in new jersey our own exchange program he chose not to do it he didn't step up to the plate he's not a bipartisan individual that's a lot of baloney and this is a perfect example we're talking about people life or death we're talking about healthier we're not talking about simply nibbling at the edges this is what it's all about your health is what is what is most important and it's of course we thank god that we do have our health and pray for those who don't this is an absurdity put forth by the republican governors it's not going any place look to the governors who have taken their their exchanges put them into the states they're doing a lot more seven million dollars unspent in the state of new jersey and this governor of the state of new jersey for not going in starting our own exchange blew through 300 million dollars case closed congressman pat's growl thank you so much for your time we greatly appreciate it we are thankful that you stuck around while we listened to the president and the day two of this push uh by the president the administration and democrats thank you cameron it's always a pleasure to be with you always well the programming notes

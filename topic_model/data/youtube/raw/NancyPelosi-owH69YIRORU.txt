what's really important about all of this is that the policies that you see them advocating are directly related to the politics and the political climate that we are in you cannot have fairness to the middle class in your policy if you have complete un reported large significant special interest money pouring into the political process to suffocate the system to suppress the vote and to poison the debate that's why we've issued a dare to say we dare disclose amend the constitution to overturn uh citizens united reform the politics the let's increase the role of small donors in the political system and elect reformers of any party who are willing to do that our founders knew that our our system depended on a democracy where the voice and the vote of the many determine the outcome of elections and therefore the policies that would spring from that not the checkbooks of the very very few a plutocracy a government of the rich a government of the few not of the many so it is in the interest of our democracy that we have accountability and transparency and that's why after the supreme court's misguided decision on citizens united disclose disclosure was one course of action one of the few courses of action that available to us person who took the lead on this strengthening of our democracy holding firm to the vows of our founders is chris van hollen as you know he's part of our leadership he's our ranking democrat on the budget committee and because of his knowledge of these issues he sees the direct relationship between politics and policy and we're very proud of his leadership on the disclose act and i'm going to yield to him to talk about that now chris van hollen of maryland well thank you uh madam leader and his leader pelosi said at the outset yesterday we saw the 33rd vote uh in the house of representatives to repeal the important protections that are contained in the affordable care act there are a number of bills where we've had zero votes uh one of course is the president's jobs initiative which he presented to the house of representatives last september no votes on that another bill we've had zero votes on is the disclose bill uh which is designed to make sure that voters know who is financing uh these campaigns and so that we can understand what special interests are trying to rig the rules of the economy uh in their favor now this is a house of representatives that is pretending that is one of the most open house of representatives uh in recent times uh and yet they have refused to even hold a hearing on the disclose act not even a hearing it's been requested many times by congressman brady congressman gonzalez and others on the house committee on administration nothing those members had to hold an unofficial hearing to bring out the facts on this issue because the majority refused to have a hearing so it's ironic that on a bill that calls for greater openness house republicans refused to even have an open hearing to talk about it the disclose act stands for a very simple proposition which is that voters have a right to know who is bankrolling these campaigns and we all recognize that when a lot of these groups are financing these campaigns they're doing it to try to elect the congress to try and buy a congress that will rig the rules of the game in their favor and among the rules of the game which we know they want to change uh relate to important pieces of our economy so for example we've been working hard to try and overturn some of the parts of the tax code that reward corporations that move american jobs overseas to special tax havens like the cayman islands like switzerland we'd like to close those tax loopholes there are a lot of corporations and individuals who benefit from keeping those loopholes in place there are lots of folks who would like to continue to have a tax code that tilts towards the very wealthy uh and we see strong republican opposition uh to our proposal to extend tax relief to middle-income americans in less they also get continuations of tax breaks for the very wealthy instead of asking the wealthiest to help contribute to reducing our deficit so that we don't have to reduce the deficit at the expense of middle tax middle-income taxpayers and seniors so that's what this is all about shining light on those contributions uh and it's unfortunate that our republican colleagues uh oppose that uh i think we want to both commend uh senator reid uh for the decision in the senate to take up the disclose act next week and we think that members of the house democrat republicans alike should have that same opportunity which is why we just filed a discharge petition in the house of representatives and we're encouraging all members democrats and republicans who believe that voters have a right to know who's financing these elections to sign that very simple measure and let us have a vote on it in the house again we had 33 votes on repealing important patient protections let's have one vote on allowing voters uh the right to know who's financing these campaigns through secret donations and trying to rig the rules and there was a time when republicans favored disclosure and i do think it's uh worth just pointing out what mitch mcconnell said not that long ago uh when he was asked by tim russert on meet the press and here's what senator mcconnell said quote republicans are in favor of disclosure if you're going to do that and the senate voted to do that and i'm prepared to go down that road then it needs to be meaningful disclosure tim 527s are just a handful of groups we need to have real disclosure and so what we thought to do is broaden the disclosure to include at least labor unions and tax-exempt business associations and trial lawyers so you can include the major political players in america why would a little disclosure be better than a lot of disclosure mitch mcconnell asked we agree with the old mitch mcconnell we believe that voters have a right to know we believe in full disclosure and all senator mcconnell and the house republicans need to do to ensure that full disclosure is to vote and favor the disclose act when they bring it up in the senate and sign the discharge petition that we filed today to bring up the disclose act in the house of representatives so we hope that they will do that

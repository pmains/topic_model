Mr Speaker I rise today to discuss the opioid crisis opioid addiction is sweeping the nation it's an epidemic that knows no race gender income or marital status and certainly no political party as we continue to work together here in Washington to combat this crisis I met with the physicians in Hutchinson Kansas that have taken responsibility and ownership of this issue they've developed their own scientific and compassion approach to curb addiction in their community the Hutchinson clinic has created an office-wide task force working with nurses pharmacists physicians and social workers that outline steps and procedures to reduce the number of narcotics prescribed in their medical practice when I met with the staff and physicians yesterday they explains these new steps will not only reduce the number of people unnecessarily exposed to cart narcotics but identify patients at risk for addition addiction they will use clinic wide protocols and breast best practices which will eliminate doctor shopping for narcotics and manage chronic pain or acute pain more uniformly I was heartened to hear their success that many many of their patients being fully removed from a narcotic prescription after years of narcotic use they've carefully tried to sit down with all their patients on chronic narcotics and in many cases they uncovered some type of an underlying depression or psychosomatic issue that could be resolved with counseling and other medications and in some instances they found out that the patient was not taken the narcotics but rather a family member was selling them and either case they're trying to use a compassionate approach to deal with this growing problem this is a great prevention and awareness approach as a physician of 30 years we must make make sure that prescribers understand the risk involved with these highly addictive drugs and minimize addiction and why we continue to look at solutions here in Washington I'm proud that physicians and nurses in Kansas and pharmacists in Kansas are also finding solutions by looking in the mirror and recognizing there are steps that communities that physicians nurses social workers and pharmacist working together can take to prevent addiction before it ever starts this month as the house continues approaching dozens of bills that work on this epidemic from every angle I wanted to take time to applaud the Hutchison clinic the physicians the nurses the pharmacists the social workers their staff for the action that they're taking and implementing the solutions that are working for those closest to the problem will have the best solutions thank you and I yield

Thank you very much, Ranking Member Scott. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3441, the Save Local
Business Act would fundamentally redefine the relationship between
employers and employees. Mr. Speaker, corporate profits and income inequality
are at an all-time high yet we are debating a bill that would
strip workers of their right to hold employers accountable. Allowing
corporations to further stifle wage growth and undermine collective
bargaining. This is yet another Republican attempt to make the rich
richer and the working people poorer; just like their tax bill. What we should
be fighting for is a living wage and employee rights. My Republican colleagues
say the law is ambiguous and we must act to save small businesses. The law is not
ambiguous. They just don't like it because it holds businesses responsible
and forces them to bargain with unions. This bill is an assault on workers. Mr
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record a letter from the
Economic Policy Institute outlining how H.R. 3441 will ensure small businesses
are left with sole responsibility for business practices often dictated by
large corporations; and in addition a letter from the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters opposing this bill in support of workers protections.
[without objection] Thank you, Mr Speaker. I urge my
colleagues to vote 'NO' on H.R. 3441. Let's get back to fighting for the people we
were sent here to serve. I yield back.

well look at this story this blew up quickly just last week the biden administration was touting its new relationship with facebook and twitter to censor what it deems vaccine misinformation but the administration quickly blew this up blew it up they blew up the partnership over the weekend let's welcome back to the show member of the gop doctor's caucus is senator roger marshall senator the administration was claiming facebook and twitter are health hazards they are health hazards in and of themselves what do you think of what happened well liz the white house cannot have it both ways do they want the facebook working with them or against them this this white house owns this vaccine hesitancy and why they want to blame this on facebook now i don't know all they had to do was drive the trump train that was full of trump vaccines but instead they send out misinformation they talked out of both sides of their mouth and now they own this problem you know senator people are sick of it they're sick of the politicizing of everything you know the president and vice president last year downplayed vaccines developed under the trump administration saying they wouldn't take it joy reid did the same thing of msnbc so did governor cuomo but you know charlie kirk has pointed this out the way the white house press secretary was talking about facebook she was talking about it like it was a government agency and not a private company right this is the socialistic policy that they really want you know jin saki doubled down on it that that she actually wants more of it she wants more censoring of facebook and i got to tell you we did town halls this weekend where and folks were much more concerned about their freedom of speech and the censoring that was going on uh than the than any information going there one way or the other you know net net facebook did a good job of getting the information out that if you wanted a vaccine this is the place to get it i've been censored lots of people have been censored and that's what i'm upset about and now this white house wants to double down on censoring jeopardizing my first amendment rights well the white house is damn playing it today it's saying they're not at war uh with facebook and that president bind said today facebook is not killing people he made comments to that effect last week you know what's really interesting senator i like your reaction to this you know high school students are saying listen we know when we see disinformation and misinformation on the on social media they can determine it on their own senator let's listen to this watch it's up to us to do our research and really make those decisions and inform decisions for ourselves i don't think anyone like takes facebook posts as serious as biden says they do it's just kind of up to their own discretion whether they want it or not i don't take everything i see on social media at face value like if i see a headline or if i see all these posts saying this and this and this about the vaccine like i'm gonna go look it up i'm gonna go do some research before i make a decision what do you say senator it's interesting right you know there you go so a common sense approach i can tell you this every time jinsaki opens her mouth or dr fauci gives us a lecture ten thousand more people say that they're never going to get the vaccine again this is now down to due to folks talking to their local physician to their own personal physician we need to respect the people that haven't got the vaccine yet the good news half of them have already have natural immunity they've had the virus but so if you haven't had the vaccine yet i respect you go talk to your own doctor and talk about the benefits and risk of it yeah how about a public service announcement that's all you need from doc maybe from doctors and nurses saying get vaccinated you know the press secretary today was downplaying the idea that uh the president should reach out to president trump and do a public service announcement together um she just basically said nah we're not going to do that i mean it's interesting that what so they want to do censorship and just dictate what's going to be on social media but then not do the all the other things i mean that dictating social to social immediate to social media that just feels like textbook case you know violations of the first amendment your final word well i think president trump has a really good case i'm glad he's going forward with it i think the final the final word is this if you haven't had your vaccine yet go talk to your doctor i respect where you're coming from uh and it's really a personal decision we don't need our speech censored all right senator roger marshall thank you so much for joining us it's good to see you come back soon we'll

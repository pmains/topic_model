A SENATOR: MR. PRESIDENT. THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA. MR. MANCHIN: MR. PRESIDENT, I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO DR. CALIFF, AND I'VE SPOKEN BEFORE ON THIS AND I JUST WANT TO SAY JUST FOR A MINUTE OR TWO HERE. I RESPECT EVERYONE'S POSITION ON THIS AND THEIR DECISION, BUT I HAVE NEVER HAD ANYTHING THAT'S AFFECTED MY STATE AND CONSTITUENTS OF MY STATE MORE THAN THE OPIOID ADDICTION. THIS OPIOID ADDICTION STARTED BECAUSE OF THE F.D.A.'S ADDITIOA PRODUCT TO MARKET IN 1995 THAT DESTROYED MANY FAMILIES, MANY COMMUNITIES, MANY BUSINESSES, PEOPLE'S LIVES FOREVER. AND THERE'S STORY AFTER STORY, AND THERE'S NOT A SENATOR IN THIS BODY THAT DOESN'T HAVE SOMEONE IN THEIR FAMILY, IMMEDIATE FAMILY OR EXTENDED FAMILY OR A CONSTITUENT THAT HASN'T BEEN AFFECTED. WITH THAT, YOU NEED TO CHANGE THE DYNAMICS OF THE LEADERSHIP OVER THERE. DR. CALIFF WAS THERE FIVE YEARS AGO. HE'S COMING BACK. NOTHING'S CHANGED. 400,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED SINCE HE WAS THERE, AND WE'RE GOING DOWN THE SAME PATH. UNLESS WE CHANGE THAT DYNAMIC, THAT LEADERSHIP POSITION ON TRYING TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA WITHOUT PUTTING MORE AND MORE HORRIBLE DRUGS ON THE MARKET. THERE WAS ONE DRUG BACK IN, I THINK IT WAS 2014, 2013, 2014 CALLED ZOHYDRO. IT WAS THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE RECOMMENDED 11-2 DO NOT BRING THIS DRUG TO MARKET. THEY DID IT ANYWAY. 11-2, DON'T DO IT. THESE ARE EXPERTS. SAID TWO PILLS CAN KILL A HUMAN BEING. THEY BROUGHT IT CONTINUOUSLY. THEY CONTINUE TO BRING MORE OPIOIDS ON THE MARKET. WE DON'T NEED THIS PRODUCT ON THE MARKET TO KILL MORE AMERICANS. THIS ADMINISTRATION UNDER ROBER CALIFF WILL TAKE THE SAME OLD SAME OLD AS THEY DID BEFORE. NOTHING WILL CHANGE. I URGE ALL MY COLLEAGUES PLEASE CONSIDER WHAT YOU'RE DOING, CONSIDER YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR CONSTITUENTS, AND PLEASE VOTE AGAINST ROBERT CALIFF.

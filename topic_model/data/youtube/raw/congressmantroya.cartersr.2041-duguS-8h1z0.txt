POURED IN TO MAKE A "FIELD OF DREAMS" NEXT TO A NEW ORLEANS HIGH SCHOOL. BUT INSTEAD, FINANCIAL MISMANAGEMENT DRAINED THE FUNDS, LEAVING NOTHING BUT AN OVERGROWN LOT. NOW, THREE YEARS AFTER OUR INITIAL "EMPTY FIELD OF DREAMS" REPORTS, A NEW GROUP IS CLOSER TO FINALLY MAKING THE DREAM A REALITY. HERE'S OUR NEW JOINT INVESTIGATION BETWEEN FOX 8 AND JEFF DUNCAN OF NOLA DOT COM ■ # THE TIMES PICAYUNE. WILBERT THOMAS 00:04 SO THIS IS YOUR HOUSE RIGHT HERE. YES. YOU LIVED HERE FOR SINCE BEFORE KATRINA. AND THEN RIGHT. SHOW ME, RIGHT OVER HERE IS WHERE THE FIELDS GONNA BE? YES. RIGHT. SO YOU SEE THE LIGHTS IN THE STADIUM, THIS IS WHERE THEY'RE GONNA BE COMING IN AND OUT. SO YOU'RE STEPS AWAY FROM THE FIELD? STEPS AWAY FROM IT AND LOVE IT, LEE: WILBERT THOMAS GRADUATED FROM CARVER HIGH SCHOOL IN THE 9TH WARD. HE NOW LIVES STEPS AWAY FROM CAMPUS. STEPS AWAY FROM THE SITE....THAT COULD SOON....BE HOSTING CARVER FOOTBALL GAMES...TRACK MEETS...EVEN COMMUNITY MEETINGS. WILBERT THOMAS 00:53 SO THIS IS GREAT FOR THIS COMMUNITY TO GET A STADIUM LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE FOR THE KIDS. AND THAT'S OUR FUTURE LEE: THOMAS SAYS THE 9TH WARD HAS BEEN NEGLECTED SINCE KATRINA.....WITH LITTLE GOVERNMENT INVESTMENT....UNTI L NOW. WILBERT THOMAS 1:47 WE HAD HOUSES OVER HERE, AND WE PROBABLY GONNA GET THEM BACK. BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WANT TO BE AROUND A STADIUM LIKE THAT. SO THE EMPTY LOTS THAT THAT LOT, THE TWO HOUSES HERE, AND A LARGE HOUSE AND THE LADY THAT I USED TO WORK FOR MRS. FRANCOISE HAD UP AT A BIG HOUSE HERE. AND AFTER KATRINA, THEY HAD TO TEAR DOWN LEE: A GROUP LED BY FORMER NEW ORLEANS COUNCILMEMBER.... ARNIE FIELKOW....HAS LANDED 6 POINT 8 MILLION DOLLARS OF MONEY....TO BUILD A NEW STATE OF THE ART STADIUM. ARNIE FIELKOW 1:48 WELL, WE'RE BUILDING A COMMUNITY HOME IN A LOT OF WAYS. I MEAN, I HOPE THAT THIS COULD BE AN ECONOMIC CATALYST FOR THE UPPER NINTH WARD, I HOPE IT WILL BRING PEOPLE HERE, IT'S CERTAINLY GOING TO PROVIDE RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUTH FROM ALL OF OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS FOR, YOU KNOW, SPORTS, LIKE FOOTBALL AND SOCCER AND TRACK AND FIELD AND OTHER THINGS. BUT WITHIN THE STADIUM ITSELF, YOU KNOW, ALTHOUGH WE'RE GOING TO START TO HAVE SOME COMMUNITY MEETINGS, TO REALLY GET INTO SOME OF THE DETAILS, YOU KNOW, THINGS LIKE COMMUNITY MEETING ROOM, THINGS LIKE A HALL OF FAME, YOU KNOW, ARE ALL PART OF THE CONSIDERATION RIGHT NOW OF WHAT THIS NEW STADIUM MIGHT LOOK LIKE. LEE: THE DREAM TO BUILD THIS STADIUM STARTED A FEW YEARS AFTER KATRINA. 00:12 ANDERSON COOPER: WE ARE LIVE TONIGHT 9TH WARD FIELD OF DREAMS.... LEE: THE 9TH WARD FIELD OF DREAMS GARNERED NATIONAL EXPOSURE AND 1 MILLION DOLLARS IN DONATIONS. ARNIE FIELKOW (OLD SOUND) LOOK A LOT OF PEOPLE GAVE REAL MONEY HELP KIDS OF NEW ORLEANS. LEE: BUT OUR INVESTIGATION BACK IN 2019 FOUND THE GROUP HAD SPENT ALL OF THE MONEY.....WITH NO STADIUM....BEING BUILT. YOLANDA WHITE ■ "(■ "(■ "(■ "(1E GOT WEEDS AND LIGHTS LAYING ON THE GROUND...FOR A MILLION DOLLARS. REALLY? LEE: WITH SOME ALUMNI OUTRAGED.....ARNIE FIELKOW DECIDED TO PUT TOGETHER A NEW COMMITTEE....TO TRY AND MAKE THIS DREAM A REALITY. HE RECRUITED AREA LEADERS LIKE WILBERT THOMAS....AND FORMER SAINTS RUNNINGBACK DEUCE MCALLISTER. DEUCE MCALLISTER 1:37 AND THIS IS SOMETHING NOT ONLY THAT THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN NEW ORLEANS WILL, I MEAN, WELL, EVERY PUBLIC SCHOOL IN NEW ORLEANS WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE THIS FACILITY. SO I WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WERE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT. AND SO, YOU KNOW, JUST TO BE ABLE TO GO TO THAT COMMUNITY, SPEND TAX DOLLARS IN THAT COMMUNITY AND REALLY JUST HOPEFULLY, REVITALIZE THE AREA. LEE: WITH THE HELP OF STATE SENATOR JOE BOUIE....THE GROUP RECEIVED 3- POINT 8 MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE MONEY. CONGRESSMAN TROY CARTER....SECURED AN ADDITIONAL 3 MILLION IN FEDERAL DOLLARS. TROY CARTER 3:25 THE LOWER NINTH WARD HAS NEVER HAD IT. THEY'VE NEVER HAD THEIR OWN STADIUM THAT THEY CAN HAVE THE PRIDE OF AND PLAY THEIR GAMES AT HOME, YOU KNOW, KIDS GO AND PLAY A PAN-AM, O'PERRY WALKER, THEY PLAY AT GORMLEY. BUT YOU NEVER EVER HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT IN THE LORD NINTH WARD. LEE: FIELKOW AND HIS COMMITTEE ARE NOW FOCUSED ON RAISING PRIVATE MONEY.....LOOKING TO SECURE AN ADDITIONAL 2 POINT 2 MILLION DOLLARS. FUNDRAISING TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT HAS BEGUN. FIELKOW HOPES TO SECURE A DONATION THAT INCLUDES NAMING RIGHTS...AND START CONSTRUCTION THIS YEAR. THE DREAM....A STADIUM....WITH A TRACK....A ROOM FOR COMMUNITY MEETINGS.....IS CLOSE TO FINALLY BEING BUILT ARNIE FIELKOW 0:08 SO THIS FIELD IS GOING TO BE BUILT. WE ARE ABSOLUTELY GOING TO BUILD THIS NEW STADIUM. 100%, IT'S HAPPENING, YEAH, WE STILL GOT A LITTLE WORK TO DO. BUT WE'RE FAR ENOUGH ALONG RIGHT NOW THAT I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT THAT THIS PROJECT IS GOING TO COME TO FRUITION LEE: CONSTRUCTION MIGHT HELP HEAL THIS COMMUNITY TOO. GIVING KIDS A SIGN OF HOPE.....PBREATHIN G NEW LIFE INTO AN EMPTY LOT... BRINGING FANS AND STUDENTS TOGETHER UNDER THE FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS... TO ERASE EMPTY PROMISES... AND FINALLY MAKING THIS FIELD OF DREAMS-- A REALITY. WILBERT THOMAS 2:37 BECAUSE WHEN WE GOT INTO IT, WE MADE A PACT THAT WE WILL NOT TALK THAT WAS LEE ZUIRK REPORTING. THE STATE MONEY FOR THE PROJECT WAS APPROPRIATED THROUGH THE STATE'S CAPITAL OUTLAY PROGRAM. THE FEDERAL MONEY WAS EARMARKED FROM

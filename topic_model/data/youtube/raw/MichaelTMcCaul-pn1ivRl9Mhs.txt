I want to thank in that Leslie I don't know where she is for hosting that great reception last night and if you haven't read her book hearing me about her son Carson you should and it's like so many of you out there who have lived through this terrible disease it's both heart-wrenching but also positive Carson so that no mommy I hope those whatever is happening to the tissues my brain that they'll be able to learn from that and maybe it will save someone else's life that brings tears to our eyes when we go through the pediatric oncology units and see these children and to those of you who have lost your child like Tim and Donna Culver who you brought this issue to my attention we're all from run them they are my strongest most passionate advocates and I really thank you for your leadership in this whole effort you know as well my best friend and great school died from leukemia which was at that time a death sentence it's better today I want to thank nancy goodman many of you heard about the creating hope act it was a bit of an experiment legislatively to address an area where we haven't had a childhood cancer drug developed since the 1980s and it's basically a way to incentivize more the marketplace where you have a market failure so that we can create each other can't cancer drugs and the good news is it's working now we had our first it it works through a voucher system within the FDA approval process and we have our first voucher that was approved for almost 70 million dollars and another one would be coming down the pike I don't want to give out too much but we'll be coming down the pike in December for the first childhood cancer drug to be developed since the 1980s and it was really Nancy's a brilliant idea I can't take credit but Chris and I were the vehicles if you will in a bipartisan manner after all this should not be a Republican Democrat issue it's an American children issue and it passed I want to thank Mike Kelly for bringing a congressman from Pennsylvania bring Briana our greatest childhood advocate on the House floor in violation of the house rules to whip that bill and we got the broad range of far left and far-right the white did officials and get that thing passed and also thank you for Hyundai hope on wheels we had an event earlier this morning they've raised 87 million dollars to the cause I don't want to thank you for that and if I finally want to thank my wife London not only for putting up with with me over the years but for always being a strong person that she is passionate on this issue she's on the board of visitors at md anderson and chairs a childhood cancer committee and working together we whipped that bill they call it whip it's actually got votes and really made it happen it was a great partnership and and I really well before that and thank you so we have a great program I just want to touch on very briefly and like Chris say a few words first we have the director of NIH dr. Francis Collins here today thank you so much for being here sir dr. Rhonda Pino president of MD Anderson who has been a great friend and ally of the McCall family and then finally a doctor amrit ray who's chief medical officer for johnson and johnson which leads me to my last topic we we don't want this discussion to end today we have proven that the creating hope act works it was passed on a trial basis and we want to make that law permanent but in addition there's something else on the horizon that I see that will touch not only children's lives but pretty much every American afflicted with cancer and it's called compassionate use we've heard stories of children that are denied access to clinical trials that have cancer that hear about a life-saving treatment or drug but they can't get access to that I had a good friend of mine Andrea Sloan who was 40 years old who died from ovarian cancer even though drug company had a life-saving drug that could have saved her life we hear those stories all too often and we want to look at this legislatively this could be one of the most transformational changes in the way we deliver medication to terminally ill patients and we want to explore this and I want to thank dr. ray johnson Johnson has really been the leader in the drug company the field stepping up to the plate to have this conversation to start having this conversation and that's going to be a big part of our conversation them here today as well so thank you so with that let me turn it over to my my partner my calorie and let me just say thank you for everything you've done for the cause thank you thank you thank you

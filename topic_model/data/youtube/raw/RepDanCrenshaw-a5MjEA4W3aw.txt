thank you all for being here um for this extremely important topic i'm going to speak briefly about my bill that i introduced last year called the holding the chinese communist party accountable for infecting americans act and that's exactly how it sounds how can the american people hold the chinese communist party accountable and why would we well they lied and they tried to cover up their role in starting and spreading this global pandemic that's a fact that's something we do know that they did lie that they stopped the domestic flights but not international flights this much we do know whether it came from the lab or not we do know that and at best trying to lie about when they knew about the virus they jailed journalists and disappeared doctors who dared to tell the truth and they failed to inform the rest of the world immediately about the pandemic now at worst even though a year ago the press smeared anyone who said who said this was as a conspiracy theorist china did all of this because they knew the virus escaped the wuhan institute of virology and they were directly responsible for the coba 19 pandemic the evidence and common sense strongly supports this we need a full investigation into the origins of the pandemic so we can get to the truth but the bottom line is that china is at fault for this people died and lies were destroyed and americans should have the right to sue the chinese government right now china is protected from americans suing them under the foreign sovereign immunities act which limits legal action in the united states courts against foreign states my bill will hold the chinese communist party accountable for infecting americans by removing that protection if nothing else passing this bill will show the world the democrats and republicans the entire united states shares a common interest and commitment to holding the communist regime accountable we came together to pass a similar bill and this one is modeled after the bill that allowed the victims of 911 to sue state sponsors of that heinous act we should come together again as americans to hold beijing accountable it'll show the chinese communist party that they're not going to get away with this it will make them pay for the havoc they've wreaked on americans and people around the world including their own citizens and i can't for the life of me understand why democrats aren't clamoring to be on the stage with us i can't understand that we're beating our heads against the wall trying to figure that out we did not politicize this we are blaming china we're not blaming democrats for the virus and yet there seems to be a lack of desire a lack of curiosity about where this virus came from and certainly a lack of commitment to holding the chinese communist party accountable and we continue to invite democrats to be on the stage with us and join the join the china task force and i ask speaker pelosi to bring this bill to the floor immediately so that americans can hold china accountable thank you and i yield back to our esteemed leader

on a topic that's not developed quite as well as our Miss Missouri River flooding challenges about this time last year almost exactly I think was around the twelve to the fourteenth of March we had flooding start earlier than it normally does in the very northern corner of the state that affected Kansas and Nebraska as well a lot of what happened then wasn't hasn't been remediated because of high water during most of the summer one of the projects we're talking to the Corps on this but one of the projects that I continue to be concerned about is the course focus on some of the fish issues of the the pallid sturgeon issue frankly before the Corps knows what would work already a number of breeding shoots were put in it turned out they didn't work now the proposal is well maybe we do 12 intercepting rearing complexes along the course of the river I think there's no particular reason to believe they would work either and what I'm wondering is what can we do to better monitor whether something would work before we go full fledged in two dozen locations and believe me every minute that's spent on that is a minute that's not spent on getting ready for what would be this year's flooding challenges so one of the things that we're doing with the Endangered Species Act implementation is to better better inform our folks of kind of what our regulations require in terms of reasonable certainty and likelihood so that we can be working with proposing agencies like the Corps in a way that offers them more flexibility so if we I'd be happy to have the in the service make sure that they are communicating with the Corps to ensure that they are thinking about these items and with our entire toolkit because we really have made some changes to improve that process well one of the things I'd like you to for sure communicate to be sure that you're also talking about the impact on flood control and navigation issues as part of the discussion as to how to move forward here those are still priority issues in the whole management plan but they never seem to get the priority considerations over the last few years another thing I'd like you to look at is what kind of metrics would fish and wildlife use to determine one if this is really a workable plan and two if any part of the plan is put into place how do you measure the success so far again let me repeat we've done we've made it it's taken a lot of time a lot of effort a lot of federal money to put things in place that then we found out didn't work if you know some you know if you know something's going to hurt people in property and you don't know that it's going to produce the result I think there should be more of an effort to be sure that you've really tested this in a way that the result would be at least positive on the wildlife side if you know it's going to be negative on the people and property side and of course all the people involved would believe that this should not be a choice that's being made also the fish hatcheries for the Neosho I think there's another one on the on the on the Missouri River seem to do a fine job of repopulating pallid sturgeon but I'd like a commitment from you that we're going to look carefully at how we measure the metrics of how we measure whether this might work or not and then if you try it somewhere whether it really does work or not though I will give you that commitment I will also tell you that the president has expressed that view to me multiple times in a broader setting and three we are very interested in utilizing human interactions with proposals of hatcheries and other things good in a number of places so I'll get back to you on it sir all right Thank You secretary

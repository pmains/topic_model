Joe Biden me I would settle for a world in which I can worry about the same kinds of things that my parents worried about I only had to worry about the grades my children got in school rather than the drugs they're being exposed to in which I only had to worry about the prices my wife had to pay at the supermarket instead of fearing that she might get mugged by a junkie in the parking lot and she loads her groceries into the car in which tonight I could call my mom just to wish her pleasant dreams not for the purpose of making sure she's safe in her own home that's the kind of world I want that's the kind of world you deserve and there's no reason we can't have it

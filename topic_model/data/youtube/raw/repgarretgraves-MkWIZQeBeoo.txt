i'm excited about this hearing because we're talking about misrepresenting the truth in this hearing today we're talking about misrepresenting the truth to the american people we're talking about effectively lying to people that's what this hearing is about today and so we have listened over the last 18 months as we have heard people say that we are aggressively carrying out this new energy agenda for the purpose of addressing climate change and reducing emissions but the reality is is that what's happened is we've actually seen emissions go up not down let me say that again under this administration's policies designed to address climate change we've watched emissions go up not down at the same time at the same time we're in a situation now to where one-fourth of all americans one-fourth of all americans in this country are in a situation where they have to decide if they're going to cover groceries if they're going to cover health care costs or if they're going to pay you their utility bills we're seeing record inflation and it's a result of what's happening this this right here respondents who for whit necessary expenses such as medicine or food in order to pay an energy bill so so they're giving up energy or excuse me medicine or food in order to pay energy bills that this is the outcome of the biden administration policies on the american people it's unaffordable i mean looking at some of these percentages again in texas 34 of the respondents have said have said that that they can't afford that they've had to forego food or grocery costs in order to pay their utility bills look so folks are saying oh well wait a minute wait a minute the body administration is doing a great job with energy you actually have to go back to the 1940s the 1940s to find an administration that has leased fewer acres of land for energy production the 1940s take a look at this i'd take jfk i'd take jimmy carter jimmy carter during the first 19 months of his administration leased 100 times more acres of land for oil and gas production than we've seen under the bite administration ronald reagan the big line up there 375 times more energy so so folks can be sitting there saying well wait a minute wait a minute i'm worried about i'm worried about emissions let me say it again this administration's energy policies not only have made it unaffordable unaffordable to cover groceries or medicine where 25 of all americans one in every four americans have had to decide am i going to pay my utility bill buy food or pay for medicine but they've also resulted in energy emissions going up not down and when i say up let's be clear up from a trump baseline under the trump administration the emissions went down an average of 25 percent a year what objective are we achieving if we're talking about misleading the american people let's be clear on who it is that's misleading the american people it's the biden administration the bond administration is misleading the american people acting as though their energy strategies are resulting in lower emissions and addressing climate change it's not and it's pushing emissions to other countries that are going up globally as well who can look at this and think that this makes sense i'm glad we're talking about people that are dishonest because we need to spend more time data doesn't lie and the facts show that this administration's energy policies are pushing people into poverty or pushing jobs overseas and are making energy it's making energy unaffordable but wait it's not just limited to families our sheriff from terrebonne parish sheriff sonia i asked him so if you weren't spending these dollars on fuel and higher electricity and utility costs these are dollars would be going into additional officers equipment and training sheriff swanye says that's exactly right he's confirming that what's happening that what's happened is that as a result of dubai administration's energy policies his sheriff's department is spending more money on those things which is undermining his ability to actually fight crime and do the things that he's supposed to be doing so i can't say it enough i'm glad we're talking about misleading the american people because we have the chief misleader who's out there telling the american people that these policies are working and they're not yield back the gentleman yields back the chair now you

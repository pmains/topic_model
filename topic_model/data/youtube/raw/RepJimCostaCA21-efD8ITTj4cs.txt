thank you very much mr. chairman for this opportunity to direct questions that are important to all of our constituencies I want to focus Mr Cameron on the challenges we face on water in California it's either feast or famine we're fortunate this year the good Lords blessed us with a lot of snow in the mountains and good rainfall and how well we manage that that supply because we base it on ten-year averages as critical to our long-term viability as you know fiscal 20 budget includes zero funding for water storage under the wind Act that I was very involved in on a bipartisan basis with both senator Feinstein and congressman McCarthy the Lyne Act you're proposing significant cuts in virtually all of the US Bureau of Reclamation programs one of our colleagues noted before the water smart as well given California and the west challenges what projects in California will interior complete this year to adequately address our water run needs our water needs under this proposed slimmed-down budget first of all mr. Coston I would I would agree with you as I know you've been saying for a long time California needs more water storage I think there's no doubt about that some of the projects that we're we're working working on this year would include pre construction activities potentially at a Shasta Dam for raising the height of shale that's important insights I know you've already made a commitment to how about San Luis reservoir we got seismic retrofit and we would like to potentially raise that reservoir it's full today we're very happy about that I remember discussions about Senate and San Luis in the past I should probably go back to Bureau of Reclamation and get a more specific answer for you please do do you have any other items would you like Ken I love our Karros we're doing work at los Vaqueros we're also working with it's a local state federal project just like like sites go ahead and try it Frank Erne canal were worried about the science issues they're worse I mean talk about in congressman caucus mentioned that earlier and let me quickly mention when we passed the Wynn act we allowed for the front water users to actually contract out under the theory that it could be expedited and it could be more cost-effective are you looking at continuing to pursue that authorization under the Wynn Act allow the Friant water users to go ahead and do the repairs there yes sir I think that is a viable option we've we've given frying ten million dollars so far there's 2.4 million in wind funds that we requested in February that would be applicable to Friant okay in addition to that thought you had precedent with the Contra Costa Water District in returning their canal to the district that allows them to finance against it one of the ways in which the parent water users could potentially finance the repairs that are necessary that are in several hundred millions of dollars would be to return the Friant current canal to the Friant water users are you considering that I'm not aware of that specific instance I can't say more generally the Bureau of Reclamation is very interested in pursuing title transfer to a wide variety of water facilities where the local district is interested in taking and I think there will be interest here and I think you had a look into that let me before my time expires talk about fall X - you're familiar with it under the by opps currently it's an action to hold salinity at certain levels above normal and hydrological years like the one we're experiencing this year which is a good one additionally under this science performed since 2008 there's demonstrated a little impact on fall X - flows and improving delta smelt population sadly because we would like that and while the use of the water and this matter flows on improving delta smelt projects populations the limited amount of water available for other beneficial uses so my question is this does this budget request enough funding to implement a pilot project this year to find a less harmful alternative than the fall X to flows we are spending money and reclamation and US Geological Survey to look at alternatives using current fall execute flows and would be happy to give you a more specifically response well we'd like to pursue that because we do have a good year this year as I noted 154 156 percent of normal although we have some issues with allocations since we have such a good year that I will visit tomorrow with the Commissioner but having said that there's an opportunity here to implement a pilot project since our current efforts have sadly not been successful on increasing the population at the delta smelt as we hoped you're absolutely correct congressman and and that is as a priority and we are you'll be interested in working with you to try to accomplish that all right well we will pursue that and I will yield back I think the balance of my time and we'll continue to look forward to trying to balance our water needs using all the water tools and our water toolbox thank you

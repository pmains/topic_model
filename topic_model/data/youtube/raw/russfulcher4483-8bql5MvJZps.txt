senator fulcher this week a federal judge overturned idaho's constitutional ban on same-sex marriage when this ban was first passed in the legislature and sent to the voters you called it a culture war will there ever be a point at which you lay down your arms in this culture war and move on to other issues and how much should we spend before we make that call well i think it's important to point out that idahoans don't tolerate discrimination nor should they and i think our current laws do a pretty good job in that arena frankly i was surprised to see that that judge ruled the way that they did especially in light of a u.s supreme court ruling that was the u.s versus windsor that clearly gave the states the right to define marriage within that state i believe that that i took the right position in 2006 in standing for the marriage amendment and i stand with the people of idaho to this day on that issue and so how far should we go to try to uphold this in the face of adverse court decisions i think we challenge that because the supreme court has already ruled that the states have the ability to define what marriage is and that's what idaho did in 2006. i stand with the idahoans yes well first off melissa i i believe as russ has already said i believe that there isn't any idahoan that really wants discrimination but in this case anything that approaches our values on marriage is going to be looked at very very closely i intend to pursue this all the way to the supreme court and i i suspect that that's where we're going to end up in in 2006 the people overwhelmingly uh identified marriage in idaho in article 3 section 28 of the constitution and said that marriage is between one man and one woman and so i raised my hand and promised pledged to defend the constitution of the state of idaho and that's fully what i intend to do governor utter a follow-up you have vigorously fought this case can you please discuss how gay and lesbian couples threaten traditional marriage in your view well i think when you redefine marriage you redefine the whole idea of family and i say again we're not anti-gay and idaho we're not anti-gay lesbian we are pro-marriage and we're pro-traditional marriage and once again betsy anything that approaches to change that definition or that culture or that value is going to be looked upon a little tough in idaho i'm curious that same question for senator fulcher how does a gay marriage affect a marriage between a man and a woman well what happens when when you start redefining marriage is you start impacting other laws throughout the state for example uh when when that gets redefined the religious freedom issue comes to play and so there's a direct conflict there and so the religious freedom issue is foundational in the united states of america and as soon as as that redefinition of marriage starts coming into play then there's an automatic conflict with the freedom of religion okay the next question is for governor otter from dan popke evening governor evan dan two of your principal initiatives the students come first laws and your effort on transportation infrastructure were very significant failures uh approaching a third term how can you assure voters that you'll be able to succeed with your agenda in in another four years well i think we began that last year when we established a task force instead of just presenting a program on furthering education on reforming education in idaho we put together a task force of all the stakeholders and they those stakeholders sat down and i believe they came forth with 20 great recommendations on how we can reform and improve idaho so that we have the workforce ready for companies when they want to expand in idaho or companies that want to move into idaho and i think you've heard me say before i'm the first to admit that i believe we had a good product but a bad process with props one two and three perhaps it was the same way with transportation and so i'm going to pay a lot more attention even though we've got a good product with the with the 20 recommendations i'm going to pay a lot more attention to process a follow-up for the for the incumbent of course uh when you when you took office you promised uh accountability at the department level and accountability the buck stopped at your desk after that um yet you've had to deal with the scandals involving the corrections corporation of america and the operation of the private prison and with this ongoing problem with the contract for the high school broadband um where does the box stop and who has been held responsible for those scandals well the buckstop did stop with my office and that's why we've got an investigation and an fbi in investigation into the whole cca pro in into the cca prison problem we expect to be able to take action once we've proven the facts uh there's still a question about how much bookkeeping was and wasn't then proper and so that's part of the investigation as well dan so i'll take that action when i have all the facts all right the next question is for senator fulcher and that comes from me as well senator uh you tried mightily to stop the health exchange and then you supported overturning it uh repealing it you first supported common core and then tried to overturn it you didn't get anywhere as a member of leadership this year on on those matters if you can't succeed as a member of leadership in the senate what confidence should voters have that you're going to succeed as governor i think we can and i think that the people of idaho are realizing some of the the realities of what comes with the affordable care act i think the people people of idaho are realizing what comes with the realities of common core we have the the we have our back against the wall at this point and we have an opportunity i believe to create a parallel path a free market component to the obama care exchange an alternative to that that truly puts the money in the hands of the people i also believe we have an opportunity with common core to put in place a best-in-class type of system that truly empowers our teachers and our parents those things make sense and so now that that everyone realizes exactly what we were sold it's time to take them back well i'm i guess i'm i'm interested in how you're going to convince the other people you have to convince as a member of a of a government with three branches um you're part of a slate you lead this slate of anti-establishment candidates uh up and down the ticket and you're attempting to overturn the power structure uh in in the idaho republican party and that's run this government for uh you know most of the last 60 years um how can you work with people with whom you differ on these fundamental issues if you are elected governor i don't think we differ i think what has happened is we've come up with some better ideas and i'll give you an example on the affordable care act there is a superior solution to that and it includes several components health care savings accounts health care membership components a direct pay component these are things that are a superior solution opening up competition those are better ideas and the the very people who pass this now see that there is a better solution we can drive i guess you count votes differently than i do i mean there was this was there was a long debate about these issues you lost i'm i'm asking how are you going to change people's minds dan again those things weren't on the table at that point we were trying to stop the affordable care act because it was it's the most massive expansion of government in our lifetimes and now that we have the realities of dealing with it there are better solutions that have come forth we can make this happen we can do it if i might that's up governor i'd like to respond to that first off i'm very proud of the fact that 88 of the senate leadership has endorsed my candidacy i'm proud of the fact that those same people were the ones that saw the wisdom in keeping obamacare out of idaho by voting to have our own insurance exchange in idaho those other states you know russ russ is dealing with fantasy here because those other states that didn't establish their own exchange have obamacare on steroids in their state and they're having big problems with it we have the chance with our own insurance exchange and i predict in four to five years there will be a private sector insurance exchange that will compete with our that will compete and take over uh from our state exchange because our folks have been able to work on it themselves these other folks that didn't get uh the the advice that i think that they should have to establish their own exchange you know they now have acorn and planned parenthood and and other subsets of uh acorn uh actually doing the navigating we have your local insurance agent we have the guy that's been selling you insurance actually doing that navigating melissa there's an opportunity to respond back here though senator understand idaho was the only republican-led state in the nation who chose to partner with president obama there is a reason for that and the reason for that is because it is a massive expansion of government and it takes away the control of the people and puts it in the hands of the government that's wrong governor uh earlier this month you said you were thrilled that you had reached your project 60 goal but at the same time according to the department of labor idaho ranks in the bottom third nationally for average wage and per capita income can you explain why the ranking at the bottom third meets your expectations and what people should do to as they start making their careers planning for their careers and be here in idaho well aaron that doesn't meet my expectations um the the ranking in the bottom third would never uh meet my expectations what i was celebrating was the fact that we had reached project 60 goal and the project 60 goal was to grow our economy from where it was when i became governor to 60 billion dollars of total economic activity i reasoned that if we could raise 3.2 billion dollars on our uh economy as it was with the same tax structure then we would have 650 to 700 million dollars to properly extra to properly fund all the roles of government including being able to cut taxes we have now cut taxes 150 million dollars and we are refunding government at a pretty good level we've got a lot of efficiencies in government and through the recession through those tough times we made some tough decisions i'm not going to go back to some of the wasteful things that we did in government that we learned we didn't have to do while we were going through the recession and so as we lowered taxes we still have the necessary income this year was 2.85 billion dollars to fund the proper roles of government and we are doing that so what would you do differently to stimulate the economy if the voters decide to send you into another term well i think we've already announced uh accelerate idaho and accelerate idaho is the idea that number one we're going to take care of the people that already brought us to the dance those citizens those companies that are here we're going to try to get them to grow here and one of the ways we get them to grow here is a workforce that can do the jobs that they want done i believe our 20 recommendations and our goal of reaching 60 percent of the people in idaho between the ages of 30 25 and 34 having a a secondary degree or a skill level license i believe both of those will present that workforce for the state of idaho and as those folks see that they will come forward remember we were at eight point eight percent unemployment during the depth of the recession today we're at five point two all right the next continuing i'd like to comment on that please here's the situation with project sixty it really didn't come to bear the reason that those numbers were reached were only because of inflation and the value of the dollar in the last eight years for the most part we have been stagnant and so that that goal is is just largely misinterpreted can i respond to that briefly and then it's time to move on i didn't use uh inflation when i decided where i was starting i said what i want to do is grow the total economic activity we don't and we grew that total net economic activity to 60 billion dollars russ the numbers just don't bear that out is my point senator a question for you you voted against the idaho reimbursement incentive act it was touted as a way to create new higher paying jobs here in the state of idaho presumably that's because you don't want uh the state picking winners and losers but how do you create higher paying jobs without favoring the businesses that actually create those jobs three things first thing you do is you put that alternative in place to the affordable care act because it's a job killer and if you don't believe that talk to the small business people out there because they're seeing the negative impact that now the second thing that we do is we focus on stem education and there's ways to do that without raising taxes science technology engineering and math there's an undeniable link between stem and prosperity in economic growth the third thing you do is you go drive access access wise balanced access to the natural resources in our state our timber our mining our energy that is our real wealth and there lies true economic growth potential if i could ask a real quick follow-up and that is what role should the government have in helping the economy well i think our our biggest obligation is to try to reduce the tax burden and the regulatory burden that's the most fair way to open up competition is to make it easy for everyone the reason i've voted against that reimbursement act was exactly right it was the government picking winners and losers we need to level the playing field and lower the tax burden lower the regulatory structure for everyone so i i have a question along those lines if idaho's economy is recovering why are our wages still 49th in the nation ahead of only mississippi and and what if anything should the government do to address this and i'll throw it to senator fulcher the reason that we are the second highest in the nation for minimum wage jobs is because we've been relegated to a service-based economy and the reason we've been relocated to a service-based economy is because we have been squeezed out from what god gave us which is our resources folks the true manufacturing base is our timber it's our mining it's our lands it's the energy sources there we have been relegated away from those things and it gets worse because we've allowed the federal government to come in with encroachments like endangered species the epa and when you take away a people's wealth when you take away the access to the resources you relegate them to a service-based economy you get minimum wage jobs and that's where idaho is governor otter well first off we we never invite the federal government into the state of idaho um we we try to do those things ourselves in fact i mentioned in my opening speech about how we've been fighting against the wolves because we decided to do nothing in 1995. we said no it's yours you bring you you go ahead and run it that's the exact same thing that those who voted against the establishment of the insurance exchange were saying all over again they hadn't learned from the wolf episode because it took us so long to finally get management now we do have management we are responsibly controlling the wolves in idaho i'd like to respond to that and it's a great idea to get back all our land and i wish them well only i just don't think it's going to happen but i would ask them this question and everybody that pursues the idea of us automatically getting back all our land in idaho i say again i wish him well i'd love to have the fact that we have all that land here but two years ago my fire bill was 220 million dollars and that wasn't an exceptional year but two years ago 220 million dollars i actually paid 14 million of it walked and the federal government paid the two other the other 206. now let's say we have all that land here now i've got a 220 million dollar bill where are you going to get the 206. you've got three areas you can get the 206 million dollars education corrections or health and welfare where are you going to take it from let's uh go out there and do our logging do our mining and uh you'll have the money to pay it senator fulcher would you like to respond on this issue we will never achieve a goal if we don't set it and put a plan forth to go get it there is a unique opportunity to do this now and the reason is is because it makes sense for everyone our current path is not sustainable 36 percent of our state budget comes from the feds they're broke it makes sense at this point for them to be able to turn over some of that land for idaho to manage it and for them to get federal tax money from idaho's growth we can do this senator can you can you cite a member of congress with any kind of clout that supports this idea the governor has talked about this he served in congress with and on the republican side and his colleagues didn't want to give up land that they believed it belongs to all the people of the united states dan there's there's two approaches it sounds like a pipe dream they're giving it it's not it's not and the state of hawaii has done this and so there is a precedent for it i believe it's the most likely past state of hawaii has gotten the federal government to return its land that's my understanding and is hawaii like idaho uh yes let me let me finish the law there's there's two approaches okay the first approach i believe is most likely and that's through the states and if you're interested in this topic take a look at american lands council there is a constitutional legal path to go get this done to your point there is also a congressional path representative labrador has put forth and it's already passed through the house a transition pilot program for 200 000 acres of land would transition management from the federal government to the state government but we have to go do this this is our wealth this is our prosperity and without it we will be a service-based economy with minimum wage jobs that's where we are now okay senator but we can disagree about whether it's a long shot or not but let's say it doesn't happen uh what's your plan for the economy uh if if this is the silver bullet there's actually some low-hanging fruit we have energy in our lands at idaho that we have not yet harvested we have natural gas in washington and payette county a lot of that is on private land a lot of that is on state land every single state with a budget surplus is an energy exporter 87 percent of the power powering this room in your home is imported we have an energy industry in idaho that is untapped and we can tap into that that's like an entire other economic leg under the stool for the state of idaho governor otter briefly russ i have been signing lease after lease after lease after lease for oil companies and gas companies that come into idaho the 4.2 million cubic foot well that we hit in the in the little canyon the little grove canyon was one of the most proved up for us that was the first time we really knew that we had gas in idaho and we we fought all of the the naysayers that said no no no you can't do that and let me also go to the public lands if i might just for a second what is not well known is in the agricultural bill that was passed this year this spring governors were given 60 days to identify 12 million or to identify the acreage in their state that was either under threat from bug kill from insect kill or from disease or from overgrowth and therefore a great fire danger in idaho we turned our report in about 10 days earlier than we had to because we already had the collaborative groups working in each of the national forests in idaho we identified 12 million acres that were threatened we identified 1.8 million acres that we want to be able to go in and clean up so that we can prevent the fires and that we can stop the spread of disease and insects into our state lands senator fulcher you wanted to respond further evidence that we can get this done is it just makes sense when a federal government is 18 trillion in debt and there's an opportunity to get some of that debt relieved by transitioning some of that management it makes sense for the state because there's an economic engine that comes with it it makes sense for the federal government because with the state's economic engine comes more federal taxes and it makes sense for the environmental community because it's less likely to have forest fires and all the pollution in the airshed and the watershed this can be done because it makes sense senator fulcher you like all the candidates here are running as a republican but there is clearly a big rift in the idaho republican party right now what in your eyes does it really mean to be an idaho republican well we're like any organization there's a platform that comes with being part of that organization and the republican party has a platform and i i stand with that platform i frequently muse get amused when people say you're you're on on the fringe somewhere and my opponent has indicated that i'm on the fringe what's interesting about all that is i'm the one who sided with the party on obamacare i'm the one who sided with the party on common core i'm the one who sided with the party on the closed primary i'm the one who side side with the party and filled out my survey so i guess i just have to kind of look at this thing and go well all right then who's really on the fringe because my opponent didn't do those things i same question governor otter there is a big rift in the idaho republican party what does it mean to you to be an idaho republican well are you looking to are you looking to heal this rift or to eject those who disagree with you i am looking to heal the rift the rift actually started over the close primary if you'll recall the chairman of the party when i when i first took office was against the close primary as was ben usursa as was a lot of other people we were against the closed primary and that's where the first big rift came when they threw out my chairman i was the only governor in the united states that didn't have my selection of the of the ruling party or of the governing party uh and and had my own chairman so uh now let's fast forward i think one of the things leadership requires is reality uh why would you mislead people into thinking that you can automatically take away their right to vote on their on their united states senators why would you take people's uh access to the polls away from them by closing your primary in fact it's very convenient from time to time for some of these folks who wanted to close the primary and did close the primary and then all of a sudden go out and advertise to the democrats into the constitutionalist to the independent party and to the libertarian party say oh cross over go ahead and cross sign this piece of paper and cross over and vote for us so maybe it wasn't so important that this rift got started in the first place did you want to respond you know this goes a little bit deeper than what any of us have really talked about if you take a look at this at the landscape out there you've you see a number of groups and there'll be pachyderms and reagan republicans and rally right and constitutionalism liberty caucus there's this host of of people who say you know what i used to be a republican but the republican party left me the real issue is that many republicans and i would say my good friend standing next to me is one of them have strayed away from that base of what is a true republican well i would say phil batt and ronald reagan were two of the best republicans that i can ever remember and both of them said in large the 10th the person that i disagree with 20 of the time and agree with 80 percent of the time is not my enemy so governor if those things that are in the platform that have been talked about that you disagree with are not what it means to be an idaho republican what does it mean well once again i think leadership requires you to lead and you need to lead with reality and to be able to do some of those things you saw my response to the republican party when they asked me which of these of these platforms which of these planks did i agree with and which didn't i agree with i want to tell you we we received from the republican headquarters when the legislature was going on and and we were trying to establish the state health insurance exchange and keep obamacare on steroids out of the state we every republican received a letter from him said remember the republican plan remember the republican plan but when they started crossing over in the primary the very essence of the reason the party got split apart in the first place then not one word was said so i think being a leader being a leader in the republican party requires reality and it also requires leadership if i've made melissa please in order to unite and i do believe we need to unite and frankly i need to be able to unite some of those groups if i'm going to win and i believe we are next week but the reality is this you re unite by rallying around the major issues most important to conservatives within our state and that's the control of our health care and our education by the people not by the government senator fulcher just a quick follow-up you were an advocate of the closed primary but you did as the governor suggested uh appeal to recruit democrats and and members of the other mine you're the one who said i was appealing to the democrats i read i read the one who wrote about it yes who i was appealing to was the people who used to be republicans and those are mostly liberty caucus members constitutionalist ron paul reagan republican rally right those groups i have to pull them in you're making said democrats can register a re-register for republicans it transitioned over as democrats and if that's so i welcome you back because i am not going to stray away from our party well it doesn't isn't that opportunistic to uh to say uh i'm for republicans picking our nominee no except when i'm running it's in the democratic no it's not it's about uniting around a platform i believe in the republican party platform and i'm asking people who think likewise to unite with me governor otter do you want to respond briefly to that well i guess we can say it over and over and over again but leadership requires a heavy dose of reality and not to mislead people into thinking that they can achieve something they can't i i say again i wish them well on the public lands i say again i think in three or four five years we're going to have a private sector answer to our health care exchange because our people are so innovative and unique in coming up with new products right here in the state of idaho all right governor i'm going to have to cut you off it's time to go to closing remarks and you're up first for close well ladies and gentlemen once again thank you for providing this opportunity to discuss the issues that are most important to the people of idaho because that's what this election is all about this election is about you your future your hopes your dreams and ensuring that we have the freedom and the means to achieve them i think i've experienced a lot as your governor and i'm putting all that i've experienced to work every day to improve on how i do my job in serving you our state is filled with good people who want to do the right thing and they ask little more of their government than to join them in that effort we all want and deserve government that is open and transparent we all want and deserve government that enables us to participate fully in crafting idaho solutions to the challenges that we face we all want and deserve people in our government who are positive and encouraging and who share the responsible conservative values that we all have i'm honored to have been through the refining fire with you and i'm excited about continuing to face the challenges of today and tomorrow together we can achieve our vision of idaho that is safer more prosperous and more united than ever before i'm butch otter and i'm humbly asking for your vote on may 20th thank you all right thank you governor senator fulcher thank you ladies and gentlemen under governor otter idaho voluntarily embraced obamacare and yet another federal education program we have increased our dependency on a bankrupt federal government and the governor says that he was able to balance the budget without raising taxes and governor i would say you're welcome because you tried and if it weren't for myself and then representative labrador you would have raised taxes on gas and on registration fees so now idaho is the second highest in the nation for having the most the highest percentage of minimum wage jobs and one of the state's least friendly to do business our economy is stagnant bad the policies are bad and they're not sustainable we must take control of our health care we and not let the government do it we must drive access to our natural resource base we must put education under the control of our parents and our teachers my fellow idahoans i ask you to ask yourself are you better off today than you were eight years ago if you're like most of us the answer is no it is time to shake up the establishment my name is russ fulcher i'm running for governor and i ask your vote on may 20th

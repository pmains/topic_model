I'm Ben Sasse and I'm in San Bernardino California standing outside the site where 35 of our neighbors bled this week 14 of them died in this Massacre this neighborhood should not be a part of a war zone this neighborhood should not be a battleground so why is it because we're in open society we're a free society and our enemies hate freedom and we owe it to those who died this week to tell the truth about the nature of this conflict we owe it to these 14 we owe it to their families we owe it to the servicemen and women in uniform who are abroad right now fighting for our freedom some of whom whom will come home in caskets and frankly we owe it to the families of those who are still yet to die in the future all adults know that the jihadi attacks we face on our homeland are not over these will not be the last people to bleed and die because we are a free society and so we should tell the truth about the enemy we face we should tell the truth about them but we should also be honest about who we are and we should reaffirm our core values we are not at war with terrorism which is just a tactic we are not at war with some empty sociological label called extremism we are not even just at war with Isis though we're obviously at war with Isis but there will be other entities that will lift the black flag of death in the future even after Isis has been routed in Syria and Iraq this is not about workplace violence this is not about global warming or gun shows this is not about income inequality this is not about kids from broken homes as tragic as that is this is not about anything that we have done wrong this is about who we are this is about the nature of freedom so who are we were people who unite around the Constitution we're people who come together around the First Amendment and we together 320 million of us believe in the freedom of religion in the freedom of speech in the freedom of assembly in the freedom of the press I am NOT a Muslim but as an American I stand and defend the rights of American Muslims to freely worship even though we differ about important theological matters in America we are free to believe different things and to argue about those beliefs it matters what you think about the nature of God and whether he's revealed himself what you think about salvation matters heaven and hell matters but these things are so important that we don't try to solve them by violence and we come together as a community a community of Americans who believe in the constitutional Creed to unite around those core American values like freedom of religion we are most certainly though at war with militant Islam we are at war with violent Islam we are at war with jihadi Islam we are not at war with all Muslims we're not at war with Muslim families in Dearborn Michigan who want the American dream for their kids but we are at war with those who believe that they will kill in the name of religion President Obama said tonight he's worried about a backlash against American Muslims I am too and you know what the best way to combat that is with the truth by being clear about who we are and what we stand for and by being clear about those who would try to kill us because we believe in freedom we are at war with militant or jihadi Islam but we are not at war with people who believe in the American creed which includes the right of everybody of every religion to freely worship and to freely speak and to freely assemble and argue we will win this battle but we will not win it without reaffirming our core values we will win it because of who we are and because of the ways we continue to fight for a free society for all Americans

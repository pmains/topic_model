congress just passed a stimulus and it is just not enough relief we need to do more in a biden administration and to understand why let me break down the economic alphabet we expect more of kind of a w-shaped recovery recovery we're having a v-shaped recovery don't worry it's not greek it's just simple economics the letters represent the shape that the economic recovery looks like when you chart it on a graph donald trump likes to talk about one letter in particular we've been talking about the v this is better than a v this is a rocket ship the fantasy of a v-shaped recovery is that the downward dip in the economy will get erased as the economy recovers right back to where it was before the v makes it look like everyone dips down and jumps back equally but that's not what's happening what's happening is a k-shaped recovery special case look for the big red k okay okay a recovery looks like a k when an economy bounces back from a recession in an unequal way one group including the billionaires and giant corporations not only recover but some of them even do a lot better everyone else falls sharply and struggles to make it back it's a story of the haves and the have-nots take a big corporation like amazon they get even bigger by putting their workers at risk partly because the trump administration refuses to enforce laws meant to keep workers healthy and safe and while regulators are asleep at the switch giant companies can use the recession as an opportunity to gobble up struggling competitors to become even bigger monopolies and guess what the wealth is not trickling down as much as some executives want you to think it does but that's very expensive during the first six months of the pandemic the richest people in the united states became 845 billion dollars wealthier this year we even inaugurated our first class of centi billionaires yup you heard me right that's people whose net worth is more than a hundred billion dollars meanwhile on the other side of the k the picture is not so rosy the pandemic has forced 40 million americans to file for unemployment creating a gaping hole in our economy the cares act provided some real relief after it passed in march we saw the share of people in poverty in the united states drop and incomes rise but then those programs expired so the glimmer of hope for a stable recovery diminished as summer turned into fall the share of americans in poverty spiked at its fastest rate ever recorded and now congress just passed a bill that won't do enough to stop the devastation so congress's to-do list in the new year must include relief and we must permanently upgrade the nation's safety net so our economy is not held hostage to republican inaction during the next crisis and if congress is unwilling then president biden should do everything he can to get families relief by taking big bold executive action and our new president he knows his economic alphabet the president says it's a v-shape recovery you say it's a k-shaped recovery what's the difference the difference is millionaires and billionaires like him in the middle of cover crisis have done very well but you folks at home how old are you doing we need to act to avoid the disparities of a k-shaped downturn from damaging our economy and our families for decades to come investing in all of us is how we recover as a nation and how we build a future that is more equitable and more resilient than ever

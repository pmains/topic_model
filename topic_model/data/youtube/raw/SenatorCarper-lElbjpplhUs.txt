the uh was he first of all delighted with the the turnout delighted with the question and the the excellent witnesses that uh that that joined us to today every one of them conveyed a sense of urgency and we have scariness right in the face the date of april at which time the the revenues that uh increase revenues and postal services realized over the last couple of years uh go away and that's been one of the things that's been able the uh the postal service to sort of keep their heads up above water and there's a seems to be a real uh concurrence here that that we need to move that forward extend that for for a bit longer and uh and my hope is that we will do that the um they're only they're about three or four really big issues that need to be resolved there's a lot of better a lot of smaller issues about three or four big ones and i think there's a fair amount of encouragement that the postal service which pays more money into medicare uh for them for the postal service and for their employees than all but one other employer in the country yet their retirees once they reach the age of 65 don't fully participate in them they don't realize the full benefit of making all that those payments that's just not fair that's not right we need to address that and i think that that would that we can so there's a i think this was i think the there's a fair amount of consensus around the issues with postal service the uh folks who represent the unions who represent their employees uh broad range of their uh their uh uh stakeholders customers and so forth seems to be a lot of current uh concurrence and uh i'm encouraged by that uh center um the chairman said that he uh that you were looking for a touchdown and maybe we should start thinking about a field goal did what did you make of those comments do you think that maybe he wants a smaller scope yeah well you know in in delaware i went to the university of delaware fighting blue hair and before the ohio state is an undergrad so in the navy in between but i come from a couple schools that uh we we play a lot of football football and i think football analogy is good i use them a lot the uh but at ohio state or uh uh university of delaware uh we never took a field goal on the first or second or third down and we might in some cases kick on the fourth down and hopefully make it but uh it's not fourth down and gold to go it's probably first or second down and uh we uh at some point in time we may have to kick the field goal right now i i want us to i always get a touchdown and not just for for congress but for for really for three folks the postal service the employees their customers and our taxpayers we need a touchdown for for them and uh if in the end we have to settle for a field goal we will but i certainly wouldn't start there now we got a couple of downs left let's use them how's that for football analogy huh you got a lot in there at once that's good there's some talk uh hearing about how other countries have privatized their systems is there any support for that um would you even consider that at this stage it's it's not part of our recommendation it's not uh the model i think that that we want to pursue there's a couple of smaller countries i think singapore was one that was mentioned where they've done that and uh i think it makes sense to look around the world and see what the rest of the world is doing what we can learn from them but there's some folks some countries where the the postal postal service owns banks or they own insurance companies and we're not going to do that we're we're not inclined to do that so the there's some things that the coastal service can do with the delivery network because the key question for us is how do you take a 240 year old delivery network it goes to every post mailbox in the country five six days a week how do you take that uh a system and actually make money and enable the postal service to make money out of it and we think we can in fact we've heard a bunch of good ideas here today uh following up on the next steps do you have a timeline at all when when you can move this forward i think the next step is to spend some time next week with the uh with chairman johnson and with his staff our folks and and other particularly the co-sponsors of the legislation and any other member of the committee that wants to be a part of it i think next uh next week we just said sit down and have a chance what do we learn uh where is their concurrence and what what are some of the questions that need still to be uh addressed one of the things we've been asking the postal service for some time is something that we got routinely over a year ago from the postal service and that is a 10-year financials 10-year financials that show a forecast what do they expect revenues to be what do they expect expenses to be what are the some of the payments they're going to have to make what does that leave in cash and when what is after the cash is recognized how much cash is available to invest in uh a new fleet they desperately need to replace their uh their delivery modernize it what kind of cash would be left and for modernizing male processing centers where they do a lot of work now with packages and parcels they're going to do more and the last thing we need to do is modernize our uh and put in investing technology in our post offices themselves so at the end of the day when we that we need to see that information i hope is we'll see it next week that would be very helpful and we have a couple people on the phone um we have time for about one question so please hit pound five if you'd like to ask questions if you have a question please hit pound five okay okay all right if anybody has a question here just get a jenny into greg and we'll we'll answer it later we'll work it out thank you all thank you everyone all right take care thank you appreciate your such good job nice to see you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you

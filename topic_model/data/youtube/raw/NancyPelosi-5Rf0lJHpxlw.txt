good afternoon everyone thank you for being with us today as you know two years ago the Congress of the United States made history after a hundred years of trying finally we passed health care for all Americans as a right for all not just a privilege for a few that it honored the vows of our founders of life a healthier life liberty the freedom to pursue our own happinesses today we have people with us who are already benefiting our will benefit from the health care bill I'm pleased to be here with my colleague a democratic whip Steny Hoyer assistant leader Jim Clyburn and we will join together in presenting our guests to you and a special grand Papa oh that is that it calling you from the audience your grandson that that's what it's all about I'd like to thank our friends Bob Bob Meeks Brian England Felicia Williams Elizabeth Barton Steen and carmella Carmen Morales for being with us imagine and this is not hard to do being a parent who has a child with a pre-existing medical condition like asthma or diabetes driving medical bills through the roof and forcing you to choose between paying the mortgage and paying the next doctor's appointment imagine being a college senior getting ready for graduation looking forward to a successful career but you cannot accept your dream job but they do can't because they don't offer health insurance imagine being a senior who relies on Medicare for your health and economic security but faith is rising costs each year for preventative care and prescription drugs or woman charged higher premiums yes women are to tune of a billion dollars more higher premiums than men for the same coverage or a worker locked in a dead-end job unable to pursue your professional pal passion for fear of losing your insurance for too long these are examples are not simply a matter of imagination they are a matter of reality faced by millions of Americans but that all changed for the better with health insurance reform the passage of the Affordable Care Act we made history passing the bill for Congress we made progress for the American people imagine Republicans want to turn back the clock and take away this progress from the American people and they will be voting next week to do so over and over again they keep bringing up one way or another to unravel it in their budgets they'll be voting on this to end the Medicare guarantee making seniors pay more for benefits already the American people are seeing enormous benefits 86 million Americans have received key preventive health benefits under the law for the first time in American history millions of American women have access to pre preventive health care today no child in America is denied health coverage because of a pre-existing medical condition and more than 5 million seniors have saved over 3.2 billion dollars in prescription drug benefits imagine 86 million Americans have already benefited from this and the full bill has yet to go into effect I'm now pleased to introduce my collar colleague a leader on this issue and the Congress and the fight for affordable healthcare to improve the care to increase the access and to lower the cost for healthcare for all Americans and for our country our distinguished whip mr. Hoyer of Maryland thank you very much thank you very much you know we usually have our caucus meetings and whip meetings in this room and what a wonderfully diverse wonderful crowd we have here of working Americans of senior Americans a very young Americans whose name is Lucas very proud grandfather standing here now let me tell you I happen to be a great grandfather with as I was saying since it was signed into law two years ago and we celebrate its signing health reform has made it possible for over 32 million seniors on Medicare to access free preventive services the leader said that but it bears repeating this because people need to understand the consequences of what this bill is doing for America and Americans it has reduced the cost of prescription drugs on to Medicare Part D and it will eliminate the doughnut hole by the end of this decade the cost containment provisions in the Affordable Care Act are already slowing the growth of Medicare spending with many beneficiaries premiums and deductibles already going down or growing at the lowest rates in years Republicans on the other hand want to end Medicare guarantee and turn Medicare into a voucher program that would ask seniors to pay more than 6,000 year out of pocket Americans who are aged 54 would have to save an additional listen this an additional hundred and eighty two thousand dollars just to cover their health care costs in retirement the note that doughnut hole would reopen if we repeal the health care bill swallowing an additional forty four billion dollars in extra drug costs for seniors through 220 these are the kinds of figures we're talking about some of you like me in this room are seniors and you understand the consequences of that increase you're now going to hear from an American who was falling into the doughnut hole every year I want to thank him for being here but thanks to the Affordable Care Act his Medicare prescription drug costs are much lower and as I said the doughnut hole is closing so I want to welcome a bob makes here and we want to hear from somebody who has real experience real knowledge and real conviction makes good afternoon my name is Bob Meeks and I am 75 years old or as one of my grandson's pointed out papa that's three-quarters of a century he didn't have to say that i live in brandon Florida near Tampa I'm here on behalf of the Alliance for Retired Americans and for every senior citizen that's in this country that's covered by the ACA during my working career I was a freight truck driver and a car hauler two years ago this week people like representative Pelosi lawyer and Clyburn longer president obama had the courage to stand up to the special interest and enact the Affordable Care Act which is helping millions of seniors seniors like me better afford to see a doctor and fill a prescription I had been in Medicare doughnut hole ever since it began in 2006 when you are in donut hole you must continue to pay your full monthly Medicare d premiums to the insurance company but you received no prescription drug drug benefits to me being a donut hole is like going to a restaurant paying full price for a meal in the waiter brings you a plate empty I am not in the best of health I must take seven daily medications and nearly all our brand names i suffer from COPD severe arthritis and high blood pressure the 40th Affordable Care Act I would fall in a donut hole every year around May my prescriptions were costing me twelve hundred dollars a month and i had to pay it all thanks to the Affordable Care Act i received a two hundred fifty dollar check in 2010 that helped and in 2011 on monthly drug costs of 1200 a month went between went to to between 600 and 800 a month to depend on my health while i wasn't doing that old this has been a huge help to me and my wife I know many seniors are confused and skeptical about the new law but here is what I would say to my fellow seniors and everyone here on Capitol Hill the Affordable Care Act is good it works it's saving seniors lots of money don't be fooled by politicians and their friends who try to scare you to the members of Congress here today thank you for helping me and millions of other seniors and please I implore you don't give up the fight I'm living proof the Affordable Care Act works a little side note to those in DC that oppose the ACA don't remove it improve it thank you very good Bob and I think hopefully to the folks in DC and I presume you mean more particularly on this ill take your advice improve it don't remove it I want to thank you for that not contribution and a real experience not just somebody debating on the floor of the house represents and doesn't do this doesn't do that bob is an example of exactly what it does do and it makes a difference passing the Affordable Care Act was especially important at a time when our economy has forced many families and small businesses to make difficult choices about spending well so many Americans have had that happen to them that's why one of the key parts of the Affordable Care Act is about bringing costs down for small businesses so they can afford insurance for themselves and for those who work with them 360,000 small businesses have already claimed part of the forty billion dollars in tax credits created by the Affordable Care Act to help them provide affordable coverage to over two million workers to talk about the positive effects of health reform is having on the small businesses he and his wife owned in Maryland let me invite lucas's grandfather Brian England up to the podium much will come right up to the podium yeah yeah yeah hello like it is Lucas well well thank you for the opportunity to come here today and as you can see we're a family business and this is new because he's going to be too soon we're committed to offering their health insurance to our employees but over the past 10 years it's become a real struggle we've been accustomed to rates going up anywhere from ten to twenty percent and it's been very difficult to find at different ways to deal with that we've got a great agent it really works hard to give us different options but it still ends up that we have to pay the bill then next page we renew insurance in August so we start thinking about this in May and well I did I standing up here is really a nerve-racking well that's what it was like this year because we'd heard a previous year that rates were going to got twenty percent thirty percent all sorts of scary things were going to happen so when my wife jennifer and I sat down with the agent in front of us we were pretty nervous about it because we pay seventy thousand a year for health insurance for employees so if it's going to got thirty percent you know that's twenty thousand dollars and what you know that's it lets the same amount of money is employing an apprentice so that's a lot of money and where was it going to come from so we sat down and it was just total disbelief when he said it was going to go down six percent six percent down so we wouldn't mode no major changes to our group it's the same insurance company same average age everything was the same and it was going down so there was it just unbelievable is news on top of this there was going to be a new package in their insurance that allowed for our all our employees on the plan to get preventive care with no copay so that was a real bit of boo the first thing I asked why I could not make her agent explained it was the medical loss ratio so it sounded like Chinese to me I didn't know what I was about you know any case I did research in it and it means the eighty percent of my premiums are actually going to go to medical care no it seems amazing that that's what it's about so our rates went down as a small business owner I'm committed to providing good value to our customers it seems only fair the insurance company should provide us good value you can see our nervous oh Emily thank you very much okay so we're so glad something has been done about the health care I want to thank leader Pelosi very much what you've done I know this is a very risky thing I went saw what happened so I really appreciate you doing this this is so important I know it hasn't been easy but you know to help care is working for my business it works in our community because with the local health improvement part it's working for individuals is right for America and it's right for the future generations it passes this technicians inspection test with flying colors thank you very much I'm Jim Clyburn and I represent south carolina's 6th congressional district that proud to serve as assistant to mccredle leader too often in this town the conversation gets bogged down into arkaen process and thorny policies and political calculations you've heard the terms bending the cost curve motions to proceed who wins who loses all of that really missed the point of this landmark legislation it's not about this town it's about real people and their families and their health care it's about saving lives saving money and saving Medicare I'm pleased be here today with two people to real people with some very powerful stories the first one I'm going to introduce I can really identify with as the grandfather of a preemie who came here in 90 days before we expected him who weighed three pounds and four ounces had three operations before he turned 20 pounds so I can relate to Felicia Williams his story Felicia is from Raleigh North Carolina and she is going to tell you about her son Ethan Felicia good afternoon like you said my name is Felicia Williams and my son Ethan was up here with me a moment ago ah yes um I want to especially thank leader Pelosi for giving me the opportunity to come out today and share our story with you and let you know how the Affordable Care Act has helped our family in 2006 my husband and I were very excited parents-to-be he was a law student and I was a manager for a major department store we were newlyweds we had just bought our first home and we felt like we were prepared to start a family I was going to continue working while my husband continued law school but all our plans changed when our son was born Ethan was born with a vascular tumor that required chemotherapy at just six weeks old he was put on oral steroids and tylenol with codeine because he was so small the doctors had to do surgery to insert an external port into his heart to administer the chemo the port had to be monitored constantly to avoid infection even had three surgeries and multiple rounds of chemotherapy before he was one year old Ethan needed round-the-clock care and I had to and I had no other choice other than to quit my job so I could provide that care and when I quit my job we lost our health insurance we were incredibly fortunate that Ethan qualified for Medicaid without it he most likely would have lost his leg and possibly his life not having employer-based health insurance proved to be quite expensive we had no income and now we had to care for a sick child while balancing a mortgage monthly bills and expensive insurance premiums because of my own personal health issues thankfully Ethan's tumor began to heal around the time he turned one and we spent the next year just catching him up to a normal level of development my husband and I managed to hold our heads above water financially for two-and-a-half years we lived frugally stretching the savings we had as much as possible and taking out student loans but in the end we still had to sell our home and move in with family Ethan's third year was fantastic he graduated from all of his therapies and started preschool he was not just walking now but running jumping and hopping with no pain whatsoever in his fourth year the Affordable Care Act was signed into law even though Ethan had proven it had overcome his illness and had proven more than most people will ever have to that he is strong and will fight to be healthy without the Affordable Care Act he would face a lifetime of struggling to get health insurance because of his medical history the Affordable Care Act prohibits insurers from Liberty limiting or denying benefits or coverage for children because of a pre-existing condition in October of 2010 Ethan's oncologist gave him a clean bill of health for the first time in his entire life and now that insurance companies can no longer consider his pre-existing condition of factor we have been able to officially close that chapter in our lives our family's health care struggle may be over but there are millions of other families out there who are dealing with serious medical problems and still need help we cannot pull the rug out from under these families who are finally beginning to feel some relief as Reeves as a result of the Affordable Care Act mom's rising members know how important it is for families to get and maintain affordable health insurance that's why we worked so hard to get the law passed and why will keep fighting to keep it from being repealed or reversed we worked hard to move our country forward on health care and we're not going back to the days when health insurers could deny coverage to our children because of a pre-existing condition or drop us when we get sick we will keep fighting to make quality affordable health care a reality to ensure that we are not just a country who pays lip service to family values but who truly values families and understands the struggles we face thank you very much Felicia in the middle of the health care debate I found myself doing a radio talk show that loud Collins am gentleman called in and began to castigate me and President Obama and all the Democrats were pushing for health care reform he said that he had his insurance he locked his insurance and he didn't want anybody fooling with it well a few moments later a lady called in and she says congressman I don't have a question but I would like to say something to that gentleman who called in a few minutes ago maybe he likes what he has because he's never tried to use it she sound like what I had until I tried to use it and she told the story of contracting cancer breast cancer at 48 years old after being on her insurance since the age of 23 and at the second visit to the doctor she got a notice from insurance company saying she was being dropped I'm going to introduce now Elizabeth Barton Stein she will tell you her story that's why her health her family's health is too important to leave the decisions up to the insurance company good afternoon everyone my name is Elizabeth Barton Stein and I want to thank leader Pelosi and whip Hoyer and congressman Clyburn for the opportunity to tell my story today I know how important it is to have the opportunity to join my parents health insurance plan in October of 2009 I just moved back to my hometown richmond virginia for a job at a small nonprofit i didn't qualify yet to be covered by my new employer and i couldn't join my parents plan in the interim because i was too old my parents wanted to help but there was little they could do my mom works for a church and my dad had lost his job during the recession and then the impossible happened I had a horrible accident at my apartment involving my gas stove where I received second and third-degree burns on my chest arm and hands with the help of a neighbor I was able to walk next door luckily there was a hospital within walking distance and she took me to the hospital and after being admitted they decided to transfer me to the mcd burn unit downtown because my burns were so severe I was kept there overnight and my family and I were more scared about what was to come then we were about the accident that had just happened because we all understood how expensive just one night in a hospital can can be so as scary as scary as this was to me and my family the pain truly after that was the bills there were lots of them by the time all was said and done I owe tens of thousands of dollars for one night stay in the hospital and I was completely uninsured not only will I forever remember that fateful morning but I'm still paying off the medical debt and likely will be for many years to come I definitely made health coverage a top priority ever since and after leaving the first nonprofit job I obtained individual coverage until I was insured at my next job however the end surance I had at the new job was inadequate and so in the meantime with the new health care reform since the law was enacted I was able to add to my mother's plan which we did as a backup but it turned out that that was unnecessary backup because now I'm in an interim job that does not offer health insurance and I don't have to worry about what that means for my for my health and I'd like to thank leaders leader Pelosi for her tremendous leadership on this issue and I'd like to thank groups like the young Invincibles for giving voice to the challenges our generation faces and obtaining quality affordable health care I wish the Affordable Care Act had been passed sooner but I'm glad that it's now the law of the land I don't have to worry anymore that an unexpected accident could leave me owing medical bills for years to come and now I don't have to worry about insurance coverage when making a career move thank you thank you very much Bob Meeks Brian England Felicia willems Elizabeth Barton Stein and now I have the privilege of introducing Carmen Morales this is a pretty exciting for me because the issue of hell this bill affects women is something quite remarkable because up until a passage of this bill being a woman was considered having a pre-existing medical condition no more in recent weeks as we all know the issue of women's health has taken center stage an affordable care act we put women at the center ensuring that women are in charge of their own health decisions and providing access to life-saving preventive care consider just a few benefits for women in the Affordable Care Act it bans insurance companies from dropping women when they get sick but when they become pregnant Bandz insurance companies from crying women to obtain a pre-authorization or referral for access to OB GYN care I think this would be so obvious beginning the summer beginning this summer it ensures free comprehensive women's preventive care services including contraception in new plans you can it ends the common practice of gender rating charging women substantially higher premiums than men for the same coverage beginning in 2014 nuh said earlier ensures that being a woman is no longer a pre-existing medical condition I'm now pleased to introduce Carmen Morales who will share her powerful story about the personal benefits of healthcare reform to her Thank You Carmen for being with good afternoon I would like to thank leader Pelosi whip Hoyer and assistant leader clybourn for this opportunity on the second anniversary of the Affordable Care Act I am a nurse practitioner and a certified diabetes educator in bakersfield california at current medical center a public hospital let me tell you about how the Affordable Care Act is making an impact in my community recently we had a 25 year old previously uninsured but now covered through her mother's insurance plan come to us because she found a suspicious lump 25 years old is awfully young to be finding these kinds of things but as it turned out she had a very strong family history of breast cancer she was able to get the necessary tests and treatments and as it was as it turned out it was cancerous we got her into surgery quickly and we were able to remove the lump and thankfully we got it all her access to our clinic probably saved her life because we caught it early we were able to avoid a disfiguring and costly surgery now she'll be able to have follow-up care to make sure the disease doesn't return or come to another part of her body she will be able to get the necessary testing she needs for her other family members her children her daughters and she'll be able to take care of her family I'm going to continue to advocate for the Affordable Care Act because I've seen how it works how it saves lives I want my patients to remain healthy and I want them to be able to lead productive lives right now in Bakersfield there is a team of nurses who are out on the floors educating patients about the Affordable Care Act and I'm asking you to please make sure that this work does not end it is so important thank you our very special guest well I'm going to yield to his mom from rot moms rising to tell us what's going to happen now for a moment we have brought a book full of stories from Mom's rising members from all across the country who have shared their stories with us to tell us how the Affordable Care Act has helped them in their own family's lives and it also includes our story look at this go around thank you all very much as you hear from these stories this is the liberation this is what our founders had in mind ever expanding opportunity for people if you want to be a photographer or a writer or a musician whatever an artist you want to be self-employed if you want to start a business if you want to change jobs you no longer are prohibited from doing that because of that you can have access to health care especially because you do not want to put your family at risk how many people in America do you think have a pre-existing medical condition that is they may have been sick when they were little or they had cancer and now cancer free and isn't that a celebration but you always carry the pre-existing condition and the discrimination with you until now until now and we cannot let that be rolled back that affects tens of millions of Americans directly and their families as well so our whole country with that we'd be pleased to take just a few questions hopefully on this subject yes well the gentleman's question is about the budget in general and it does have an impact on our conversation here in terms of healthcare right from the start the Republicans have tried to make an assault on the Affordable Care Act it's hard to understand why they would be against ending for pre-existing conditions from and keeping people from getting health insurance and women from getting preventive care and children for having the access to care that they need but for whatever reason they do and bless their hearts they act upon what they believe they do not believe in this bill and they are trying to roll it back we cannot let that happen at the same time and they're distorted priorities in their budget I'm a little hepped up about this today because this bill is being in the process of being written their budget bill before it comes to the floor they passed their bill will have our alternative I hope but the fact is that in the bill they break the guarantee the Medicare guarantee for seniors that means seniors pay more over six thousand dollars more I think standing mention that figure over six thousand dollars more how many and all the money you would have to save in advance 182 thousand dollars what could they possibly be thinking I'll tell you what I think they're thinking and I don't question their motivation they don't believe in Medicare and bless their hearts again they are acting upon their beliefs their belief is that Medicare should wither on the vine and this budget is a step in the direction of Medicare withering on the vine and so we see a situation where they put forth a budget which doesn't even honor their own agreements in terms of of what the amount that budget should be breaks the Medicare guarantee with seniors right raises cuts jobs it's simply not a statement of our national values that a budget should be and I want to yield to mr. Hoyer and mr. Clyburn friendly comments they let me say one thing I do want to add is there was bipartisan opposition to the budget that came out of the Budget Committee it was a totally Bart partisan bill in terms of passage but it was a bipartisan opposition in that bill because it has the wrong priorities and in fact in my opinion will make the debt deficit and the economy worse and move in exactly the wrong direction as well as undermining the guarantee and competence that people have at Medicare and Social Security and other programs will be there for them when they need it yes I think the president has been absolutely great on health care without the president we would not have this bill I have sinned and every day every day since the passage of the bill the administration has moved in a very positive direction to implement it so we stay on schedule so many of the benefits that our people are enjoying now are put forth the secretary they change as many cabinet secretaries people in the administration are taking the message forward in the country and without the president no bill I'll just tell you this that the day after the bill was passed the president called me said last night when the health care bill was passed in the house I was happier than I was the day I was elected president of the united states that beautiful i said well i was pretty happy last night to mr. president by not happier than when you were elected president of the United said as if you weren't elected president of the United States we would not be passing this historic legislation to make progress for the American people we're very grateful to the president for his leadership yes sir well I'm thinking and much more positive vain than you just posed it but I guess that's a fair question and again if my colleagues have anything to say about the president's participation or the case next week we knew what we were doing when we pass this bill it is ironclad constitutionally what happens in the courts is another matter but we believe that that we're in pretty good shape going into the court it's interesting though because our Republican colleagues now this may be more on the subject than you want to know but they have been opponents they have been opponents of judicial review they have said that the Congress when the Congress acts and the president signs the bill that is the law of the land and they oppose judicial review meaning the courts can review the constitutionality of the law in fact they even said Marbury vs. Madison which established the principle at the beginning of our country was wrongly decided that was then so opposed to are they two opposing their friends and the insurance industry or to whom they are handmaidens that they have even broken with their opposition to judicial review to take this important bill which means so much to the American people to the courts but I have faith in the courts own I had faith in the bill and we will see what happens next week but I well we won't know next week but I know all of America will be watching to see the proceedings at least means meaning every American who has a child with a pre-existing condition a family history that can be so described any woman who is concerned about the health her health of the help their fat her family any senior who's concerned about Medicare and what that guarantee means to a person's health and their Economic Security it means anybody who cares about innovation in our country for a new kind of healthcare that's not just about the health care and America but the good health of America about prevention and the rest about innovation to take us to customized personalized care anyone who cares about lowering costs expanding opportunist and improving the quality of healthcare that sounds like it should include a lot of people at least people who are aware of what is in the bill so I hope that all of you will help us make people more aware of what is in the bill because it really honors the greatness of our country right senator Kennedy and toward the right as we were in the debate and toward the end of his life so this is the great unfinished business of America that all people should have access to quality affordable healthcare as a right for all Americans and not just a privilege a privilege for a very few so in that spirit we are proud of the work that was done it was a compromise it wasn't the bill I would have written but it is a bill that will make a big difference that is making a big difference so I pray that the courts will make the right decision but we have sent them they have been sent the right bill so I thank you all very much let us thank our real people who are here today ring thank you

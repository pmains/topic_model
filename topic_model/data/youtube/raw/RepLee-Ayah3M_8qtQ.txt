I mean I was represented barbara Lee from California and Councilman Lee and you're just the person we wanted to talk to on this because you have long opposed what you have seen as it's us interference in the Middle East and starting wars in the Middle East that you didn't see is justified can you tell us in your view at least from Capitol Hill what you understand the purpose of these airstrikes to event well judge first of all the total chaos in the White House and total confusion so it's hard to really understand what the purpose of the strike was we have to really recognize the first of all Assad has committed heinous crimes and killed so many people in the use of chemical weapons is unacceptable but also we have to really recognize that one surgical strike is not going to change that actually it could embroil us more in a civil war in Syria and so it's hard to kind of figure out why the president would do this minimally he should have come to Congress to seek authorization and a vote because this is an act of war and it's illegal and so for the life of me you know people need to really ask the White House what in the world is going on because we do not need to get embroiled in a civil war but we have to come together and help figure out a political settlement to this carnage that's taking place in Syria and you talked about coming to Congress there were a number of very interesting bedfellows that were made by this strike among those who supported what Donald Trump did Congress of course John McCain and Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio longtime Hawks on this issue the House Speaker Paul Ryan and several other members of Congress including a couple of Democrats eliot Engel of New York and of course senator bill nelson from florida so you've seen some sort of change of heart among a lot of really formally you if you want to call them never Trumper or anti-trump or very Trump critical politicians what do you make of the Capitol Hill support particularly from the neo conservative wing of the Republican Party but he strikes well I think you know people really are shocked and angry about what is taking place with a side but speaking for myself and I think most members are saying now that they think that the president should have come to Congress for a vote in an authorization we're in recess the speaker should call us back right away to begin to debate this because when you listen to the trump administration they're talking about more to come what is this I say based on our moral commitment and our humanitarian values we need to call for a ceasefire right away and that's why we need to come back to Congress so we can debate and come forth with a comprehensive strategy to begin to stop this carnage in this wart that's taking place in Syria and we have to of course talk about the Russian piece of this because we know that the Assad regime is backed by Russia by Vladimir Putin's Russia the reaction from Russia so far to the strike New York Times reporting that Russia in addition to suspending a pack that coordinates air operations over Syria an accord that was meant to prevent accidental encounters between the two militaries Russia said that it would bolster serious air defense systems and was reported to be planning to send a frigate into the Mediterranean Sea to visit logistics base in the Syrian port of Tartus in addition to that we also have reporting that the air base that was hit may not have been damaged all that much because Syrian Jets are still taking off from there they're back to taking off from the student observers are you concerned about an escalation with Russia as a result of what you just described as potentially more to come from the administration I'm very concerned because this this whole issue with Russia is very troubling and it's very dangerous and I hope this doesn't sidetrack the public from really recognizing we have to have a bipartisan commission to look at all of the activities that Russia has been engaged in in terms of undermining our democracy yes you know Assad and Putin's Russia and Putin's they're very close and in fact we need to know and the public needs to know the costs and consequences of what is taking place and we have to immediately revoke joy when you look at what's taking place with the children and men and women in Syria we have to insist at least we have a ceasefire in a safe corridor so that humanitarian is systems and so that medicines and food can get in there and we have to just stop and put a halt to this war mongering and this march to war because it is in fact very dangerous and it is in fact not going to keep our troops and our country any safer this was an act of war and it was illegal what the President did console and Barbara leave thank you very much for your time you really appreciate it

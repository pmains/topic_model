[Music] our immigration system is broken the federal government's failure to enforce the law has led to a national security and humanitarian crisis here on our southern border we spent the entire day with the Customs and Border Patrol's starting at the border right now I'm at the Falfurrias checkpoint station where each day at this checkpoint alone eight eleven thousand cars pass through here ruthless cartels victimized desperate foreigners and traffic people in narcotics into the country in the shift right now that this crews working on there's been five cases of human trafficking it makes it unsafe for both sides of the border while cartels continue to profit I spin a day with Customs and Border Patrol to hear from the boots on the ground about what needs to change starting near McAllen at the busiest landing for illegal entry in the United States in the short time we were there for two patrol picked up a family of four from Bangladesh and we watched as a cartel member escorted another family illegally across the border right in front of us the people here who are working you can see that they have compassion and professionalism and how they're dealing with the crisis caused by these cartels and unfortunately they're undermanned and often under fun against the cartels in addressing this issue we must continue to work to secure the border eliminate loopholes the fund sanctuary cities and remove the magnet that encourages illegal entry as we work together to stem the tide of this humanitarian and drug crisis at our border

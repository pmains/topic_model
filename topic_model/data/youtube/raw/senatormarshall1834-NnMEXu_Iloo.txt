by the way dr anthony fauci and dr rochelle wolenski went before congress yesterday to discuss the response to covet kansas senator roger marshall was part of that hearing and he joins us now senator good afternoon to you and we know things got heated which we'll talk about in a minute but did anything really new come out of yesterday's meeting well ashley good afternoon i think the big bombshell what we dropped is connecting dr fauci once again to funding viral gain of function studies that that a a particular grant that was denied by the department of defense uh it looks like his office approved it but you know susan collins one of the fiercest competitors i've ever met actually bringing light though to the issue that you're describing there almost two billion dollars diverted from coveted relief and used to take care of the the southern border crisis that was also created by joe biden i mean how frustrating is that we know that the lack of testing which the administration we're told were you know uh told about it last uh what october and yet when they do get the money it's funneled down to the southern border i mean how galling is that you know that's just it what we had one and a half million new cases uh yesterday this administration has put all of its eggs into one basket vaccine mandates mass magnates and testing really the testing will never be able to keep up with the situation we need to be locked in on therapeutics to protect those people who are most vulnerable those people that have co-morbidities uh people at over the age of 65. well dr fauci certainly got frustrated with you uh you were caught in exchange with the doctor and he had some choice words for you take a listen and i'll get your response totally incorrect well we look forward to reviewing it senator marshall dr fauci has answered you at his public information and he's happy to give it to you if you would ask senator moran what a jesus christ well how nice is that what a he's heard on a on a hot mic there you know senator would you have any family friendly response well look this has never been personal i had a co-position a mentor of mine who once said once you lose your reputation you never get it back and dr fauci has lost his reputation we caught him once again in a white lie he continues to mislead the public i thought it was a very reasonable question to ask the highest paid employee in the federal government making over four hundred thousand dollars a year a person who oversees five billion dollars in grants to give the public his financial statement uh so that we make sure there's no conflicts of interest obviously uh he went south he obfuscated once again so look nothing personal but these are the questions that i get asked every day about dr fauci because americans don't understand his logic in his policies so this is but one example one more example of dr fauci misleading america and this is why he's lost his reputation we don't trust him well you certainly touched a nerve i want to shift gears a little bit now to the issue of inflation hitting its fastest pace in nearly 40 years with consumer prices surging 7 just over the past 12 months this is really hurting a lot of people where it hurts uh what should we be doing about this and why is the bind administration still wanting to spend millions and trillions of dollars well actually you hit the nail on the head inflation is the biggest problem that folks talk to me back home about this is a social injustice another crisis created by this president and his policies and until we reverse those policies inflation's going to continue so you think about this president's policies he's driven the price of gasoline and our utility costs up because of his energy policies he's exacerbated supply chain shortages by paying people more to stay at home than to go back to work you throw on top of that vaccine mandates and then he's printing dollars like like there's no tomorrow you're probably a better expert than i am but i think our money supply in this nation is up 40 percent now from a year and a half ago and he wants to print more he wants to print another four trillion dollars to build back better thank goodness we've got that shut down for now but what's interesting senator is that with all of this going on and the covet testing inflation and so on it seems the democrats now just want to focus on voting reform of all things [Music] right they want a federal takeover of the elections they want to to lose the filibuster to do that and of course if you lose the filibuster what that's really all about is packing the courts making dc and puerto rico estates and then they want to go back and impact the supreme court so it's way more than just voting rights look republicans want to make it easier to vote harder to cheat but the constitution clearly states that's the state's responsibilities as well once again chuck schumer with the solution looking for a problem

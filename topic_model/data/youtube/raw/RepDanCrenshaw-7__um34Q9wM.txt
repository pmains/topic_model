a lot of the policies of president biden are simply seem to me simply to be about doing the opposite of what president trump did and one of those uh in very much affects your state and that is just doing the opposite of what president trump did down on on the border and uh in april i think we heard the figures just yesterday 178 000 people attempted to enter the united states illegally across the southern border uh and were apprehended all but about 5 000 of them are are still in the country and are here we've gone from record to record to record can you talk a little bit about the policy or the lack of policy uh on the southern border and uh you know where we go from here because the numbers just keep going up it's infuriating and um our citizens are feeling helpless about it because the democrats in charge did they simply refuse to address this problem and it's not as if there's not ways to address it it's it's a pretty simple set of solutions to be honest and i've talked about this for months now um you simply need to reinstate trump's policies especially the ones that involve cooperation with mexico and the northern triangle countries these policies were working quite well um you need to enforce our our current covid mandates um which allowed us extra extra powers to send people back immediately you have to you have to uh from a legislative standpoint we need to address the flores settlement which which i'm trying to put this simply basically says you can't hold migrants and family units um for more than 21 days which also makes it impossible to adjudicate their claims which means they have to be let loose into the interior and until we change that we can't enforce it we can't enforce in a timely manner and why is this important why is this bad it's bad for a couple reasons one americans deserve some sense of national sovereignty that is it that is a moral imperative the second moral moral imperative is that legal immigrants deserve to not be cut in front of by a bunch of illegal immigrants that's also a moral imperative this is wrong on so many levels it also um exacerbates human trafficking and look americans have to care that's the real thing we have to keep talking about it because americans need to actually care because the buying administration won't feel any pressure on it whatsoever until americans actually care and the problem is most the vast majority of americans do not see that if they're not turning on the tv and seeing the crisis at the border they honestly don't see it you know so it's it's very easy to ignore this problem for the democrats because you know once a hundred thousands of people they diffuse into our into our system and you know the numbers keep growing and growing and growing and growing and it becomes a completely unsustainable prospect but your average american is somewhat sheltered from it and um but not of course not in the low income neighborhoods they're not shelter government because that's generally where um now they're competing for jobs they're legal immigrants uh their schools are becoming overcrowded and our taxpayer money is funding that right so you know slowly but surely they do see it but then it's too late why why does the biden administration apparently want to encourage it because when when the influx really started to surge the the word from the biden administration was not don't come but just don't come yet why do they want to what is their what is their goal in allowing or even encouraging illegal immigration this is one of the saddest turns of the party okay the democratic party of bill clinton no longer exists but i think there used to be a legitimate labor party in our country uh and that used to be democrats that no longer is true this is a very radical marxist party now and and part of their revolutionary stance is to remake the electorate um ultimately power is their actual goal but what they do with that power you know they'll let us know when we get there but it'll be utopian of course but it's part of getting that power is votes of course we still do live in a democracy and so it's it's you have to look at their entire strategy unfettered illegal immigration coupled with something like the dream act now if you look at the dream act it basically says blanket amnesty because it totally redefines what a dreamer is it says yeah your age doesn't matter when you came over it doesn't really matter you're all dreamers now okay well that's tens of millions of people and they want to they want to grab hold of that electorate as soon as possible they start toying you know they've already started to normalize this idea of non-citizens voting i mean they do that local elections in places like san francisco so you see all of this coming together what they want to do create an electorate to gain more power this is such a cynical interpretation but i honestly don't know how else to interpret it because they they won't tell us they won't give us another explanation right um so where are we left it's difficult to see it any other way congressman i know that we've uh run out of time i want to thank you for the time and to wish you a speedy recovery and to see you back on capitol hill when not just you but the whole of the country returns to normal

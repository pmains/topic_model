first of all start echo the comments of my friend senator from Tennessee will never fully know what was the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back but I do believe that under the leadership of the senator from Alaska when 16 of us came to the floor yesterday and made the comments Senators on the Republican side saying please let's reopen the government senators on the Democratic side look like myself saying I'm open to increasing the dollar amount on border security so today echoing again now the presiding officers comments I rise to welcome the news that sanity has prevailed at least temporarily after 35 painful days were finally poised to reopen the government and pay our hard-working federal employees and it's not a moment too soon because under normal circumstances today was supposed to be a federal pay day but this morning thousands of federal employees went to work one more day knowing full well that they would not be getting their paychecks that they had earned thousands more have been furloughed waiting for the President and my colleagues to come to their senses to let us reopen the government for the last 35 days 800,000 federal workers had been held hostage through no fault of their own and frankly that's just scratching the surface of this destructive shutdown that number of 800,000 doesn't include the hundreds of thousands of federal contractors not getting paid and I know I've talked to my friend the senator from Alaska and I appeal to the common sense and good sense of the presiding officer we have some legislation may not be perfect but would look at trying to make at least partially hold those low paid federal contractors folks under $50,000 who if we don't find a way to take care of them will come out of this more than one month of their annual salary with nothing at all to show for we also know and senator from Alaska raised this issue with me even if we were to move towards low price price contactors low salary contractors that the solution that we announced today and hopefully we signed later today really will do nothing to take care of the small businesses whose customers were furloughed or working without pay making about the senator from Alaska who had that powerful picture here on the floor of the brewery in Kodiak Alaska I copied her efforts and saw went to port city brewery in Alexandria I believe it was yesterday where not only were they down dramatically in terms of customers but they had five new brews that they were trying to bring to market none of those able to be approved the truth is the damage to those folks in the private sector is done and I'm not sure there's much we can do to rectify candidly there's no way we can undo the harm thinking about you here locally to the food truck owners some who've had their food trucks repossessed who sit outside the Smithsonian waiting for the tourists to come those losses are permanent or in my state or in the presiding officer states those restaurants or campgrounds that are outside the Great Smoky Mountains or outside the Shenandoah Valley matter of fact there's no way as well that we're going to be able to make whole the contractor that told me he was closing his doors in laying off 72 workers because he just meet the payroll during the shutdown frankly it's too late for the president or any of us to help those folks the only thing we can do now is to end the shutdown get the federal workers and contractors back to work and try our darndest to make sure that this would never happen again we also need to make sure that those folks get back pay and again I was especially urge that we take a hard hard look at making sure that those low-wage contractors who are suffering so badly right now get a chance get an opportunity get their back pay as well I'm co-sponsoring legislation sponsored by the senator from Minnesota and I hope all my colleagues on both sides the out would look at that legislation we now finally have the opportunity by reopening the government temporarily to take a timeout and give both parties to space to negotiate a compromise we're clearly not there yet but there is room for common ground over the weekend the president proposed additional funding for screening vehicles and cargo coming across the border at points of entry the DEA says this is how the majority of illegal drugs come into our country it's something we can work on together and if the White House wants to seriously discuss providing real long-term security for dreamers and TPS recipients let's have that conversation as well I think we can do it but it will take time in the meantime let's make sure the president signs today that legislation that will allow our federal employees and contractors to get back to work before I close I want to take a moment for self-reflection at what's happened over the last 35 days because in many ways were right back where we were in December right back where we were where this body nearly unanimously passed legislation that would have prevented this stupid crisis for 35 days this body has refused to fill its role as a part and co-equal branch of government we can't let that happen again I hope the White House will take some lessons from this crisis as well they can start by realizing that no one no one wins a shutdown if you shut down the government the only thing we know for a fact is that the American people lose I hope the president will also realize that you need to empower those around you to help make a deal the vice president came to the Senate with a deal in mid-december I don't think he left Capitol Hill before the president basically took back the vice president's deal senator Graham proposed almost exactly this deal that we came to three weeks ago but unfortunately again the president cut off his good friend at that point it's my hope that in coming weeks we could have good faith negotiation where both sides have an opportunity to come out ahead imagine that a win-win proposition here coming out of the halls of Congress but to do that we have to have enough of the stunts and the political to protect that we've seen over the past few weeks in a moment of optimism if there's anything good that can come from this shutdown let's make it the last time that a president or a congress uses shutting down the government as a negotiating tactic I've got legislation and it took some hard work to come up with the acronym but the legislation is called the stop stupidity act that will make sure that Congress and the White House are the only ones who suffer when the Congress and the White House can't come to a funding agreement now maybe the particulars of that legislation can change or maybe even responsible members like the presiding officer would think we don't need to put into law something called stop the stupidity act so I'm open to changing the name as well but the final language in any deal that comes out three weeks from now should put strong provisions and strong penalties in place to prevent this tactic from being used by either party or any White House or Congress in the future and in my mind perhaps the best and easiest way to do that would be and I know there's Republican legislation on this they would continue to fund the government and my idea would say the only place that would actually be the victims of a shutdown going forward would be the Congress and our staff and the White House and its staff more than a little bit of common sense tells me that we wouldn't be here 35 days into this shutdown if all our staffs were experiencing the same kind of shortfall and economic distress that 800,000 of our federal fellow federal workers experienced truth is our federal workers need to get that paycheck the truth is our country can't afford another self-inflicted disaster so let's go ahead and get that CR passed let's go ahead and sit down and negotiate in good faith on border security and most importantly let's make sure we're never back in this circumstance again with that mr. president I yield the floor and note the absence of coul

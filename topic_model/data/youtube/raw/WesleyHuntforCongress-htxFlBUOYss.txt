i remember being at west point and going to class like it was just a regular day and i recall turning the tv on in my room and watching one of the towers go up in flames and replay over and over and over again as the plane ran into it and then as i was sitting there i watched the second plane fly into the second tower that moment i knew that we were all going to war what's interesting is at west point you could attend the first two years without having any monetary commitment or any time commitment to the military so my sophomore year we could have left actually knowing that we were going to be a country at war once we graduated from west point and most of us stayed the heroism that you saw from these brave first responders police officers and firefighters that drove their vehicles into a cloud of smoke to try to save as many people from a burning building as possible it's heart-wrenching it's the best of what it means to be an american it exemplifies the american ethos many of those brave first responders lost their lives because of it but they weren't even thinking about their own lives they were thinking about the lives of others and they were willing to sacrifice their own lives to save others and that spirit even permeated throughout the united states military i lost 14 west point classmates in the global war on terror and i'm here to tell you that their sacrifice was not for naught for they kept us safe their blood kept us safe their sacrifice kept us safe for the last two decades when called upon the american soldier always answers the bell a question that i get asked all the time is you know do you feel like it was worth it and the answer is of course it was hell yes it was worth it why because we got to keep americans safe for the last 20 years and that's what matters there was a time in this country after 9 11 where you couldn't find or buy an american flag online because they all sold out there was a time in this country to where we all prayed together as a country we lifted each other up as a country we banded together as a country because we refuse to allow the enemy to destroy who we are as a nation we are not going to allow us to wither from within we are going to defend ourselves from within and we're going to prevent any rogue agent or any rogue entity or any other country that does not want to see american prosper from taking us down you

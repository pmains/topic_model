our congressman barber congresswoman barbara Lee of California Fernando a Mondesi Fernando Mondo's Vermont for non Amanda senior a retired executive and his son am joy Powell and folder for non Amon D the second all right so now that I've got everybody's name butchered and destroyed let me go through the congresswoman first what do you make of Donald Trump's up switcheroo on Cuba first III think that he's shown just how disingenuous he's been by these role by this has been a 50-year policy in terms of in ensuring that Americans could not travel freely to Cuba like we can to Vietnam or China or anywhere else in the world also you know Gooding well that in in the embargo would create more jobs in America and the role in this back now really would destroy at least 13,000 jobs 6.2 billion in revenue and so it's a policy that you know President Obama attempted Florida on because we in Congress still haven't been able to legislatively lift the embargo and lift the travel ban so he's trying to roll back the gains that we've made in terms of normal relations with Cuba and tried to set us back fifty five years and it doesn't make sense and I hope the American people really resist this bad move and for Donna Bondi senior we're going to start with four non senior on this why shouldn't Americans be free to travel to Cuba if Americans can travel you know the North Korea I mean Americans get on a plane to go to Iran if they want you why shouldn't Americans be free to travel to Cuba no American should be free to travel anywhere in the world and will continue to be able to travel to Cuba but let me try and put this in context in nonpartisan context this is what's in the interest of the American people and what is in the interest of the Cuban people to give credit where credit is due President Obama reached out to the Cuban regime in an effort to open up a basically paralyzed relationship over 55 years with noble intentions and he tried President Trump comes in looks at it and decides that this is not as we expected it to be the fact is that the Cuban government did not react to the unilateral concessions that the US government granted they continued to meddle extensively in Venezuela creating a debacle in that poor country that can increase the repression invent in in Cuba and and so you wonder why not reset the policy the fact is that the president did not eliminate President Obama's good elements of the policy many of them in fact most of them remain in place what is the main point of the policy is that the direct relationship to direct funding the direct business with the Cuban the oppressive regime for 58 years is no longer allowed the policy in turn turns to the Cuban people let's engage the Cuban people directly pretty much what I think President Obama really tried to do but couldn't let's give President Trump credit and the chance to engage the Cuban people and stop funding this repressive oppressive regime for 58 years well that's the right thing to do for our country it is the right thing to do for the Cuban people we applaud President Trump's decision let me go to Don jr. the firaon you know this it's a lot of complicate there are a lot of complications here right so you have the estimates from engaged Cuba saying that this policy switch would cost six point six billion dollars over Trump first term that it will cost twelve thousand two hundred and ninety five jobs the more sort of directly I mean I've been to Cuba the thing you hear most when people will talk to you off record by the way it is it clearly an authoritarian country because people can't just talk to you openly and freely it's pretty clear that they can but when they do get you and you can get them alone in they're wrong on one one of the things that they will often say is we really want to make money we'd rather make money and that the only way to really make money is through the tourism industry by being a waiter or by being in that well you can make tip income why is it a better idea to throw withdraw that kind of opportunity to people to make Airbnb income or a tip income by making it harder again for Americans to travel tequila well I'm not I'm not sure it is Joe and I think that's where I part a little bit of company with my dad and ascribing the good faith intentions to President Trump because at the end of the matter number one like congresswoman Lee says he in no way cancelled the Obama policy this was a slight alteration so I think there's some disingenuous there and I think what it ends up doing more than anything else this is the tragedy about the new alteration is once again it gives that Castro regime that authoritarian and that all of us agree exists an excuse on which to blame the lack of progress what the Obama policy did was eliminate all of the excuses and joy we know that a successful con man like the Castro's utilized the hustle of blaming someone the blame game and by now doing this action they can blame the United States again for an aggressive posture one before they were accountable for their totalitarian actions and that's why I think at the end of the day as tragic as it is this policy change this policy alteration will not change the fundamental dynamics of the 58-year repression the Cuban people I think we were on a closer path to that happening with the previous approach now these con men and Cuba have another excuse with which to blame yeah and very quickly congresswoman Lee your colleague Marco Rubio in the Senate on the Senate side seems to have gotten something and also congressman Diaz blart my former congressman in Miami they went in and had a meeting with Donald Trump is this what they got in exchange for a friendlier relationship with the White House probably so a joy but let me just say a couple of things we have bipartisan support in Congress to lift the embargo and to lift the travel ban there are only a few members of Congress holding this policy hostage I co-chaired the Cuba working group we had 12 Republicans and 12 Democrats on that working group we're working together to try to make sure that we do not go back 55 years but rather move forward it doesn't make sense 65 percent of the public wants to travel to Cuba freely and in fact 53 percent of Cuban Americans in miami-dade County believe that this policy is a failed policy and we should move forward are there oh it doesn't make any sense we're almost out of time I want to give for a non senior a chance to respond to you do what about just lifting the embargo and just having openness and having American ideas shared with Cubans directly well the Abbar goal at this point is American law and we are a country of laws the president stated it very clearly here's what we expect the Cuban regime to liberate political prisoners allow free expression allowed multi-party you know politics in the country and have supervised elections instead of continuing to be a tyrant for 55 years I think is that not an American principle we I want to have this debate again I have to have you all back but I can see the next toast is that you're standing in the room I have to get off the air so I've got to let you guys go thank you very much to congresswoman barbara Lee and Fernan aman DS senior and junior both

from your your producers as well and you very Abele indicate that you believe it's a system that's encouraged productivity and made the poultry ecosystem the best in the world that's why we can ship all over the world without barriers that we could literally feed everybody chicken all over the world thank you very much miss that I yield back mr. pallazzo Thank You mr. chairman mr. secretary thank you for being here today I'll jump right into some questions ones dealing with food safety twice Congress has legislated to transfer food safety inspection responsibility from the Food and Drug Administration to the USDA food safety inspection service once during a democratically controlled Congress and once during a Republican Congress yet the budget submitted by the administration yesterday proposes to reverse course change the law and move back to an FDA inspection program which really provided little if any food safety inspection at all in fact this very same budget proposal highlights the work FSIS has done over the past year ensuring product quality specifically highlighting rejection recalls and removal of product totaling well over a half a million pounds of catfish that otherwise would have found its way onto the tables of American families throughout the US so my obvious question here mr. secretary is why is the administration reversing course I think again this budget may have been constructed prior to secretary Tom Price and the FDA Administrator and I have in conversations of how we do a bright-line delineation over food inspection I think USDA is rightfully proud of its food safety inspection system and someone mentioned dr. Harris mentioned hotdogs it's kind of curious to me that USDA is responsible for the safety of the Wiener but if you put it in a bun that becomes FDA's responsibility so globally I think we've got some real opportunities here to delineate in a bright-line way who does what best and I think secretary Price and I who served in the Georgia State Senate together have begun some top-level conversations about of how we approach that decision which hopefully will be reflected later in a budget over how do we determine who does what and who does what best so I appreciate your comments about the catfish inspection program I know there's a lot of interests as I meant met with senators about that as well and once again I'm not quite sure of the etiology of the proposal in that way I think to really to their credit I think it was again a duplication issue where they viewed this was a duplication in that we're at USDA typically does not have fish inspection and it seem to be moved over so while we have poultry and meat don't have fish and I think they viewed that as a duplication yeah I've heard that as well and one of the reasons why we took it away from FDA because they were failing to provide food safety inspections if they're inspecting the product at all and it's our job and I think there's several people in agreement on this committee that you know if there's going to be things there going to be imported from abroad into American markets we need to make sure it's safe for consumption and I believe your food safety inspection service group is doing a fantastic job and we'd like to see it continue to remain under us DNA to protect the American families and what they're going to be served on their kitchen table I appreciate the compliments I think you'll get a shot at that well I appreciate that now moving to my second question I believe my state and many other states are facing some real struggles and staffing from their local Farm Service Agency offices and in January the administration announced a federal hiring freeze during the transition on April 12th OMB announced the freeze was lifted however as my understand the USDA still has a hiring restriction in place and can you update the Committee on the status of the Department staffing plan to assure that customer service is fully achieved at the local level as you referenced in your testimony certainly actually that customer service was one of the reasons that I chose to realign our NRCS as well as that with FSA with our crop insurance RMA people for one-stop-shop we're really to give a critical mass an economy of scale for instance if in smaller communities if one FSA had two people and RCS had two people they may be kind of in the same building but they really want co-located so just if one person's out or some child's sick or something like that we want more people there in order to help that I have not had an opportunity look drill down on all the offices where we have vacancies and where we have deficiencies regarding our our farm production credit customer service but that's a huge goal of ours the other thing the other huge goal is to get our databases to communicate you may know from your customers and your constituents that our NRCS database and our FSA database don't really talk about dock together well they have to go through a bridging program and our farmers are frustrated by having to fill out the twenty page application in one place walk through the next door that fill out almost a similar identical twenty page application for NRCS programs so the goal of co-locating and is more than just physical it's its heart soul and spirit of customer service because that customer comes in there that producer comes in there and they just want to sign up for the program's they qualify for and we want them to to be able to say if an FSA employee says here you report all this these are the programs but you may want to think about your farm plan let me introduce you to the NRCS person right here behind me and to do that but the staffing level is something I've not been able to get to yet and how that works as you all know my confirmation was April 25th even after that hiring freeze was lifted so we were evaluating the best use of our personnel across the department Thank You mr. secretary I yield back oh yes we go

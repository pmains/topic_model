nortey leader seek recognition Mr Speaker I ask unanimous consent to address the house for one minute without objection so ordered thank you very much mr. speaker Mr Speaker I rise to address the house in relationship to the transport fill that we are currently debating on the house this week transportation as you know has traditionally been and historically been an idea where our two parties have been able to find common ground transportation has been an opportunity for Republicans and Democrats alike to work to rebuild America to create jobs strengthen our economy move commerce move people improve the quality of life include including the public safety that is up until now up and and that is until this bill with the legislation that we are debating today Republicans put forward the most partisan transportation package in 50 years it is not just partisan it's bad for our nation destroying more than a half a million American jobs the transportation bill is supposed to be a job-creating bill it always has been until now destroy more than a half a million jobs cutting highway investments in 45 states bankrupting the Highway Trust Fund with a 78 billion dollar shortfall and just the strangest of all among many short-sighted harmful provisions in the bill it may I want to make particular mention of what it does to public transportation it eliminates all of the dedicated funding for public transportation leaving millions of riders already faced with service cuts and fare increases out in the cold the legislation is so detrimental to our nation that the Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood a former member of this body on the Republican side of the aisle has said this is the most partisan transportation bill that I have ever seen and there's also the most anti safety bill I have ever seen it Hallows out our number one priority which is safety and frankly it Hallows out the guts of transportation efforts that have been for about the last three years it's the worst transportation bill a secretary LaHood former Republican member of Congress said that I had seen in the 35 years of my public service in recommending that the president vetoed this legislation the administration has said it would make America's roads rails and transit systems less safe reduce the transportation options available to America's traveling public short-circuit local decision-making and turn back the clock on an environmental on environmental and labor protections mr. speaker this is so unfortunate because it's so out of character with the American Way the common sense of the American people about what we should be doing for them at the beginning of our country Thomas Jefferson when he was president he enlisted his his cabinet officers to build an infrastructure plan for America that involved transportation in 2008 this planned undersecretary Gallatin that Secretary of Treasury was put forth it recognized that we had purchased we had made the Louisiana Purchase that there were Lewis and Clark expeditions going on and that we had to build america build roads and transportation out into these territories so that people would move their commerce would develop our country would be strong following this the Erie Canal the Transcontinental Railroad the cumberland road they were all built after the war of 1812 course the Continental railroad later than that when our population was sparse and so was our National Treasury am i owns a community of San Francisco the Golden Gate Bridge and the San Francisco Bay Bridge both were built 75 years ago in the midst of the gresham President Eisenhower in the late fifties in mid-to-late fifties time of not a good at not a good economic time either he built and instituted the interstate highway system unifying our country was a national security issue to unify our country and it was done at a time when our coffers were low on money but it created jobs it did what it was intended to do and now we are abdicating our responsibility again 100 200 years ago Thomas Jefferson a hundred years later Teddy Roosevelt and his initiative for infrastructure centered around our national park system and how we how we make that part of our natural Pratt Ramon II and some of that falls under the transportation subcommittee of the Congress of the United States and now here we are a hundred years later putting forth a bill that loses jobs diminishes public safety it's a missed opportunity and it's no wonder our Republican colleagues are having so much trouble building support for in their own caucus I just wanted to take a moment to share my views with our colleagues about how wrong this is for the future and how out of keeping it is with our great past which has seen the strength of our country grow because our investments in our infrastructure and our bringing people together through transportation with that I yield back the balance of my time gentlelady's time has expired for what purpose does the gentleman from Florida seek recognition

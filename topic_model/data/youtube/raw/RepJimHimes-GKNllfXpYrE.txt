democratic congressman jim hymes of connecticut is a member of the house intelligence committee close to this debate joins us now thank you so much congressman himes so you have disagreed that the president already had authority as he is claiming to conduct this war without congressional authorization uh why is this aumf important yeah that's exactly right i've been troubled like a lot of colleagues have been and of course fundamentally this is a constitutional issue uh with the idea that you know president should be able to make war without the approval of congress and look this is as clear as day in the united states constitution and we as a country i think have gotten away from what the constitution would have us do so yes i am gratified to see that we have a request for an authorization but you know even this is going to be a heck of a cage match here in the congress you know you've got all kinds of different views on it but it start with the fact that it's sort of interesting that the president did assert that he had the authority to do this under the old 01 aumf and under his constitutional powers of the commander-in-chief so one of the key questions is what exactly are we doing here if the president still believes that he's got the authority under previous authorizations that's a tough question this proposal has a pretty broad grant of power in it as we just mentioned it includes any action against associated forces it doesn't have a clear geographic limitation are you concerned about that yeah look in the uh and without in any way suggesting that this president would treat this authorization that way this way this authorization as it is drafted basically would give the executive the president this president and the next president for a year the authority to do just about anything just about anywhere for a three-year period you know you pointed out that the the the uh the modifier enduring offensive combat operations what does enduring mean does it mean two months does it mean two years does it mean 20 years these are all things that at a minimum we're going to need to sharpen up here before i think the congress is going to give authority to the president to to fight another war well on the subject of sharpening it up ambassador samantha power our ambassador to un just said this morning that the administration is willing to make what she called reasonable adjustments to get bipartisan support now if you look at what's being asked for on the republican side of the aisle that includes boots on the ground how difficult a partisan fight is this shaping up to be well it's going to be tough you know it's not going to be purely partisan yes it is true that most republicans are want the door open for boots on look i can only speak for myself ronan and my constituents which is that i will not be party to any approval that leaves the door open for yet another ground war in the middle east you know when you look at what we have achieved in afghanistan in iraq and of course in a more limited war in libya you know tribute to our armed services that they can remove a regime very very quickly the next day is usually catastrophic and we of course expend lives and have bankrupted our treasury in pursuit of these ground wars so on the flip side of course and this is really important on the flip side when it comes down to hunting down terrorists and i sit on the intelligence committee so i get daily reports of this activity when it comes down to hunting down and taking out terrorists we're pretty good so i think a lot of us feel like we ought to keep doing that and give the authority to keep doing that but by god let's not get into another ground war in asia the white house has said that there is one more american being held hostage in the region how tough does that make this debate well you know any time there's a hostage involved uh it is always from a human standpoint a brutal calculation and of course you know not just what we do but you know the the principle that we don't negotiate with terrorists i got to tell you if it was your son or daughter that would be that hostage it would be a lot harder to say that than it is for me to say that um but look at the end of the day what we're talking about here is probably the most serious and most profoundly uh consequential decision that washington and the united states congress can make so we've got to bear that in mind as we as we think about how to decide on what the president has asked us to do congressman jim hymes thanks for your time on this thanks ryan

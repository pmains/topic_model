thanks everyone for spending a few minutes with us here today to talk about this new program through fema and i want to thank peter morin who serves as executive director of the new hampshire funeral directors association for uh being a part of this conversation um obviously we have been through a lot as a state and a country over the last a little over a year now throughout this pandemic you know so many families have been experiencing loss and i think this particular program as with so many other efforts are designed to help make sure that um we are supporting uh families in their time of need and that we're giving people the help that they deserve through this pandemic and beyond clearly nothing's going to be able to erase the pain and suffering of those who have lost loved ones due to covet 19 over the last year but as people continue to grieve there are certainly some significant ways that we can help make that financial burden uh more manageable for our families in the american rescue plan there was significant support for our small businesses for our workers for our communities um also support for fema which has launched a national funeral assistance program to offset the costs that families are experiencing right now any new hampshire family who paid for funeral expenses after january 20th of last year for individuals whose death may have been caused by coven 19 is eligible to apply for the program uh there is up to nine thousand dollars available uh per funeral reimbursement um and um i think we can get into a little bit more of the details of the program how people can access it and uh also to answer your questions so i want to thank peter moore for joining us here today um and beyond that and before we get to peter i just want to say anyone who has any further questions about this program or anything else we really uh like to hear from you at our congressional office we're located in manchester and in dover you can call us at 285 4300 or find us online at pappas.house.gov so please don't hesitate to be on uh today to reach out with any questions or requests for assistance so peter i'll turn it over to you maybe you could introduce yourself talk about the association and some of the facets of this new program well thank you congressman pappas um and thank you very much for asking me to be part of this uh this webinar uh welcome everyone with your you know participation glad you're here um yes my name is peter morin and i am the executive director of the new hampshire funeral directors association uh i am myself and my licensed new hampshire funeral director and balmer have been for over 20 years i've been executive director for the past 12 well over 12 years now and the association the new hampshire funeral directors and embalmers association which is our legal name um was formed back in 1900 and of course a lot has happened in that time and now i haven't been on the involved in all that time but i'm here during those last 12 years um the association not only represents funeral service and and our members here in new hampshire but we also represent the families that we serve the association in the last 12 years has has done a great deal in terms of consumer legislation consumer protection legislation in terms of pre-need funeral contracts and that sort of thing we also are very involved nationally and that's where first became involved with uh representative pappas uh with the brave act and the passage of that uh veterans burial benefit bill so we we we're pretty involved a lot of different things and for a small state and a small association uh i believe that we're uh you know we're very effective and and we try to do the best we can to represent those the citizens here in new hampshire so that's pretty much as far as the the association and myself and i'd be more than happy to answer any of your questions about this program um to to just touch base with what the the congressman started with as far as the the female funeral assistance program this is enormous this is a great um uh effort on uh to help people in in across the united states who have lost a loved one to to covet uh 19 in uh in the past year to really help relieve that financial burden and to try to make the process is easier for them and so i will turn this back to the congressman well well thanks maybe one of the first questions people might have if they're looking for information is can they do this online or do they have to call the telephone number we know that when this was opened up we had a million calls in the first day and a lot of people had trouble getting through so how can people um you know reach out to apply for this assistance that's an excellent question um the first answer is no you cannot do it online you can go and look for you can get information on the fema funeral assistance page uh that's a true has a tremendous amount of information there brings you through all the questions that you might have in terms of applying uh applications can only be done through their uh their number uh for applications it's done in person with a member of their staff one of their representatives uh we'll guide you through it take the necessary information to set up an account for you to get this process started so it can only be done on um through the phones uh and with the fema representative looks like we have a question in the chat about um someone who lost a brother and i'm really sorry for your loss in massachusetts and she dealt with the massachusetts funeral home is that eligible and the answer is this is not a new hampshire specific program even though i referenced i think granite staters in my opening comments this is a national program that all of our families are eligible to apply for assistance through did i get that right peter uh yes you did congressman um it as long as if if the individual died within the united states within uh one of our united states territories or the district of columbia um then they would be eligible uh to uh whether it's they would be eligible for this program feel free to offer any less comments there but one question i was thinking about was um about how funeral homes can assist families i'm just wondering if uh funeral homes might be able to either help families apply or to apply on their behalf um can you provide any clarity there yes um that's very another very good question no funeral homes can assist you in gathering the necessary information that you're going to need uh among them will be a death certificate which indicates that covet 19 was either the cause or an underlying cause of the person's death the statement of goods and services which you would have signed for that the contract if you will they cannot apply on your behalf the application can only be done by the person who actually made the payment and paid for the funeral services so it's limited to that individual as i said they can assist you in gathering the information that you're going to need to make the application and that the payment would be made directly to the person uh the applicant themselves so it looks like we have another question here in the chat um also about someone who's lost someone who lost their dad and i'm really sorry for your loss uh appears he lived in new jersey um but she's a new hampshire resident and um so yes this is also that question about um you know whether someone lives in another state but this is in fact a national program and um you know uh regardless of the circumstances of where people lived or where the funeral home was located uh you are eligible and i'm just dropping into the uh chat right now uh just the direct information on um the phone number and the particulars on where people can go to um you know reach that hotline what hours uh it's in service for so people have a little bit more information on uh what to reach out to now what type of expenses peter are covered by the program um there's a lot involved when you're paying respects and you know honoring a loved one with a funeral service what aspects of of that are eligible for the fema reimbursement well there's actually a great deal that is is eligible and i've got a list here because it is quite extensive um you know it could be the the cost of a casket could be the cost of burial services or cremation uh it could be a casket or an urn i think i mentioned the casket up to two death certificates um the burial space itself in a cemetery the actual cost of the internment or the cremation they actually and they also allow reimbursement for two individuals to travel in order to identify the deceased um so there's um and there's a number of a number of things like that it's a rather extensive list and i know um we've received questions about um you know what sort of documentation you need to provide to access these funds for some covid may be listed as a contributing factor on a death certificate do you need that designation in order to receive these funds yes yes you do that's that's a critical point is that uh either the cause of death the primary cause of death is coveted 19 or a subsequent cause of death if it contributed in any way but it must be on the death certificate now if it isn't and you believe that your your loved one did die from covet 19 or related circumstances then you could possibly have that death certificate amended that's not an easy process uh it'd be a matter of going to the physician who certified the cause of death um but it is necessary that that is on the death certificate that's that's a primary uh requirement for this okay and marilyn asks about um she paid for funeral expenses out of pocket uh didn't have insurance does she qualify for the program absolutely absolutely you would need receipts which you would have received from the funeral home um you know if you paid by check or credit card even um the documentation uh the receipts would be very uh would be a requirement that they would for documentation um but yes absolutely you uh the only types of insurance that that could be used to pay for the funeral expenses is it would be like a whole life policy a life insurance policy if it is a funeral related policy let's say you had a mortuary trust or you had an insurance policy specifically to cover a pre-arranged funeral contract then no that would not be eligible for reimbursement but a whole life policy would be but any other form of payment cash check credit card yes absolutely uh as long as you can document that you paid for it and do you know you know how limited the program is will the money run out at some point in time is there a date certain that people have to apply for these funds by no no there is no deadline um and that's what i like to reassure families that call reach out to me that i know that the fema is very busy that a lot of people are applying but to be patient that this process is is is in place and it's going on uh there is no deadline um you know that they think they've allowed for an you know ample amount of funding for this and i would not see it be an issue at all so i would not not worry about that terrific maybe you could tell us a little bit more about just what the last year has been for um for your members for the funeral homes around new hampshire and the families that they work with obviously this is really unprecedented and what kind of strain has this put on you know our families who are struggling to um you know keep people safe and um also make sure that um you know they're doing everything possible to honor uh their loved ones well it has been it's been an incredible strain uh on the families and also on on funeral service um i think that one of the biggest impacts that families have had is their the inability to be able to to grieve and mourn in a way that we're typically uh accustomed to and not having that often people can't be you know couldn't be in the hospital with their loved one that he died or even a nursing home because of the restrictions and protocols in place so this put enormous put you know an enormous burden on the families uh and this inability to to mourn in a way that we traditionally have i think we often aren't aware of of the importance of grieving a loss and are allowing ourselves to grieve and it takes time and it's going to takes it takes a process and not being able to do that and not being able to have the support of family because family wasn't able to travel or that they were restricted by the numbers that they could have at a service and also because the community at large was not able to participate and you know often you know that's a tremendous tremendous source of support for for grieving families and individuals and so it's had an enormous impact i and i i suspect and i've heard some professionals talk about it that that you know there may be some lasting effects to this that people have really uh there's going to be issues with what we refer to as unresolved grief and um that they just haven't had the chance to to grieve in a supportive manner and have the help that they need so um it's been it's been a tough time for everyone and particularly those um anyone who who lost someone during this pandemic whether it was through coveter or other through the other circumstances other causes uh was a very very difficult time and i'm hoping that you know things will ease back and we'll be getting to normalize more and more and keep everyone safe so um yeah i'm optimistic and we're gonna as far as the funeral homes in new hampshire you know we follow the protocols to keep everyone safe and we'll be gradually you know expanding those very carefully to allow more capacity for services and more of the community involvement and larger family groups so um yeah it's it's been it's been an unusually difficult situation something we've we've never encountered before on this scale well we hope we never encounter it again and we certainly hope that things uh continue to improve as as you know people get their vaccinations we continue to heed the public health guidance that you know new hampshire can get through this but we do want to make sure we're providing support for families who have experienced loss and that's why this program is so important i will tell you all the uh the hotline number just so you have it i did drop the information in the chat but maybe everyone can't see it um so the hotline opened up on april 12th uh it is open for applications now um it's open monday through friday nine to nine eastern time so it gives you a 12 hour window during weekdays and the number is eight four four six eight four six three three three that's eight four four six eight four six three three three and we'll make sure we get that information up on our website um so if people have any additional questions about that um you know we certainly can assist with it um colin do we have any further questions before we um close this session you know that is all i'm seeing um in both the q a um and in the chats i think we have we've come to the end of the questions yeah all right peter anything else you'd like to offer i i think congressman i just reiterate with you it said to reassure people that this is a national program uh and if you have any questions um you can certainly go to the uh you can certainly contact me like as well as as the congressman's office i'll be happy to assist you and you know maybe guide you where you where you might need some help that this as i said this is the national program if you have questions don't be afraid to ask them and if you and if you do get through and start the application process with fema i know they'll be very helpful uh their representatives are are really their goal is to make this work successfully for every family and to take the time that's necessary to guide you through they're not going to rush you you know they're not going to push things through or that they're going to be of absolute of assistance to you all so um i think i was reading that uh an average call takes about 20 minutes to gather the information on the line with fema so um you know having the right information is important but it's not that long of a process to to get through and um you know file your application and i'd also mention i mean reach out to the funeral home that that helped your family um you know in caring for your loved one they'll they'll be happy to help you gather this information if you you know need this another copy of the statement of goods and services of the contract if you need help getting more death certificates reach out to them and ask them for help and and i i'm sure that they will be more than happy to do that and now keep in mind that they may be busy serving other families so it may not happen overnight but i know they'll be happy to to assist you in that so but don't be afraid to ask questions and and gather the necessary information before you call fema i think that's going to be a very important part of it is to have because on the fema site it has a list of exactly what you're going to need and uh basically a death certificate with the cause of death listing covet is an underlying cause or the cause uh the contract that you signed and that the person applying for this whoever it is has to be the person that actually signed that contract and paid for the services they're very very particular things that have to be met and then you would have any receipts related to it other than those from the funeral home and um maybe there'll be information of course you know the deceased person's name their social security number that sort of thing likewise your own name your social security number and information like that will be will be critical to having this move smooth move smoothly forward well there are a lot of ins and outs of this process but peter we appreciate your time at uh helping folks in new hampshire understand a little bit more about it and we'll continue to try to spread the word i'm sure your association will as well and once again we encourage folks to reach out to our office if you have any further questions here or really anything covert related or any assistance we might be able to provide again our number is 285 4300. um hopefully you're all doing well and staying safe we're thinking of new hampshire families that have been going through a tough time right now and we want to do all we can to assist so everybody have a great rest of the week and we hope to see you again soon

joining me now is kentucky senator rand paul senator paul we've moved from one type of lockdown to another from covid to a military one are you worried about this constant moving of the goal post and slow creep well absolutely with regard to the pandemic lockdown you mentioned the stanford study this is a peer-reviewed study in a and a medical journal that says they studied 10 different countries and what they found is is that the mandatory lockdowns did no better than voluntary suggestions so i've been saying this for a long time i don't think we've changed the trajectory of the virus at all with any of the things we're told to do and they're never going to let up on this but what i tell people is use common sense if you've had the disease or you've been vaccinated and you're several weeks out from your second dose throw your mask away and tell dr fauci to take a leap because once you have immunity you don't need to do this they will never let up there are doctors out there saying well we need to wear them after the vaccine and really we may need to wear them forever that is ridiculous and that defies the science so when you've had it and you have immunity or you've had a vaccine and you've had your second dose and you've got immunity i say throw your mask away and tell these so-called experts who say lockdowns work tell them to take a flying leap because there's no scientific evidence that the lockdowns have done anything to tr change the trajectory of this virus i want to talk about what's happened to washington d.c since january 6 with the incursion uh by these extremists who went into the capitol obviously enormously destructive politically uh personally physically life lives lost but are you concerned about the size and scope of military deployment in the nation's capital in the aftermath of that well the thing is laura you know government they either under react or overreact so i think there's too little security obviously last week and now we're going to become a militarized zone and you know they're checking uh congressmen as they come in to see if they have a sharp pencil or a sharp pen so it's gotten ridiculous and so we'll see what happens and whether it's permanent but most people who write about civil liberties say that in times of war or in times of stress or in times of crisis you lose your civil liberties very quickly but it's very difficult to get them back because government once it grows large never wants to give up on this uh but yes we we have to resist this and we have to have security obviously but i think living in a wartime state with you know we're now we have troops in in the capital you know you know they're they're staying in the capitol they're they're platooning and camping in the capitol so um you know i understand yeah i understand you know the last week we weren't prepared and that was a real problem and i regret everything that happened last week with that but going forward this week i think we there's a danger of overreacting and you know they say they're going to have this sort of virtual inauguration so i've informed them i'm sending my hologram my hologram is going to be there if the hologram doesn't have a spot i may send a cardboard cutout but uh it's going to be virtual i think i can go virtually you know well here's what pelosi said about this military-style encampment in dc with the interaction of last week it is necessitated by security to have more security it depends on the intelligence and we have to have more and more security than the intelligence might warrant i think in this case redundancy may be necessary i don't even know if she knows what she's saying there but redundancy may be necessary i mean does she want tanks right i think the redundancy is in her speech i think the redundancy is in her speech but you know i'm not against security we do have to have adequate security and i want people to be safe i want the new president to be safe i want the i want the old president to be safe and i think one of the questions with their crazy impeachment stuff that they're talking about is are they going to strip president trump of his security i mean can you imagine being an ex-president and being stripped of your security so these people are bitter and the rancor and the bad taste they leave in the mouth i just don't understand how they can be moving forward with this and look i'm not just saying i i'm for everything president trump has done i i was for seeding the electors because i think congress shouldn't overturn the state electors but at the same time the thing they're doing now is an overreaction and if they think they're going to have a positive feeling from the public when they're going to go through a partisan impeachment again i think that's absolutely insane and wrong-headed are you surprised that your colleague mitch mcconnell as at least has left open the possibility that there will be a senate trial and when trump is already in florida well i don't often get asked my advice from leadership how they how they should react but my unsolicited suggestion would be this they will destroy the republican party if leadership is complicit with an impeachment or if leadership votes for an impeachment they would destroy the party and like i say i have opposed president trump when i thought he was wrong i've been for him when he was right we did a lot of good things throughout the trump presidency and impeachment is purely a partisan thing it's for these moral oh i'm so much better than you and you're a bad person because i'm so moral these are the kind of people that are going to do this look i didn't agree with the fight that happened last week and i voted against uh you know uh overturning the election but at the same time the impeachment is a wrong-headed partisan notion but if republicans go along with it it'll destroy the party a third of the republicans will leave the party i mean this isn't it was a right or wrong debate yeah it wasn't good this isn't about any more about the electoral college it's about the future of the party and whether you're going to ostracize and excommunicate president trump from the party well guess what millions of his uh fans will leave as well america american voters who supported uh president trump will feel that they've been impeached and called a white supremacist too senator uh thanks for what you're doing to protect civil liberties we hope you stay on it

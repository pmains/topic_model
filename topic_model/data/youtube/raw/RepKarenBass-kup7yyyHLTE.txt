madam chair I support HR 1-1 to the enhanced background checks Act of 2019 as a common-sense measure to improve the current firearms background check system and to save lives 25 years ago today we began implementation of the Brady background checks Act the system it employs to run background checks on those seeking to purchase firearms from licensed gun dealers has made us safer now it is time to address the circumstances in which the FBI needs additional time to investigate information relating to a prospective purchaser when the records may not be immediately clear as to whether someone is legally allowed to purchase a firearm under current law after a three day after three days a gun dealer has the discretion to sell a gun to a purchaser if the system has not given a green light to the sale when after three business days have passed without a denial being issued by the system in these circumstances it is the choice of the dealer as to whether to proceed with the sale which we call a default proceed or whether to wait for the check to be implemented the results of such a choice were tragic in Charleston South Carolina in 2015 when a young man filled with hate shot and killed nine worshippers at the Emanuel AME Church the gun used in this murder had been transferred by a gun dealer to the shooter even though the check had not been completed by the FBI but which would have resulted in a denial had to check been finished this is not an isolated incident since 1994 gun sellers proceeded with between 3,000 and 4,000 default proceeds sales per year analyzing data provided by the Department of Justice one study found that such sales are eight times more likely to involve a prohibited purchaser than other background checks in 2017 alone default proceeds sales accounted for more than 4,800 transfers to purchasers who were prohibited from owning firearms the FBI reported that in oh seven and oh eight in cases a licensed seller sold a firearm through a default procede transfers gentlelady's time has expired I yield the gentlelady an additional 30 seconds the gentlelady is recognized the FBI reported that an oh seven and oh eight in cases where a licensed seller sold a firearm through default procede transfers approximately 22% of the individuals investigated were legally prohibited from purchasing or possessing a firearm the additional time provided by HR 1112 is not too much to ask so that we may help prevent tragedies such as the Charleston shooting from happening this is why I asked my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill today I yield back the balance of my time

commissioner i understand that senator blunt has brought up already the issue of spent grains grains that have been used to make beer and serve no further purpose to the brewer and are now being used for animal feed i have to tell you that i think the fda's approach is a perfect example of a solution in search of a problem this practice has been going on for literally centuries where brewers have donated or sold often for very little money they're spent grains to farmers in maine we have an emerging craft beer industry that now employs over a thousand people and 90 percent of the spent grains produced by craft brewers are disposed of as animal feed to me this makes great sense it recycles the remainder of the spent grains and there simply is not evidence of of problems i understand and agree that it's essential that we ensure the safety of our nation's food supply but this is an example of of regulatory overreach that will hurt both the small employers that our craft brewers are and the farmers that are working so cooperatively with them so i want to just second the concerns that senator blunt has raised and urge you to take a really hard look at what the impact of that rule is and whether you're really solving uh a problem or creating one well thank you and you you uh were not present when we had the earlier discussion i'll just reiterate that that you know we have have heard these concerns senator blunt actually raised some additional ones around this notion of of sustainable agriculture and recycling of products we actually do think that this is an arena where there are sensible reasonable solutions and we're committed to working towards those and we think that that this issue can be effectively addressed when we um put forward a re-proposal this summer of some of the components of the human and animal feed preventive controls rule and the produce role good i i hope we will see a significant change you

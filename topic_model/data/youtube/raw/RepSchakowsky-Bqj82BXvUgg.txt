good afternoon everyone it is truly an honor to be here with all of you today my name is molly hillman i may have no title no platform a position of authority like all the other speakers around me today but the one thing i do have is a voice a voice that i hope cannot always be for myself but the millions of others facing the immediate effects of the overturn of roe v wade if i've learned anything in the past week it's that the world can be a cruel place the type of cruel that hurts your heart to an unbearable extent the overtime of growing weight is not just about abortion it's about my own life being put at risk today i choose to be vulnerable and share my own story for the sake of all those affected by the court decision at three days old i was diagnosed with hypoplastic left heart syndrome a reverse effect where the left side of my heart was 200 developed to perform along with my diagnosis my parents wanted to expect limited physical activity in my future totaling up to 25 hours in the operating room before my second birthday my entire heart was rewired reading only the right side able to pump water throughout the rest of my body my entire childhood i remain unfazed by my condition oblivious to the circumstances it entailed up until this point i've been fortunate enough not to be restricted physically by my condition only attendance guards showed more however in this past week a new reality has presented itself on june 21st three days prior to her own being overturned i went by the possibility of carrying my own child's term would kill me i learned how fragile my heart truly is i learned how quickly the life you planned in your head can be torn away from you and finally i've learned how insubstantial my rights and the women in this country truly are in the span of three days i lost a family i've pictured in my head since i was a little girl and i lost the one thing that just might save my own life in abortion it is not my first choice rather the only choice i have the preventative measures offered are not compatible with all health conditions in my case potential side effects birth control are blood clots in my heart so i asked myself today what options am i left with i've struggled to come to terms with the fact that i probably won't ever be able to carry my own child unless i want to make the ultimate sacrifice lose my own life we live in a state where abortion is still legal for now and for that i feel truly privileged privileged at 18 years old not to have to choose whether to die or hire an attorney go before a judge and beg for my own life as a woman in america i am insulted how easily my rights have become a privilege roe v wade was not solely based on abortion but entailed the fundamental right to be treated as a human being in this country and as a human being i've never felt less than i do today no matter what happens from here on out women girls and people with reproductive systems everywhere will continue to live with the trauma of knowing that this country has and will continue to take our rights away i share my story and hope to educate those who are privileged enough not to have to deal with the consequences of this decision it's not just about abortion and those who have yet to realize that will vary soon the overturning of rho isn't about life because if it was my own and millions of others wouldn't be at risk right now three open heart surgeries later and i'm still standing here today and i will not stand by and let lawmakers politicize to fighting my life the decision to share my story was not an easy one to make but a necessary one because they will not stop at bro they will not stop until their personal beliefs have been forcefully imposed on every citizen in this country that is not the language of free because freedom entails freedom of choice the hardest decision a woman will ever have to make is not one of lawmakers women will die and the court has made it abundantly clear that they do not value life they value power i am angry i am let down and i am saddened that this country trusts women so little that i'm only left with one option i will not be silent not today not tomorrow or ever you may not like abortion and that opinion is completely valid because it is your choice not to get one however what is not okay is restricting life-saving resources to people across this country the word healthcare is wild widely accepted as any effort made to maintain or restore physical mental or emotional well-being the supreme court has shown all women in america that the only thing they care to maintain is power the power to diminish women as human beings the power to define what is not healthcare and the power to decide how my story is going to end so the last week has been a very busy and hectic time on our homeline since the court's decision came down we've supported double the amount of people based in wisconsin that we normally see where as the agenda mentioned there's currently no accessible abortion care due to a pre-row abortion ban that's in the process of being challenged but that is an uphill battle the second that road fell and clinics were forced to close their doors we received an email and resources from our partners at women's medical fund in wisconsin and we got to work supporting wisconsinites traveling across state lines to the care that they needed and that's just one testament to the way that a network of abortion funds across the country is working together to make sure people get the care that they need as bans and restrictions and closures continue to come down we're standing by people until they get the abortion care that they need one caller from kentucky where there was an immediate trigger ban already needed to leave their state to make an appointment in ohio but when the six-week ban in ohio dropped their appointment was canceled at the last minute they had to scramble to find an appointment here in illinois and we supported them because they had even less money to put towards care than before as they made these travel arrangements the president in his very emotional and heartfelt speech after the supreme court decision to overturn roe v wade ended by saying this this decision is not final this decision is not final and he looked out into the crowd and he said you have the final word talking to all americans and we can begin that and make great progress in november at the election we need to get people out to vote they need to make decisions based on who is for fundamental rights and who is not when they make that uh that vote and if we have that majority in the in the senate as well as in the in the house we as a congress of the united states of america could restore reproductive rights the president of the united states would sign such a law and we could begin again and so this this ruling that puts so many people millions and millions of people in danger everyone here is doing their most to meet the needs but every person who has the right to vote can also make that contribution to changing the way things are we as an office have been acting in a sort of post-world capacity prior to the dobbs decision you look at the statistics from from 2017 where i think uh 5500 women came into the state of illinois in 2019 and increased to study 500 and close to 10 000 uh the last in 2020 the it reflects a trend that is going to spike up uh exponentially now that the dobbs decision has come down and now that we're in a situation the term safe haven has been used the term oasis has been used and those are accurate terms because of what is reflected in the states immediately surrounding the state of illinois so much of what we're hearing in the states around us are about our supreme court so i'm just going to start by reminding everyone abortion is legal in illinois right now if you have an appointment keep it if you're thinking about making one make it but it's only as strong as the next election if row no longer holds the right to contraception is next similarly constitutional rights for lgbt lgbtq people in this country came from cases that followed roe and marriage equality and and similar lgbtq rights are next on the chopping block justice thomas wrote a concurring opinion and dobbs making no secret of the fact that he thinks there is no consequence constitutional protection for these other rights even if people don't think that abortion is an issue that touches them i think we should all be concerned about the government's ability to intrude into these most private areas of our lives we love who we marry and decisions about what our families look like we are in a marathon we're not in a sprint and the marathon may start with a special session next week where we get out of the the starting gate and we get a jump on things right and we demonstrate that we are taking action to protect folks here but there will be ongoing work and there may be work in the fall and there's going to be work next year and the work around this is about several different areas that will be really important on those practical solutions that actually make a difference first we need to look at expanding that provider goal making sure it's not a big barrier for a provider from another state to come in here and start providing care we want to make sure that we look at who's providing the services which includes looking at our advanced practice clinicians like nurse practitioners who already are prescribing medication abortion and in other states are performing certain procedures we can do that here in illinois we need to protect providers which has been mentioned already and make sure that if they have concerns about their licenses in other states or discipline or things like that that we're exploring how to protect them and lastly and most importantly coming from a provider provider perspective is the resources that are needed to make sure people have access to care there's been a lot of discussion in the last few days about our rights but a right is meaningless if you cannot actually exercise it and access it

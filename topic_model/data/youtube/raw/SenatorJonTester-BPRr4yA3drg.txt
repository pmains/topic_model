thank you madam chair just real quickly I'm a reference this in my opening remarks there's a contract out there that the the CBP is entered into on hiring and I want the contract I'll just be honest with you you 43 million bucks supposed to hire 7,500 people they haven't hired anybody and by the way if they would have hired the 7,500 people it would have been thirty nine thousand dollars per person would have been the cost it's one of those things that people go to the Senate floor make speeches on and I just want to know why is this happening and are you going to stop it and I just don't see the positive I I mean I see a positive for trying to get people on board we need to do that but this seems a bit beyond the pale yeah sooner let me just start by you know I've had many conversations about border security and hiring and I really appreciate your support oh wait yeah and I know that you're asking the question for purposes of trying to get us the folks that we need in the most effective way possible yeah the way the contract works is Accenture does not get paid until we have entry on duty until there's an EOD the 13,000 is meant to capture the full lifecycle of hiring so it's everything from the advertising through to the training through the onboarding at CBP's case that's the polygraph it's the physical test so there are the two 9290 seven million is for the 13,000 people to be inspired yes sir as far as I believe I'll get back if that numbers wrong in my mind but I believe so yes sir okay so we're happy to show you our modeling CBP and our HR folks did quite a bit of work on what is the most effective way to do this yeah and at least the figures showed that rather than hiring up our HR department to be able to have all the people we need to process this it was more cost effective to do it by EOD so again they're not paid unless we actually bring somebody on board so just okay at that rate is 43,000 bucks a person 13,000 by 297 million here's the rub you signed the contract in November it says you've allocated 43 million you said they get no until they bring on the person and they're actually on board but but the question is they haven't done anything yet I mean it were November hell were seven eight months into this thing so some of this was this strategy around for example looking at how we could add mobility into the processes you know there are some places on some of our border areas where people do not necessary that do all sorts of things for the government and I can tell you a lot of them I've had some pretty bad experience with because they promise they don't deliver and this doesn't look like to deliver and whether delivering in Washington DC or Whitefish Montana Minot North Dakota anywhere hard places easy places but we obviously want to try to get some more people on board and I just I've got to tell you when I look at this it appears to me a just a total boondoggle I mean I'm just going to tell you well I you know I share your view on holding a holding accountable yeah so why don't we come talk to you this week and just walk you through and let's fair how to make it better would love to and then I've got a number of questions just want to touch on one real quick and that's TSA TSE sees a cat getting rid of some Viper units getting rid of a number of other things it's pretty important that's all I'm going to tell you I mean those guys do a hell of a job and we need to make sure that's beefed up just as much as we do on our ports and borders which I think we all agree - thank you for being here Thank You senator Shaheen

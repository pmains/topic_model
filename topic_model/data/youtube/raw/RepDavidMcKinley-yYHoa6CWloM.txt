mayor when the vice president says that they're not going to support clean coal technology there will not be clean coal when the when the president slashes the funding for a National Energy Technology lab for its work in clean coal technology by forty-one percent I I'm astounded that you can sit there and say there's no war on coal when I have a list of 20 some companies 20-some powerhouses it's just my immediate area that have been shut down because of this war on coal when the thousands of people that have lost their jobs at work there know fully well that it's because of the EPA's aggressiveness I'm astounded people in miami fort Beckford piqua bayshore lakeshore avon lake ashtabula eastlake dials conesville muskingum river armstrong newcastle shawsville tightest portland omarama albright camera reidsville Willow island Kanawha Phillips sport I would just suggest mr. wife you go to those neighborhoods and you tell them this is not a war on coal when they're sitting there home without a job mr. Cox if I could go to you a little bit on the thing please your your your comments have been interesting about health air quality I'm just curious given that the World Health Organization's own statistics have indicated that indoor air quality is twice as hazardous more twice the people have died I feel excuse me let me correct that twice number of people have died due to indoor air quality than outdoor air quality are you aware of that I don't think that I was no I'm sorry no okay the also that the EPA came out in their own website saying the indoor air quality of 96 times worse than outdoor air quality I'm trying to understand it's an engineer someone needs to teach me then why are we so focused on shutting down our plants and our facilities and putting people out of work when the real threat to our health and safety is on an indoor air quality yeah I think that there is a natural human tendency as dr. committee's illustrated with the Atlanta example to say well sometimes things go up sometimes they go down if only we could control the decrease in mortality it would be great for constituents it would be great for public health and what they forget is to look quantitatively at questions like was there a reduction in mortality rate in Atlanta for example there was any greater from the reductions elsewhere that wouldn't have occurred anyway the comparison between indoor and outdoor air pollution is similarly a matter of numbers not a matter of direction or of hope so when I refer to wishful thinking and bad statistics as the basis for conclusions such as the false conclusion drawn from the Atlanta study a conclusion that the health effects Institute has recently rejected for example I think that a lot of this turns on our intuitive feeling that qualitative direction matters and are forgetting to look at the numbers you think watch if I could dr. Cox do you think we should be spending more time perhaps looking at our indoor air quality because I'm hearing a lot of testimony here over the year over the last 18 months about all these premature deaths and the like caused by outdoor in these greenhouse gas emissions but yet if the air indoor air quality of 96 times worse how do we differentiate the person got an asthma attack because of greenhouse gas emissions as compared to their indoor situation whether someone that in the in their house was smoking a cigarette how do you differentiate this is so excellent question for the perp of our tight time stranger let me just say that there are excellent and readily available quantitative methods for causal analysis that allow one to compare indoor and outdoor pollution effects for example it is not true that this is a very difficult matter and causation is ambiguous all we need to do is to look at the issues that you're raising or the issues that dr. communities raised using readily available quantitative methods these methods are documented in my written testimony Thank you Thank You Ahmed I'm Thank You mr. McKinley yeah this time chair recognizes gentleman from Virginia mr. Griffin for

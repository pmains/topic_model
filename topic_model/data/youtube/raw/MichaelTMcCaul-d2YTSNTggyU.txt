thank you good for the field hearing in laredo is very productive mr. Cuellar chief thank you for being here thanks for your service I always learned something new every time I go down there we note the task force and they talked about the nuevo laredo the gang yeah the cartel activity going on there between the Sinaloa and the Zetas cartels and this was last week predicting that the violence was going to go up it was going to spike and sure enough last Friday 23 individuals were killed in Nuevo Laredo hung over bridges decapitated just a reminder that the border is not a safe place that we do need to secure the border I think the thing that keeps me up at night the most would be the idea of weapons-grade uranium being smuggled from a place like Iran to Venezuela and then between a port of entry a dirty bomb in a major city that to me is terrifying and yet it's not far-fetched I think that's something that is very possible so operation control of the board is important last I liked it was forty-four percent under operational control you know you have this new strategy now that scraps operational control and now the GAO has come in to testify that this new strategy does not have performance measures can you I guess I'm a little confused we're not talking about operational control anymore taking that off the table and now the new strategy has no performance measures at all how can we possibly measure whether the border is secure night no chief yes congressman we will have we have measures right now in other words we're not again going to dismiss all of the measures or the metrics or the comparative statistics that we have done within the organization those continue what we're trying to do is match those now with the strategic objectives that are outlined in this particular strategy when you look the scenario that that you outline is one of the primary factors and our rethinking about how we apply resources to the border and one instance in 2004 quite frankly it was brute force right we realized that we were getting more resources both in terms of Border Patrol agents we were getting fence built we were getting technology and so the strategy really was get everything forward we wanted to stop the flows that were coming in the the scenario that you depict is is very akin to being able to identify a needle in the haystack if you will now in order to extract the needle and I'll use this in terms of a particular threat that you just mentioned there's two different general approaches that you can do to get that needle the first is having very specific intelligence information regarding the intent and capability of the opposition timing to be able to surgically go into that haystack and remove it well over the last 10 years or so that necessary that really didn't was not applicable in our border scenario we were not getting that level of intelligence to be able to extract it that way so the other approach that you can do to find the needle is to reduce the haystack and so if you look at some of the shifts in our approach between strategies 2004 was built to be able to reduce the haystack as we have done that in terms of people coming across the border in terms of not just the apprehensions but the individuals those unique individuals that make up our border environment in which we operate has changed and so we try to do is now leverage and try to figure out what is it going to take and and of this new strategic approach what then are those metrics that are going to continue to carry over that we have traditionally been reporting in addition what our new metrics that we haven't been reporting that really taught to more about the the risk along our borders that's why when I said earlier it's it's more of a methodology than a particular metric we want to be able to come back to the committee either an open or a closed hearing to be able to tell you about the information and the intelligence that we're hearing either very tactically or in a broad sense talk about the capabilities that CBP has to be able to show you how we are assessing risk in how we are going to minimize that risk at any given time to get that briefing the one thing we learned also is that the human smuggling at the port of entry has gone way down now we saw 5,000 18-wheelers go through the port of entry and they said that they really find humans now in the cargo it's mostly drugs coming through so that means are coming through the ports of metro and Robert Lee the apprehensions have gone way down the disturbing statistic is load salem rate has gone way up the others than mexicans so between the port of entry is where the scenario i outline is probably most likely to happen I do think technology is going to be the solution to getting that under security no secure can you tell me we're l with the latest advances in technology and what is your strategic plan to deliver technology to the border well the strategic plan really talks about optimizing capability the first thing before we say hey we need 10 more of these and 15 more of these is to take a look about about what capability what technology has been deployed over the last few years one are we utilizing and they're in the right combination I'll give you a quick example take a look at Arizona we have everything from unattended ground sensors and that are implanted in the ground we have mobile surveillance systems we have integrated fixed hours we have light and medium lift helicopters that are running forward-looking infrared and we have you a esas that are running payloads that whole suite of capability is something that this organization over the last few years is just trying to figure out how do you deploy that within the theater of operation they're not deployed equally because they all have different capabilities so we have to understand organizationally and within the leadership how we maximize those capabilities and then how we shift and redeploy resources from areas that were once in areas of high threat in terms of activity levels and redeploy those to new areas where we have seen you the displacement or new emerging threats along our border well thank you live an enormous challenge I thank you for your service in them without bag

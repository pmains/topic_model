Definitely take care of business
in the classroom, take those academic obligations
seriously, try to stay active. I mean, these academies,
they really love fit individuals, people that show discipline of being able
to take care of their mind and body. The mission of the Naval Academy
is moral, mental and physical. So showcase your discipline in taking care
of your body, mind, and also reach out in your community, engage in activities
that show that you are other oriented.

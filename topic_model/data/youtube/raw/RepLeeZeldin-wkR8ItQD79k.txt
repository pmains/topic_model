dang it you actually said it's president Trump's fault that the iaea is not allowed to have access to Iran's military sites where the IAEA has never had access to Iran's military sites but you're here sir blaming you blaming President Trump for not having access to something we had never had access to President Obama said is this deal is not built on trust it's built on verification have you read the verification agreement between the IAEA and Iran I have not read it no I have read the deal though which says very clearly you have not read the verification agreement between the IAEA and Iran and when secretary Kerry was here he admitted that he hadn't read the verification agreement between the IAEA and Iran either so a deal that's built on not on trust but built on verification the leaders of our government never read what the verification agreement was and the entire deal was built on verification

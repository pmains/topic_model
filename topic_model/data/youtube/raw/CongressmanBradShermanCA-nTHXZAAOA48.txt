they're even more available to you in business hours starting tomorrow morning uh we will have uh a guest speaker in just a second as we have had uh dr lynn goldman uh in the past she is both a pediatrician and an epidemiologist and i will introduce her in just a bit i want to cover in the opening statement here something that's very local and then something that is international for the first time in 10 years members of congress have been able to get individual projects for their districts funded and we were successful in getting 10 projects funded one is for a community room ranger station public restrooms a lot of other things that's part of the 30 acre project that will also include uh stadium and bleacher seating and landscaping and uh and and multi-purpose sports fields which are so important uh i i certainly identify with uh with fathers whose uh need to go to that ayso game that starts at seven o'clock because there aren't enough sports fields uh to to have the games uh at reasonable times so um this will all be at uh uh in a 30-acre area just west of the existing sepulveda basin sports complex we're able to secure two million dollars for an organization i have just a lot of respect for and that is the hope of the valley rescue mission they are so-called they're cost-effective they're kind and i i don't know a private group that does more for the homeless and the unhoused in the san fernando valley uh a million dollars for a group called baby to baby that helps um uh women without means of this and and the unhoused women who have very young children diaper strollers um we were able to secure a million dollars for el perjecto de barrio for their clinic in winnetka that will now have six additional dental exam rooms and six additional uh women's specialty examination rooms um we were able to secure money for cal state northridge to look at addressing the long-term mental health needs of a valley children affected by the covet lockdowns about half a million for labor community services which distributes food helps with emergency rental payments um we're able to get a a quarter million dollars to improve warner center park and a lot of you know i enjoy the uh the sunday concerts that uh are held there uh in the summer and uh this will make the concert uh experience i think a lot more a lot more enjoyable as we improve the park and and the stage um we're able to get money for computer labs for a group called new directions for youth which teaches teach teaches at-risk youth how to deal with with computers and even how to fix them um tree people um is going to be planting and it's not just planting the trees it's caring for the trees for their first three years particularly in those areas that were scarred by the aliso canyon fire and the cessna on fire and then finally we're able to get some money for the valley economic alliance to provide uh technical training for businesses around the san fernando valley so there's the uh the very local the very international is obviously ukraine we see the heart-wrenching stories we should keep in mind that there are also heart-wrenching stories that are not put on your television set from other areas of the world yemen syria and most significantly the tigray region of ethiopia and in those areas there have actually been more human suffering but what makes ukraine different is it's not just a humanitarian disaster it is also an attack on the international world order if you look at the history of the 20th century and prior centuries the great wars were fought over one country going over its borders and trying to conquer another and that really hasn't happened this century uh and as far as as annexing or taking over the half or all of the territory of a clearly independent country that pretty much hasn't happened since world war ii except with russia taking certain regions of the country of georgia and certain regions that they had taken in 2014 of ukraine and now it appears they're trying to seize all of ukraine i don't think they'll be successful but that it appears to be their preferred outcome um there's been a lot of analogies to world war ii um i think we'll learn more by studying the history of world war one which was a world war that broke out when no one country wanted a long world war and i don't think russia wants a world war i know we don't either but the history of 1914 shows you that this can happen um i've been a member of the ukraine caucus for 10 15 years and as a group and as an individual i've been pressing to provide the uh the defense material that ukraine needs long before ukraine was in the in the headlines um and they had they got an awful lot from us before this year and they are using it uh spectacularly well as far the controversy comes with the no-fly zone proposal and there um you've got the idea of americans shooting at russians whether on the ground or in the air is uh is particularly scary um we did not see that in the wars of the 20th century even though we were backing one side and they were backing the other we did not shoot at russians in korea in vietnam and in the afghan war of the 1980s where we were where russia was fighting insurgents armed by the united states no flag zone sounds good except to protect your pilots it's not enough to just fly over ukraine you have to destroy the um the anti-aircraft systems that russia has and those systems are located in russia and in belarus so for our pilots to be safe in a no-fly zone they would have to conduct bombing raids against russia against belarus and uh that would bring us far closer to uh to nuclear war than we've been ever uh so it's important that we avoid that i i think we'll get a question about the the new newest controversy on that and that is whether certain mig aircraft soviet-built aircraft owned by poland uh can be transferred to ukraine but uh i'm sure we'll get questions on ukraine i'm sure we'll get questions on a host of other subjects but right now i want to turn it over uh to our our guest dr lynn goldman as i said pediatrician and epidemiologist a member of the national academy of sciences masters in public health of course a medical degree and one of the leaders of public health uh and she'll tell us a little bit about where we stand with kovid and i hope uh then that you can cover uh vaccinations for those age six and younger and when uh booster shots there's a proposal to give a fourth shot to those who are over age 65 and uh it looks like pfizer is uh um is working on a uh a booster shot for the fall that should be particularly designed to deal with omicron and delta so i hope you can tell us about about the vaccinations but about everything else dr goldman certainly and thank you so much for having me i'm at your town hall meeting tonight so things are as you know i'm looking up in the u.s right now we've done a very good job in the last few weeks with bringing down the rates of kovid and and i we're in what i would call a lull in terms of the transmission being fairly low across all of our country um we of course could have more surges which is why i think of this as a wall and not an actual you know end of the pandemic but it feels like the end in some ways and it is definitely a time when we can all be somewhat more relaxed a little less vigilant and um and have a little bit more fun with being able to get together without having to worry so much about distancing and masking and all of that but at the same time it's also a time when we need to be preparing for what is very likely to be the next version of coded that as it comes through of course which right now we have no idea what it will look like but and that means building up our capacity to do testing now we have good treatments we need to have enough of those pills around i happen to like the new strategy that's been rolled out by the biden administration called test to treat where you get a rapid test and fits positive you can start a treatment right away i think that's a really good idea and above all to immunize and especially the people who haven't yet had any immunizations and it's a little bit daunting to realize that in l.a county there's still about 30 of people who are not immunized and who are still therefore very susceptible to covid as you said though there's some progress being made also in improving our approach to immunization one problem still is the lack of an approved or even authorized vaccine for children age five and below and those vaccines have been uh tested but it's it's it seems like there may be some challenges with coming up with the right dose for very young children you want a dose that is potent enough to create the immune response but you don't want a dose that creates some of the ever side effects and especially given that children are at lower risk for some of the worst side effects of covet itself that there's been a lot of caution about that and so the the two companies that make the mrna vaccine have taken completely different approaches to developing those vaccines for little kids pfizer which already has some vaccines for children over the age of six their vaccines have been found especially in the age of 6 to 11 year band the kids receiving pfizer didn't have this effective immunity during the last wave of covid as as we would have liked to have seen and pfizer was using a very low dose and now has developed a vaccine that's even lower dose for the children under the age of five meanwhile moderna is coming forth with data for the fda to review with a vaccine for younger kids that's somewhat more potent which they say is also very safe so it remains to be seen how how this is all going to play out these vaccines the companies have to go to the fda and they'll undergo strict safety review by the fda and then they have to be reviewed by the centers for disease control but i think that there's reason to hope that within the next few months at least one of those products if not both of them will be available for children under the age of five and then we'll be able to get things sorted out on how to have an effective vaccine for the older kids you mentioned the issue of the fourth uh shot basically the second booster and that is a proposal that pfizer is putting in front of the food and drug administration right now there is a lot of data that indicates that over time the vaccines wane in their effectiveness and so i'm beginning to be of the opinion that it's really not a matter of whether we're going to get boosters it's more of a matter of when that's going to be happening and and which boosters we will receive will it be the same vaccine that we've already received or as you mentioned you know will it be a different one that's been tweaked to be more effective against the delta and omicron variant and or maybe it will be both we might have to do both but this is the time definitely to catch up on vaccines and especially for people who aren't yet vaccinated to go and get it thank you very much thank you let's now open it up to questions from the floor and please tell me your name and what town you live in and what your question is okay congressman we have madeline who has a question about ukraine uh madeleine you are on now oh hi thank you so much uh you know i've been very consumed with the situation in ukraine and i know you have too representative sherman i've been calling very frequently um i'm wondering what your thinking is and your feelings actually more your feelings rather than your thinking um about giving uh zielinski and the ukrainians the you know either the migs or other ways to close the the skies as they say because they are being really bombarded and you know these are targeting civilians i don't know how this is tolerable but it's very traumatizing even just to watch it and i can only imagine what the people are going through over there so we have to stop the trauma and we have to stop the bombing and we have to stop dictators doing these kinds of things but that's my opinion i want to know how you're feeling about it i think most people uh agree with you i certainly feel that we have to do uh everything we can under difficult circumstances to help ukraine and especially deal with high-altitude aircraft now we have given them and are rushing to them as much as we can the missiles to deal with armor and tanks and most aircraft that is to say those flying at lower medium altitudes but there's the high altitudes and uh the discussion is should they should poland transfer soviet era migs to them that raises questions about uh first whether those would be effective uh if there's dog fights in the sky uh this the russian air force is uh is much larger than ukraine and has some planes that are more advanced than the ukrainians can fly um so what's more likely to protect ukraine are anti-aircraft missile systems and that's what we need to transfer one problem we have is that we don't have as many of them uh in our own stockpile as we would like um the other problem we that arose with poland's offer is that poland was willing to transfer the planes and expect that the united states would give them for free much better planes and that was certainly in the cards but they got skittish over the issue of how to transfer the plane with regard to anything that can be trucked into the ukraine it's being trucked in and so uh you know a case of rifles goes in it's in ukraine a day later they open the box and they pass out the rifles and so the war is in ukraine if instead a plane takes off from poland it's ready to fight um as it flies over the border and if a plane were to take off from poland and bomb russians on the ground or engage with russians in the sky that is in effect an air raid emanating from poland so poland said well we'll transfer the planes not in the direction of ukraine but in the other direction west to germany and we'll have the united states figure this one out and we have not figured it out um i do not think that these planes can be trucked in i don't think they can be disassembled and as i said our military experts have uh have said that planes are not that useful for ukraine because they're going to get shot down and that what's useful is and what has been most useful to ukraine are the uh the shoulder fired uh anti-aircraft missiles um chiefly the stinger the um and uh so we'll see how this develops another advantage of the stinger is uh we hope ukraine wins the conventional stage of this war and they are uh holding their own and every day that the russians don't win they're winning um but uh what's daunting for putin is that even if he can get his tanks into the middle of kiev he's then going to have to occupy ukraine and there is stingers are extremely effective for guerrilla operations we saw that in afghanistan both against us but especially against the soviets in the 1980s and uh so i uh i think that uh putin needs an off-ramp uh we may see a negotiated settlement in the next week is zelinski has already said okay ukraine won't join nato that may be enough of a a concession so that uh so that putin can announce victory and leave which is what we want them to do um now the fact is ukraine wasn't going to join nato um this decade next decade and the reason for that is ukraine's territory especially the crimea also areas of the eastern dambass have been occupied by russia since uh 2014. if ukraine joins nato on monday we're at war with russia on tuesday the reason for that is that we have to treat the uh occupation of uh ukrainian territory um as the same as occupying our territory if ukraine were part of nato which is why we're not uh nato membership isn't in the cards until that's resolved um so i don't think ukraine is going to be joining nato if we can go back to where we were at the beginning of this year it'll be a huge step forward for the for ukrainian people for the rest of the world uh putin deserves to be humiliated and defeated but if we can restore peace um and restore ukrainian control of all the territory they controlled four weeks ago i think that's a major step forward and i think uh putin is going to be paying a big price for this economically and i'll point out uh madeline your question was similar to that of peter gold of west hills who submitted his question in advance i was going to answer his i just did and i answered answered yours as well let's take another question from the floor okay uh congressman this one is uh likely for the doctor um robert in sherman oaks question about vaccines robert you are on now hi there hi doctor i just had a quick question about the uh percentage of unvaccinated uh people in los angeles i was wondering if you had at your fingertips uh that 30 how much of that 30 is in the pediatric population that's my question thank you i can't give you an exact number but you're raising a good point a fair number of them are in the pediatric population mostly people in the pediatric population who have approved vaccines that they could be taking but who have not yet been immunized i would also say that a fair number of them though are older people people of all ages who are still hesitant about receiving the vaccinations and um and and even some of them are people who actually have known um known are known to have to be immunocompromised and i've i've spoken with many people who on the basis of being immunocompromised are more afraid of a vaccine than getting covered and to which i have to say that it is far safer to get the vaccine there is no evidence that the vaccine harms people who are immunocompromised and there's a lot of evidence that covet is extremely dangerous to them but thank you you're right some of them are kids now let's do a survey question um the question is do you approve president biden's handling of the uk crisis so far press one if you approve of how president biden is handling the crisis press two if you disapprove and three if you're unsure or somewhere in the middle uh we'll have those uh results for you and now let's go on to another question okay congressman um we have um a call uh from jeremy and encino jeremy you are on now um hello congressman sherman hello are you there yes um hi sherman uh funny enough i actually need to go to the same temple um but what do you call it um i have a question um about the military to be specific um my question is hold up i had it written down somewhere where i watched it um here we go i have it okay here's my question since we know that the military is the biggest contributor to false fuel emissions in the country and that most of the oil we produce domestically is exported or sent to the military what will you do to decrease both emissions and the cost of oil you know it's possible to do but so far no one stepped up to do it why is that i i i'm not sure i heard every word of your question um you're talking about the price of oil and also the amount used by the military and the emissions that come from the military um that would be correct um the military um is the biggest contributor to fossil fuel emissions in the country well uh you're cutting in in and out but all of this whether the military's largest kind of depends upon how you classify things certainly the military is the biggest institution uh in in the country uh on the other hand obviously emissions from autos emissions from power plants uh nationwide dwarf the military there is a a real attention to reducing emissions from the military but as long as our military remains uh very large and this gets into the foreign policy aspects uh um as long as it's the biggest institution of the country it will certainly be uh um the biggest it'll be the biggest source of emissions as to the price of oil um a lot of democrat versus republican sniping is about um the democrats not allowing oil to be produced in certain environmentally sensitive ways i'd say what you have to understand is that the price of oil is a worldwide price so you could say well gee if we could just drill off santa barbara and grab that oil for the southern california then our prices would go down uh or it just it it doesn't work that way the amount that somebody is going to get for their oil is reflective of the world price and the united states is energy independent we export oil we import oil roughly the same amount but the price that we in california pay for texas oil um doesn't it it doesn't matter if texas produces 10 percent more oil or 10 percent less oil it's a world price um now the sanctions against putin are designed to prevent him from being able to sell oil if to the extent they're effective that takes 4 million barrels a day off the world supply they're right now over half effective uh putin's uh people are running around now trying to figure out how to get around these sanctions but now they're more than half the oil is off the world market the saudis and have refused to pump more oil even knowing that the russian oil is off the market that decision shows that they've forgotten how much we saved them for example in the first gulf war when saddam hussein not only conquered kuwait but was ready to conquer the part of saudi arabia that has all the oil which is the part kind of close to kuwait um the saudis uh want to be neutral between those who [Music] care about between putin and his victims and uh that doesn't uh that that's not the an appropriate response from a country that has time and again called upon the united states to protect its security the final thing and again this goes back to u.s levels of production what democrats have been known for is pushing for energy conservation fuel efficiency standards um alternative energy and these have dramatically reduced what would otherwise be the price of oil and the consumption of oil when i first got you know my first car got about eight miles to the gallon um we have almost doubled fuel economy over the last 30 35 years and that's because people who care about the environment have been pushing um and uh not to mention the alternative energy the conservation uh and uh hopefully we'll see a mass transit system that gets better in los angeles so um we uh um we do need to reduce the amount of fuel we use both uh in general and in the military um kind of a separate foreign policy issue is should the united states play this enormous role that we play uh in in uh world uh foreign policy and uh when you see us being able to step forward and help ukraine that uh it argues for uh for the big role that we play but uh we we play an oversized role in the military and national security uh arena in the world uh we have avoided a world war um after we fought two world wars in two generations or in one generation one half generations apart and so um i'm sure we'll get some more foreign policy questions and the one thing underlying our foreign policy questions is should the united states uh play this enormous role in working for world security uh let's uh see uh the uh the uh answers on that survey question biden's handling of ukraine 64 of you approve 19 percent disapprove 17 are unsure um that's more unsure than we typically get on questions asking whether you approve or disapprove of a president and that stands to reason this crisis has been going on for three weeks and we're gonna have to see how it develops um at this point i'm gonna well i'll go to uh a second survey question um yeah here's one of that i'm personally interested in uh with coveted restrictions easing in los angeles uh uh this summer do you think we should emphasize having telephone town halls like this one or switch back to the in-person town halls and if you haven't been to a sherman in-person town hall it'd be very hard to enforce any kind of mask mandate or anything like that you it's it it can get a bit rowdy there are uh people in the in our in our valley that support donald trump and people that uh are angered by him so um i'll ask you to push one if you think we should emphasize telephone town halls press two if we should emphasize in-person town halls and three if you're unsure um let's go to another question from the floor okay congressman gregory in sherman oaks has a question about the bill the senate just passed today to make daylight savings year-round hello hello hello hi greg can you hear me um i i can hear you can you hear me yes i can okay good um the so-called sunshine protection act passed today by the u.s senate and now awaiting house action which if it passes will put all of us and everything we do on year-round daylight saving time is really a terrible piece of legislation the best way to eliminate the twice a year obnoxious time change i think very intensely is to move to year round standard time and this is for a whole range of quality of life health equity and environmental reasons for example year-round daylight savings time will definitely not help america reduce oil use will not help decarbonization everything we do from getting up to going to school to going to work to finally maybe at the end of the day having a little bit of social time is all going to be made much more stressful i think this act should be called the make everything happen earlier act especially bad for students especially bad for people who use public transit and wait for buses as i know it's going to be bad for me a lot of people do not are not functioning best during the morning half of us function better later in the day if we just have standard time which is also aligned with the rotation of the earth we can also implement all of the many flexible provisions that we need i think to not just reduce oil but to allow everybody to live a good life flex time right you obviously you obviously feel very very strongly uh and i do want to take a look at this bill coming from the senate i think if we do any either of them year round we'll eventually do what we want to do when we do it that is to say if 8 am is always 8 am and we as a society don't want to be at work at 8 a.m so employers will specify that we're to be at work at 9 00 a.m um i don't i i agree with you the change is just a problem and uh as you know i've got a job where i live in two time zones and so it's a um i i find it a problem to change time zones and changing from daylight to uh to standard is is the same thing only everybody has to do it not just those of us who are on a plane um the the original adoption of daylight saving time was with a theory that it would reduce uh energy usage and there have been um studies on that that uh say it does and or let's say it doesn't as to whether life is better uh with daylight versus um standard um you know i'm happy in february i'm happy in may um obviously may is better in that there's more but you know there's more total sunshine but that's the matter of the earth circling the sun that's not a matter of anything we can do with the clocks so it's hard to compare the two but uh so i think a lot of people object to the change um and um we'll we'll have to see because i mean you know regardless of uh whether you have daylight or standard time there are schools in this country that start at 7 a.m there are schools in this country that start at 9am and i hope educators will pick the time on knowing that the earth is involved and the the real time when the sun rises and sets um that that allows students to to learn best and i count on employers to do the same thing but i uh uh the daylight saving time has been talked about um kind of continuously since world war one um and uh now that uh the senate has sent this bill to us i look forward to studying it uh let's do uh another survey question here um should we impose sanctions on russia even if it raises oil and gasoline prices worldwide uh one yes sanction russia two uh no if it's going to raise uh oil prices three unsure and we'll get those answers back to you and i'm going to take one of the rsvp questions uh you can submit a question writing by going to bradsherman.house.gov town hall and uh deborah llewellyn of sherman oaks uh did just that and she asks uh thank you for sending a letter to secretary bouditch about appointing a new faa administrator who will meaningfully address jet noise and pollution from the faa next gen flight path changes um will you please also schedule a meeting as soon as possible with secretary buttertech to educate him the airline industry has dominated the faa the airline industry focuses on getting from here to there on time and safely and with no concern for the effect they're having on people on the ground we have out here a quiet skies caucus which is a group of about 40 or 50 of us who are focused on reducing uh noise it's not just a problem for the san fernando valley it's a problem in a lot of areas and when i say quiet skies caucus i know there are groups in la with different names and one of them is quiet skies the quiet skies caucus is you know it's a nice name but it's not affiliated uh with any of uh any of the groups uh in los angeles um perhaps fortunately the faa administrator steve dixon is leaving this is good in one respect at least he has been very unresponsive on noise issues and so now is our time to try to get someone appointed to that job who's not just focused on on-air transportation was also focused on the millions of americans who are on the ground certainly if you live in studio city and not much of sherman oaks etc you realize how the so-called metroplex system has shifted where the planes fly put them over hills that uh where the sound reverberates um and have continued the absurd uh idea that planes that go out of burbank have to go over the southeast san fernando valley they don't they could fly due south they could fly southeast they don't have to hook southwest but they would actually have to spend some time designing the flight patterns for la county and its various airports in order to not afflict the south east valley with all of the burbank uh noise um a couple other things in in the area of of course uh join with my colleagues in introducing the rest act they restore everyone's sleep tonight act so that local airports will have the right to have curfews just as adam schiff and i had legislation reasonably close to passing to give burbank and van nuys airports the right to have a curfew which you don't realize is the airport even the air transportation system is so dominated by the airlines that even the airports who own the airport are not allowed to uh to have curfews um under federal law uh with some exceptions we did have one of those exceptions applied of nis and that's why we have a curfew although there are uh public safety flights and some other flights that that happen late at night and uh i could go on on and on about uh about the faa and um and its insensitivity on on on noise uh one of the more ridiculous things the faa does is they say well in the here in the valley the high the most noisy plane doesn't meet our standards as being extremely noisy while ignoring the fact that at that location you may have a hundred different events a day and so um the faa has got to look not only at what's the noise level but also uh how frequently uh residents are exposed to that noise we have a uh answer should we continue with telephone halls are they in person 76 telephone town hall 15 in person 9 not sure let's take another question from the floor okay congressman we have um uh richard in woodland hills uh richard you're on now yes hello congressman um i had a question uh immigration from ukraine into the us uh so the countries in europe are currently accepting you know multiple millions of refugees into their cup their countries and i don't think that the united states has been doing that um i wanted to to ask some people have family members who have been waiting for many years to come into the united states as for a green card and and they've all they've been through all the processing and have been approved to come to the united states but but there's a long queue you know it can be ten years and um and now some of those people from uh ukraine are in refugee camps in europe and they have nobody to uh to take care of them because their family members are in the united states what is your opinion on allowing an expedited admission process for those those people to come immediately to the united states we've got two and a half million refugees but this is a different kind of refugee these are people who expect to go back to ukraine these are situations a male between the ages of 18 and 60 isn't allowed to leave ukraine and so these are not complete families these are people who want to stay close and go back these are not people who want to come to a different continent leaving the male members of their family in one in ukraine and they want to move here so this is a a different kind of of uh of refugee and uh many of uh ukrainian refugees are are being offered places in in italy and germany and they say no we want to stay in poland we want to stay close we're going back soon um now uh if somebody has we ought to have a rule to allow those with family members here in the united states to come um and i'm sure that if god forbid this is a permanent exodus from the ukraine that america will step forward and take a share of refugees but um people um people from the ukraine want to live in the ukraine and they expect that they'll be going back there in weeks or months um and i think that that that needs to be our goal um as to uh um uh yeah yeah if we're going to accept refugees from from ukraine and we are um we should be accepting those with family members in the united states first and foremost um but uh i uh uh in touch with uh with those on the ground in poland and uh i i don't think that these two and a half million people uh want to live outside their country and i don't think too um i think we do we have some survey results we will soon have some survey results um let's uh let's take uh well let's let's do uh um i guess we have just one more survey question so we might as well get it out of the way here um in response to rising gas prices and this was true even before the invasion of ukraine there have been calls on congress to create a gas tax holiday which would um take 18 cents of tax off the uh the cost of each gallon until january of 2023 now the trust fund that builds our roads would then need to get money from the general fund from income tax revenues because it would not be receiving money from the gas tax if we suspended the gas tax the federal gas tax keep in mind there's a larger state gas tax but that that's outside the purview of our federal discussion here so if you think we should um suspend the 18 cent federal gas tax uh for the rest of the year press one if no press two and if unsure press three um and i realize 18 cents is a small fraction of what we're paying at the pump um okay should we sanction russia even at ra if it raises oil prices worldwide yes 81 percent no 10 unsure nine percent those are the results uh let's take another question from the floor maybe we have one for dr goldman in fact we do uh [Music] susan from sherman oaks you're on now hi there good evening good evening thank you congressman sherman and dr goldman for being here tonight i'm dr goldman i have a question for you i've been reading so much about novomax it's a protein-based vaccine and i just wrote an article this morning in yahoo news that said that there's that the fda is slow walking the approval process for novavax and i just can't understand why um right now we have 65 of all americans vaccinated when we need that to be much greater and we need to vaccinate children i'm sure you can appreciate that being a pediatrician and novavax uh has a really strong track record they did a a big study with children back in august of 2021 and it seemed to have a good efficacy with no serious side effects it also has no serious side effects for adults and i have several friends who are on the fence about getting a vaccine because of health issues and their doctors are actually telling them if they can wait for nova backs to wait for novos especially anything having to do with heart issues so i'm hoping that we can raise awareness about novodax and the need for it they finalized their approval application on january 31st to the fda and it took the fda 21 days or less to grant pfizer moderna and johnson johnson emergency use approval and so far it's been 45 days and they're not even setting a meeting with novavax so i'm just so curious as to why we seem to have a vaccine oh it's improved in 177 other countries including canada the eu australia new zealand um the uk and so i'm just so let's let's hear the doctor's answer yeah yeah thank you for the thank you for the question because i think a lot of people are concerned about this and wondering why it's taking so long for the fda to bring the nova vacs to its advisory committee see the process that fda uses is that the companies submit a big pile of information including all the studies that they've done and the statistics and everything and then their expert reviewers review that and when they're satisfied that they have what would be a possible strong case for approval they bring it to their advisory committee and i don't think anybody knows except people inside fda and perhaps um inside the company that makes novovex what these delays have been about uh you know because the fda doesn't really reveal very much about what its procedures are until they go to the advisory committee and then they at the you know really the very last minute right before these meetings they will share all of their analyses and so it i there are many theories one is that it's it doesn't seem urgent as urgent as it did earlier on in the pandemic when there was no vaccine at all but it's also possible and i've seen this a lot and and actually at one point in my career i was a regulator and there can be a tug of war between a company and the regulator if fda has data a way that they want to look at the information and the company doesn't agree and that kind of thing could be going on behind the scenes but we don't really know but i think you're making a good point it would be another option and i think that that we probably need it um there we are using it in a number of countries across the world um i would say i wouldn't wait for it i'd go ahead and get a vaccine now probably one of the mrna but it could be the jnj vaccine and then you know one could switch over to nova vaccinator uh since it seems like we're going to have to have boosters and and periodically change vaccines over time but i certainly i wouldn't wait for it um because i i can't even i i can't fathom why it is that there is a delay um but thank you for the question and and susan uh uh you've shown some real persistence you were also one of the uh our written questions i was going to call on or or answer or actually have dr goldman answer but you also asked it orally um speaking of written questions we've got one for me from robert shellhorn of woodland hills he says you're a fraud who has supported anti-american anti-energy independence and the sick welfare state your party believes in taxing and punishing success while subsidizing stupidity and failure you are an anti-constitution sicko who should go back to russia exclamation point i will go i am going back to the san fernando valley this weekend uh as to energy independence um democrats uh have pushed for conservation particularly for mileage standards that have done more for making us energy independent than than then two texas and a and a north dakota uh as i mentioned before we're getting twice the mileage per gallon on average almost as we were 30 years ago that being said we are producing more oil in this country um today than we did when biden took office and uh are on target to produce more oil in the united states in 2023 than has ever been produced in the united states in history but are the price we pay is going to be dependent upon the world price um and that's why um hopefully we can solve the ukraine problem and then russia's oil could be purchased and hopefully we'll see greater production out of saudi arabia and lower that world price um i i've answered a lot a lot of robert's questions and now we'll give a report on the last uh the last question here uh survey question should we suspend the federal gas tax 50 percent say yes 32 percent say no and 18 are unsure um let's take a question from the floor okay congressman uh we have um a question from uh gary from west hills gary you are on right now hey yuri hi uh thank you congressman for taking my question it has been you've been touched on this a number of times uh so i'm going to raise a little sharper uh point on it my basic question was we don't want to buy oil from venezuela uh or russia and we don't want we want lower gas prices so uh you've i've heard what you said and i respect that i'm curious about the keystone pipeline and the effect that that may have had and you know on both you know my understanding is that it was something that affected canada as well and if uh if we're not using a pipeline doesn't that mean that we're using uh more uh energy to truck that oil where it needs to go and should should be reconsidered closing the the shutting down of the keystone pipeline well we do have to evaluate the keystone pipeline keep in mind that um this is very heavy hard to refine oil uh that's not economic under some circumstances and that poses more of an environmental problem than lighter oils trump approved the project in 2017 and they didn't build it democrats have been a bit more skeptical because these tar sands oils are tougher for the environment than other lighter oils but we also have to weigh on the environmental concern with the the geopolitical as well and when one looks at the additional oil that could come online it isn't online today it's saudi arabia not always a great upholder of human rights and then it goes downhill from there iran venezuela russia um so we could take a look at this the the fact is that the canadians do get some of that tar sands oil into the united states by by rail and that is not as good for the environment as a pipeline if that pipeline is built safely and built in the right place and there are controversies not only about the keystone pipeline in concept but the exact route that it was scheduled to build so i do think that the biden administration will be looking at this i'll be looking at it it's a very small part of world oil production i will also keep in mind that environmentalists tend to focus on production issues in canada the united states and north america in terms of global warming if you produce if you don't produce oil in north dakota and you instead produce it in saudi arabia you really can't blame the saudis for the uh for the carbon uh if that oil is going to be uh burned here in the united states it's not the place where the oil comes from it's the place where it's used that literally uh and i think orally um is where the the the the carbon pollution is coming from and it's incumbent upon us to burn as little fossil fuels here in the united states as possible which is a different thing than how much we produce producing less but burning more is much worse for the environment so we can take a i we can take a look at that but we really need to look at conservation alternative energy and a carbon neutral footprint getting being achieved sooner and every barrel that we don't need to burn is not just good for the environment but it's good economically since low oil prices they may not be so great in texas and north dakota but i don't represent texas or north dakota certainly better from california and lower oil prices i think in general help the u.s economy they certainly help on the inflation issue and uh so we've got a very strong interest in what has been the number one contribution to energy independence which is conservation and alternative energy but also as i pointed out we're going to produce more oil in the united states in 2023 than we ever had in history i believe we have time for maybe one maybe two uh additional questions let's uh let's see if we can get into if they're easy questions okay congressman uh brian from sherman oaks uh brian you are on now good evening congressman thanks for holding these town halls they're very much appreciated thank you um the payment choice act which is hr 43.95 for anybody who wants to look it up it's a short bill it would require businesses to accept cash for most transactions um this bill has a number of co-sponsors it has democratic and republican co-sponsors uh as i'm sure you're aware there are many people in the community who don't have uh debit or credit cards uh debit card requires a bank account many people are not able to maintain bank accounts for various reasons uh credit card requires credit uh uh requires access to credit um and as a result the businesses that don't accept cash are in effect discriminating against uh individuals who don't have access to those cards um you know businesses everywhere from dodger stadium to you know local restaurants and small businesses have increasingly adopted no cash policies in the wake of the pandemic ostensibly as a public health measure although the doctor could probably back up that that's really not a public health measure the virus is not being transmitted on cash uh anyway so the question is uh would you be willing to uh co-sponsor this legislation uh to uh help to push to get it passed um and if not why not um and i appreciate your attention to this and i'll note that there are two states that have passed uh bills uh in the same vein new jersey and i think massachusetts uh and there is a bill pending in the california state legislature on this topic but i really think of federal law uh given the the uh essentially civil rights issue that's an issue here but and also by the way a privacy issue people have the right to make you know to buy a diet coke without it being tracked by uh their credit card issue or their uh or particular businesses anyway i think a federal law is is appropriate so i appreciate your thoughts on that thanks well i i will take a look at it i think the vast majority of businesses should accept cash for the reasons you bring up uh the only reluctance i have is this idea can i be sure that that's 100 of the businesses are there any unique circumstances where this where that business uh can best not you know it's just not in the position to accept cash um and so i need to hear from from from just every kind of business um there are uh there are transit systems uh that on the one hand you can use cash to buy the card but then they want the card one wonders uh and this is more of a of a subway thing than a bus thing so it's uh more apple other parts of the country that you know how is that system going to work and i don't know how this bill would apply to a business that said yes you can give us cash but then we give you a card and then you're going to use the card to enter our subway system etc so the vast majority of businesses should accept cash and whether it should be one size fits all mandate would require me to to both look at the states that you brought up maybe they prove that uh either there's some way of making exceptions or that no exceptions are necessary so i'd want to see how it's working in those states i want to hear from a whole variety of businesses but uh you're right not everybody has a debit or credit card i think that's going to need to be our last question um but that is not the last part of our communication um because uh when the um pretty soon you'll hear a tone first i want to thank dr lynn goldman for joining us for what must be the the 12th or 15th time um you'll hear a there'll be a voicemail system just as soon as i conclude here please leave your email address even if i already have it because i won't be allowed to send you emails in the future unless i get your email from the email directly from you um if you want to know what our next town hall is it's april 6th 7 pm and you can rsvp in advance bradsherman.house.gov and the voicemail system will allow you not only to leave your email address but leave whatever comment or or question you have i'm not going to listen tonight but i will listen tomorrow and we will we'll be back in touch with you if if you leave a question in your email address so uh look forward to staying in touch look forward to coming back to the valley in a few days and thank you very much for participating in the san fernando valley town hall goodbye

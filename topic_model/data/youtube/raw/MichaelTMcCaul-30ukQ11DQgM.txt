Republicans say while the measure provides a path to citizenship it isn't strong enough on security joining us live from Washington this morning is the Honorable congressman Michael McCaul who is chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee a good morning congressman you wrote a letter this week to the FBI the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of National Intelligence regarding the Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan tsarnaev and his extended trip to Russia you feel there perhaps were some warning signs that we here in the US missed well first of all good morning has a it's good doing and I see you and but yes I did there are a lot of unanswered questions in this case a lot of flags that have come up in terms of you know the FBI had a lead on this individual interviewed him ran a sort of a very short investigation if you will had no idea that he traveled to Russia and this was on the heels of a Russian communique warning the united states that he may travel overseas to join radical extremist groups so why didn't the FBI know about that and then we heard yesterday from Secretary Napolitano the Homeland Security Secretary that they did they did know that he traveled overseas to the Chechen region where these Chechen rebels are that are very much linked to al-qaeda have fought with them in Afghanistan Pakistan in Iraq and so we want to know why that information wasn't shared what could have been done better in the future that's my job is chairman of Homeland Security's make sure that we examine this case identify mistakes and make sure it doesn't happen again and I'm concerned that there were some mistakes made congressman does this appear to be a case of deja vu because after nine eleven the Department of Homeland Security was created to make sure that all of the agencies law enforcement agencies were coordinating information that just didn't seem to be happening exactly a point it was designed to make sure that stove pipes would no longer exist and that the the dots would be connected and I'm afraid in this case if the department homeland security had information about his Russian travel and the FBI did not then yet that siloed information problem again and if these dots aren't connected properly as they should have been at the Joint Terrorism Task Force then maybe they would have opened up a new lead on this individual so that when he returned to the United States he could have been under closer examination one thing is clear when he comes back from Russia he becomes more radicalized and we look at his YouTube website he created in August month after he got back really radical jihadist postings and then within nine months conducts the most destructive terrorist attacks since 911 you should we in this country be putting this as part of the immigration debate I I think it does have a place in the debate in terms of we have a broken system and I think it needs to be fixed and look if we're going to talk about reform we need to talk about ways to prevent people like this from coming in the country you know my role as chairman of Homeland Security is in my lanes of jurisdiction are to come up with the the operational control bill the bill that will finally achieve operational control in a little bit over two years and so that's kind of my my mission up here and I think it does play in with a reform piece we can't make the same mistake we made in 1986 when we grant amnesty and then forgot about the border security piece I think they both sort of go together in some respects but one thing is clear hose is that we really do have a broken immigration system that needs to be fixed congressman Michael McCaul thank you so very much for joining us here on Fox 26 morning news and we will be checking with you periodically with your committee to see what developments are taking place in Washington that affect us all in this country thank you sir thank you

Hi, I’m Congresswoman Marcia Fudge. Open Enrollment season is upon us! Are you ready to get covered? Open Enrollment under the Affordable Care Act runs from November 1st to December 15th in most states, including Ohio. If you have coverage through HealthCare.gov,
you will need to renew your plan during open enrollment. If you purchase your own health insurance
through the marketplace, or will do so for the first time, ACA open enrollment season
is your opportunity to buy or change your health insurance plan for 2018. Insurance plans and prices change. Do not miss your chance to make changes and
find a plan that works best for you and your family. The Affordable Care Act offers plans with no-cost preventative
care – like flu shots and mammograms – and you may be eligible for assistance with paying
your premiums. Resources available for sign up assistance
are limited this year. Each one of us must do our part to make sure
our friends, family, and neighbors are covered in 2018. Be sure to visit HealthCare.gov for more
information, or call 1-800-318-2596. Remember, Open Enrollment season is November
1st to December 15th, 2017. Get covered, Ohio!

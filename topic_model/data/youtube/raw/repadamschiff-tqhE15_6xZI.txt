joining us now is congressman adam schiff a member of the january 6 committee and the lead impeachment manager for the first impeachment trial of donald trump in the united states senate congressman schiff do you have any other evidence about what happened in that car i can't comment on other evidence or testimony before the committee all i can say is that i found cassidy hutchinson to be a thoroughly credible witness telling us what she what she saw what she heard she was very careful to differentiate when she was a participant in the conversation or actions were related to her by others she was careful to tell us what she didn't know and as a foreign prosecutor to me those are all in disha of reliability and credibility as a witness uh so i found her account uh you know very very credible i also thought you know frankly of all of her testimony what was most uh important i found most shocking is the president's acknowledgement that or his understanding that these people in the mob were armed and when he was told they're armed and they're potentially dangerous his response was take down the magnetometers that he wanted this armed group to be able to march with him to the capitol that they weren't there to hurt him and later in the in the white house when he was in a position of safety and was uh told that they were chanting hang mike pence's response was basically pence deserves it to me as a former prosecutor and as a as a just plain citizen that is the most shocking revelation about the president uh the secret service issued a statement tonight saying that they are fully cooperating with the committee and they will provide any evidence and any testimony the committee wants is that a new posture for the secret service or have they been cooperating all along well the secret service is not monolithic so some elements might be cooperating some might be refusing but look we are uh interested in having anyone willing to come in that has relevant information uh to come and share that information under oath about what they saw what they said uh and we would welcome any any testimony by relevant parties what do you think is the single most important piece of evidence that the committee received today in this testimony i really do think it was the president uh basically saying if these people are armed he's okay with that because he felt that mob was not there or hurt him those were his people and his response was take away the magnetometers it was made clear to the president that it's uh it's not that there was a long line at the metal detector it's that people wouldn't go through it because they'd have to give up their weapons and the people that had gone through it did have to give up their weapons uh and he was okay with that and he still wanted that arm mom to march with him to the capitol he was indignant when he couldn't go to the capitol it was furious uh and to me you know when we're looking at what is the what is the intent of the president what is the knowledge of the president about the danger of that crowd uh the fact that he knew it was armed the fact that he knew that it was not a danger to him but was a danger to others and still persisted in wanting it to march to the capitol even when his own white house counsel is saying that this might violate any number of laws to me that is the most among the most damning things that we've heard what the hell what does your investigation show about what donald trump was going to actually do when he arrived at the capitol well i think it's a bit unclear it's you know from cassidy hutchinson's testimony i think there were a number of possibilities what he might do when he got to the capitol and uh and part of the challenge i think was his uh staff the white house council among others was vigorously resisting that effort uh so i don't know how much uh uh he had gotten to a final plan about what would happen uh you could tell from uh cassidy hutchinson's testimony that the republican leader in the house ken mccarthy was concerned about him marching to the capitol and needed to be assured that it wasn't going to take place so even the leader of his party in the house was desperately concerned about what he might do what are you hoping that the justice department took note of in today's hearing well particularly the president's knowledge uh at his intention the fact that he knew this crowd was armed that he was still willing to march with it that the the tool that might have been used to disarm the crowd the magnetometers he wanted them taken down that to me is very very telling as well as his reaction when he's informed that the crowd is is you know signaling their intention to hang his own vice president you know the other evidence that the justice department has heard uh relating to other people other participants those on the ground this is the first testimony that goes right to the president his state of mind what he knew and when he knew it and uh and his intention to go forward nonetheless so to me that would be very significant hard for the justice department to look away from that hard for the justice department to i think justify um not investigating the president united states and up until this point we see no sign that they're investigating the former president uh at the end of the hearing uh we heard uh uh cassidy hutchinson tell us that her boss mark meadows requested a pardon and that rudy giuliani requested a pardon what does that tell you about rudy giuliani and mark meadows well you know considering that the white house council patsa bologna who by the way i wish would show the same courage that cassidy hutchinson just showed but considering that he was warning that if they went forward with this march the capital that uh you know they might be brought up on any kind of charges um you know it certainly puts in context mark meadows who knew the president's plan and evidently didn't try to stop him um was worried about his own culpability and liability and of course rudy giuliani uh at ample reason to be worried about his criminal exposure uh so um uh you know the same mixture of oceans i guess the last five years on the one hand totally shocked uh on the other hand not at all surprised that the president's own chief of staff would be interested in the pardon and his own principal lawyer would be interested in the same is it possible the justice department has not tried to enforce your committee's subpoena on mark meadows because mark meadows is the subject of a criminal investigation by the justice department it is possible i would would like to believe that is the case i am skeptical though that that's the reason um and uh you know that may change however that may not have been the reason reason initially for them to uh decline if that's what they've done to prosecute but that doesn't mean that they haven't now found sufficient evidence to warrant the investigation of mr meadows why was this hearing suddenly scheduled and how much does it have to do with cassidy hutchinson changing lawyers from a lawyer closely allowed aligned with donald trump to a lawyer not aligned with donald trump well you know you know certainly her changing of counsel may have been a significant development but the i don't think that was uh an issue in terms of the timing of our hearing i i think the timing was more a function of the urgency of getting this information out to the public the urgency of responding to potential intimidation of witnesses in our investigation and the need to make a strong statement that we will push back and and take strong action against any threat or effort to intimidate our witnesses and a desire by the committee to be able to make public use of the evidence she provided to pursue other leads to encourage other people to come forward that had much to do more to do with the timing than anything to do with council to the point of intimidating witnesses was the point of doing this publicly today to let the people know who you believe are intimidating witnesses that you know who they are and what they're doing uh you know it was certainly i think one uh part of the purpose of our presentation today and that is to put people on notice that if they try to intimidate witnesses uh that they face potential criminal liability for doing so and they need to know that we're aware of their actions uh and that others that might be inclined to try to influence witness testimony need to know how seriously the committee will take those actions congressman adam schiff thank you very much for leading off our discussions tonight on this hour i really appreciate it thank you

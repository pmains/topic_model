i want to thank secretary diaz for being here today with us and and getting us started uh this is a proper place for us to be this is woody's uh woody williams's gold star monument as you know and he's worked very hard for veterans for the last half a century i believe and with the service he's given to our country and right now i would hope that woody is in all your prayers and you're all thinking about woody at this point in time we had a chance to visit him yesterday had a real nice visit and uh he's as uh he's as optimistic and chipper as ever as you know uh but his prayers will be uh greatly appreciated i'm sure um the the the quality of care that veterans receive from our from our hospitals and our sea boxes everything we do specifically for veterans is uh there's nothing to compare it to and there's nothing to replace it with so in 2018 there was the there was a piece of the mission act they call it we were trying to improve the quality of care throughout with that mission act they put the air act inside of that which basically was a review process and i knew exactly when they put that in it would be the same as the brac was done when they tried to close some of our national guards if you all recall that i immediately objected to it it went in anyway i introduced the bill in 2019 myself and mike rounds from south dakota republican dear friend of mine we were governors together we both did it we fought it in this year we identified everything once they came out with what their intentions were i think a lot of you have seen the report that came out and what they wanted to close how they want to change some of the services and we said this will be this destructive truly destructive for rural america and rural west virginia to have the quality of care that we can give in our and our veterans services and our veteran hospitals so i'm here basically to say that we fought it was something worth fighting and the veterans is something that brings us all together it's the only thing that we have that crosses both party lines to find what's best for america because of the people willing to put the uniform on to service and that's what's so special about it and i've always said my state of west virginia i get to you all give me bragging rights one of the most patriotic states in the nation we have more veterans per capita than most any other state fought in more wars and shed more blood for the cause of freedom than most any other state so we've given our all on top of that we mine we've mined the coal that made the steel that built the guns and ships now i know it sounds just like a saying if we've mined the coal that built the guns and ships but let me tell you in world war ii the navy requested they requested one particular seam of coal and it was the coal that came out of mcdowell county for the basically had the hottest coking button that made the best deal for them they requested that specifically when they were building their ships and guns so i know what we've done for our country this here is what i'm happy to announce today that i've been able to secure a bipartisan agreement and how that works is in our committee so as i told you we had the mission act and an admission act had the air act the air act had to have nine nine appointees which would be appointed by the president and then confirmed by the senate so i was able to get jon tester and myself and mike rounds we were able to get our whole committee which is a bipartisan committee of the va committee which i serve on and then we got jerry moran from kansas who's the ranking republican and john tester is the chairman of the committee we got them to agree that we're going to kill the air act by not appointing any commissioners whatsoever so it is died it has died by its own weight they can't have anyone recommending anyone enforcing any of the rules until we have it completely taken off the books so right now is a good day for us not to have to worry does our clarksburg get changed and transformed as beckley does our huntington woody williams facility are we going to be changing in martinsburg and closing sea boxes none of that's going to happen we can concentrate a thousand percent on improving the quality of care of each one of our facilities and that's really what it's all about i think it's a great day i really do and i'm just so tickled with it i really am so i think all of you should be too but this was a group effort we were able to get it done doing it in a bipartisan way and i'm very very satisfied with that so what we'll do if any of the press would have any questions you want to ask or anything that i can answer that hasn't been spoken about senator is there any way around this that they could make the cuts anyway or without the commissioner it just doesn't happen it doesn't happen they can't do it mark because basically they have to have nine commissioners and we've agreed that that's the first to get rid of it the first thing is is to have all sides agreeing democrats and republicans when you have the two leading members of the committee john tester and jerry moran and all of us have signed on to it it's dead it is dead now what we'll do is basically repeal that in the ndaa we'll remove the air the air act in that and that'll be the way to get rid of it for forever but it's dead the same as brock was dead before act unfairly targeted our rural communities especially here in west virginia yeah give me the other book i had before it had everything let me just tell you here were some of the things you can ask me about take this one man thank you let me just tell you what what it did it was so unbelievably i just had it because i was reading through it myself [Applause] [Music] okay clarksburg what they're going to do in the clarksburg i'll go through them you ask the question anytime you want it was going to establish a strategic collaboration to provide inpatient medical and surgical services and discontinue those services of the clarksburg va hospital converting the emergency department at the clarksburg va to an urgent care center and discontinue those services at the clarksburg va it was going to modernize community living centers at clarksburg establish a new community based outpatient clinic in buckhannon relocate the west over cboc to better location somewhere else they're talking about monogamy county relay relocate services and close parsons operation outpatient sites those are very rural areas now what they were going to do in beckley they were talking about constructing a new beckley va with community living centers adult daycare non-surgical outpatient services establishing strategic collaboration to provide inpatient medical surgical services and outpatient surgical services but they were going to discontinue those services at the beckley va they were relocating emergency department services to community providers but they were discontinuing those services at the beckley va and they were uh talking about another opera uh an outpatient operating site in huntington they were going to establish a strategic collaboration to provide inpatient medical surgical services but didn't discontinue all this is going to be discontinued in the hospitals we currently have that was the problem and then they were going to convert the emergency department and they were going to discontinue those services at the va so basically we'd have a shell of a building that's it there'd be no services in it so that in martinsburg they were going to relocate relocate all services to franklin oos and they were going to close franklin anyone ever been to franklin it's a very very remote area these were things that just all through the country were happening and they were in some of the most remote rural areas so this is what has been stopped they will not have any members at all we've all agreed there will be not be any confirmation votes whatever so what we have to do now is get the vehicle the national defense authorization act and put the absolute closure of the air act in that but it's dead it is dead anybody else why of course was this important to you to get this kill i wanted woody there was nobody that worked harder on this when it came about and woody said joe i think they're going to take they're going to take us out and i said woody they're not going to take us out well we identified it in 2018 in the mission act i put a piece of legislation it still went in the mission act they were saying well we're going to improve this and that once and they didn't tell us in detail what they were going to do until this year in 2019 i introduced the bill again once this came out in 2020 we reintroduced the bill again myself and my crowns and we had all democrats republicans signing on to it because they affected every one of their states that's what but woody brought the truth i want to make sure that woody knew this is something we were doing his behalf senator we always hear people on both sides want efficiency in government i get that let me just ask the question from a personal perspective because i'm sure you heard questions like i'm about to ask you all around this street my dad served in world war ii in korea my daughter has presently served at texas city of the us army people look at washington sometimes and say what on earth were they thinking i mean is that the kind of reaction i mean that was my gut level reaction talking to ted diaz about it as well because when on earth were they were thinking yeah tell veterans they're not going to get the quality medical care they were promising the thing and first of all if you ever talk to a veteran they'd rather go to a veteran hospital or a veteran clinic because it's veterans serving veterans they understand what your needs are and how to best take care of you that's the thing we can't replace in the public service in the public hospitals we don't have that dedication or that knowledge or experience level about what va and va care that's why we fought so hard not to get rid of it not to change it i can tell you one thing we have we're having more geopolitical unrest around the world that's going to demand more of our west virginians being alert and ready and being put in parts of the world in harm's way i want to make sure that we can serve them they know that we're going to serve them when they come back and they god forbid they need a lot of help transitioning this is something you know the dollars that we have invested and we already have the system in place we just need to upgrade the system if they're going to let it die by a thousand cuts by not fixing and not not you know and enhancing the the services are expanding them then they said well we can give it better somewhere else we also have you know we have the availability for veterans if they can't get the type of expert services at a va then we can go to the best services available to them that's not prohibitive either we think we can do it within the va system that's what we're trying to do i know you got a lot of calls when this initially came out a lot of people were scared to be well they were once they told us once we got the report this year it showed exactly what they intended to do up until this year in 2018 until oh no no just like marcus it's going to be for more efficient we'll make it better how can you make something better if you take it away how can you improve it if it's gone nothing made sense and once they put it in writing that's when we got total bipartisan buy-in it was easy to get the help then because it affected everybody anybody else okay thank you all i appreciate you being here and and god bless woody williams and all the veterans who've served and are still serving today and they may the good lord look over and that's the best thing that we can do right now support our veterans that they don't have they can't ask and question whether where they're being sent for what reason we have a hundred thousand over a hundred thousand troops now in europe we have in the baltics on uh by ukraine uh in poland uh all along the baltics there and who knows what's going to happen there it's not a good situation it's not going to end any time soon it's not going to be pretty but we're going to fight main thing i want to make sure you know i am totally committed to ukraine any way shape or form that i can and i want our country to be too they're fighting for their life they're fighting for their country we've got to make sure that we stand with them we have all free europe standing with them we have to have a what we call it the marshall plan to go back and rebuild they need to know that we're the country the world the free world's going to be behind them to rebuild their country because they're willing to to fight to the end and god bless them because they sure are putting up one heck of a fight we'll give them all the support they need thank you all you

hi this cottage look tomorrow in addition of lame bus thanks for joining us this week this week one just kind of updates you a little bit with regards to the health care law is how it's coming along as you recall year two three ago we passed the Affordable Health Care Act and since then we've had a lot of discussion about it both sides on this issue have been pretty adamant about continuing to work on the bill we now have a Supreme Court decision says it's an 800 billion dollar tax in the bill and as a result there's a lot of concern as many of you know what 14 much of this kicks in and we've got a year prepare for it so there's some interesting statistics the president promised that this health care law would cut your prunes about twenty five hundred dollars and so far they're going to about 3,000 or family the National Business Group on health released the survey recently that health care costs actually go up six point two percent shooting health care costs of golf 6.2 person and premiums going up nine point three percent and you like four percent companies expect to limit the hours of their part-time forward workforce so other things that indicate that health care is a is a major has a major impact on our economy that this bill has not solved the problem what is done is put a level of uncertainty into the business community they know how to deal with this especially people who are a lot of part-time workers you know we on our side of the building would like to do is repeal any place this and when we say repeal I'm going to take it all down and then we replace it with something that we feel is going to be more effective in a piecemeal fashion to go back and tweak the bill there are some parts of this bill that are worthwhile and keeping and we will replace those and put those back in place as well but as a rule a lot of this is going to be very negatively will have a very negative impact on our our businesses and our consumers and you feel it's best to take it off start all over you can put back into pieces of it they're worth while but generally speaking most of it needs to go again any questions on this or any other issues with regards what's going on Washington don't hesitate to give us a call when forward to seeing you next week take care

I lost my mom when I was 10 it made me stronger I used that strength to become a Navy SEAL Bryan countered my second test I was hit by an AED blast in Afghanistan I was nearly killed and I was blinded I kept my faith and I persevered doctors told me I'd never see again I had faith that I would and I did and I deployed again twice more I went on to Harvard I did my degree my master's degree in public policy because I listened to God's path for me and that is one of public service it is one of good governance and conservative values and I know now that my path is not just defending the Constitution from foreign enemies is defending us from lower taxation and over-regulation and federal overreach is defending our Christian values from the left's attack on our traditions in our history and our culture is protecting our borders and enforcing our laws I hope to have your support thank you [Applause]

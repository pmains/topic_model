congressman you say mayorkas should be impeached over this move i do thanks for having me first of all look the title that majorcas holds is the secretary of homeland security which indicates it implies that his job is to protect the homeland and yet every action that he takes is the exact opposite so one of the main issues that the department of homeland security has to deal with is of course border security they're in charge of our border patrol they're in charge of our customs and every action that majorcas takes is meant to increase illegal immigration okay at the very least you could call this a flagrant and probably deliberate dereliction of constitutional duty to enforce our laws this this recent example of canceling border wall contracts is is a good example of that so first of all it wastes a lot of money because you've already spent a lot of money on these contracts second of all uh it makes it yet again more difficult for border patrol to enforce our laws because what what border walls do is they create choke points they they allow border patrol to use their resources in other locations but see that's not all majors has also deliberately refused to reinstate the remaining mexico policy which is one of our best tools to disincentivizing these sort of false claims of asylum that we're seeing come across the border not only that but they are not they are not enforcing title 42 which is those covid protocols so saying that look we during a pandemic we do not have to be taking people across our border we can immediately deport them but they're refusing to even do that they're allowing hundreds of thousands of people in they won't give us the exact numbers for that these people are not showing up for their court dates they're not showing up for their asylum claims because they're not real asylum claims and we all know that so it's an unmitigated disaster and by the way they cancel those border wall contracts in places like rio grande valley which has seen half a million crossings just this year well and and yeah i want to get to this issue congressman vice president harris skipped a border security meeting in mexico city instead she pushed biden's agenda during a new jersey trip she's supposed to be the borders are so why wasn't she at the meetings because she doesn't care about border security she doesn't care about illegal immigration they want this to happen i mean i i hope nobody else is pretending otherwise we shouldn't pretend like this is incompetence and they'll throw out some really weird reasons as to why why uh these illegal immigration surges have increased so much they'll say well at first it was trump's fault and then well there was a hurricane and well then you know people are sad or civil war or somebody or a president got killed they make up reason after reason after reason oh it's seasonal surge i mean they're full of it the truth is is they want more of this they listen to these these um immigration activist groups that that help people kind of disappear into society they work with governors from places like california and new york so that there is no federal law enforcement there whatsoever they won't cooperate with the federal officials they do this on purpose right and then on the back end they they implement or they want to implement legislation that would give everybody amnesty so what they actually believe is that there's a voter block coming here remember they actually they actually took a strong stand against cubans coming across remember that why because cubans tend to vote republicans this is very political for them i just want to just get this issue in before we run out of time you say parents should keep protesting critical race theory in the classroom that the justice department can't do anything about it they're just trying to intimidate parents explain yeah that's exactly right keep doing what you're doing look the doj sent out this awful letter saying they're going to work with local law enforcement and look into this into these claims of domestic terrorism now this came from this absurd letter from um the the the national school board association that claims that this was akin to domestic terrorism and here are some examples they're writing letters calling us marxists i mean these are literally some of the examples okay they're being mean to us they're yelling at us they're disrupting the meetings these are public meetings and this is a democracy so yes you can do that no that's not domestic terrorism this is absurd and the democrats in congress uh in the media uh they claim that there's no crt right they claim that these parents are just being misled by some right-wing facebook posts but that is so not true these parents are seeing the curriculum their kids are learning they see that it's infused with the teachings of crt under the guise of these nice nice sounding things like diversity and inclusion but it's teaching racism it's teaching kids to hate each other and it's wrong and parents keep it up

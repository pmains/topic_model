well that's that's pretty simple I think we just have an election in 2016 and the way it worked for us we had a clear contrast with Walt and we also had a presidential candidate that a clear contrast with Hillary Clinton Donald Trump and Iran unaffectedly the same platforms we need to make Keep America safe that means reinstating peace through strength that means securing our borders with merit-based immigration and means protecting our country from Islamic supremacists I was the first person in the nation to call for a refugee program timeout and then President Trump Donald Trump picked up on that secondarily we need to reform our government the Democrats want to transform America we want to transform the federal government to help keep our make our country prosperous and that means tax reform regulatory reform merit-based immigration get rid of that Obamacare and having free market health care it also means an energy policy where we have US energy independence and we put downward pressure on the cost of energy that's very important then we get into what should Congress do we should protect our god-given rights the right to life the right to keep the bear arms and the right to religious freedom is under attack up there by the left each and every day and lastly I'll say it again sustained agriculture and our rural way of life those are the priorities that I would take to the job out in Washington I would work in partnering with the President and like-minded conservatives as best as possible to get that done on your behalf

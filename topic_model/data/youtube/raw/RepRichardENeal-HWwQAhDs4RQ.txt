today we welcome ambassador Robert eat light Heiser the United States Trade Representative to discuss us-china trade one of the challenges for the ambassador members of the committee and the administration indeed is the following and as trade issues play out there is generally some truth to what everybody says about trade at the direction of the Trump administration there are currently US tariffs of 250 billion dollars on Chinese imports in retaliation China has imposed tariffs on a hundred and ten billion dollars of US exports this hearing is our opportunity to make clear what Congress stands for on us-china trade and what the American people need to see in any trade agreement as the administration concludes its work and memorandums of understanding with China at the outset I want to acknowledge that ambassador light Heiser is leading negotiations with China and that he may want to exercise discretion about the level of detail he gets into as we reach the delicate stage of finishing hopefully the agreement at the same time I encouraged the Ambassador to be as forthcoming and vigorous as we know he is capable of doing as possible I have often observed that there is truth again as I noted earlier everybody says about China China has been good for some but it also has been bad for many others in 2000 when Congress voted on normalizing trade relations with China the promise was that China would reform and become market-based Democratic and would respect human rights but the China that we trade with and compete with today is very different from the one that we had hoped would emerge China's economy which has taken on some market characteristics remains fundamentally state-directed China's companies state-owned or not are called upon to serve the government's interests China's trade and economic policies are coordinated through five-year and ten-year plans those plans are backed by China's resources they are aimed at fostering national champions advancing China's economic making technological ambitions and ensuring full employment in China and they are implemented at the expense of other economies through the theft of other's intellectual property and without regard to the global trade rules or human rights of workers these are structural economic challenges that American workers and companies face in trading and competing with China while this administration confronts the same challenges with China the previous administrations have faced it has chosen to use tactics and tools the previous administration's of both parties did not the administration's tariffs have been sweeping disruptive controversial and indeed for some sectors painful the administration's promises that high risk approaches will yield high rewards my concern is that we are about to see the administration used the same from time to time ineffective playbook that has been applied in the past recall that in April 2017 president Trump met with President Xi at mar-a-lago as part of a 100-day plan for a big China deal the Commerce Secretary declared that outcomes from the exercise represented more than has been done in the whole history of us-china relations of course when we examined the results of these negotiations we found that some of the commitments were quite as advertised other commitments that were made promising changes in China were already in the process of being made but in May of last year China's trade negotiations seemed like it was about to lead to a package of large purchase commitments for commodities like soybeans natural gas along with aircraft those negotiations clearly were not leading to the solution that we had hoped for in terms of significant trade challenges they indeed were put on hold this time around in December 1st the president announced a 90 day period to fix our complex trade problems with China as we near the finish line we are hearing once again about very large purchase commitments for commodities like soybeans natural gas and along with aircraft there is a primary difference however with these negotiations that is that ambassador Light Iser is at the helm he has time and again I think developed a vision that many of us on this committee will support vigorously and we believe that the structural problems that faces America it bases its trade relationship with China are well absorbed by the ambassador this administration is chosen to take a path of high-risk confrontation it must hold out for the good deal a structural deal the future of America's economic prosperity is in the balance

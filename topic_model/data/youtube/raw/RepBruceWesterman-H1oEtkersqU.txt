let's welcome ranking member of House natural resources Congressman Bruce Westerman along with former White House counsel of economic advisors acting chairman Thomas Phillipson good to have you both with us Congressman I'm going to go ahead and start with you um and and the president is feeling certainly emboldened it seems uh after some of the midterm races the results have come in even though we're waiting to still find out exactly how this all shakes out uh the Democrats didn't lose as badly as they were expected to um and so he's doubling down on climate change and and spending and and now acknowledging that the inflation reduction act really isn't going to necessarily do much for inflation but push his climate change uh agenda his green energy policies and there's a lot of people out there right now who are suffering as a result of of what we're seeing 7.7 percent inflation is better than where we were but we're still not where we need to be yeah well good afternoon good evening and uh first off I want to express my appreciation to all the veterans out there on Veterans Day and uh heartfelt thank you for their sacrifice and service and you know what President Biden is saying is he's telling the truth the inflation reduction Act was not about reducing inflation it was about spending more money on giveaways for his green New Deal plan and you know I can't figure out why he's excited about losing the house but I'm confident we're going to win the house and he's going to face a new reality when he comes back to uh to Washington and when the new Congress starts in January yeah I think that's a good point and and the expectation is that there will be change in Washington and that it seems like he's almost a little bit in denial at the moment but perhaps uh we'll have to change his tune having said that Thomas I want to come to you and read a tweet from the president this is from the President Biden at POTUS account it says it's going to take time to get inflation back to normal levels and I highlight there it's going to take time and we could see setbacks along the way but with gas prices decreasing grocery store costs easing and millions saving on health insurance we're keeping at it to get families help with the cost of living the problem here is that nobody I speak to says that they see prices going down at the grocery store and that's the number one concern of Voters who are leaving the polls on Tuesday and having said that gas prices are down but they're you know from historic Highs but they're poised to rise again and so people are very worried about what's you know life going to feel like for them in the next few months when he says it's going to take time that's a concern to a lot of people yeah I think the uh president I mean I'm glad he's working on it because he cost us so that would be very useful if he'd attacked it going uh in the in the right direction I think this is going to be it turns out this looks like it's going to be a deflationary midterm in the sense that if Republicans get the house and potentially also the Senate then we've seen the end of this fiscal nightmare which has caused this problem to start with on top of the FED monetizing all that spending there's a caveat to that which is because the White House is losing the fiscal purse it's going to basically go very heavy on regulations and their regulations has been very uh sort of clamping down on Supply particularly in energy obviously but also in other sectors so once you clamp down on Supply that's going to be awkward pressure on prices but the but the upward pressure on prices from increased fiscal spending and raising demand I think we we're going to have to we have seen an end tooth thankfully and we've got a sound by from the president addressing inflation again there's a different point that I want to make here so let's listen to this one it's going to take time to implement our entire economic agenda which we already passed and for folks to field it in their day-to-day lives but I think folks are going to see it in the next few months um Congressman he's been saying this for months and months now and you know we've heard from the Federal Reserve at first that inflation was transitory and it was going to go away well it never did now it's embedded in the economy and interest rates are going up and so it's really difficult to listen to the White House in the administration with their messaging on this when you're going to the grocery store and you're seeing food prices and food inflation right at your your kitchen table eggs are up 43 percent Butters up 33 percent those are some of the big ones flour 25 milk 14 and a half percent so we're talking about very very basic kitchen table items we're not seeing a decline in prices right now and he keeps saying it's coming it's coming I promise but where is it yeah and Jackie he again spoke truth when he said we're feeling the effects of his Economic Policy those are the effects you just read about increasing food process increasing gas prices you know the FED has raised interest rates and we got a slight drop in uh in inflation but look what it's done to the housing market and construction market look at the layoffs and the tech companies uh we're definitely feeling the effects of Biden's economy and they're not good and I don't see anything on the horizon that's going to make that any better what he's done to energy in this country affects all different Industries it's one reason food prices are so high and here he is again looking other places in the world for energy talking about all the money we're going to spend on on the green economy and he's not paying attention to the problems here at home that he created yeah and he's looking to Saudi Arabia to try to solve the oil woes drawing down continuing to dry down from the spr and and doubling down on this um over regulated energy industry policy that's not helping United States producers ramp up production that is what would bring inflation down because until we get those costs under control they touch everything having said that I just have one more minute left with both of you Thomas I want to come to you because obviously there is a meeting planned with President XI of China many speculating on on what topics will be covered in that meeting what are your expectations well it sounds like it's not so much economic the issues that are coming up as Taiwan human rights Etc so I think but I think there's some economic issue which is that we still have not sort of disciplined China to follow through on technology transfer Force technology transfer intellectual property issues and that's on the table but it doesn't seem like it's there's a lot of Economics on the main table Yeah and we'll be watching very closely and of course bringing everybody the latest great to see you both Congressman Bruce Westerman and Tom spillitson have a great weekend gentlemen

a gentlelady from north carolina for one and a half minutes thank you very much madam speaker the american rescue plan will deliver needed aid to individuals families workers businesses and health care systems i'm proud that this congress has taken such swift action to get this important work done i want to highlight one part of the bill that would be life-changing for hundreds of thousands of people in my state sadly north carolina is one of only 12 states that has not expanded medicaid under the aca this failure has left over six hundred thousand low-income north carolinians without health care the american rescue plan provides an added incentive for states like mine to expand medicaid the bill offers a five-point increase in the federal funding match for medicaid for two years for states who choose to expand this program during this pandemic this would bring north carolina more than two billion dollars in federal health care coverage for our most vulnerable people and help our hardest hit hospitals our state desperately needs the relief provided in this bill thank you madam chair and i yield back

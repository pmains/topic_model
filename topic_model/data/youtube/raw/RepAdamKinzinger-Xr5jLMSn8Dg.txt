you so much here to discuss republican congressman adam kinzinger of illinois and democratic congresswoman stephanie murphy of florida they're both on the house select committee investigating the insurrection and both are retiring after this term congressman kinzinger let's start with you what can you tell us about the cooperation so far with members of vice president pence's team well it's been robust i mean we've we've obviously witnessed over or interviewed over 300 witnesses the vice president's team uh has has been cooperative i think it's it's not just in their interest it's in the country's interest i think uh the vast majority of them are honorable and they also recognize as was mentioned in the report that the vice president played an important role but and that's the key is you know we may not have to talk to the president the former president but we're getting pieces of this puzzle all these pieces right now are in this box and when we put this puzzle together we're going to be able to see what i think even more importantly is what was the president doing what did he know prior to january 6 and what led to this and congresswoman murphy the vice president was not at the white house that day he was on capitol hill with you and your colleagues if you could ask him a question what are some of the things you'd want to know well i'd like to know from him what he had said to the president when the president was pressuring him both publicly and did he pressure him privately to act in a way different than what he did i actually am very impressed that he carried out his duties as vice president and certified the election despite the enormous pressure and despite having his life be put on the line he came back and did the right and patriotic thing for this country and i want to understand the motivations behind that and what led up to that moment yeah interesting and congressman kenzinger house speaker nancy pelosi led a moment of silence this morning there were lives lost including that of police officers that day and in the subsequent days the only republicans on the house floor were congresswoman liz cheney and her father former vice president dick cheney i'm sure you would have been there as well we should tell our viewers you're back home in the chicago area because your wife is about to have a baby but were you surprised that that liz cheney was the only house republican there five people died that dramatic day four police officers died by suicide in the days after was i surprised no was i disappointed yeah and and it's it kind of breaks your heart because you know look regardless of the politics of the moment that really democracy is a threat and i don't even think a year ago i would have been so definitive in that but what we've seen over the last year a lack of accountability continued misinformation a sizable majority of americans believing utter lies democracy is a threat and so if you're a member of congress and some probably had prior commitments i understand that but if you think you're going to avoid it because you don't want to answer the questions this is jake where i would encourage every member of the media local media national media anytime you talk to a republican member of congress ask them was the election legitimate and who do you think was responsible for january 6 and don't let them weasel out we need to be on the record for this this is that dire to the future of self-governance and we should note congressman murphy people like you and congressman kinsinger you come here to do good for the american people left right center wherever you are but we listen to senator sheldon whitehouse democrat of rhode island talking about how much tougher it is to do the people's work since the insurrection a year ago oh it's a full screen i'm sorry i find the tolerance of some of my colleagues for rewriting what we live through to be really hard to take it's not just the flagrant trumpsters who lie without shame about what took place it's also the more decent and regular republicans that hunker down and won't call them out on it and leave the lies unchallenged it makes it a harsher colder place unquote that's uh that's his paper statement from sheldon whitehouse what do you think do you agree i think that when we come here we should argue passionately for our ideological policy differences but at the end of the day we should be principled behind our commitment to the constitution and certainly to see some of our colleagues try to whitewash what happened on january 6 to put forward different narratives different facts disinformation has been disheartening because how can you take them seriously as a legislator anymore when they are um you know sowing so much disinformation and undercutting the constitution it is distressing and let's talk about what's next because congressman kinsinger you're not running for uh re-election and you've ruled out a run at least for now for statewide office in illinois you say you're going to dedicate yourself to working against the extremism is that not a battle that would be better fought from inside congress inside the republican party you know i think in a different circumstance maybe um i'm gonna con you know i'm not going anywhere and i'm gonna do my best to continue to get that message out have a broader fight you know when you're fighting in a primary for reelection and also fighting against disinformation in your own party obviously that's difficult and the other thing jake first off the democrats drew me in with another republican member of congress in illinois let's be clear like they did 10 years ago but secondarily i've served 12 years in congress at the end of this term and i think every member of congress ought to look inside after 12 years particularly and say should i stay or is there somebody better that can come all right congressman kinzinger thank you so much

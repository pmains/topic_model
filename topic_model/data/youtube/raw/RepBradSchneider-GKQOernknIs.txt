Mr. Speaker, addressing climate change is
one of the most important long-term challenges for our future. But this week's executive order from President
Trump reverses recent progress and will worsen this slow-burning crisis. The order undercuts the Clean Power Plan,
weakens restrictions on emissions, and expands federal coal mining leases. It undermines the success of the Paris Agreement
and damages our relations with signatories, including China and India. At the same time, the order makes it harder
for our government and military to plan for the already occurring consequences of climate
change, including assessing its impact on national security policy. That's why today I am introducing the CLIMATE
Act to prevent the irresponsible executive order from being implemented. Whether the Trump Administration recognizes
it or not, the international community understands climate change is real and is rapidly embracing
a renewable energy future. The Administration's decision to move our
energy policy backwards only weakens the United States' global leadership role making it more
likely that the green energy jobs of tomorrow will be created elsewhere. We must come together, support policies that
grow clean energy jobs in the United States, and ensure we pass on a healthier planet to
the next generation. And with that I yield back.

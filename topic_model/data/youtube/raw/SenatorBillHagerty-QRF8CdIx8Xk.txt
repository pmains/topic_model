[Music] a new bill titled the 21st century free speech act seeks to stop censorship by companies like facebook and twitter by repealing section 230 of the communications decency act in the wall street journal op-ed our next guest the author of the legislation states quote instead of being accountable to people this public square is owned by big tech corporations that use opaque inconsistent practices to control the information presented to and discussed by american people all right strong stuff tennessee senator bill hagerty also former u.s ambassador to japan uh senator well done uh walk us through some of the high points for this act it's high time you had some concrete legislation well thank you larry it's great as always to be back on with you and i think you know that some of these large tech companies really function as modern day common carriers today what my act does is actually acknowledge that if you think about it's the same as telephones and telegraphs once were so many people get most of their information today from these large platforms that are essentially unregulated they're allowed to censor they're allowed to determine what we learn what we believe i don't think americans want that at all so what my act does is it repeals section 230 the protection that they've been able to live behind it really requires all of these large tech companies defined as large common platforms that have over 100 million monthly subscribers these platforms are going to have to be open to all comers in a very similar manner that we've regulated other organizations of that type in the past senator do you want you want to get rid of 230 which is the liability shield or reform 230 there's always a little gray area you know and people who are on your side including myself and never quite sure the best way to go how do you propose it in your bill well this will eliminate section 230. and what i'm going to do is prevent it will prevent censorship in the form that we've seen take place most recently you know it's been egregious where major american political figures like president trump could be censored yet someone like the ayatollah can stay up and remain online while calling for death to israel you know you had accurately reported stories in the new york post about hunter biden taken down this sort of censorship is not what america wants and we don't need these large corporations to tell us what to think what to believe i mean i think and your op-ed piece in the journal i mean this is something amazon removed from its streaming service an acclaimed documentary on justice thomas all right justice clarence his supreme court justice on black history and they took that off now supreme court justice is not typically regarded as incendiary or revolutionary and they just did that and i also was doing um governor um of florida uh said that he had a hearing okay he had a hearing with a couple of scholars from harvard i think in oxford university or something like that where they discussed you know different points of view about the pandemic and about wearing masks and about the shutdowns and um they struck that from youtube it was on youtube and they just took that out um that's crazy i mean that really is obvious overboard stuff indeed and with no no explanation of what the rules are that are being applied uh that's not the way the american public needs to be treated again it's up to americans to determine what they want to learn uh the ideas that they want to share and we don't need these large corporations again hiding behind the veil of 230 to use these opaque standards to dictate what they believe americans ought to see in here um as your diplomatic experience by the way governor desantis i didn't mean to shortchange him sometimes you can't remember everything when you're on air um senator haggerty just a quickie on this flap over john kerry leaking intel to iran which is a big deal it is a big deal we've been discussing it on this show quite a bit we will continue to follow the story you are of course a seasoned diplomat yourself how do you read this story i think it's a terrible story it's a terrible story for american security it shows the recklessness of some of the appointees that president biden has brought in we've seen the same thing happen today with colin kahl the number three person at the pentagon i raised this point very clearly call tweeted out classified information and larry you and i both had to live by the rules of managing classified information it's got to be covered it's got to be locked down very specific rules it should never be allowed out in the open this colin call it sounds like john kerry now too is giving classified information to our enemies talking about our allies and sharing that information with our enemies this is something that is absolutely beyond the pale i agree that uh john kerry should resign over this there's no way we should allow someone like this to have a secured position in the white house and real quick final point senator haggerty we're going to put up on the full screen uh poll we're going to hear a lot of big government talk from president biden preference for government 56 percent prefer smaller government and less taxes only 36 want higher taxes and larger government so he's playing to the 36 percent i think that the american public is going to be very disappointed with what they hear tonight because i think you're exactly right biden is playing to a left-wing fringe and what we're going to hear is a socialist wish list of things that he'd like to see accomplished with these misnamed bills that accomplish exactly the opposite all right got up a heartbreak senator bill haggerty thank you ever so much good luck on the free speech amendment

hi I'm ami bera and I'm Chris Goetze chris is a Republican from New York and I'm a Democrat from California but we're both proud to be here tonight representing no labels tonight President Obama called for a year of action we agree this should be a year of action but in our democracy no one branch of government can act alone nor should they the president needs to work together with both parties in Congress and we're ready to work with them our Constitution was designed to put the people in charge separating powers among the respective branches of government requiring them to forge consensus after listening to our constituents we need to stay faithful to that process and work together to create a national agenda if we want our country to work again we don't just need a year of action we need a government of collaboration this is why no labels is starting a three-year campaign to create a national strategic agenda for America an agenda based around common goals tonight there were over 70 members of Congress wearing these orange pins in support of this campaign because they know it's time to change the way we do business in this town it's time to stop fighting and start working to fix problems of course political leaders have been calling for this sort of culture change in Washington for a long time everyone says we need you nighters not dividers but they never say how we're going to do it the no labels campaign for a governing vision is a formula for how to get our leaders in Washington to start solving problems together again by finding consensus where we need to go at the beginning of the governing process each side can give a little take a little and find a way to get there together this isn't a new idea presidents like Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton understood that this approach can work even in Washington that's bitterly divided President Clinton speaker Gingrich didn't agree on much but when they agreed on the shared goal of a balanced budget both parties were able to come together and achieve that common objective when Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill agreed on a common goal of tax reform the parties came together around the most sweeping tax reform in our history these were proud moments for our country and we need that same sense of purpose today to make this new governing vision into a reality the hard work of forging consensus must be done before the speech that way the state of union will be more than just a partisan laundry list followed by an opposition speech with more partisan laundry list over next year no labels will work with leaders inside and outside of government to forge consensus around national goals we can all support it's time for real leadership that provides purpose motivation and direction that unites the States of America hopefully next year the president can come forward and he'll have this consensus and on that common ground members can rally the current state of our union maybe one of division but we firmly believe that it doesn't have to be that way tonight the president said he was committed to making Washington work better and rebuilding the trust of the people who sent us here we should all be committed to this cause it starts with uniting the country to forge a better future so let's get to work and let's get it done thank you thank you

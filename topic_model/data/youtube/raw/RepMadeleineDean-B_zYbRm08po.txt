the new house impeachment managers democratic congresswoman from pennsylvania madeleine dean congresswoman thanks so much for joining us on this really appreciate it not surprising to hear this news of possibilities of jim jordan and matt gates involvement considering their support for him throughout and they've been consistent on that some staunch support even after the storming of the capital really surprising to hear from those two individuals to say the least but not surprising to hear what their roles may be um in the impeachment trial as i played as i played the the sound of of um congressman adam schiff a little bit earlier um during the first impeachment of course we know that that was based on the ukraine phone call with the ukrainian president a quid pro quo shall we say and it seemed like the um objective of congressman chef at the time was to make sure the president didn't lie again was to stop him in his tracks to keep him from abusing the powers of the office of the presidency what is your objective going into this impeachment well it just reminds me of maya angelou's wise words and i'm paraphrasing when someone reveals himself believe him the first time and so adam schiff's words were absolutely chillingly directly on point look where we are there has never been a greater betrayal by a president of the united states against his oath and against his country than by the actions of donald trump inciting insurrection and attack attack on the capitol at the time of a joint session with the vice president in the building never been a greater betrayal it's going to come down to mcconnell some reporting is indicating um this from an nbc piece on mcconnell's impeachment decision writing the outcome could come down to mcconnell who has a deep reservoir of trust within his caucus if he were to back conviction he could lead more reluctant senators to follow suit what will be the appeal that is made especially to an individual like leader mcconnell the appeal is what we all witnessed and many of us uh went through i was in the capitol i was in the gallery trapped there uh for a short while uh the senators were under attack we were under attack that mob was there with the intention of assassinating the speaker hanging the president's own vice president and hunting down members of congress like senator mcconnell uh this is it's it's such a tragedy for our country and so i am certain senator mcconnell and all of the senators are reflecting on their duties uh as this moves forward i hope for a conviction i hope we are successful in putting the case before the american people of course the american people witnessed it themselves but i hope and and i hope we get the votes of all of the congressmen mitch mcconnell importantly among them how much do you think the senator's decisions on their votes will be based on the president's behavior and the behavior of his followers and his voters in the coming three days i have no idea i have not spoken to senators about that we certainly saw the claims of some of the members of the house in terms of their vote to certify the election or regarding impeachment that they seem to make it based on politics or based on they didn't feel safe therefore they threw their vote the wrong way very strange uh rationale from members who are sworn to uphold their oath of office as well as the constitution and the law i do don't have any speculation on the senators the senators are the greatest deliberative body on the planet and i i count on them to deliberate to take the facts the evidence and the constitution and the constitutional oath this president took when they cast their votes what are your concerns if this president is acquitted yet again in the senate i'm not going to anticipate that i know we have a job to do and the reason we want to continue with this regardless of if the senate fails to convict and i'm very hopeful that they will not as i said if there were ever a greater crime i don't know what it would be against this country but what my hope is is that we are there we clearly put forward the case uh because what it also sets is deterrence if we don't move forward with this trial in the senate uh it will say to any future leader that you can go on a crime spree at the end of your term and you will not be held accountable so we're doing it for deterrence for constitutional accountability for the protection of our constitution and our precious rule of law uh for the protection of our government um it's it's so important that we do it and i hope that we will then also take the next step not only convict but prevent the president from ever holding office again we saw that he didn't learn his lesson by impeached number one we don't want him to get another shot at serving and what does it say congresswoman to the world that have seen the united states as a pillar of democracy for for so long that you can have a president in charge who incites an insurrection who tells his supporters to storm the capital and who spreads lies about an election the freest and fairest that we have seen in our in our nation's history oh i know that our partners around the world are heartbroken for us and for this attack on our democracy we absolutely know that but what they i believe they are counting on is for us to do our constitutional duty try and convict this president bar him from ever holding office and send up a signal to the world that we do value and hold precious our constitutional rule of law our democracy and this republic and of course the world is watching as very importantly uh vice president biden will become president biden and kamala harris will become our vice president now there are two people who value our precious rule of law and our constitution and their own public service democratic congresswoman madeleine dean from pennsylvania thank you so much congresswoman and thanks for taking the time out on this saturday afternoon

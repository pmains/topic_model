or a democratic congressman james Clyburn of south carolina he is the House Majority Whip and a member of the Congressional Black Caucus congressman thank you so much for being with us I want to read you some reporting from our crack congressional reporter Manu Raju who says that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told her leadership team that her caucus should focus on their agenda and their message and not the molar probe and rushar interference she and her top lieutenants view the matter as a distraction and believe they should focus on pocketbook issues the sources said tell me about this meeting and tell me about that message well first of all thank you so much for having me the fact of the matter is that's exactly what we ought to be doing that's what I did all of last week when I was in my congressional district I went from County to County having listening sessions and people are concerned about everyday issues and I believe that the Mulla report has been done that's a chapter that's closed and I think it last night this administration opened a new chapter when it moved to completely invalidate the Affordable Care Act and that me is the number-one thing on people's minds people are worried especially my part of the country about children being born with diabetes and how they are going to get health care people are worried by themselves prostate cancer which is prevalent in the low country of South Carolina and then we repress cancer how are they going to get the medical treatment that they need and so for this administration to open that chapter I think that we have got to reconnect our conversations with the American people okay before we go to the chapter that you say was open overnight you did say that the Mullah report that is a chapter that is closed what does that mean in your opinion what does that mean in your opinion for hearings that judiciary chair Jerry Nadler might have that oversight chair Elijah Cummings I have that intelligence chair Adam Schiff might have going forward do you think they should start to turn their focus elsewhere no not them they have oversight Judiciary Committee's got oversight and Elijah comments the government operations they've got oversight those of us who are dealing with the everyday issues of the American people we are going to have a press comes today talking about the affordable care act and so we can do more than one thing at a time up here that's why we have all these different committees but is it a mistake in your mind for those Democrats and there still are some who say impeachment is still a possibility they still want to see focus on that you would prefer that to be a closed chapter no that is a chapter further down the road we were going through this book chapter by chapter and maybe that's Chapter five or six but let's go to chapter two feet at this point and that is chapter two the committee's doing their work at chapter three let's get to work on the Affordable Care Act and I'm hopeful that we consume start looking at an infrastructure bill which is huge in most of these congressional districts what are we going to do about broadening our discussions about infrastructure everybody's talking about roads and bridges nobody's talking about water and sewage nobody's talking about broadband employment look and this to me is where our focus oughta be trying to make people's lives better I will say this book is complicated and I hope some of these chapters have pictures to help people like me get through it are there areas where you would be willing to work with the president to pass bills on infrastructure on health care for instance people always talk about improving on Obama care is that something you want to reach out to the President on maybe drug pricing absolutely that's exactly what the press conference we're having today is about we've always been willing to reach out to this administration on these issues the fact of the matter is when I see children in my congressional district being loaded in automobiles going down to the parking lot of the local library that closes at 5 o'clock aver they're 6 & 7 o'clock trying to get connected to the internet because they don't have adoption in their homes that is what we ought to be focused on there is something wrong with that I just heard from Sanford Bishop how his local football team after practice go down to the McDonald's so they can hook up to the Internet let me ask this what we ought to be doing making people's lives better let me ask you though as we close here about this past chapter because a lot of Democrats did say a lot of things about the investigation into Russia and the Trump campaign alleged connections to it you did an interview with BuzzFeed I just want to play you a little sound from that listen to me very blunt do you think Putin has something over on Trump and what is it oh yeah I really think that uh I've been thinking that for a long time but whenever you see smoke you need to investigate to see whether there's a fire causing it how big the fire is building up you're gonna put it out and let it burn there's a lot of smoke here and when you see this much smoke there's fire somewhere and we gotta put it out so as you sit here today reading the the bar version or summary of the Moller report were you wrong to say there was fire well we still have not seen the report I said I don't know how much fire is there the question is obstruction of justice is still on the table and that is something these committees will get into I know our soldier Nadler over the weekend they are going to get into that Elijah Cummings and others they will get into that but that's not what I ought to be doing that's not what the book of our caucus ought to be doing let them go and see what what this Malter in there while the rest of us try to go about doing what is best for the American people cars with james Clyburn from south carolina always a pleasure to have you on with us thanks so much for doing

thank you madam chair I yield myself as much time as I may consume the gentleman is recognized I want to first thank my colleague chairman Doyle for his leadership on this bill the save the Internet Act restores critical net neutrality protectionist at the FCC repealed last year this legislation is necessary to hold on firm legal ground the net neutrality principles we should all support no blocking no throttling and no paid prioritization while ensuring a free and open Internet is of the utmost importance so too is ensuring broadband internet access for all in fact according CC's 2018 communications marketplace report nearly one in four Americans lack access to broadband internet service at home as the proud representative of one of the most rule congressional districts in the country I cannot overstate what a huge problem this is individuals and small businesses in my district still lack access to stand-alone broadband internet because of high service costs a lack of broadband infrastructure in outdated in unreasonable bundling practices that require consumers to purchase home telephone service or a cable package as a condition for purchasing broadband internet service in today's global economy broadband shouldn't come with any strings attached that's why my amendment would give Gao one year to report to Congress on the benefits to consumers of making broadband internet service available to everyone on a standalone basis additionally it would include recommendations to Congress on ways to increase the availability of stand-alone broadband internet service to consumers particularly those living in rural areas consumers increasingly don't want to buy big cable bundles they just want access to the Internet that's why I urge support for this amendment and for the underlying bill madam chair I would like to reserve the balance of my time

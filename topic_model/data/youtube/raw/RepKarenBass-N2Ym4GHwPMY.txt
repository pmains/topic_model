thank you thank you for your time appearing before us today director inch I wanted to follow up on my colleague the ranking member he asked the question about the policy in Coleman prison and I wanted to know you you made reference that books are available from a library but this policy says that books are banned from publishers bookstores book clubs and friends and family you said you weren't aware of it and I understand that my question is can you do a memo or some type of communication to all of the prisons under your authority that under no circumstances would books be banned representative essa again thank you for the follow-up on that question and and I will certainly communicate if there's a misperception that we are withholding educational recreational books legal books of any form because that's certainly not the case so this doesn't seem that I would just encourage you to follow up with Coleman because this doesn't only to be a misperception this seems to be a directive from that prison and I certainly hope that this is the only case that such a policy was distributed so sorry for the staring I'll certainly review that memo thank you I wanted to ask you about women who were incarcerated and who were pregnant I know that it is the general policy of the of the Bureau that a woman is supposed to notify the bureau if she is pregnant but it's also my understanding that you test all women inmates this question okay I'll need to confirm that aspect I have certainly researched every search these aspect of you know that our processes of how we care for women in pregnancy but I'm assuming but that's a bad thing to do an airing that we do a test of are you aware that in some prisons that when a woman is pregnant that she is shackled and has restraints on her throughout her pregnancy including in her third trimester as well as during labor and delivery are you aware of that I no that does not happen in federal institutions yes well I think that it does because there have been a number of lawsuits filed against prisons because of that I wanted to know if you had ever heard of any instance in which an inmate has either attempted to escape or escaped from states now there's a number of states and state prisons that prohibit are severely restrict the use of restraints on pregnant inmates in their third trimester during labor delivery or postpartum resent best so no I have not reviewed the state's practices and in this time I hear I have specifically reviewed our practice in the federal prison know for us so you don't know you know exactly have not shackled a woman in any stage of pregnancy during the time I've been here Nord can anyone remember a time in recent history work okay so maybe we should ask those questions again as they go back how do you determine whether a pregnant inmate has received adequate care so my office has met with correction officers who raised concerns about staffing shortages and they're well there's medical there's also nutrition what is the protocols so at the federal prison of course we have a Health Services Division we have both trained medical personnel throughout our system as well as medical administrators members of the Public Health Service there are specific protocols around the nutritional needs and health needs pregnant inmates though I have not personally reviewed that I speculate there is and I will confirm it upon return to our central office also if you could document or me and I I know you don't have this information now but I would like to know the number of women who are pregnant in prison and delivered in the last couple of years and what the outcomes how many delivered normally how many delivered through a c-section and what were the birth outcomes we we will we'll go back and research that I don't sir letter I would also like to know about private prisons that are under your authority are there differences in terms of protocol and terms of the health care as well as nutrition how it's handled certainly so we have 11 private prisons currently that that we use from three different providers that predominantly address criminal alien low population within our contract there's absolutely standards of appropriate medical care and we check on that we have on-site personnel that check that so are all of the private prisons or immigrants so the eleven the predominant reason we use in the federal system private prisons is for criminal alien low custody by statute of course we have also some DC offenders in our facilities as well thank you

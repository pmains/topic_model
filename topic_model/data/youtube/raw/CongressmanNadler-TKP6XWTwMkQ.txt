Thank You mr. chairman mr. Lopez I have to start by saying that I'm greatly concerned about EPA's response to hurricane marina Maria it's eerie similarly it's eerily similar to EPA's response after 9/11 at the World Trade Center in my district in New York when EPA infamously and incorrectly declared the air is safe to breathe and the water was safe to drink thousands of people became sick and hundreds died because of EPA's negligence and lying at that time so I'm very concerned with that precedent now I hope you can finally clear up some confusion related to news reports of people drinking water from wells on the Dorado groundwater contamination Superfund site on Tuesday an EPA spokesperson was quoted that water being pulled from the Dorado Superfund site is quote okay to consume based on the analysis that we've done unquote a quote that could have come directly seventeen years ago the day before EPA responded to committee staff to the very same question about whether people were obtaining drinking water from the Dorado site that people are not drinking water from the EPA Superfund site wells unquote that's troubling because it adds to the confusion secrecy and distrust of government sources in protecting public health of the environment so I have some specific questions regarding the Dorado Superfund site and EPA actions to protect human health from known contaminants on that site the Dorado Superfund site was listed to the National Priorities List just last year correct yes sir that's cool thank you the Superfund site consists of a groundwater plume of industrial chemicals and solvents including TCE PCE chloroform and other chemicals known to have adverse human health effects both short-term and long-term correct correct sir thank you it is my understanding that two wells on the Dorado Superfund site the Nevarez in santa rosa well sites still have active wells in operation some of which the press is reportedly used as a source of drinking water following Hurricane maria is that correct that's also correct has EPA investigated whether any other well in the Dorado site was used as a source of drinking water since Hurricane Maria so sir those are the the two that we understand are the ones that are used on an interim basis by Prosser which is the the utility so the answer is you haven't investigated whether other sites were used our understanding is that no other sites are used the two it's also my understanding that when the Dorado Superfund site was listed on the NPL sampling at the Nevarez and santa rosa sites both found traces of these industrial chemicals including chloroform dççe TCE and PCE is that correct it is correct just as a note though if I may so they talk a little louder please if I may the chloroform piece was a byproduct of chlorination so that was an early indication that that is part of a public water supply but all of these chemicals were found there in terms of me if I may in terms of the the chemical analysis the analysis is roughly was conducted on a regular basis by the Department of Health on Puerto Rico and by process we also have done sampling ultimately in terms of the the threshold of safety those levels for the Santa Rosa and never-never K but but although they're below those a tolerance levels for standard drinking you're saying that all of these chemicals are found there but they're below tolerance levels correct sir all right now the Wednesday news report quotes an EPA spokesperson is saying that what are being pulled from the DeRita Superfund site meets federal drinking water standards unquote is that based on EPA testing since the landfall of Hurricane Maria yes sir we have testing under way we actually completed the testing for bacterial microbial so that but that's a statement that the water meets federal drinking water standards that's based on the EPA testing since three landfall it is and we have that results in okay as EPA made all the drinking water sampling data publicly available we are working towards that certain be happy to provide a greater expanded but you haven't made it publicly available we have the the VLC in the microbial we have still working on the drinking water and we'd be happy to update and you will make all the sampling data happy to do that sir immediately available as soon as we have the available data we can give it to you the press also reports that in 2016 when the Dorado Superfund site was initially listed on the Superfund National Priorities List that EPA stated quote drinking water with the solvents which include tetra coke tetrachloroethylene and trichloroethylene can have serious health impacts including damage to the liver and increasing risk of cancer close quote now EPA saying that the water is safe to consume is that because they're below threshold levels or why the change in position just one year so there's no change in position sir there are thresholds that are part of the drinking water safe drinking water standards and in terms of testing again for the door for the Navajo and the Santa Rosa sites all right so your testimony is that all of these poisonous chemicals are there but that they're well below tolerable levels sir we are again our point my testimony is they are within drinking water tolerance late yeah but you said that most of all the ones I mentioned were there but they're within drinking water that was left sir is there any scientific dispute as to what drink you were to tell what drinking water tolerable levels are I would have to get back to you on the detail of any scientific dispute in terms of the the standards the standards are nationally known and are regularly imposed and and the reason they go but in all communities across the reason I asked the question but and my time is expiring so let me to be very quickly here is because this is exactly what we got from EPA after 9/11 all the air all the toxins in the air were below tolerable levels they were all okay and everybody was gonna be fine and thousands of people are sick and hundreds of people are dead because they weren't fine and that's why I'm very skeptical I thank you I yield back

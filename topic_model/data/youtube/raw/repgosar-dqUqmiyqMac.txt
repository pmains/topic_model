and so it is my pleasure to introduce to you our guest speaker for your commencement today the Honorable dr. Paul Gosar our congressman from the fourth District well thank you in what ABA eautiful day what I've seen today is more smiles than I see in Washington DC in a whole year and there's a reason I bring that up is because a smile tells you that you're ready to come to the table with solutions that you're happy with yourself and you're ready to go so there are some benefits about being a dentist smiling about it is one of them well thank you dr. Ayers and thank you this year's graduates I'm very humbled to be your speaker and to address you congratulations to each of you who are graduating today and graduate congratulations to the parents the families who have supported having had a supporting role in the lives of these young men and women I have three children in college and I know how important the support a family is in the education and in the development of young people continue to support that it is one of the most important things that we can do for this country to you the graduates remember you didn't get here alone or by chance today so well whoever it was along the way a parent a sibling a teacher a mentor a friend anybody who encouraged you or inspired you don't forget to say thank you no don't do it in a text message or a Facebook you can do that to it with with professor errors take the time to hand write a note it means something make it special let them know how much they meant to you this is my first commencement speech that I've given and as I sat down to think of what I wanted to say I realized that the theme that I usually come back to is most applicable to you so as you leave college move away join the workforce settle down making a life for yourself the most important thing I can tell you and the thing that I want you to most remember is that we are a great nation only when each and every one of us takes on the responsibility of being great within it it's the American challenge so it is my challenge for you to be great so how would I define somebody who's great well we'll start with something that I think you know a little bit about already a great person sets goals and knows how to work hard to attain those goals and you've made choices when you enter college particularly here at embry-riddle you woke up you got to class to meet the demands placed on you earned your degree so I know that you're able to do this step so just remember that this is just the first milestone in pursuing your career but it's a key cornerstone you have to continue to set goals for yourself and when you reach one you set another one Thoreau said what you get by achieving your goals is not as important as who you become by achieving your goals very important we become better men and women when we aspire to do more and become more a great person is a good friend and a good teammate you forge friendships here at the University and I hope that you nurture them and keep them from a lifetime nurture them because they're worth it to this day I tell stories about the friends I made in college the wild adventures the teachers the exams the rough games of my undergrad and graduate don't look so surprised I'm not always this old it was just yesterday when I was in the classroom in an anatomy lab on the basketball court and then a rugby pitch playing with abandon what you most don't know is that Congress can be a full-contact sport so I'm happy to take the hits but I'm happy to deliver them too one day when you look back and look at the fun of these last four years it will seem like it was a moment ago but actually a decade will have passed you need to keep in touch with the friends that you have today pick up a phone spend some time see what they remember see what's going on in their life even if it comes back to what you did here in college something that went wrong something that went well or just a great laugh it was teamwork that I learned during pursuing my degrees that guides me today teamwork cannot be discounted you will always be part of a team and the skills you learned here will be your guide for success in the future I'm actually living proof of that today I stand here as a congressman just three years ago I was a dentist not just a dentist because there's a lot of things great about being a dentist I was in a crowded primary race and I beat the odds to win and that's because my family friends and my colleagues who believed in me they supported me and to this day they remain engaged and are integral to the success at my congressional level a great person strengthens the world around them with the honor of having a higher degree and from was such a respected and highly regarded institution you have great responsibility sure your expect to be to ready for their workforce that's only one part of it has become a part of your future no one wins when you play small play big here at embry-riddle in the last four years you've become part of a community the people around you today our class makes tomorrow they'll be colleagues and they will always be part of the embry-riddle family our nation is strongest when we remember we're all part of something great and you are something great the Embry Riddle family it is incumbent upon you to get involved in the world around you strengthen your community so as busy as you find yourself remember that a great person makes it a priority to give back with your time your talents your resources with you finally a great person has passion you're excited today as you head towards the next chapter of your lives keep that excitement be engaged be brilliant care you're gonna be challenged and going down you're gonna find that very that every cycle in life there are ups and downs if you remain passionate about what you're doing and why you're doing it you will be successful don't get me wrong you will fail we all do but when you do summon the passion reconnect with your core your family your community and try again detours are frustrating and discouraging but if you keep the passion you will find yourself back on the path to success Steve Jobs once said success looks like a lot like work work looks like a lot like success and he's right but there's more to it there's dreams there's gold and there has to be opportunity don't forget to celebrate as well because when we celebrate by the celebrating what we accomplished and reaching our goals it becomes contagious like a disease everybody wants a piece of it so go out there continue to be great men and great women make yourselves proud make your family proud make your university proud make America proud who is it to you who is it if it's not you to turn on the light for other people to shine I was a saying from Nelson Mandela what a good would good point to be made on this day god bless you and god bless all of you thank you [Applause] on behalf of our students faculty and staff and the whole ambriel family I would like to present you with the Eagle of excellence and we appreciate your support for all of us you

now here now my conversation with the congressman Bennie Thompson who by the way had the Homeland Security Committee do you think julie meyer should be fired well i think she has some explaining to do and that's why I've asked her to come and give a presentation to me and some of the other members of the committee as to what actually happened do you know why this is such a big deal I'll tell you why it seems to me that this is a very important issue she is charged with the job of in many cases arresting and deporting people who are of the skin color which that man seemed to be mocking at that costume party ok I mean essentially brown skinned people and real dark skinned people how do they now look at her and the agency she runs as a fear organization well I agree that is poor taste I agree that this agency deals with a disproportionate number of minorities and higher you get up an organization the less minority participation you get what I really want to get to the bottom of Rick on this issue is is this situation symptomatic and the fact that they're doing that and nobody in the room seemed to recognize when it was going on from a leadership standpoint from a julie meyer standpoint that there was a problem there is symptomatic in and of itself I mean if there isn't a recognition of a problem when it's happening that's not leadership sir well I agree clearly there's a problem the minute she saw it she should have said oh no this is totally inappropriate to wait until the next day to issue an apology and say oh I was mislaid I thought this was an hour American but to find out this person had makeup on it's inappropriate i agree with apparently there's a picture of her standing next to the gentleman who she singled out for originality and costume but that picture has been gotten rid of for some reason they had the photographer make sure he got rid of his negatives according to a report hey have you seen that picture and B what's your reaction to that report alright we heard the same thing Rick we're trying to find out why was that the CBP photographer's camera erased a family race I will ask her that in the morning if that was the case then I think that creates a bigger problem because you're trying to pretend or cover up and actually make like me like this situation never occurred Bennie Thompson congressman my thanks to you sir for taking time to take us through this Thank You gene Meserve let's bring you back into this conversation because I was taken aback when he told me he seemed to be saying he's more concerned about the cover-up than he was the actual charge what are you learning about this well I says that those photos were deleted from the CBP photographers digital camera because the costume was offensive and inappropriate we asked wouldn't have been helpful to have those photos for the inquiry that DHS is now doing a spokesman for rice said well they might or they might not there are other photos of the party we have asked for them I said no they wouldn't tell us why but advises to file a Freedom of Information Act request we have done that Rick's well done gene reserve thanks so much for that report by the way want to show you take a look

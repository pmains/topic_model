it was a choice I made to be a single mom we spent 24 hours a day together for the first three years of her life I was big and pregnant during the time I was taking my last finals in and grateful that I didn't that I was able to finish everything my daughter soma was born four days after I graduated from college I started my salsa company when she was 2 years old and I taught her how to eat hot salsa when she was a young child we traveled around all over New Mexico she was she'd be in the backseat delivering our salsa to mom-and-pop stores across the state when it was time for her to start preschool I found a preschool that allowed parents to volunteer I can then get a cut in tuition and that was the only way I was able to afford her to go to preschool the safety nets were there for me what during the time I was raising her every family and parent who needs that should be able to access that she got her degree from UNM and 2017 I'm proud of my daughter so I couldn't be happier [Music] you

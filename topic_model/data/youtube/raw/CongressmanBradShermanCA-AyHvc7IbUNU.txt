this is extra with Kalinda good morning and welcome to news conference X for a special segment of today in LA weekend with us the Honorable bread Sherman member of the House of Representatives a Democrat from Sherman Oaks he's a member the House Foreign Relations Committee and also partly responsible for a representation of porter ranch which first of all congressman thanks for joining us thank you and although i'm known as brad sherman from Sherman Oaks and I will always be from Sherman Oaks we moved up to porter ranch about a year ago so you actually live in that neighborhood we live about as close as anybody to well they've been smelling the gas we smelled some of the times and your neighbors a next-door neighbor has a bit of asthma he evacuated months ago okay we're talking of course about the natural gas leak in Porter Ranch which is lasted months and has resulted in all sorts of consternation both for the residents there and for the gas company we notice has been going on for over three months I don't you know they have a kill well that's being drilled it's a difficult thing to do I they're relatively confident that it will work they're also drilling a second kill well just in case the first one doesn't work what I'm skeptical about is the there's they should be withdrawing the natural gas as quickly as they possibly can that's the only thing that's going to be successful until you get the kill up rate they reduced pressure but now it looks like they're going to stop withdrawing natural gas and they view the natural gas in the facility as an asset we import a ranch view it as a toxin well it's the natural gas for Southern California it's a storage place so anybody in this viewing audience that turns on the gas on their stove or heats their water for the shower that's where it's coming from so you can't get rid of it well longer-term who knows where we'll store natural gas we should never be dependent upon just one storage facility but the governor's order is to pull the natural gas out of that facility as quickly as you can to reduce the pressure and the PUC which works for the governor just announced that they're going to ignore the governor's order and have them not withdraw natural gas starting next week this is mostly a state regulatory issue what does the federal government has to do with it well first phasma should be regulating these storage phasma basma what's that that is the pipeline at hazardous material safety transportation agency under the US Department of Transportation and they should they should have nationwide standards for gas storage they have good nationwide standards for direct gas transportation at least decent standards but they have punted to the state when it comes to the storage some of your neighbors want it closed just closed no more it is closed now right but the question is whether it will be allowed be allowed to reopen and they're the people in the industry just assume that it will be reopen in a few months well if you I'm sorry if you don't reopen it where do you get the natural gas that fuels the homes of millions of Californians well most of the natural gas come you know is piped in it never goes into storage or a big chunk of it but yes you're going to have a problem either way you either have an onion until this do we have safe storage it's hard to know how to run a natural gas system but we're very dependent on on Aliso Canyon and I they've got to make it safe before they start injecting more gas into it you're on the federal side what is your assessment of how state and local authorities and regulatory bodies the job they have done when it comes to not just the sleek but regulating at prior to the lake prior to the leak the regulation was incredibly old fashioned and and lacks for example this one well had a subsurface safety valve in it that was removed in 1979 and never replaced the regulation say you don't need such a valve unless you're within a couple hundred feet of a home or school because they thought that the only thing to worry about with natural gas was it might explode burn they didn't realize that when you have this amount of natural gas coming out with the impurities are in it you're going to have a health problem as many as five miles away let's move on to something else very quickly there was a exchange of prisoners between the United States and Iran there were more dual citizens US citizens and Iranian citizens who were released from custody in exchange for individuals that we held back to Iran what was your opinion about that look it's just a great thing for the families involved in these families have we know that in terms of the power and the prestige in the relationship with Iran I I think we paid a very heavy price because Iran is barred from getting nuclear and missile technology around the world they need front companies to act as invaders to get the technology they need to develop a nuclear weapon earlier than the deal would allow them and missiles and now they can turn to their evasion network and say if you get caught we'll get you out end Iran's the pro-iranian militias in Baghdad have already seized three new American hostages so they are ready so their people get caught you're a supporter of the current administration of course a loyal Democrat give us a grade on how the Obama administration has dealt with Iran and the potential for that country to dominate Middle Eastern politics the way it wants to it's them that here I'm not degrade the president but I will say this I disagreed with the Iran deal but I think it's now important that we are free to sanction Iran try to change its non-nuclear behavior you're you turn on the TV you see the people dying in Syria you got to ask why it's because Assad is supported by Iran and now that Iran has an extra hundred thirty billion dollars we cannot ignore what Iran is doing in Yemen and in Syria and say well we have a nuclear deal so we're not going to try to change your behavior in Syria let's end with one political question you've endorsed Hillary Clinton for president she is neck and neck in Iowa that vote coming up and in New Hampshire from what we understand she's trailing but Bernie Sanders make a competent nominee for the Democratic Party as far as you're concerned I support Hillary and I think she would be our best nominee I think we're at a disadvantage in the first three states because caucus States will is a a better venue for for the Sanders campaign and also New Hampshire is right next door to Vermont but once we get through those first three contests and we get to the primaries on Super Tuesday and the primary in South Carolina I think the kid they Clinton campaign will do very very well you've served with Bernie Sanders absolutely it would he be a capable commander in chief I think so and yet I would disagree with him on some elements of foreign policy and we say confident I've got to say compared to what compared to Donald Trump compared to Ted Cruz Bernie Sanders would do an outstanding job as president United States honorable brad Sherman a Democrat of sherman oaks and also Porter

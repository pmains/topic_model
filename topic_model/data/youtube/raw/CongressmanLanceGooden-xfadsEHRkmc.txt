the u.s navy sending five teams to texas after cases spiked for five straight days with us now texas congressman lance gooden congressman always good to see you you know for for the latter part of june and early july texas had been saying yes cases are up infections are up but the deaths are down and now that seems to be trending in in a very bad way your thoughts on that i agree with you totally it's it's not good at all it's terrible we saw a story just the other day about infants are absolutely able to get this that concerns me i have a daughter who's less than one year old and so we're being careful i think texans as a whole are being careful we realize realize there is a crisis and things are trending badly but we also face this difficulty with our economy we don't want to shut down and i really sympathize with the governor who's making some really tough decisions for our state i want to add the context there if i can congressman to you saying about the infants there and what it is is this and they're saying in south texas the corpus christi area there has been an outbreak of 85 infants under the age of one just for clarity here that's not the outbreak this has been since the pandemic started back in march they've had 85 just so we're clear on that the problem down in south texas appears to be in and if i'm wrong on this correct me congressman it appears to be that you have a lot of family transmission and it's happening in these multi-generational houses the kind of the same thing we saw in the early outbreak in new york your thoughts on that i think that's probably accurate that's common in various parts of texas not common in my family my mother lives four hours away and so we've kind of done our own thing but different cultures around the state spend a lot more family time together there are more people in one house so it's easier to transmit but i think this this spike that you're seeing in texas and around the nation is why we're talking about another relief package when about a month ago people including myself said that that doesn't look like it's necessary anytime soon and now i think you're seeing a lot more serious talk about the next phase of that i got to go here congressman but i know gov governor abbott has tried to steer clear of shutting down the economy you know and he wants to kind of keep things rolling your thoughts on that with 10 seconds he's got a lot of criticism because of his mask mandate but i know the governor doesn't want us to have to be wearing mask he certainly doesn't want to shut down and i believe at the end of the day if we do this right we'll be back in business and in a better place but we've got to get a vaccine sooner than later texas gop congressman lance gooden thank you sir thank you

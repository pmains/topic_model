if you want to see what our law enforcement officers are dealing with every single day along the southern border take a look at this pictures released by the DEA Los Angeles field division showing the seizure of roughly a million fentanyl pills the pills which have reported links with the Sinaloa cartel I'm not all that familiar with these cartels folks I got to tell you but they're intended for retail distribution and they have an estimated street value of about 20 million dollars here to discuss Wisconsin representative Scott Fitzgerald Congressman give me your thought on why should people be concerned about this we know they're coming across the uh the Border we know that's down to the southern border but you're up north why does it matter to the rest of the country as well well about it's good to be with you I I've been to that San Diego sector uh touring with other members of Congress members of the Judiciary Committee and if you talk to both border patrol as well as Homeland Security they'll lay out for you very clearly how these drugs make their way literally across the country and and in many cases it's going unfortunately right into the state of Colorado through Denver it then is uh picked up and is dispersed really right across the interstates I mean we've seen it in Wisconsin where you'll have these drugs being delivered uh on I-90 I-94 and they make their way directly into our communities and and that's why the the concern about the border is so significant because you can absolutely track this fentanyl being distributed now Nationwide yeah in fact Florida attorney general Ashley Moody sent a letter to the president calling fentanyl a weapon of mass destruction here's what she wrote for the first time in this country's history more than a hundred thousand Americans died from drug overdoses more than 75 000 of those overdose deaths were primarily fentanyl she went on to say in the nearly two years that your Administration has been in office you have done little to Abate this American Tragedy indeed many of your policies have exacerbated the death toll needlessly wasting America's youth so what do you think the White House should be doing about this congressman well what we've seen as of late is that there's still kind of a denial that the fentanyl epidemic is is really taken hold at the level that is being reported even by our own DEA and I and what I would say to that is uh certainly when you're at the Border in San Diego and these drugs are being smuggled across and as you refer to and as what what you showed earlier 200 pounds of fentanyl is is so deadly that uh even if it's dispersed and distributed through other drugs and other methods uh it's it could be somebody simply smoking marijuana or or certainly uh what we saw was uh just bags and bags of cocaine that also was laced with fentanyl there's unwilling individuals that simply think they're participating in a recreational drug and the next thing you know they're in complete cardiac arrest so I mean the White House needs to be better engage further engaged and just getting the word out there uh specifically through doj to say uh listen local enforcement and certainly what we've seen in Sheriff's departments they need to be better educated on what this is a lot of this fentanyl is actually manufactured in a way that mimics other prescription drugs we saw bags and bags and bags of this in San Diego because it's one of the easier ways to smuggle these drugs in is to say their legitimate prescription drugs so we're um we're very concerned Judiciary has been down to the southern border we've also been to McAllen Texas we saw the same thing going on down there but unless unless both Homeland Security and the border patrol and DEA can put together a plan to stop this uh it's not it's it's it's simply going to continue to damage our communities congressmen are those are their representatives on the other side of the aisle that are concerned about this also because it it does seem like the bite Administration kind of doesn't want to talk about these things well I think unfortunately admitting that there's a fentanyl issue and a smuggling of drugs across the border puts them in a position of having to admit that the border right now is out of control right and politically for them there's just an unwillingness to really Embrace that a whole idea and and I'm not sure exactly why some of these members uh think that that's a winner politically either to be honest with you but as we've seen the unchecked immigration that continues on a daily basis at the southern border uh and Homeland Security I think does a good job of showing what they've confiscated it's just alarming uh when you talk to local law enforcement whether it's Sheriff's departments Down On the Border or others that say you know don't just focus on the immigration focus on what these people are bringing across the border yeah Congressman Fitzgerald thank you so much sir

thank you terming Bishop and I deeply appreciate the opportunity in last Congress when you and I had a number of conversations about this in ranking number gevalia as well this is an important hearing and I'm glad I could be here supporting my friend and colleague dan Benishek who is picked up the baton that not just mean last Congress but my predecessor prior to that Peter hoekstra had spent nearly a decade working on and I'm hoping to maybe give you a little color commentary to the great description that dr. Benishek had had I guess I can tell you that sleeping there national lakeshore is a near and dear to me and my family not only on a professional but on a personal level and in fact earlier this summer my oldest two boys 15 and 14 spent a week canoeing in the area all the way out to the islands out there Manitou Island then it can out to the island trip but they were transported out there and spent time in that area and it truly is a magical place the Pure Michigan ads are true that is what Michigan looks like you need to come visit it and bring your golf clubs as well so my statement today is in support of this legislation introduced by representative Benishek dave Camp Mike Rogers fred upton to wahlberg and myself as i said a continuation of the efforts that had taken place by my predecessor peter hoekstra that will implement the new general management plan for Sleeping Bear National Lakeshore legislation was designated would designate approximately 32,000 acres as wilderness setting reasonable boundaries while preserving historic landmarks protecting private property which is extremely important for me as a former realtor in developer I understand those private property needs and maintaining hunting and fishing rights exercised for generations also another very important thing I know for myself as well as a doctor Benishek both avid outdoorsman HR 163 enjoys broad public support in Michigan and bipartisan bicameral support in Congress a companion measure introduced by senators Levin and stab and awe passed the Senate by unanimous consent on jun 19 more important importantly HR 163 protects an immensely popular component of the National Park System in fact as was talked about this has been named one in most beautiful places in America it is seen countless attention and something that we all want to protect and use properly the latest National Park Service report shows that in 2011 1.3 million visitors came to Sleeping Bear national lakeshore and spent almost 133 million dollars in the park surrounding communities supporting an estimated twenty three hundred jobs and those for those anyone who has a rural area those are well and and hard working jobs for that area and something I was extremely important to the local economy but as I said the road introduction for his legislation was not easy in fact I was just reminiscing with my friend who will be hearing from a little later Janet fahee Lee from citizens for access to the lakeshore Cal and we were we were thinking it was about 13 years ago that she and I had a first meeting about this project I was a district director for congressman hoekstra at the time and we knew that this was something that was being discussed and at the time representative bud stupak it had the area with redistricting it was coming into Peter hucksters area and on a bipartisan level everybody was concerned and needed to work on it so the the in 2002 National Park Service ignored frankly public input and developed a management plan that would have brought the park back to pre-columbian era status tearing up all the roads the county roads as as Danny had talked about to the beaches destroying many historic landmarks and making much of the park virtually inaccessible to the public almost an exact opposite of what what I think the stated goal here is this quickly resulted in a public outcry from northern Michigan both the public and the private sectors and to me access is the key element that I pursued i know dr. Benishek has pursued and the proper usage there so it's important it's important responsibility of Congress to hold the executive branch accountable for the actions and particularly when they do not consult with the public or Congress Congress should also recognize and act on those policies and recommendations when the public is fully engaged in support of HR 163 in his example of how this process can and should work frankly local citizens and stakeholders have invested significant time and effort working with us the National Park Service to develop appropriate policies for sleeping there's national lakeshore and again I just like to thank the committee for recognizing a high level of local involvement scheduling is hearing and it's my hope that the full committee will soon send the fill all in front of the full house f for consideration and passage so with that mr. Chairman I appreciate the time

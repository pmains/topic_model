hello everybody Anthony Gonzalez here with another weekly update this will be our last one for the year this week was without question the most consequential week we've had here in Washington since I've been sworn in and obviously we had the impeachment I voted no on that and we released a pretty detailed letter as to kind of my thinking in the analysis I went through if you're curious for why I voted no I direct you there but but I was a firm know on that and so that you know that will go to the Senate now presumably where I suspect it will be voted down and and then we'll have our election next November so that's impeachment on the positive side we finally were able to vote on the USMC eight months ago back in March our staff DC staff and district staff came together we had a retreat and we set priorities for the year and our number one goal the top goal that we had as an office was to help get us NCA USMC I signed into law I believe that this is the number one economic issue that we have in our region u.s. ITC independent council non partisan council projects that it'll add one hundred and seventy-five thousand jobs to the US economy a quarter of a percent of GDP and will in particular will boost manufacturing and agriculture to the most important economic drivers in Northeast Ohio so to see us pass that and to be able to finally put some partisanship aside for a couple minutes and get real work done for the American people is immensely gratifying and I can't wait to see the effects on the local economy really really excited about that can't say enough good things about it so that's us MCA lastly the NDAA the National Defense Authorization Act which is a big defense bill that we signed we passed that out of the house that will be signed into law momentarily president's going to sign it sometime over the next day or two and that's exciting for a lot of reasons for me personally it's the first piece of legislation that I've I've authored that I've had a hand in that has become law I didn't offer the entire NDAA it's a combination of a bunch of laws but SAFTA which a bill that I put forward to protect our research universities and our research institutions from foreign actors stealing it's mainly China that's doing this that made it into the NDAA and so that will become law that's like I said my first bill that will become law we've had two others that have passed the house this one will become law and and that's exciting I think it's very important we spend a lot of money take a lot of time to innovate in our universities and I want to make sure that Americans are benefiting and certainly not China so so on that front thank you as always for allowing me to be a representative merry Christmas to everybody Happy Hanukkah and a Happy Happy New Year thanks everybody

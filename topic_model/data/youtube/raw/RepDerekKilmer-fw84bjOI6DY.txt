laughter Thank You mr. speaker Tom Brokaw once said it's easy to make a buck it's much harder to make a difference today I rise to honor someone who made a difference as a schoolteacher for 50 years he began his career a half century ago at Roosevelt junior high school in Port Angeles Washington where he taught seventh grade homeroom and coached football I have met so many people who had him as a teacher I think he may have taught my entire hometown but the common themes from his former students that I've met have been these he was a great teacher he cared about me as a student he didn't just teach me English and geography taught me to be a better student and a better person earlier this week he finished out his career at chrysalis school in woodinville washington and yesterday he had his first well-deserved day of retirement mr. speaker the teacher that I rised honor today is named Jay C Kilmer and he's my dad Mark Twain remarked that the two most important days in a person's life are the day he is born and the day he figures out why my father was born to teach and like so many fantastic educators he has affected so many lives in so many ways so today I hope you'll join me in thanking a teacher and I want to congratulate him for being a great educator a difference maker and a terrific dad happy retirement dad thanks mr. speaker and I yield back

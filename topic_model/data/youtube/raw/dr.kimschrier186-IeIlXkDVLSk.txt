To understand someone better, walk a mile
in their shoes. Or ride along in their patrol car. Thats what I do with local police officers
here in Washington to hear their concerns firsthand then fight for them in Congress. It's why I got police more funding for bulletproof
vests and body cameras. And more mental health officers so cops can
stay focused on fighting crime. I'm Kim Schrier and I approve this message
because our local police deserve our support.

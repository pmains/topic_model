madam speaker i also rise to address a self-inflicted disaster occurring at our southern border i along with nine other republicans on the house oversight committee visited the border last week to see for ourselves the national security and humanitarian disaster that's wreaking havoc on our nation when our border patrol agents are pulled from their post to deal with the swarms of children at the processing facilities the remote remote border is left wide open for the really bad folks to stroll right in these aren't people that we see on television wearing biden t-shirts looking for the nearest border patrol agents so they can surrender to them these folks are in full camouflage with ski mask and are usually armed often with automatic weapons these intruders who breach the remote parts of the border illegal illegally are referred to as getaways because our agents are outnumbered usually all they can do is simply document these groups as they pass on by the notation for the records is simply 20 plus even though there are often 40 60 or even 80 or more people in january and february alone there were over 61 000 reported getaways that's a staggering amount but because the 20 plus documentation grossly underestimates the actual figures agents told us the real numbers for the first two months of the year were probably close to 120 000. left unchecked we're looking at 750 000 getaways breaking into our country this year alone again these are not asylum seekers surrendering at the border they are dangerous criminals drug smugglers human traffickers and terrorists who are willing to do anything to get into america and not be caught and once they make it to interstate 10 just a few miles north of the border they can have easy access to any place in the country this isn't a border state problem it's an unfolding national disaster of unprecedented scope that must be addressed for the security of our country yet the biden administration and my colleagues across the aisle refused to even acknowledge the problem so far neither the president or vice president have bothered to visit the border we can stop this manufactured crisis first we need to complete the border law we have construction materials laying idle in the desert president biden used to think the border wall was a good idea it's time he stops cowing to the radical elements within his own party and do what he knows is right the materials are there and the contracts to complete the work are in place just sitting there just finished the job second in the practice of catch and release and re-implement the migrant protocols and the migrant protection protocols that prove so successful in reducing the number of border incursions officers shared with us that only 10 to 12 percent of people who come here seeking asylum have legitimate cases the rest are sent back by requiring them to remain in mexico while their asylum requests are adjudicated the roughly 90 percent who know their cases are bogus won't risk the journey and those who do have legitimate causes to seek asylum will have it granted more expeditiously that would be the humane course of action we are indeed a nation of immigrants many industries in my home state of florida including agriculture hospitality and construction depend on a steady flow of legal immigrants in order to function but for america to remain the world's brightest beacon of hope we must acknowledge that a fundamental part of what makes us so attractive is our adherence to the rule of law honest law-abiding citizens like the johnsons the coopers and others we met at the border ask us to tell their story they're not confident though that we will but they also want our government to know that they aren't looking for special consideration these are tough people who simply want the opportunity to live and work their land in peace and security without having to live in fear they want to know that we will not forget about them we promised we would share their stories and we must we'll must not let them down i yield back

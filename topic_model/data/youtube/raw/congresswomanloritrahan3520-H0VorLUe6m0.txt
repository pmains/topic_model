well well thank you uh madam chair uh thank you to the families and the witnesses for giving us their time uh and their expertise today also just want to thank uh chairman pallone and chairwoman shoe for holding this important hearing uh this hearing is so timely as the kova 19 pandemic has exacerbated workforce issues that were already present pre-pandemic across the health care continuum you know i'm pleased this committee recognizes that and is highlighting legislation that aims to address these issues including my bipartisan bill the bolstering infectious outbreaks preparedness workforce act or the bio preparedness workforce act which i introduced with congressman mckinley madam chair i would love to offer a stakeholder letter of support for the bio preparedness workforce act for the record ordered thank you as many of my colleagues have expressed today cover 19 has highlighted long-standing health disparities in the u.s in addition to covet 19 other infectious diseases like hiv also disproportionately impact people of color and people of color face greater barriers and access to health care at the same time black latinx indigenous and other communities of color are underrepresented in medical professions the bio preparedness workforce act authorizes hhs to consider geographic equity and ensure that contracts helps to increase the number of underrepresented uh minority individuals serving as bio preparedness health professionals or infectious disease health professionals i'm concerned about the disproportionate impact of covid19 and other infectious diseases on underserved populations including our communities of color and it's important to increase access to culturally competent healthcare particularly during a pandemic or another public health emergency dr morazzo you mentioned to my colleague congresswoman blunt rochester how you believe the bio preparedness workforce act would help diversify the bio preparedness and infectious disease workforce but could you elaborate on why a more diverse infectious disease workforce is important to advancing health equity yeah thank you so much for that question ms trey and i and i'm really grateful that the bill that you're sponsoring specifically gives the secretary of hhs discretion to award loan repayment contracts in a way that increases the diversity of our work sort force as i mentioned before financial challenges probably pose an even greater barrier for individuals from underserved communities to pursue careers in infectious diseases and in bio preparedness a more diverse workforce really addresses a need for a culturally competent workforce we know as i mentioned before that we do better we resonate stronger with providers and people who look like us and who understand our specific health challenges so getting a more equitable distribution of id professionals not just geographically but also across these different strata of society is really going to be critical to reach the patients that we need to reach thank you for that and in addition to physicians many other health professionals are critical to bio preparedness and infectious disease care i mean many of these professionals including our our clinical uh lab professionals our advanced practice nurses and others are are also struggling with workforce shortages and burnout um dr morazzo can you also elaborate on the types of bio preparedness and id health care professionals including their roles their recruitment challenges and how the bio preparedness workforce act would help them absolutely i don't think anything has illustrated the need for a team approach um more than this pandemic we've all felt it very very urgently so in addition to physicians you nearly need a team of healthcare professionals and those include clinical laboratory professionals infection preventionists id trained pharmacists advanced practice nurses and physicians assistants all of these folks are really critical to staff the sort of workforce that we need to deal with these things and very importantly all of these professionals are included in the bio preparedness workforce acts act these people are already in short supply 25 of health care facilities have a vacancy for an infection preventionist position with more than half of long-term care facilities which have experienced incredible coveted challenges as we know having experienced a loss of an infection preventionist in the last 24 months these shortages are likely to grow more in the future as 40 of the infection preventionist workforce is expected to retire um in the next 10 years the other area is laboratory personnel there's a very high total vacancy rate for clinical microbiologists just over 10 percent and also that's a field that's aging probably about 17 of them are going to retire in the next five years and then finally pharmacists we work very closely with iv pharmacists to make sure people are safely treated with many infectious disease agents and they are very much in short supply a 2018 survey of the acute care u.s stewardship workforce to fund that pharmacist and physician fte to bed staffing ratios particularly in places in the country like ours are well below recommended levels for stewardship to be optimal thank you so much for that detailed response and i yield back thank you

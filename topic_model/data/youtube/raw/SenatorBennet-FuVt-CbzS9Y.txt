good evening everyone thank you for joining us and happy child tax credit awareness day i'm mike washington i'm the director of outreach diversity equity and inclusion in senator bennett's colorado office and i have the pleasure of moderating tonight's town hall on the upcoming rollout of the monthly child tax credit payments that will start on july 15th as a parent of five kids ages 11 9 6 4 and 2 i know how expensive it is to raise a family these days and it's only growing more costly the child tax credit will be a boost to the families like mine and i'm excited to be here tonight to help answer questions about it before we get to the questions i want to start by introducing our two guests tonight i have the privilege of being joined by colorado senator michael bennett who has led the work to expand the child tax credit in washington dc for many years and joe garcia colorado's taxpayer advocate and the taxpayer advocate is an organization that will play a key role in helping colorado families access the new benefits for which we're they're going to be eligible for so without further ado i want to turn it over to you senator ben well thanks mike i really appreciate it thanks for taking time and i want to say thank you to everybody who's on this facebook live discussion thank you for making some time for it i also would like before i um make my remarks just say how sorry i am about yet another uh tragedy this one in arvada taking the life of we think in arvada police officer we don't have details tonight but we're thinking about arvada and in the state of colorado as we go through this once again so with that let me i'll i will say a few words and then i'll turn it over i guess to joe right mike is that the order um i'm really really pleased that uh we could get together to uh on child tax credit awareness day to discuss the most significant investment uh that our country has made in children and families in decades uh before i was in the senate uh many of you know i was the superintendent of the denver public schools and a lot of the families there were working two and three jobs and and it seemed like no matter what they how hard they work often they couldn't get their hit kids out of poverty and over the last 11 years i've had the privilege of traveling to every part of our state and and we've got a very diverse state in a lot of ways and i've heard a lot of different things but if i had to summarize the basic point from people it's that they're working really hard and they can't afford some combination of housing health care higher education early childhood education child care people feel like they can't save you know they're stretched every single month just to pay the bills and and they're worried that their kids are going to live um a more diminished life than the life that they'll live and and and it's for that reason that i've been fighting for years to expand the child tax credit and i am incredibly pleased that we got it we got it included in the president's american rescue plan and the result of that is that on july 15 most families in the country and by that i mean over 90 percent of the kids in colorado most families in the country will get 250 dollars a month per child and 300 a month per child who's under the age of six the credit is what we call fully refundable which means that there are no income thresh thresholds that you have to meet but that but people are eligible from um uh just because they have a child the expanded child tax credit uh which takes the credit from two thousand dollars to three thousand dollars and makes it as i said payable monthly and it's fully refundable if you look at all of that together what we know is that it's going to cut childhood poverty in our country by almost half in a single year and in colorado by about the same amount it's going to lift 57 000 kids out of poverty and benefit over a million kids in our state more than 90 percent of colorado's kids are going to benefit from this so for families it's going to mean direct help to cover groceries to cover rent to save for a college fund or or even maybe for summer camp and we want to make sure that anyone who's eligible for the monthly payments is able to receive them if you've already filed your 2020 taxes you do not need to do anything and you should receive a payment by mail or direct deposit around july 15th and if you do not file taxes you can go to www.childtaxcredit.gov and use the non-filer sign up tool to fill out your information i hope you'll help us spread the word expanding the child's tax credit was a was a historic step forward it's going to make a massive difference in the lives of kids and families here in colorado and across the country our job now is to make these tax cuts for working people and for the middle class permanent washington has cut taxes over and over again since 2001 for the wealthiest americans this is an opportunity now uh to make sure that we do the right thing for for working americans and for the middle class on the back end of this pandemic so let me turn it over to joe to tell us a little more about what we can all expect on july 15th and then we're happy that he and i are happy to answer questions all right thank you senator bennett i just want to thank you and your entire staff for putting this together and good evening everyone my name is joe garcia i am the senior local taxpayer advocate for the state of colorado the taxpayer advocate is an independent organization within the internal revenue service and you kind of think of us as the problem solvers of the irs what we do is we help taxpayers resolve their problems with the irs from tax credits to refunds examinations and everything in between we truly do assist taxpayers with resolving their problems with the irs we also assist taxpayers with any type of violation if a taxpayer fails that their rights as the taxpayers have been violated the taxpayer advocate service assists with that as well and so uh today with the child tax credit um as senator bennett mentioned those payments will start on july 15th and for the most part folks if you file your 2020 tax return you won't have to do anything the irs is going to be using 2020 filing information they'll be also even using 2019 filing information if necessary and uh for the most part a large majority majority of american families will be receiving the child tax credit the irs sent over 36 million out 36 million letters to american families letting them know of their eligibility for the credit and an estimated amount if you did not receive those letters that's okay as long as you filed your 2020 tax return you will likely be receiving a credit as senator bennett mentioned if you are a non-filer without a filing requirement for your taxes there will be a non-filer portal which is actually up right now that you can access and input your information to express your allergy or the credit you will also have the opportunity to update your basic information such as filing requirement address so on and so forth from a secondary portal that the irs will be putting up as well and so um right now um things seem to be on track for uh the secondary portal to get your basic information by the irs uh the non-filer portal is up what we're hearing so far here was 17 and so again if there are any issues related to these tax credits and these payments the taxpayer advocate service is here to assist joe thank you for that and for your your great service to the state of colorado we really appreciate it mike i'll turn it back over to you yeah thanks joe thank you senator bennett if you um if just a prompt for everybody hey if you have any questions feel free to actually uh submit those into the comments section um so that we can have uh senator bennett and um or joe uh chime in and answer your questions so the first question is going to go to you senator bennett um can you tell our audience how the child tax credit has changed i mean you've been working on this a long time how has it changed since then yeah thanks so the the the newest version is based on a bill that i wrote called the american family act and introduced it in 2017 with my friend sherrod brown from ohio and cory booker and kamala harris actually were the next two co-sponsors of the bill and we had three major changes i mentioned a couple earlier but i think it's useful um to say it again we went from two thousand dollars to three thousand dollars per child between age six and 17 which that is a big change from the existing credits at 2 000 to 3 000 and it takes it up to 3 600 per child for kids under the age of 6. as i mentioned the new credit is fully refundable which means that the poorest families can now access the credit which they couldn't before there used to be an income threshold and that meant that millions of the poorest kids in america didn't benefit from it and now now they will have access which is one of the reasons why um uh we're cutting childhood poverty almost in half uh with this program which is going to actually also reach more than 90 of colorado's kids and then the final change that's very significant is that it it will instead of having the credit paid out as one lump sum at the tax filing time um it's going to be paid out on it on a monthly basis so that families will have the benefit of this of of this cash when they are uh when they're paying their bills and trying to decide uh how to pay the rent at the end of the month i don't i always did a call this morning with um with senator brown with some people from colorado and ohio and one of the moms on the call said that she spends basically the entire month just trying to figure out how to pay the rent and you know our hope is that this is for people like that that this will be help on a monthly basis rather than having people wait for the annual the annual the annual um uh payment of the child tax credit all right thank you senator i know i can't wait for my payments man my kids can't wait so uh joe um got a question for you man the the rs has been busy preparing resources to help eligible families access the advanced monthly payments can you give an update on what tools and resources are they are already available and what additional tools we expect to launch in the coming weeks yeah absolutely the irs has been preparing for this for quite some time you know all the way back to earlier this year pre-filing season which is around that january february time frame that's kind of when the irs started to prepare to implement the roll out of the child tax credit you know right now of course the largest strides the irs has made is of course the non-filer portal um getting that up and running so if you are a a taxpayer who doesn't have a filing requirement but yes you think you still may be eligible for the child tax credit you can go ahead and head over to irs.gov and on the on the very front of the irs website is the child tax credit link where you can click on and be taken to uh the the centralized hub for the child tax credit and you'll see the non-filer portal link there simply click on the non-filer portal link input the information and it's very user-friendly pretty self-explanatory and that portal is up and running the secondary portal where you can update your basic information such as address maybe you've moved in your word the irs won't send you a check to the right address you can update your address on that portal you can update update your bank information if you uh so choose to do direct deposit all of those things you'll be able to do on the secondary portal that the irs is getting ready to launch as well you know in terms of you know manpower the irs is expected to be taking phone calls and the like related to the child tax credit um i think what the taxpayer advocate service is doing um is really also gearing up for any issues that are going to stem from the child tax credit so in terms of something that's at the taxpayer's disposal for issue resolution is a phone call to the taxpayer advocate service here in colorado i will put that number in the chat here for taxpayers to utilize but very similar to the eip payment that went out earlier this year and last year we do expect some issues folks there's a million different reasons maybe why taxpayers may not get their payment perhaps the information the ira irs has is not updated perhaps there are other issues or holds on a taxpayer's account i mean we see a bunch of different issues and we saw a bunch of different issues when eip rolled out we do expect some of those same issues but i can guarantee the taxpayer advocate service is here to help move through those issues help taxpayers resolve whatever may be holding back their credit payment if they encounter that situation and so you know those are just a few things that the irs has done and the taxpayer advocate service has is doing in order to help folks uh get the payment with no issues and help overcome any barriers um there's a tremendous amount of outreach that taxpayer advocate services especially here in colorado we work with so many different nonprofit organizations family organizations um the underserved population in our state to get the word out that this credit is coming um [Music] there's going to be an upcoming outreach uh on june 30th a local where we're going to assist taxpayers with getting their information updated on site assist them with inputting on filer portal the information update portal perhaps you're a taxpayer that wants to decline the tax credit you also have that option and we will be assisting um at this event on june 30th more information to come on that folks and that will be widespread across facebook and other social media platforms but there's a lot of different resources available i will i would absolutely recommend that taxpayers go to irs.gov click on the child tax credit link for the latest and greatest thank you so much joe all right we got a couple of questions coming in from facebook michael the first question is for you if i sign up for the child tax credit will it affect my government my other government benefits like snap and medicaid that's a great question i was asked that question this morning as well and and the answer is no uh because the child tax credit is not treated as income it is it is not uh does not count against any of the thresholds for other public benefits all right thank you thank you guys continue to submit your questions into the facebook comments section this is helpful all right this next question is going to be for you joe if i haven't got my federal refund yet will i still receive the child tax credit payment the answer is yes you should um however as i mentioned earlier there's a lot of different reasons um lots of different reasons that we see folks as to why folks may not get their uh refund may not get their tax credit and you know quite honestly folks um a lot of the guidance after the fact is being created on the fly because of scenarios just like this question i didn't get my ref i haven't got my refund yet is that going to hold up my tax credit payment the honest answer is we're not sure you should get your payment from what we're hearing with the irs but i don't know with 100 certainty because of situations like this um there are there could be coding errors in a taxpayer's account there could be we don't know yet if the child tax credit is going to be released if somebody owes a federal debt all of these questions we just don't know yet because the guidance is not quite out there but in general i would expect a taxpayer to receive their credit payment without issue even though their refund has not been paid out yet just because of the backlog of processing of returns that the irs has right now so it does just because you haven't received your refund doesn't necessarily mean you will not receive your child tax credit um because there is a tremendous backlog of returns for 2020 that the irs is still processing still in the millions of returns folks so it doesn't necessarily mean that you will not get your child tax credit payment but if there are any issues you run up against and that includes your refund folks if you have not received your refund i would encourage you all to call the taxpayer advocate service here in colorado those are the types of issue issues excuse me that we work with and help taxpayers resolve with the irs and again i'll be putting that number in the chat thanks joe got another question for you senator bennett will families who don't sign up in time to get a payment on july 15th lose out or is there a way they can still get their ctc benefits eventually well what i would say is you should please do sign up uh and try to try to try to try to do that today if you can i mean if you haven't filed your 2020 taxes you should go ahead and do that and and and if you don't file taxes you should go to the to the irs website that joe mentioned so that you can get it done but i i think the answer is that you will not be penalized you'll be eligible for the the tax credits that you deserve uh and even if you get them late you still will get them and if i'm looking to my staff rachel west to see if i answer that question incorrectly or not no that's exactly right you will still get the credits even if you sign up later in the year the irs will pay them out in larger advanced payments and if you don't sign up at all you will still get them at the end of the year at tax time with your normal tax refunds and by the end of the year she means next next year right because that's that's the tax tax time is in april exactly all right thank you so much thank you rachel appreciate that i got another question for you joe um can someone ask can i get the child tax credit payment in one lump sum instead of monthly payments uh the answer is yes and i i want to thank rachel for kind of tackling that a little bit but yes the short answer is yes you can you can choose to decline the interim payments from july through december and if you so choose to receive a refund in full you can do so when you file your 2021 tax return and at that point in time you would receive uh one lump sum as opposed to monthly payments so you do have that option absolutely all right thank you joe um let's see let's take one more question um [Music] from facebook here um senator bennett the enhanced child tax credit was only expanded for one year what's next in the fight to make it permanent well i we got to make it permanent just doesn't make sense i mean if we we've we've decided that we're going to not accept childhood poverty as a permanent feature of our economy and that in by doing this we're going to cut it in half my goal by the way is to end childhood poverty in this country i think that's what we should be doing uh we have one of the highest childhood poverty rates in the industrialized world and some of the lower economic lowest economic mobility rates and but this is a big step forward and um but it'd be really un unfortunate if at the end of the year it goes back to where it was so you know in my view we've cut taxes for years and years and years for the wealthiest people in america there are a lot of companies that don't pay any taxes and and wealthy individuals because they take advantage of the rules of the irs and and and we've done that sort of on the theory that somehow all these benefits are going to trickle down to the rest of the country and that really hasn't happened and what i've heard consistently from people across colorado as i said earlier is they're working really hard but they feel like they can't afford a middle class life no matter what they what how hard they work so there are ways of paying for this and we're having negotiations in washington to see whether we can make it permanent the speaker of the house nancy pelosi has already said they're going to make it permanent in their version of any infrastructure bill that goes forward we have to find a way to get something similar done here in the senate and and and i mentioned just some of the i know joe's not involved in this po in these politics at all but many of the groups that represent families uh in the in this in our state and across the country know how important these changes are for their families lives the families that they work for and advocate for every single day and they are pushing members of congress also to make this permanent so the biden administration has proposed that we extend it for five years that would be an incredible victory but i think um i think that we should we should do everything we can to try to make sure these benefits last for for americans forever thank you senator bennett we have one last practical question that we'd like to ask you joe from facebook um how do you get the tax credit if the mother claimed the children on her taxes for 2020 and hasn't financially supported them for over two years plus yeah so michael that that's just another scenario um that there is no guidance for at this point um the irs will use current filing information for 2020 and if 2020 is not on file just yet or taxpayer does not update their information in the portal or the non-file or portal the irs will use 2019 information so based on that data and based on that data alone the irs will make the depend on where the credit goes and it's usually going to be based on direct deposit or paper check sent out depending on what your option selected was on your tax return but unfortunately in situations like that we just don't have the guidance yet god i appreciate it we'll be looking out for that additional guidance uh thank you so much joe uh for coming on and um for answering some questions for us we really appreciate it senator bennett uh we're at time so i'm going to turn it back over to you to close out mike i just want to thank you for hosting it and and and rachel thanks for being part of it joe garcia our taxpayer advocate thank you for everything that you do i should say you know that the irs has really been working very hard this is there was a time a number of months ago when people were saying oh my gosh it's going to be impossible to make these month payments monthly the irs and the treasury department have been really working hard to try to do it i know they're going to be mistakes and i know that's going to be frustrating to people and we're going to have to work together to get through the iron out the wrinkles that that exist along the way but hopefully it's going to be a really great experience for almost everybody starting july 15th to to begin to receive these monthly payments and begin to imagine again an economy that works for everybody not just the people at the very top that's what we need to find a way to build again in america and i think this is a very important step forward uh in that journey so thank you everybody for being on tonight i hope i'll see you sometime in person soon thanks mike thank you senator bennett

mr. speaker no words can express the pain and sadness I feel for all those affected by the horrific attack on a gay nightclub on Orlando on too many occasions the LGBT community and our country have been forced to overcome moments of profound loss but on each of these occasions we've emerged stronger and more resilient once again we will choose love over hate and compassion over intolerance these are the themes of LGBT pride month and they cannot be lost in this overwhelming tragedy this attack forces us to confront too unpleasant facts about our country fact one hateful rhetoric towards the LGBT people and other minority groups is still far too common and it is far too easy fat to it is far too easy for dangerous people to access assault weapons I hope we have the courage to confront these facts and build a safer and stronger America this is what the victims and their families deserve

it's an honor to be with you today my name is Camila Hayward I work for FEMA the Federal Emergency Management Agency located beverages by office based here in Chicago and Anila the head of our office talked this morning about our office and our various programs so this is a continuation of that and I focused in particular on public education efforts so most of you have heard of clean obviously and you've seen us in the media mostly after disasters and response and recovery phase but I am active all all year long talking to the community members about what they can do to become better prepared for disasters and well we don't have grants per se I'm here to tell you about some of the three programs that we have that are obviously paid for by taxpayer dollars but then you can take advantage of them and there's also partnership opportunities and things like that Belleville to you so the first thing I wanted to mention is our focus on public education so one of you must mean priorities is building a culture of preparedness across the entire country we will feel empowered to be cleared for disasters to hopefully less than the loss of property a most important loss of life when it says we have Bennett so things like having a family communication plan in place handing it over to supply tip he financially prepared for disasters all those are really important things relate to emergency preparedness so it's been effect we have a whole bunch of different resources they can order for free from FEMA different brochures and pamphlets and things like that and some of them are on the table outside but just some examples we have a checklist for knowing what alerts and warnings are active in your area and what the different levels of alerts be forming a family communication plan reckless at home and talking with your family about disasters and things like that we want people to know what exactly happened in their areas so that they're prepared for those and they want people to know what kinds of actions to take you know what's the difference between a watch Authority where the best place to shelter here the tornado and everything like that so importantly we want to focus on youth in reaching you know people at a young age so that we're helping people form an understanding of what centers are humming prepare to get petty young man aged so we have a number of programs for kids one of those is the student tools burglary to clean program and it comes to the fun backpack so I'm happy to show you that this backpack afterwards but it's it has a flashlight in it it has an emergency blanket and a whistle so it's just a conversation starter for kids in terms of how they can talk with their families about being better prepared for disasters and while the backpacks themselves aren't free we do have a free curriculum associated with this program and it's geared towards for the creators because we found that that was the best age here to engage in terms of their ability at that level to peers in their families for preparedness so we talked about Twitter disasters looking happier where I live and the custom fun interactive teens that are included in that as well and it can really go into any curriculum so if you're in our area it's a line to Congress core standards after science and for English 12 and it's really great program is only one hour minimum that's required in order for kids to get their certificate as part of the program but there's seven to eight hours optional written as well and different activities that think of you like role-playing emergency scenarios and things like that so I've adopted it for many different organizations such as Girl Scouts or Boy Scouts or summer camps and things like that brother Tori preparedness initiatives we also partner a lot with local nonprofit organizations and community groups to encourage people to know their risks and to take action prepare for disasters really focus a lot on disturbing underserved communities so people who are low income the very young the very old of people of access and functional needs in minority communities including limited English proficiency so we have limited resources at the minute to prepare people for disasters and goobies more intensive programs so we kind of focus them on the communities that need them the most one of our partnerships is with Head Start cities we have that in the city of Chicago as well as Will County and I'm hoping to expand that out so and that just takes a look at how these facilities better prepare for disasters how can they prepare the people that we serve for disasters so that these are the most vulnerable groups when something happens that you know they can take steps still to be better prepared and I wanted to ask how many of you have heard of the cert program Community Emergency Response Teams a few okay so that's another program that falls under my area of work and it was essentially created in the 90s after some earthquakes in California and there's big earthquake in Mexico City as well and it so the key to the emergency response team around this started as a result of those earthquakes that I mentioned and essentially what it does is teach people basic emergency response skill sets such as like urban search-and-rescue organizational skills it teaches them how to act as the first responders before the actual professional first responders arrive and if you just want to do that in the safe wave where they're not putting themselves into harm's way so sir teens have been really beneficial in some of the best with your kind of Illinois for example in the South County the cert members reused for everything from you know managing spontaneous volunteers after tornadoes and flooding events to helping people evacuate when we join it or I'm helping with damage assessments and things like that and when there's not disasters the cert members will help out it you know community events and they'll help with things like traffic control or the little medical tent you know if there's a race happy new the community and things like that so it's a 20 hour basic search training that every member of us go through and there are quite a number of teens in the surrounding area Illinois has a very strong Start program so for those of you who are justed in getting involved in that I encourage a few so and lastly I wanted to mention on some of the trainings that we do with our community members I mentioned the head start training series but we're always looking for new opportunities to partner with organizations as well we have a for example of Girl Scout Bank coming up in our region that our private office in partnership with the American Red Cross and it's going to teach the girls about emergency preparedness and we're going to give them a parent it's fun packed and help them fall back to their first batch so the goal is we want to get to this fifth and get me 81 kinda grow to become prepared adults in similar to the success of campaigns in the past seatbelt campaign in the recycling campaign I wrote a thing to do something similar with emergency preparedness and like I said we focus on engaging youth and engaging those historically underserved communities so we are always pink forward to partnerships and training opportunities and things like that so my position will be sent around and you can feel free to contact me also I want to make a point of linking above those materials that I mentioned you can order those online have order corporate event and we can send that around as well and all of those are cartridge for you to order [Music]

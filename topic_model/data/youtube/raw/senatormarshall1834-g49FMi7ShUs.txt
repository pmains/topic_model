Kansas Republican congressman Roger Marshall congressman good to see you thank you with us you maybe I'm wrong but I think you won the last election with about 66 percent of the vote that's that sounds right you're a popular guy in a Safely Republican state what why do you why do you think that was a sufficient explanation I mean it's not gonna hurt you to say what you really thought right you heard the president say it most people didn't believe it well certainly I'm gonna take the president at his word I I think that he made a mistake when he was speaking the first time and he corrected that and I'm happy with his explanation but you don't really believe that he made a mistake right congressman I mean that's that's just do you really I just I I got a no because it's not really plausible the way he said it there was a whole press conference in which he reiterated the same sentiment over and over again but this was apparently the one sentence taken out of context boy where I come from a man's word is his bond consistently he said three or four different times over the past year that that he understood that Russia was trying to interfere with her election he's made that very very clear so I'm gonna take the man at his word and I think I also have to look at his actions look what he's done this president has been tougher on Russia than any Administration in recent history so I think his actions match up with this words and I accept his explanation your Congress has been tough on Russia with sanctions opposed the the administration hasn't actually lived up to the requirements that Congress actually voted on and imposed so I'm not I'm not sure this president's been tougher he also did say that he has faith in Vladimir Putin I got to ask you in a good Republican place like Kansas is that gonna go over well with your constituents I think that we're all pretty suspicious and mr. Putin in Kansas I think you're right about that but but I certainly understand where President Trump is trying to go with this you know this old adage keep your friends close and your enemies closer so the president's goals and my goals they line up together I want ruled peace I want the nuclear weapons out of North Korea and if the president can use some triangular diplomacy with Russia to accomplish that then I'm okay with it would you do that Congress but I mean I I hear you I'm all for dialogue you and I are on the show together you about it but did that feel like good dialogue to you would your constituents support you going out there in the face of the evidence I assume you believe the US intelligence committee committee a community that Russia interfered in the 2006 election and continues to do so in 2018 certainly I have faith in our investigative forces our law enforcement people that that and I believe in that Russia has and is continuing to try to hack into ours lots of our systems but I also believe that the president is I'm gonna give him some room and some rope I'm not sure what was said behind closed doors but I think this president has a strategy and I think again his actions have been great he's he's you know sit missiles over there in the face of Russia he SiC tout over 50 diplomats not just in the United States but also from United Nations he's closed a consulate office in the state of Washington so I do think that this president's actions are lining up with his words that he has an ultimate goal for national security and peace the apology tour is over with this president means business when it comes to national security but you know we're also we're not sure what happened behind closed doors we'd be interested in that Eric swallow was on a little while ago saying look you could discount what you think about whether the president does or doesn't like Vladimir Putin or does or doesn't believe this but Congress has a role to play and can do lots of things to you know close these loopholes and make sure that America actually does punish and prevent Russia from interfering in the 2018 elections what are you prepared to do to assure your constituents that you're taking a hard line on this well first of all we've already done a lot we recently allocated about 380 million dollars to shore up all of our electoral processes back home the Department of Homeland Security has visited with a thousand different elector identities they've been in 50 states so they're doing everything they can to shore up the process there's very few days go by that and we don't talk about cybersecurity issues up here and holding the administration accountable but actually your results are gonna your Congress actually defeated a bill that was going to increase funding for purity today well we I think we have a lot of cybersecurity money already out there I think that the 380 million dollars is enough to work to work on the election process and certainly you know engaging with our their friends at the military on doing more cybersecurity acts as well so I think that we're putting some money that we're putting a lot of money in the right direction we're gonna be talking to somebody who says that Congress should call upon the interpreter who was in that meeting to testify would you support that I I don't think that's necessary I think the President Trump has a job to do and some things do need to be said behind closed doors so I support the president I think he has a plan in mind I mean just think about a year ago and we thought that the world was coming to an end with with North Korea that NATO was going to blow up but instead NATO was stronger today than it was and were closer to peace with North Korea so let's give this president a little bit of rope in and have some faith in him - I can't I mean you really think NATO stronger than it was a week ago when President went to Brussels and called our European allies foes I think the NATO was stronger today than she was a year ago were two years ago I think the amount of money the investment by our allies there has been more than ever so it and just talking to our military folks here in DC at the Pentagon I I hear them say that NATO is indeed stronger congressman thanks for joining me tonight

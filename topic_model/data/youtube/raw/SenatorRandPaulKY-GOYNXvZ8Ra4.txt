without a doubt venezuela is a socialist nightmare it's indeed a vivid indictment of the economic system of socialism it's appalling that a country like venezuela that sits atop more oil than saudi arabia is in such a dire state that people actually eat their pets no one disputes the disaster that is venezuelan socialism however when it comes to regime change the u.s track record is less than stellar it has been largely ignored that the possible replacement for maduro guado is also a socialist his political party is recognized by the socialist international my fear is that even if you get a kinder gentler form of socialism it's still socialism and the results will be similar economic malaise and economic disaster what do you say as to replacing one socialist with another in venezuela i don't think the main problem in venezuela is that one party or another is a member of the socialist international which a lot of partners of ours in europe are and have been it's that it's a vicious brutal murderous dictatorship and that's the real reason that we're engaged there right he's driven five million people out of the country i guess that response sort of uh somehow alleviates the stigma of socialism from being a problem you know that socialism isn't the problem there and i guess many others who've watched socialism through the years have argued that you really can't have a kinder gentler form of socialism that what happens with democratic socialism is that when you want to own the when you want to have the state own the means of production or when you want to have the state owned property that ultimately it devolves into a croney system that what chavez and maduro started out as is not what it ended up as when you have a more complete form of socialism as socialism evolves that perhaps authoritarianism is a side effect of socialism you know when batista was rooted out you know he was a so-called croniest or whatever there were people who supported castro many well and intended people supported castro in the beginning and turned out castro wasn't any better than batista but was actually probably worse than batista um so i think that we ought to be careful with this and i think that discounting that socialism has anything to do with it is really discounting an economic nightmare that has happened in venezuela and saying it's just because you got bad socialist if we had better socialists we wouldn't have so much of a problem do you think that the u.s government has the uh where the president has the right to uh military militarily bring about regime change in venezuela without the authority of congress that's not our policy do you think the president has the right to do that i think the president has the right to conduct the foreign policy of the united states under the constitution and we certainly would like to see a democratic venezuela sounds like a non-answer but i mean the question is do you believe that the president has the right to do it without congressional authority this is a very important constitutional question also if the answer is that socialism is not the problem we think one socialist is a little bit more benign than another socialist and we think the president has the right to do it we could very much be involved with this and the reason why this is important and why the discussion of regime change is important is that president trump gets it more than almost anybody else at the iraq war which i know you were a big proponent of was a utter disaster that in getting rid of one bad person we were left with something maybe even worse and that is the the vacuum the chaos and the terrorism that comes from having no government this happened again in in libya so the real question of whether or not we want to always think we know what's best for another country and we're going to replace one leader with one less bad is an important one do you still believe that the iraq war was uh a uh something that you would support today you're you still think the iraq war was a good idea senator i haven't thought about the iraq war in years because i'm in this job trying to sound like another non-answer but it'd be nice to know if the president had people around him who actually agreed with him the president thinks it's a worse public policy decision of the last generation that it led to a vacuum that actually led to chaos and more terrorism but also led to more of the emboldenment of iran so the same hawks that wanted to go after hussein now want to go after iran but now iran is worse because hussein is gone so see one thing leads to another and there are unintended consequences and i think the discussion of regime change is an important one and i think we should not so casually dismiss socialism as being the problem in venezuela well i'm not casually dismissing it and i think that it is a very bad economic policy but we've had allies i mean england has had socialist governments francis had socialist governments germany has had socialist governments they were allies of ours throughout the cold war that was not the problem as long as they were democrats whether they pursue a terrible economic policy is essentially theirs to decide because it's their country the problem with venezuela is that it has a murderous corrupt regime that is having an impact not only inside but on all the neighbors the question is is whether murderous thugs are an accident of history or whether they are a consequence of socialism why does it seem that time and time again socialism leads to autocracy and that is important thing because if you get a benign democratic socialism how long does that last till it devolves into authoritarianism i think it's a question worth asking

league from florida mr posey for five minutes thank you uh very much uh chairman foster and ranking member ubernold for holding this hearing a discussion of the variance of covet 19 is very important to our work of defeating this virus and understanding its dangers in history dr striffer in 2003 it appears the first sars epidemic sarv cove was beginning to spread and the virus was mutating rapidly as it adapted to humans but it appears once it became more contagious it became more stable and stopped mutating so quickly kevin 19 or sars code 2 appears to have been remarkably stable since it first emerged in 2001 19 in wuhan it never appears to have had the same period of rapid mutation in the 2003 sars outbreak each witness obviously is very interested in the variants but but i wonder if we are uh as curious about the missing links for earlier variants covet 19 that we would expect to see just after the emergence of a new virus can staff bring my my pictures up now this is this is from a pre-print paper uh and and figure one shows mutations in early stage stars in blue and then the late stage sars in yellow figure 2 shows the mutations in covet 19. bigger spaces between those dots would appear to this lay person to indicate greater mutations in the virus and obviously the two figures are very different from each other and in fact the red covet cover 19 looks a lot more like the yellow late stage sars the original sars is known to be nationally emerging virus and it mutated rapidly when it did emerge coveted 19 on the other hand did not have the same rapid mutations so my my question dr striffer based on your expertise how would you explain why figure two does not have the early mutations that we see in figure one so just uh just just to jump in and sorry i apologize i'm moving screens around so i can actually see the figure i'm actually paying attention uh so i think uh virus evolution is always a careful balance between trying to infect the host replicate and do that in a way which is efficient but not actually kill the host and one of the things that you'll find is that vaccine viruses rather that are actually too aggressive that cause too much fatality will actually damp out very quickly uh so you do see uh an enormous amount of uh difference in the rate at which viruses mutate and the patterns that you see in those mutations and i think that's reflected here i think these are both natural viruses i think uh the difference in the mutation rates is a reflection of the uh different uh epidemiology of the way in which the initial pandemics played out and then just the natural differences in the virus and uh dr abdul karem and dr uh uh um excuse me uh i'm gonna get my name wrong uh dr grubel um uh could probably comment very eloquently on this if they'd like to follow up with that um although of course it's the member's prerogative i'd be delighted for the follow-up thank you are you all right i can i can answer for a minute um so so one each virus is a little bit different and and especially when we have viruses that emerge from animals and to people that they're at different stages of being able to adapt and spread within within people and so there's it's always hard to compare apples to apples when you have different events that are happening also evolution is is not just dependent on on adapting to the host there's there's other things in place that such as the rate of transmission um some other inherent factors the the types of therapeutics that are used um so it's a really complicated uh uh factor and i would say that with starscoby2 we did see early adaptation to humans we had the d614g mutation that rapidly spread around the world um and then now we are seeing the emergence of many new variants that are happening um and and also just to say that the the pandemic with sarsko v2 is is really unprecedented in terms of the number of infections it's evolutionary patterns with the emergence of several variants that have many mutations that are acquired in a very short period that um i would just say that it's very difficult to compare this to really anything else because we haven't seen anything quite like that uh thank you thank you very much mr chairman thank you i yield back thank you and yeah the i believe the gentleman's line of questioning touched on a very important issue which is trying to understand what we can about the origins of this virus and you know this is a subject of very serious scientific debate among serious scientists about what what constitutes evidence in various directions this this subcommittee on investigations and oversight does intend to have a hearing on the origins of the sars code two virus in the near future

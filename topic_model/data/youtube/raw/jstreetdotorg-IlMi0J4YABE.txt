there isn't a single day that I don't wake up with a sense of being involved in a miracle of being a rabbi here in Jerusalem but as a religious Zionist I feel incredibly blessed that my children have grown up in Israel and that Israel is part of our lives I love the fact that Israel has been a tremendous and wonderful inspiring project somebody who lost his brother in the war in 73 somebody who raises his children here I don't think that there's any better place on earth than Israel what we have been able to create here in some 60 years is a miracle the essence of the miracle of Israel is that it's a Jewish Democratic state Israel is it a very important juncture but today in the core issue here is the question of war and peace at what kind of country we will be in the future behind me is the lobby squirrel on the force of love member 1995 lobbying was assassinated here with three shots at his back this is a place were Israeli right-wing forces try to kill the peace process but what my beer and Paris have started a 93 is stronger than any assassin myself as a brigade commander in the Gaza Strip and then as the head of peace administration under for Israeli Prime Minister I really believe that the only way to preserve Israel secure the more gothic and Jewish state is by achieve a peace agreement with the Palestinians we must divide between the two entities the Palestinian state and the state of israel otherwise we will be in a combination which is hopeless it will lead to a non-jewish majority and the end of Zionism is not a Palestinian issue he's a Jewish issue if we don't achieve the two-state solution I'm afraid that my daughter would grow up in a much more segregated much more violent much less d√©mocratique of course less peaceful Israel to support Israel today means to support Israel to get out of the occupied territories because we can't go on like this you know how many more children need to die i paid a really high price for what I'm saying you see it's so easy for people in America not to compromise their children aren't standing at a roadblock every day not in ten years from now not in 20 years from now if we will not reach the two-state solution in the very near future we slowly become a bi-national state which is not why I and other people have arrived to this country we used to be 12 tribes who are still separated in many parties ideas differences but we are still one people and I believe that the same right that Israelis have to criticize the government is not only part of democracy it's part of the Jewish tradition and I believe that Jews all over the world has the right to think and to say loud and clear what they are thinking you can support Israel you can love Israel and you can also criticized the policy of the Israeli government and consider myself a moderate right winger I support the State of Israel and I do not necessary support ganda today I'm going to vote against it coming next election the whole of Jewish intellectual power is based on debate on difference on argument and I see no reason why there shouldn't be two different voices within the Jewish community in the u.s. we need world jewelry telling us Israelis please come to your senses but what's worrisome and that's something you definitely feel among the young people is the time is running out last summer we protested for so a new way of social justice in Israel the same voices needs to be raised up now for a peace agreement from the Palestinians I think finding peace is crucial and I the only way to do peace is to divide our country I think we need to find a two-state solution as soon as possible there is absolute urgency two-state solution is necessary for Israel we have a huge political spectrum from very left to very right and every voice is heard this is a time for Americans as well to go in lobby there Congress to their senator whoever they need to do and make their voice heard we need you the American Jews to speak out and to speak very clear and support the idea of two-state solution peace is a core value of Judy's human rights and human dignity is a value of Judaism and therefore we have to get together all good forces inside Israel outside Israel Jews and non-jews if you want to do what is right that is what is right those who are friends of the Jewish state they have to help us achieve a two-state solution we know what the solution is so let's just get up and do it

joining our coverage kentucky senator rand paul who serves on the foreign relations committee and senator good morning to you i want to get into some of the issues in a moment but first your reflections on this day just as an american sir well you know i think a peaceful transformation of power is something that's incredibly important and something that's part of our heritage so i think while i'm not excited about the transformation it's peaceful and i think that that's good for our country yeah when you think about the executive orders that are forthcoming what do you see as perhaps the biggest change as you look at those well you know we went in the direction of trying to get government out of the way of business trying to encourage businesses to stay in america and i think the opposite's going to happen in fact it's hard for me to believe anybody in the country would want the things that biden is proposing if we raise the corporate income tax here in america companies will go overseas that's what was happening when we had the highest corporate income tax in the world companies were regularly reincorporating in other places around the world to escape our taxes so raising our taxes will cause corporations to flee but if you mandate what the wages are if you mandate a minimum wage of 15 dollars it's not like everybody gets fifteen dollars the people who still have a job get fifteen dollars but many people will become unemployed in fact government statistics say almost four million people will lose their jobs if you mandate a fifteen dollar an hour job minimum wage senator watching michelle obama and the former president barack obama now enter the east side of the capitol i don't know how much you've thought about the future of the republican party but there is a comment that came in the guardian from james comey former head of the fbi i'm going to read it for you sir the republican party needs to be burned down or changed something is shifting and i'm home against the fault breaking apart a break between the trumpets and those people who want to try and build a responsible conservative party because everybody should know that we need one who would want to be part of an organization at its core is built on mise and racism and know nothing now senator that's a lot have you heard that advice when we start taking advice from comey a notorious liar a guy who ruined the fbi a guy who used the enormous power of government to go after his political opponent donald trump i think when we start taking his advice we're taking the wrong advice and so i don't plan on listening to anything from comey in fact i think comey should be imprisoned for the things that he did it's a remarkable statement just as you're reading it to take those words in sir what do you think the state of the party is now going forward my fear is that if republicans particularly republican leadership goes along with this impeachment they'll destroy the party and so i think it's a huge mistake i think it's a hugely partisan exercise on the part of the democrats but for republicans who go along with it i think they'll destroy our party donald trump isn't everything in the party but he did bring a lot of people to the party and i think it's a huge mistake for people to say oh well we're just going to impeach him and that all of the blue-collar workers that he brought to our party are going to stay no i think quite a few will be unhappy so i hope our leadership will think twice about these undercurrents and rubble rumblings about them actually voting for impeachment i sure hope it doesn't happen [Music] senator we saw the clintons enter there we'll see more in a moment here for others as they arrive what was the last time you spoke to president trump i spoke to him yesterday and i think he seemed to be in good spirits and you know seemed like the same old president trump that i've come to know over the last four years you heard his speech yesterday what did you think of his closing comments of sorts what's incredibly important is that we look at the highlights of what we've done over the last four years that he's done with the republican senate and for some of those years of the republican house largest tax cut in a long long time lowest unemployment in 50 years for every category that you can look at men women black white brown i mean amazing accomplishments and then we had this terrible disaster of this pandemic but also we had the great uh speed with which we got a vaccine and i promise you that wouldn't have happened had donald trump not been uh butting some heads around and bullying people with the fda to make sure that they did their job that did it was remarkable on that topic sir just one final question it appears that coveted relief will be the first push forward legislatively in congress what would you sign up for on that well people need to realize there is no money in washington to give you there is no rainy day account there is no savings we run a trillion dollar deficit every year just paying for medicare social security medicaid food stamps etc national defense we're a trillion dollars short paying for what we normally pay for so there is no money we borrowed an extra 3 trillion last year it is not good economic policy not good fiscal policy and it damages the very foundation of the country to keep printing up money and handing it out it's popular but it isn't good sense is there no amount of a straight check that you would cut for americans right now we've already passed out four trillion dollars we don't have unemployment's coming down what i would do for america is open america if you give governors like cuomo money they'll just keep the economy closed so you don't want to give them an incentive to keep the economy closed if you open up our country we'll prosper like we did about a year ago before all this came senator thank you for your time i look forward to more conversations in the new administration rand paul from kentucky thank you thank you thank you very much

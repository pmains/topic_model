and this morning we start with the impeachment inquiry surrounding President Trump a lot of movement this week by Congress including several subpoenas this morning Republican congressman Lance Gooden who represents Dallas Henderson and Kaufman County's joins us thank you so much for being here coming having me it's always great to be here I know you've come out against the impeachment inquiry do you think when Congress gets back anything will get done with respect to actually actual real legislation probably not but I'm glad you mention impeachment inquiry because what we have right now it's not an actual inquiry it's Nancy Pelosi saying we have an inquiry the US House has not voted on this which means Democrats are unwilling to force their vulnerable Democratic freshman members to go on record they're also refusing to give Republicans subpoena power which is what happened and the Clinton and Nixon impeachment proceedings and in the last 25 years the US House has impeached three federal officials two judges and Bill Clinton in all three circumstances the full US House voted to initiate an inquiry that's not happening here which is why the president's refusing to cooperate and he should refuse do you think first of all it there's nothing in the Constitution that says it has to happen it's just been like that as you mentioned for the you know past 25 years but do you think it will happen eventually I do think it will happen and one of the reasons I think it'll happen is because Democrats aren't defending this process Nancy Pelosi said after the first few days there's nothing in the Constitution that requires it but as the two weeks have drug on since she said that keep in mind three days after she made her announcement of opening her inquiry we all left town for two weeks so everything you've watched in the last two weeks has happened without Congress being in Washington and I think the discussion it's going to be very difficult for Democrats to refuse us that very important vote for the American people not just for the members of Congress okay happens do you think that the Republicans and the White House should cooperate absolutely and the White House has said that they said if this is not a kangaroo court and this is an actual legitimate inquiry we're happy to cooperate so let's do it in a legitimate way if we're going to actually go down this road I've heard Nancy Pelosi say over the last two weeks that this isn't politics this is about the US Constitution this is about the rule of law no one's above the law if this is so important if this is so much about the Constitution and not about politics put it on the floor for a vote very simple do you think Democrats should impeach you think Trump should be impeached of course not of course you don't this whole thing's ridiculous well let me ask you this then you say it's ridiculous do you condone the call with the Ukrainian so I'm glad you I'm glad you sure sure sure everyone watching those what's coming next in your question because news media people good people like yourselves have said for the last two weeks the key question that news media are trying to get Republicans on record of saying is is that appropriate there's that conversation appropriate was it not appropriate that's not what we're talking talking about here with impeachment is it lawful or is it unlawful nothing in that transcript was unlawful which is why he doesn't deserve to be impeach if Nancy Pelosi had waited 48 hours and actually seen that transcript before she made her declaration she would not have made her declaration is it an appropriate phone call back to that question we could go through Donald Trump's Twitter feed for the last three or four years there are going to be people who think it's appropriate and not appropriate we're going to I think that Donald Trump is nontraditional his style doesn't necessarily fit mine but he's doing everything he campaigned to do and no one who's whining complaining upset about that phone call should be shocked that the President of the United States is nontraditional in the way he communicates not traditional but I mean do you agree with with what he did I have no problems with this phone call no no okay good you just answered a question and let me ask you this and let's say the impeach impeachment inside if more Republicans called out the President on that call and other things that he's done not to impeach him but just to say hey we don't agree with this do you think maybe it wouldn't get to the point where we have an impeachment enquiries and things like that I think the heavens could come come open and someone could come down and endorse Donald Trump for re-election and the Democrats would still not listen there's nothing this president can do that will appease far-left Nancy Pelosi is the only person who in leadership who has said no to impeachment she doesn't even believe in this but she's caved to the far left that have pushed her in this direction there's nothing this president can do that will make Democrats happy or willing to work with them before the election and the counter-argument is there's nothing this president can do to get Republicans to be critical of them that's absolutely not true except for the situation in Syria and the talk along the Turkish border and your Kurds what about that pulling US troops from that area this president is executing on yet another campaign promise and that was to pull us out of needless Wars expensive Wars Wars that don't concern us he pulled us out of here I believe there's more to the story that's going to come out in the next week or so but I absolutely trust the president and if other countries the next question you may ask is well what about Russia and Iran they're going to move in this is Syria this is this is an area that we've already ceded to Russia because President Obama refused to do anything we had a chance to do something about the dictator and a like hang-dry because I know I were about 11,000 lives were laws fighting the choices and all of that and just to leave them out there now I mean it's that right I'm not saying I love it but I believe that this president knows more about the issue that than the rest of us do and then the coming week I believe we will learn more and I also fully support the president's desire and my desire my constituents desire to get us out of needless force that's something he campaigned on and that's what's so upsetting to so many as the president is executing on his agenda that he campaigned on people don't like it let's turn a little bit to what I began with with Congress I mean Congress is very divided will we see an infrastructure bill get done will there be bills that people in North Texas want the answer is I think that I think probably so before two weeks ago when Democrats said let's go down this road of impeachment I believe that the US Canada Mexico trade agreement for example is one of those bipartisan issues that Democrats are for privately and publicly they say they're for it they've struggled internally in their caucus but because they know that if the president gets a win god forbid then they're going to have to be a part of that and they refuse to deal in anything that results in Donald Trump getting a win so everything you just said these are all priorities of mine their priorities of Democrats too they know that we need to act on infrastructure they know the US Canada Mexico trade agreement needs to be done they know we actually have the support to make a deal on immigration but Democrats don't want to deliver a win for Donald Trump they're doing exactly what Republicans did against Obama after that first midterm election when Republicans said let's prevent Obama from getting reelected so will obstruct will obstruct will obstruct that's happening now history I believe will repeat itself and Donald Trump will get reelected because of it Trump is the president is coming to Dallas Thursday for a big rally you don't understand right next to him and then I would love to and I hope I hope the answer is yes but we also have a vote scheduled so it'll depend on votes but I love Donald Trump when Texas absolutely the margin he won by nine points last year what do you think I think that Republicans conservatives were awakened after this last election cycle where Ted Cruz was almost defeated we'd lost seats in the State House Republicans across the state have awakened and said we've got to engage better than we have we've rested on our laurels in past election cycles there is no Republican taking things lightly both Democrats and Republicans across the state of Texas equally to me say there's a 50/50 shot the house goes Democrat because Republicans know that we have awakened and we are working hard to make sure that doesn't happen because Democrats know that they're pouring research resources into this state like never before so I think you'll see a ton of money being spent I'm sure you all will make a lot of money on commercials throughout the election cycle we're gonna leave it there congressman thanks so much for being thank you

we are joined on the line right now by Senator Ted Cruz member of the Senate Judiciary Committee who was present for the idiotic Democratic assault on Attorney General William bar senator Cruz thanks so much for stopping by really appreciate it man it's always good to be with you so let's start with this what was your take on the Democrats attempts to somehow turn dross into gold with this Muller letter so apparently Muller wrote for those who don't know Muller apparently wrote a letter to William bar after William Barnes initial summary saying that he was angry that bars summary didn't include a synopsis of all of his various evidence and bar basically responded by then releasing 448 pages of the Mullen report the entire Mullen report and Democrats are calling this obstruction or they're accusing Bauer of lying what exactly are they doing here senator yeah they're simply a moding their rage for Donald Trump it you know what was striking number one what was striking is Sherlock Holmes his famous dog that didn't bark what they didn't talk about virtually at all was Russia was the alleged Russia collusion for two and a half years they've been going on non-stop about their allegations of Russian collusion and and and of course the Special Counsel concluded unequivocally that the evidence did not support criminal charges on Russian collusion so that so their whole central talking point an attack on the president was was refuted by the special counsels report so instead what they talked about most of the time the Democrats devoted their attacks to attacking bill bar because at the time that Barr released his four-page summary of the the conclusions of the Special Counsel report Bob Muller asked that that that bar also release the 19 page summary that that Muller had written or didn't release it at the time and steady released it three weeks later with the entire report 448 pages and so the Democrats are going on and on pulling their hair out by suggesting essentially that bar is hiding this but he released the damn thing he released every page of the 19 pages you can read every word of it it's public the Democrat their hand so they're literally like holding it up saying you're hiding this from me they're holding the full report I mean it even for Senate Democrats on judiciary it was a level of asinine partisanship that really exceeds where they normally are and one of the things that I found so hilarious about this is that there seems to be the sense among Democrats and apparently the Democrats who work for The Washington Post that attorney general bar did something deeply wrong in releasing his four-page synopsis of the charges themselves and Muller's letter really was about Muller it seems to me being angry that that bar wasn't going to include all of his emotive about President Trump in the mobile report itself the mobile report itself does not include evidence of criminal behavior which is why bar is not pushing for criminal charges why Muller didn't recommend criminal charges presumably and yet Muller was apparently angry that bars initial synopsis didn't actually include within it all of the embarrassing material about Trump that was not actually criminal well last I checked it's not the job of an Attorney General and you've served as Solicitor General and in Texas it's not the job of an attorney general to release information that smears somebody who's not being prosecuted last I checked it look that's absolutely right but but more fundamentally you know most of the breasts list coverage and in the the partisan quotes that are coming out from Democrats and and Democratic mouthpieces in the media are suggesting that Barr somehow hid something right every single page of the 19 pages Muller asked to be released has been released it's public you can read it's not what Barbara wrote what Bob Muller wrote you can read those 19 pages and not just the 19 page summary you can read the entire report and what Barr made the decision to do is he said look I don't want to release this thing piecemeal oh I don't want to release the 19 page summary and then three weeks later release the rest of the report I just going to release the whole damn thing and and so what is their allegation it doesn't make any sense as I told the general bar at the hearing I said he they're accusing you somehow hiding or suppressing this why I got to say you were hiding and suppressing it you're really lousy at it because you're released the damn thing and it's public and anyone who wants to can read it I think my favorite contention today senator Cruz came from Senator Kamala Harris who is now contending that apparently bar before he decided whether or not to prosecute president Trump had to go through all of the evidence that Miller had already gone through is necessary for Bart to not look at the 448 page Muller report and then take that at face value despite the fact that Muller was so relied upon by Democrats that they were printing his face on votive candles now apparently Barr was supposed to go through the hundreds of thousands of pages of documentation that the entire Mulder team had already spent twenty five million dollars compiling and going through and then find what I guess the needle in the haystack that was going to prove that Trump actually should be charged with obstruction of justice I mean you've worked in the law for your entire life effectively speaking have you ever heard of a situation where an attorney general goes back through the underlying material that his own people are not recommending prosecution over yeah of course not but it but it's even more fundamentally idiotic than that you know Senate Democrats seem to believe that nobody has any memory of anything they said yesterday or the day before and so they live in the moment of whatever partisan attack gets their left-wing base energized so I was sitting in the judiciary hearing room when when we had bill bars confirmation hearing and I recall Senator Harris and just about every other Democrat screaming at him then don't you dare second-guess Bob Muller don't you dare you need to give Bob Muller the discretion to investigate this don't interfere with his investigation and they were going on and on and now suddenly she said why didn't you interfere with Bob Butler's investigation what do you mean you actually let him come to factual conclusions I mean it was and okay the moment that it truly became through the looking-glass was when she said rod Rosenstein did you get an ethics opinion or whether he could participate in the charging decision just a few weeks ago they were heralding rod Rose Jane and Bob Muller as like Mother Teresa and Pope John Paul if they thought those those were people that were praiseworthy yeah I mean it's rod Rosenstein was a US Attorney under Barack Obama and virtually every one of the Democrats voted to confirm and now she's saying she was implying it was unethical for Rosenstein to be to have any conclusion on this at the end of the day it's real simple been that this is partisan vitriol they hate Trump and it doesn't matter what the facts are they don't care what the facts are they don't care what the evidence is they just hate him and and and and their party is that rage and hatred trumps everything else to coin a phrase well watching former attorney General Eric Holder who described himself as Barack Obama's wingman criticizing William Barr who has just released a four hundred fifty page report that does not show President Trump and a fantastic light is pretty rich and watching Democrats who were perfectly happy to watch James Comey let Hillary Clinton off the hook without having Loretta Lynch examined the underlying evidence call for a reexamination of the underlying evidence is also pretty wretched senator Cruz I know that obviously been watching the developments in Venezuela what is your take on those developments and why is it that so many Democrats are having a hard time saying the Maduro needs to go well look this this is a incredibly pivotal time potentially in Venezuela we could be seeing within hours or days a a transition to a legitimate constitutional government that the fall of the socialist dictator Nicolas Maduro who who is producing misery and and suffering and has destroyed the the Venezuelan economy we're right now seeing protests we're seeing people standing up for democracy standing up for freedom that's a powerful moment now it it also has the potential to become very very violent as Maduro relies upon cuban thugs and and and and and russian Russian thugs to potentially commit horrific acts of violence and and what's really pivotal right now they're about 3,000 generals in the Venezuelan military those 3,000 generals that they have a decision to make right now who are they going to side with are they going to side with Maduro who is an illegitimate dictator who has no legal claim on authority who is a despot and who is on his way out or are they going to side with the people of Venezuela with constitutional government with Juan guado who is the legitimate leader selected by the democratically elected institutions in Venezuela and are they going to side with the people of Venezuela and from a u.s. perspective I think we need to see the maximum number of both carrots and sticks carrots to encourage those generals stand on the right side of history but also sticks if you stand with a dictator against the the Venezuelan people you personally will face sanctions if you're a general your family will face sanctions that decision will haunt you for generations to come well senator Cruz thank you so much for your time really appreciate you stopping by giving us an update I cannot for the life of me understand how you spend every day in the company of the people you have to listen to so thank you for making that sacrifice on our behalf because my god dude that's that's pretty wild stuff thank you sir well it's a pleasure to be in the arena and I will tell you as much transparency as we've seen from Billboard it's been extraordinary transparency releasing 448 pages of the Mullah report I also urged Barr to show the same transparency and making public the degree to which the Obama administration spied on president Trump spied on his political opponents politicized the Department of Justice politicized the FBI and an abused law enforcement of national security for political and partisan purposes I hope we see exactly this much transparency there and I'm hopeful that we will well I appreciate it senator Cruz and I'm sure that we will get to the bottom of all of this thanks for your time

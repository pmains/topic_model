to search I want to talk to you about the student loan handouts seems like the Supreme Court is ready to reject the 400 billion giveaway but what happens in the unlikely event that Biden does get his student loan passed what happens to the economy do you think I either want one for you know the committee for responsible federal budget said it would meaningfully increase inflation and that's a left of center organization so for sure you'll have inflationary impact you send a message to everybody in this country that borrows money for student loans you're not going to have to pay it back and you know and you'd have College tuition rates will go up because no college is going to say well gosh if they're not going to have to pay back their loans why should we have to worry about you know our tuition rate so I think you're going to see a lot of impacts that would hurt students people in this country but maybe most importantly Stuart it's the the mayor the Americans in this country are going to be paying for this the hard-working taxpayers who didn't get a chance to go to college or perhaps paid back their loans are now going to be subsidizing and underwriting This president's trillion dollar giveaway uh to people in this country if he gets gets away with forgiving all the student debt I mean it's a this isn't a an astounding thing it really is I'm sure you saw this but outside the Supreme Court as The Supremes were looking at the student loan we had Andy Weingarten in an extraordinary I call it extraordinary rant uh I'm sure you saw it what do you think of that what do you think parents think when they see the teeth the head of the teachers union behaving like that I think it's an example of just uh you know liberalism run amok I mean the these are people who really believe you grow and expand government and you you know and then just you'd bestow benefits on people across our society uh in hopes that they'll vote for you I mean clearly that was the objective with this Biden's Standalone giveaway did it right before the election it was clearly a political stunt and uh and so his constituency groups are rallying around it but again talk about the hard-working Americans all those people across the country who are going to be paying for this in the form of adding more to our debt and uh and and then the the message it sends I mean we're a country that's built around the principles twin principles of personal freedom coupled with individual responsibility exactly the message that you aren't going to have to pay back the the money that you borrow I think is a tremendous shock waves uh in a ripple effect into the future in our economy I hope the times are changing Senator Johnson thank you very much for being with us sir always appreciate it thanks Stuart yeah

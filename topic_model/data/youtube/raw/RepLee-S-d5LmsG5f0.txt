joining me now from Nationals Park congresswoman barbara Lee Democrat from California and Republican congressman Lee Zeldin of New York it's great to see you there and I imagine it's a extremely emotional atmosphere there Congress and Zeldin tonight we watched the moment of silence we saw David Bailey the Capitol police officer throughout that first pitch what's it been like absolutely and it's bringing everyone together you know singing the national anthem seeing David Bailey come out for the first pitch there's a tremendous amount of pride for our country we were all tested yesterday morning in a ways where we're tested every day but we're all coming together here for our national pastime unfortunately the Dems are beating up on the Republicans pretty badly on the field that's okay Lee weird word I think it ends up 72 as you mentioned not good knocking it off it's congresswoman you know I if what it was it was such an awful scene yesterday and so shocking I think to everyone I just wonder how you're processing it tonight and whether you feel like since you started this and you've been doing this for a little bit now do you feel more threatened personally than say you used to well first let me just say everyone of course is on an emotional roller coaster right now our thoughts and prayers are with Steve our what with all of those who were hurt in this horrific tragedy yesterday and also coming from the Bay Area I have to really again remember and pray for those who lost their lives in San Francisco the truth and so you know it's a moment to reflect if the moment to really remember and who we are as a country and that in fact we can have different points but hate speech and actions that lead to violence are just unacceptable violence should not be an option we should engage in our debate in a way that's healthy and stay true to who we are but also understand that we must stay unified as a country and really make sure our accuracy work you know that that line to me is really important right because you know people talk about the tone and they talk about but it's a level part of what makes country great and has from it's very beginning which some of the most brutal rhetorical political fights from John Adams and Jefferson on was a big deal we mix it up in the public sphere in America and and in Congress and Zeldin how do you how do you sort of understand holding on to that and and at the same time looking for sort of a vision of civic purpose and unity that that isn't quite as toxic as the one we have now well I think disagreement is beautiful and it should be encouraged it's part of what makes our nation the greatest nation in the world is when we debate ideas and we have a better solution because of it but there is a way to disagree and so Barbara Lee and I might disagree on issues we might be able to debate what we think is the way to solve problems facing our constituents and our country but but I would be my heart would be torn if something happened to Barbra Lee we're all a family here and you know there are liberal Democrats conservative Republicans and many people in between but we care about each other we talk to each other we know about each other's families that we know are each other's passions on the issues but not the answer is to advocate for violence against someone to tolerate violence against someone or to actually obviously as we saw yesterday morning carry it out forever I want to just take a moment we got to see David Bailey throughout the pictures and surprise he was in crutches he you know crystal Bryan David Bailey who are the two Capitol Police officers who happen to be there who put themselves in a line of fire I just think about the the scope of the even greater catastrophe that those two saved all of us from not just in terms of people being killed but but the just what could have happened if not for them it we all owe them a tremendous debt of gratitude the Capitol Police Officers go way beyond the call of duty and we have to salute their heroic efforts sake protect us each and every single day I have personal experience with the Capitol Police and it's really an unbelievable experience because you see each and every day these men and women living up to their oath of office living up to their duty and the courage they display hopefully we can learn a lesson from their bravery and their courage and be better members and be more courageous members and really understand that we have to do our job based on the oath of office as we took in a way that honors our democracy yeah David Bailey Christopher Kriner we all of us owe you but just an unbelievable debt of gratitude congressman Lee Zeldin and congresswoman barbara Lee or as I like to call them barbara Lee Zeldin thank you very much for joining me together enjoy the rest of the game

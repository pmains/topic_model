what was it about the the navy seals that got you well like anybody there's a variety of ways to serve right so so why choose the the seal teams um i choose the the hardest the hardest training there is and precisely because it's the hardest is actually is what attracts a lot of guys to it and because you will be asked to do the hardest things to be in the most extreme combat that's what we're looking for because there's a variety of ways to defend your country obviously that's that's the first step why you have to want to do that but then you have to decide how you want to do it and it's that sense of adventure that sense of elitism and that that that extreme sense of well desire to go to combat that's that's the hard truth that a lot of people don't i think understand is there someone who sticks out in your mind as kind of that that ultimate service is there someone who inspired you to join what's your story yeah but it's slightly embarrassing but uh you know there's a lot of books on seals these days and um uh but one of the first was a series by dick marcenko he was the founder of seal team six he's well known in the seal teams and i picked his books up when i was um got a young teenager maybe even younger and uh i was hooked never never turned back it's like you know everybody has a childhood dream and usually those dreams get let go of but not in my case what was it about the books what what's what stuck out i think everything i told you about earlier i mean the the the sense of camaraderie the sense of adventure the the the just the grittiness of of the teams i think is um is it's it's it just captures you uh especially as a young boy so you know the question is is it does it still capture you as a young man and for almost all of us in the teams the answer is yes well again thank you for your service and i hope nobody ever forgets appreciate that we got it

the distinguished gentleman joining us today serve on the house permanent select committee on intelligence Congressman Mike Turner of Ohio currently serves as the ranking member of the intelligence committee and has done an excellent job since assuming this role and highlighting the slew of National Security issues that confront us as a nation advocating for a strong and aggressive military and intelligence posture to protect our future he served this country in Congress since 2002 including stints leading the armed services tactical air and land forces as well as the Strategic forces subcommittee while serving on the house intelligence committee since 2015. he sought to move these conversations with the American public Beyond scif and we welcome here to Heritage today as part of this series for an excellent discussion be joined by his colleague from Mississippi Congressman Trent Kelly who serves on both the house intelligence and armed services committees Congressman Kelly has spent 36 years in the Mississippi Army National Guard as a combat engineer where he currently serves as a major general he's a consistent voice for our men and women in uniform and those serving in the shadows within our intelligence community gentlemen welcome here to Heritage and for those of you here live in the auditorium please join me in welcoming Congressman Mike Turner [Applause] welcome thank you thank you Dr Roberts and thank you for having us here at Heritage and I want to thank Heritage and your team for being able to support this effort um the number one thing that I've heard from our members of the intelligence committee on both sides of the aisle is a real need for the intelligence committee to return its focus back to National Security all of the members are ready to uh to look at the portfolio of the intelligence committee and looking at our adversaries what are our threats what are the risks that we're facing and make certain that the intelligence Community is focused on those and that the information is getting to the intelligence committee beyond that we also look to change our Focus from not just National Security but a function of we don't just want to be a bunch of people in the basement at the Capitol who get told important and and uh you know critical aspects of our national security uh We've formulated a mission statement that looks at how we can marry intelligence to policy making and decision making we want to make certain that the information we receive as actionable intelligence can come into actual action on the part of of Congress this series that we've been calling beyond the skiff and we greatly appreciate Heritage hosting us is an effort to reach out to the Think Tank Community the policy community and the academic community and to entertain their issues and thoughts as to what we should be focusing on as we look to the future of our adversaries now this issue as Dr Roberts was saying is very important China Russia Iran others because we're an open Society look to ways in which they can undertake nefarious activities or malign activities to try to either destabilize or to influence the American politic as Dr Roberts was saying it's so important though that in looking for these nefarious and malign activities that we also do not at the same time stumble in ways in which we could suppress our own dialogue or our own debate on important issues Trent Kelly is uniquely positioned in the armed services committee and the intelligence Committee of having both his feet in both areas that gives him a really solid basis we have a look at the issues of National Security and what should the intelligence committee be doing and of course from his army experience as a major general he brings unique expertise back to both committees in addition to just the overlap we appreciate this this forum today we look forward to the experts and hearing what their recommendations are and of course the leadership from Trent Kelly I appreciate your conducting this today thank you [Applause] I want to thank Dr Roberts and the Heritage Foundation for hosting this beyond the skiff platform we're going to discuss a platform to discusses uh these importance and sensitive issues and we're going to allow folks experts to get involved on a policy level we can't always do in a skiff outside of the view of the American public I want to also want to thank ranking member Turner for his introduction and his leadership on the house intelligence committee we wouldn't be here today without the leadership of Mike Turner he has chosen to get out of the shadows and to get into the public so that we can make policy making decisions that help us forward our intelligence Community while protecting America and getting the ideas of our variety of Scholars which are not always in the skiff with us as ranking members said the committee is hosting a series of these events to expand our engagement with National Security Experts and to provide us a unique opportunity to have public discussions on key National Security challenges which are not always outside in the public to hear today's panel is focused on a threat of foreign malign influence activities and how the U.S government especially the intelligence Community should respond this is one of the committee's oversight priorities going into the next cycle we're particularly focused on ensuring that government actions in this space do not restrict prevent or disrupt the First Amendment rights of American citizens I really want to thank our panel we have a group of experts I think that is very very good so we look forward to questions and to a forum which uh gives us some good ideas going forward with that I thank you foreign here today with significant National Security experience I want to get into the meat of the issues as quickly as possible so I'm just going to provide a couple of highlights of each of the person's background but they are all impressive with diverse experiences and their Heritage webpage includes their full bios Brian Kavanaugh is a senior vice president at American global strategies he has served in several positions at the Department of Homeland Security and spent three years at the National Security Council Craig Singleton is a senior fellow and the China program deputy director at the foundation for defense of democracy 10 plus years of government National Security experience primarily in positions focused on East Asia Victoria coats serves as the senior research fellow at the Margaret Thatcher Center For Freedom At Heritage she has served as a senior advisor for several presidential candidates and has held several key positions at the National Security Council and the department of energy she is also has a PHD in art history and is an expert in Italian Renaissance art Dustin Carmack is a research fellow with Heritage focused on Cyber intelligence technology and border security Dustin has worked in senior positions on Capitol Hill and his chief of staff to the Director of National Intelligence thank you all for participating today I'm going to begin with several questions to the panel and then we will open it up to the audience for questions so the first question and I guess you guys can answer it and I'd like for each of you to take a shot at if it's in your area of expertise how have I adversaries intentions and capabilities changed as it relates to conducting overt and covert influence operations and within the range of adversary foreign malign influence activity what do you see is that current top threat well I think first and foremost as the world has become smaller in the digital era there's a lot more information available to our adversaries so they have more at their fingertips they're able to get into the issues that are divisive in our country and continue to exploit that um great no I would say that the the Chinese are keenly focused on something they call cognitive Warfare and that's using public opinion as well as psychological and legal means to achieve their their strategic objectives and so so much of that relies on um I think really taking advantage of all the cleavages that exist in our Regulatory and legal structures such that much of what they're doing isn't technically illegal and so they're able to do this because they prioritize it it's something that the United States really hasn't done and they also get to do it because they've named it they've sort of framed it from a Chinese perspective they're operating with a Unity of effort that obviously we're not and it's just an area where I think it's great that we're starting this conversation now uh but it's long overdue thank you well and thank you Congressman Kelly and Congressman Turner Kevin uh for for hosting us here today on this critical topic one of the things that's uh been fascinating to me is how information has gotten into the National Security space which is not some conversation we would have been having 10 years ago but for in terms of Iran which I'm sort of focused on this week I mean we had it on display last night with the Iranian president being having a long-form interview on 60 Minutes in which he was allowed to give all of his talking points to millions and millions of Americans and one of the things he did that I thought was the most pernicious and I had to think about this for a while because there was a lot of tenacity going on uh was when asked about the Holocaust uh he didn't come right out and say there was no Holocaust he came out and said well you know I guess there is some evidence that it might have happened so you know why would the Jewish Community or the Israelis be so against a real investigation into this I mean and it's it's really the most maligned thing you can imagine he's suggesting he's the reasonable one and those who actually do think that there was a holocaust cost are somehow unreasonable and against research that's the kind of messaging we are allowing because of our first amendment to be broadcast on our Airwaves and figuring out how we address that I think is is critical so I really appreciate your including us in the conversation thank you yeah thank you Congressman uh you know all of our panelists have brought up things that I sincerely agree with um one of the things I think where if you look at what China is doing in a space is operating in that that data environment in which they have so many touch points and this goes everything from genetic DNA data to think about and this has happened over the course of time there was the Equifax hack you know several years ago where it stole immense amounts of data of everyday Americans you saw the OPM hack where essentially you took tons of government employees data and you look at these different hacks and the different uh it's obviously just buy on the open market too and that's the other wild thing is data from Americans just being purchased on the open market which I can tell you for a fact they do not have a good intentions for of this data in the long term and so where we see the Chinese are able to do things that maybe the Russians and others weren't able to do over the course of time is use all the levers of their powers then that is heavily in the economic space and more now in the near term in technology and Military uh to quickly catch up with the United States and use these types of vowels to not only affect everyday American speech but they are highly impacting third world and developing countries that we are not currently combating in any any substance of fashion yeah and I think that's a difficult thing in a democracy or a republic you have the opportunity to to to have the First Amendment and to speak your mind but you have people taking advantage of that I I in Russia right now they're not getting both sides of the story they're only getting the Russian what Putin tells them is going on in the world so while protecting our first amendment rides and also protecting our national security and you mentioned China Russia and Iran as three of the primary people I think we just need to highlight that I think sometimes the American people don't realize the real threats we see from those three countries are there are there any other countries that you would name in addition to those three well North Korea but they're less they're not as good at it uh for various reasons but those those are the big three I guess Venezuela sometimes plays in that space Cuba uh around the axis of Evil okay thank you and how is the U.S government currently postured to counter these threats and while you're talking about that uh a lot of attention has been given to interference with elections and you can also talk about if you see any foreign malign influence as a broader threat beyond the election Cycles but also elections but I think thank you Congressman the the the key here is there is a distinction between interference and influence and and it is a very gray line that separates the two of them I think one of the things you'll hear the panelists and clear myself talk about is thresholds we have adversaries that understand our thresholds for rule of law and they operate just below the threshold uh in terms of the policy that exists out there and how we use that and execute on that uh in the election space executive order I think 13848 from 2018 uh defined for the first time what election interference is and provided some categories and tools for the the government to use to go after not only foreign States but individuals that are operating in this space to covert uh influence in that in that area I would argue right now there's a lack of unity of effort and identifying it that's the most important thing we can take away from this is educating the American people as to what we're seeing we inside the skiff space are seeing massive amounts of information how it's being manipulated how it's being used but there's no one out with credibility sharing that message and I'm going to use an anecdotal story real quick in 2020 in October of 2020 uh Iran was doing a pretty well thought out um a little bit JV in its approach but they bought and used U.S citizen data to formulate this campaign to misinform folks and on the basis of proud boys um I think the quickest turnaround ever I've seen from the intelligence Community go from understanding what they were seeing speaking to the American people in less than 96 hours we went from seeing something in extremely classified channels to having the director of the FBI the director of the odni and the director of sisa in front of the American people and having a conversation about what it is they saw and and that lends itself to the transparency and credibility that this this issue needs to be confronted with yeah I would just say I think there are silos of Excellence throughout the US government looking at this but often they aren't communicating with one another and that they're in many cases there's maybe too much information to Brian's point but not enough analytic Acumen to say how do we take this and make this actionable how can we take something that we think is actually classified but isn't and share that with the right stakeholders is it Academia is it the media the General Public we haven't built that muscle memory and we've sort of lost it because we used to do this routinely during the Cold War uh particularly during the uh the Reagan Administration we were constantly thinking about Russian active measures and I think one of the challenges we sort of face now in this multi-polar environment is that the tactics used by each of the adversaries is sort of very different um you know I love reading and learning from Victoria because she'll explain to me how the Russians are shock and awe um and I think the Chinese it's it's sort of like Brian mentioned low and slow just below the threshold of illegality just below what they know where our intelligence resources and capabilities are and so that doesn't say that it's low intensity it's very very high intensity but there's a deliberate focus on slowly shaping our behaviors and how we think about these issues and I think the biggest challenge that we're sort of facing is actually too much too many targets too much information and not enough analysis uh the Acumen there and not not enough platforms to share it with the right stakeholders and this is where we're sort of falling short thank you well and I think in terms Congressman your question about how postured to deal with this it the answer is extremely poorly and I think that the answer is going to have to come from what probably would be an NSC initiative this is what the NSC actually should be doing uh is both reviewing classification process which I understand uh that they are actually getting after that piece but then also how we spread our own information and we have you know an extraordinary amount of of money uh coming out of the Congress for the USA uh Global media agency which encompasses Voice of America the radio free franchises the Middle East broadcast networks of which I was the proud president for six weeks at the end of the administration so I learned all about it enough to be dangerous but we have all these things we had the global engagement Center at the Geck it's not clear I've been not clear they're not doing it they're not coordinating together there is no Central Authority uh on on how that information is disseminated and in the case of something like Middle East broadcast we didn't even we had no English presence and we were prohibited from broadcasting into the United States uh by our own by our own Charters so the American taxpayers who are generously funding that thing to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars a year have no way to evaluate the product or see if that's information they might find interesting uh and so that reforming that uh through the Congress I think is enormously important and work we can get after now I thought Craig Craig's uh comment that there are silos of excellence in the government was spot on the problem is you know when I I came from OD and I where the the goal is to actually break down those silos but this shows you exactly where that debate is because uh the National Defense authorization actually mandated a center to be uh traded several years ago to tackle just that and I was you know a front row participant watching that debate play out which I think is still going on in Congress uh just uh to this day about what that will look like because at the end of the day the Congress has in a coming as a former Hill rat into the executive Congress has done a very good job of piling a lot of money to understand and study and resource issues what I don't think has happened though is ever a channeling of actually using the resources that we have in place and this goes to the executive side as well of actually applying them properly and breaking down those silos and so you know sadly I think some of them still exist because there are there's a question of the definitions in which they exist that that question that Brian and others brought up of influence versus uh interference is a key one and this was brought up uh you know the National Intelligence office for cyber officer for cyber uh brought this up in a dissent you know in the community which descent should be encouraged actually you know it's not a bad thing I think we've kind of gotten out of this practice um which what I saw from an analytics side and the community of saying okay it's okay for a different agency to disagree and that's important for members and stakeholders to understand why and so where we go in the space I think it's going to you know sadly have to drive a lot of this into action as a member is really putting a some Spotlight on how this is happening agency by agency and making sure that analytic products represent the you know the things that they need to do and see to authorize programs properly and just real quickly if one of you guys will take a stab at this what is the difference between interference and influence if you can take a stab at that you know most Americans are sitting here and we're talking to these words but Define if someone will take a stab at defining that place I'm gonna look at Craig on that no way yeah right this was a challenging one even in real time I think on our end when going back to I was running election security for the NSC for three years and looking at all the information out there and understanding what is acceptable and for from where I'm sitting and the way we interpret that as overtly acknowledging and owning that that's that idea that concept was yours that that's free speech there's ownership of that idea there's ownership of what you're saying it's when it becomes the covert you're trying to influence through means that are not you example a community uh accepting funding for development from China and then that Community being very Pro one position they're being pro that position because we know in the intelligence Community there's being coercion influence there to have that opinion but the American public who's seeing that in their local community doesn't realize there's an outside hand tipping the scale that that's where we got to the interference piece I think that was a very good stab at it so thank you uh there have been numerous missteps such as the creation of the DHS disinformation governments board and allegations of FBI officials pushing a narrative that the 100 Hunter Biden laptop story was Russian disinformation situation like these have led to a credibility issues for our government going forward what does the government need to do to reset and develop an appropriate foreign malign influence strategy I would chime in I think one of the biggest issues we're facing is a transparency challenge um particularly on the China front uh everything that we're seeing is is happening in plain sight but our our legal structure and U.S code hasn't necessarily caught up with the fact that the Chinese for example don't need to and for example recipients of Chinese money particularly in the University space don't need to disclose that they received it if you're operating as a media platform for the Chinese Communist party there it isn't technically legal that you have to sort of disclose publicly where your funding streams are coming from or what your editorial intent is and so I think as we start to sit back and ask ourselves even in the lobbying space here in Washington DC plenty of very very powerful Chinese firms like Huawei and 10 cent and bite dance have some of the best lobbyists on pastry including former IC officials on their payroll should that be allowed and so I think part of the challenge becomes through a force of transparency there are many I would say U.S or American enablers here helping on the formal line space and until that there's some risk to their operations and to their reputation by forced disclosure of their activities I think that the the IC in the U.S public in general is sort of ill-served or just to sort of uh piggyback off of that I think the transparency issue is is critical both for exposing what they're doing and for making what we might be doing legitimate and you know there is there is the temptation to say well we're telling the truth so our message will get out there we know that's not true that that the old adage is that the LIE goes around the world twice well the truth is still putting on its shoes so I think coordinating our efforts to push narratives which have the added advantage of being true but doing so in a radically transparent way uh and and so I think that that is another step we could take uh to to counter this um I'll this is going to be one of my many white whale issues but um this kind of gets into that accountability piece you know of where you know Americans having a very keen View and a respectful View and an insightful view of the information that they are receiving that's direct without analytical commentary um by the the proper you know Orchestra of government that you know needs to be telling the information and and we saw that in the 2020 cycle um and this this a lot of times you know my old boss used to say this the dni Radcliffe you know a lot of times we had members just as much politicizing intelligence at times than then you know so essentially you know Craig mentioned like some people helping Drive some of these things is is really where our foreign adversaries want us to go is actually kind of causing us to be at our throat and so I think it's also behooves members and members of the executive branch to be very keenly aware of their actions and this goes on the executive side what grinds my access is leaks selective leaks of information um and this goes sometimes it's good intentions even by somebody over at the Department of Defense or the intelligence Community says hey here's this ex-reporter I'm going to leak this little nugget to without any kind of you know ability to actually call what that is or not and so when we're talking about downgrading intelligence information in a fashion that can be delivered to the American people in a timely manner that people feel like is articulate versus you know X Source said this and it's one Cherry Picked piece of intelligence that drives this narrative that I want to drive because these all play into a broader theme of what our adversaries want us to do and so I you know when it comes to Prosecuting leakers and and um and those that abuse uh classified information it is key on my list I agree as a former district attorney I assure you I agree with that do you have any comments I just think uh for the U.S government officials that are going to have to carry that water when the time comes credibility is the most important thing you have to trade on and too often today we're seeing people take cheap shots or put themselves in compromising positions that jeopardize their credibility when it comes time to have to carry that message to the American people yeah and I I think one of the most important things for me here is just highlighting uh that on a government level China is using malign influence here in the United States whether it's through our universities or businesses or buying a Farmland all the things that they're doing and I think for so long America turned a blind eye uh to to all that just uh refusing and I think the fact that our citizens now are starting to see some of this maybe they'll ask the question where is this money coming from what do they want and so I think that's very important all the things that y'all brought up looking into the 2023 and Beyond what are your recommendations for executive and or legislative branch action particularly as it relates to roles and activities of the intelligence community and the appropriate civil liberty liberty Guardians guard rail sorry I think there's two that popped to mind for me first is uh Pharaoh reform um I think it you can think of it almost as a defensive capability should former senior executive branch officials or intelligence officials be able to you know clock out on Friday from the US government and then go on Monday and go work for Huawei Huawei is a great example because some of their most senior most officials uh were very very senior U.S government officials uh back in the back in the day and you start to see this revolving door and so I think thinking through disclosure and thinking through constraints on the ability which could be done through US code to inhibit I think that flow of expertise and talent and at least putting a a real five to ten year gap on it will really inhibit the ability of these Chinese companies to operate and to I think to leverage that former USG experience and I I think at least from the IC Side open source intelligence has always been treated as the black sheep of the IC right we're here to collect secrets and there right but increasingly so much of what we're talking about here is occurring in the open source space and we are not only not collecting on it we aren't analyzing it and we aren't pushing out that knowledge and so when we talk about what Russia is doing on Facebook or what the Chinese are doing in the media space it that's overt it's open source we should have teams of people being able to look at it analyze it understanding it and then pushing just their analysis which is wholly unclassified to the right stakeholders so that people can see as Dustin mentioned should I believe what I'm seeing here is this a legitimate source and how is the adversary attempting to shape My Views because at least from the Chinese perspective they call it cognitive Warfare guys Warfare they want the battlefield is our minds it's not so much they want to influence what we think it's how we think and how we act and because they use the word Warfare we need to take it very seriously I think that's such a great Point interference and influence both by definition are over they are open source in many cases and I do think uh we need to take that from a second tier to a first tier priority for our I see anyone I would just uh again piggybacking off of Craig stealing all of his good good ideas uh this is a little bit of a sidebar but but in terms of what the Chinese are weaponizing I mean it's everything from Tick Tock to your doorbell uh so I think we need a very thorough review how all that works but one area I would particularly recommend for for Congressional oversight is the gaming space they are using uh you know online gaming which is not I learned just playing solitary anymore uh it the whole new world out there but they're using that to train people to train people's minds to get you to work work through their war games so they can see how different people react and there's going to be a security aspect to that as well that is significant and I think will have the information and influence piece built into it so somewhere else I think we're going to have to pay more attention than we might have thought as you're talking 2023 and Beyond I mean one of the things I would say is actually looking back at 2022 and stop the bleeding because uh recently passed legislation I mean and I know some members felt differently about it uh for some of its positive aspects but the chips plus science Act is a perfect example of something that we had an opportunity to do a lot of these types of guardrail type of discussions in fact Senator Rob Portman LED an entire investigation on the Confucius institutes and different Chinese meddling on college campuses around the country built a bipartisan bill out of it and then between you know shotgun to start between last year and this year doj scrapped the doj China initiative they said that his uh measure was essentially targeting uh you know for racist overtones uh Asian Pacific Americans which is false and essentially he was told that his bill was going to be part of the chips plus science act and then had to find out on the back end of it after the motion to proceed that it was gone and so we were missing opportunities and I think Congress and and you know depending if there's a change in Congress they should be revisiting these types of measures and putting those back on on President Biden's desk and saying you should sign this and I think just to piggyback on that oversight issue with um I think there's two reports due around elections one election infrastructure and the other one with influencing and what was the outcome of those efforts on elections when you look at the malign influence space who who's connecting the dots between the malign influence that's that we're experiencing day in and day out and how that pairs with their efforts on critical infrastructure how that pairs with efforts in local governments and and what are the connecting dots there that we're missing I feel like there's something in that space where whether there's a lack of connectivity between the different silos and the intelligence community that are working these issues that we're just not putting these together to understand the holistic picture very good and both Russia and China have carried out aggressive disinformation campaigns in the past two years Russia cyber actors targeted Ukraine with false messages that President zielinsky committed suicide or was planning to surrender there are also Russian campaigns focused on legitimizing the Russian presence in occupied Villages and we all remember the false Russian narrative that there were U.S bio weapon labs in Ukraine similarly China carried out disinformation campaigns in the aftermath of covid to include that the U.S military was responsible for releasing the virus uh give me some thoughts on those or other ways that they are using malign influence I might I might just start with with Ukraine that I think uh doing an after-action uh sort of Lessons Learned report on the entire Ukraine operation from basically the fall of Kabul through whatever uh the conclusion of the war is is is critically important because I think you know the Russians sold the broader narrative that they were 200 feet high and we're going to take care of in three days and and everybody believed it including you know our intelligence community so I think I think going back through that so we can start to trace those patterns and you know and the rhythm of it uh is is really is really going to be crucial to prevent it from happening again uh because because we we probably missed some pretty big opportunities early in the war to much more aggressively respond to Russia and and beat them which is what's happening now but it's kind of happening incrementally and almost accidentally uh but for The braver Bravery of the ukrainians so I think that that's a very important subject to get after for the Russians yeah and kind of along that line if you guys will talk about what the I say the intelligence Community can do to kind of combat these things or what should we be doing when these types of misinformation uh happen I think on the China side one of the key challenges and the covet example I think is a great one is you know the Chinese are very interested in stakeholder mapping and they they have a particular operation set in a series of objectives here for the United States that serve their both short-term and limited objectives so everything from as Dustin mentioned they were they were heavily involved in influencing uh the chips act and what came out of that you know so it limited in short term in a very specific policy option and objective but then they have these much longer term um sort of campaigns that they will staff for decades and their targets are varied they are everything from very influential individuals here in the United States to specific groups but also the general public targeting them both selectively and I think serially which is really important the challenge is the Chinese are also doing this overseas and I think as we talk about um you know the future of great power competition and what a strategic rivalry with China looks like we're also in essence winning hearts and Minds in other countries and the Chinese recognize this as well they're heavily engaged in the the media influence space and I think the challenge that we sort of face is you know who's whose responsibility within the IC is it to watch what's happening here in the United States and where does the line sort of uh come for what's happening abroad and it might require as much as we would like to have you know a centralized to notice like within the IC that's looking at all this it might require you know CIA analysts looking at the the foreign piece and then others from DHS and FBI and ncsc which is um totally not utilized to its maximum potential thinking about the domestic stakeholders and it does sort of require that framing I think one big thing that I sort of learned uh in my time in government is when Congress can direct funds that are fenced it's very hard for the bureaucracy to fight back as I think we sort of mentioned here so do you establish a you know a ciap or a CIA program that's specifically focused on this one thing um and where the money can't be reded to these other priorities and I think that sometimes you can weaponize the bureaucracy against the bureaucracy thank you I think that fencing is very important um I was going to touch one of the things we need to Grapple with we are behind the eight ball especially as it relates to China but also to Russia to an extent is our accommodation and understanding of the future use of artificial intelligence I mean that's happening playing out as you know well know and in the dod space of how you know Humpty Dumpty gets put together but separate to that you know arpa and DARPA are doing some interesting work on looking at this kind of information Warfare type of game and trying to understand quickly not only ways for us to see what our adversaries are working on and underlying capabilities technology wise to see that but also at the end of the day we also want to be able to make sure we get messages and people maybe have access to tools uh in China in Iran in these places that are going to be con over time going to be completely closed off to outside information I mean you see Russia and China further moving into the space of shutting down vpns shutting down access to outside confirmation and so these information flows is how they stay in existence and so how do we build those capabilities and Technologies to assist with that I mean SpaceX and starlink with what's happening in Ukraine has significantly helped the ability of Ukraine to push out messages of what was happening behind the scenes there or just staying in close communication from actual defense movement perspective so these type of Technologies and then how we grapple with them and also the ethics behind them because you know that when I was at OD and I we released you know kind of an ethics of artificial intelligence uh you know kind of framework that I think it was a good resource for people to think about but we're going to kind of apply these things when we're thinking about domestically make sure that they stay in line and inside those guard rails that we're comfortable with and just to get back on to the the prioritization of the IC on what are we doing with malign influence you have the center from line influence that that was supposed to be established and if there's a real challenge with establishing that have the leadership to come to Congress and tell us what the challenge is is there is there a different Authority that needs to be given it's just it's been multiple years it's not going anywhere signals to the American people it's not a priority well I can talk to you guys all day long this is great stuff uh we do want to open it up for questions from the audience so someone is going to have to help me with this uh as far as uh recognizing folks for questions think right there JP Hogan you raise all this and say it's technically legal what someone is doing but if the first civil liberty is religious freedom and a republic is for people are under their God before under their government anyone working with America should be respecting that principle so if China is here to be secular and socialist they don't have equal standing as that each citizen is supposed to be protected of that Liberty so I'm wondering where if you're saying things they're doing it legally um that's it does that give you something to work with as you're puzzling me on how it's being allowed is legal can um I mean in terms of you mean like what we what do we need to do to make that illegal well or I don't know how to stay brief so this um China's efforts would be more to be secular in here it would then raise the question are they being religious technically or if what they're doing is more trying to it's there should be the separation in there I know there's a history of people of like the religious separation was supposed to be we have faith and secular and they're side by side but I'm not sure that's the way it works if your rights come from your create Creator and your religious liberty so your free state is freedom in the judeo-christian so yeah I I think and you guys can kind of follow up on this but I think it's kind of like the difference between influence and and and uh um words going now but interference but it's also uh individuals have rights to say things whether that's on social media or any other platform but when it becomes a campaign and a government doing that or someone doing that that is influencing that then that becomes illegal and so many times it's very hard just like interference and influence are hard to determine which is which it's also hard to determine which is a campaign which is a campaign of war and which is just an individual's thoughts and uh we value uh First Amendment rights here in America and I can assure you in China and Russia we don't get the same opportunity they don't value the rights of their citizens to speak and if y'all can follow up if there's anything that kind of articulates that better it's certainly when we struggled with and I think when you look back at some of the examples that we've experienced in the last decade uh kind of drawing that line and where where can we go and what tools do we have I think it becomes a what authorities do we have and what levers are available to us to kind of pursue some of those as it's not this is definitely a gray space okay let's move to another question if we can uh I think right here actually Congressman I just had one quick point I wanted to make on that uh issue going off of something Dustin had said about uh starlink and and Elon Musk and all of that actually was very generously funded by U.S taxpayers through the department of energy so you can take a lot of credit for that and that capability to uh shoot Broadband access internet access from a satellite is new we developed that after Hurricane Harvey and Maria to be able to get internet access to remote areas and I do think under the rubric of the First Amendment we should make that a top priority because we're basically exporting free speech that's our brand and we could do it offensively so you could get it into you know closed countries like China and Iran to allow their citizenry to communicate we have this breaking out in Iran today they just shut down the internet again to prevent activists from communicating and we can also do it as a service to Partners and allies I could think of no greater thing we that we could do for say Latin America to help them develop uh than to say you know we're going to help you to have this capacity and we can also do it for Rural America so I think that's an area where we can have a very positive impact as I said completely consistent with our values and interests that will draw a very bright line between what we are doing and what these malign actors are doing yeah and this lady plays thank you so much for having us today and thank you for having conversations such as these my first question sort of relates to the International Community and your work with the International Community as a citizen of behind that's representative the embassy of Bahrain we've seen sort of domestically Iran's malign efforts and so I'm kind of curious if you could maybe shed more light on how Partnerships with the International Community kind of develop and sort of having these conversations where you share intelligence or looking at sort of a rubric of how certain communities or certain countries deal with International or malign efforts and then sort of taking them as maybe like an American example and the other being just a more uh simple one or maybe a more difficult one what does it look like within just just genuine Curiosity on like a domestic level within the international having these conversations about the International Community or malign interference on on the American citizen what's the way to sort of engage an American citizen who may not necessarily be within the political sphere about or letting them know about how these things occur and thank you [Music] take the last half of that question I'll defer the first half to one of my my colleagues but um the last half in education I think there's a lot of efforts made and a lot of it wasn't made to the average American during the 2018-2020 elections from my perspective we really focused our efforts with the state secretaries of State who handle elections at each of the different states and if you've seen and worked with one state you've seen him work with only one state so a lot of time we were doing classified briefings bringing them in and educating them and it's amazing with the takeaway from these were is oh really that that's what you're going to share with us it's it's actually really close to what you're seeing in real time so how did we break down that wall from 2018 to 2020 to have a more whole holistic conversation about what it is you're seeing in the malign influence space and how it applies to them so I think there's a lot of lessons learned there on the elections front that can be taken and applied to General mainstream line influence across a number of diversity of issues and it's really just identifying the right agency the right leadership to be that point person to carry the water and have credibility whether it's the FBI on issues whether it is the dni on other issues I think the dni is doing amazing stuff in the critical infrastructure space we're trying to highlight issues there so identifying who that is and I think that's a discussion that the the executive branch has not really kind of wrapped around and decided how they would do that I would just say on the perhaps maybe on the international organization space right I think that from at least from China's perspective like the the UN is an arena for great power competition for them and for for the Chinese Personnel is policy their goal is to transform um a lot of these International organizations into mouthpieces for China's foreign and defense policy and so they make strategically timed Investments they work in overtime to ensure that PRC Nationals assume key positions where you can shape the actual for example the UN Agenda and for all of the un's many many flaws what goes on to paper directs the UN program of work and you'll find for example China's belt and Road initiative spread throughout the broader UN Agenda and a portion of that has to do with disinformation and misinformation and so I think that there has to sort of be a broader recognition here in the United States that these International organizations are an arena in the malign influence space when it comes to messaging and it does require a far more concerted U.S effort to get our people into these positions to contest International Organization elections because we see time and time again particularly in the Chinese space that when there is a PRC National who's a at the head of these organizations they put forward Chinese propaganda and we have to be able and it's very difficult to counter it if we're not putting up U.S candidates to challenge them or it doesn't have to be a U.S candidate it can be a candidate from any country but maybe it shouldn't be from Russia maybe it shouldn't be from China maybe it shouldn't be from Iran when do you pick who's the best athlete and I think if we're thinking about shaping broader narratives around the world you do have to look at some of these organizations and sit back and say well are we really in the game and how are are we using our financial and Personnel Resources and I think you would see that we're not doing very well and we're actually not competing when we really I think could if we if we put our mind to it you might you might even have a candidate from Bahrain uh because I mean you all as you know very well on the front lines of the Iranian disinformation campaigns and taking the brunt of that and and we have not done a good job of reaching out and coordinating what would be very much what Craig talked about an open source program you know that this doesn't even have to be in the skip we could do this out of the skiff uh with our theme today and you know make sure we're communicating to you the patterns that we're seeing that what we're picking up here what we think might be being broadcast toward you and I mean and this is not isolated to Bahrain I mean we literally had our first conversation with the Israelis about this uh during the previous administration so this is something we need to get after much more holistically uh so and I think I think that could be a critical service the United States could provide and to chime in just on that too we have so much to learn from our foreign Partners who are on the receiving end of this propaganda themselves I would it would be an amazing bi-directional train transfer to say well what are you seeing in your media what are you seeing in your public dose the public domain in the public space there maybe that sounds very very similar to what another partner is countering um and trying to or sort of diffuse around the world even just that putting the two parties together can be incredibly useful but we the challenge of creating this policy in different silos and governments not talking about it is sort of counterproductive because I find that we're all doing it and it sort of fits and starts it's not needed and my question is that do you feel any uh backlash from American people given that the people who are on left they tend to buy a Chinese point of view on social media and the people who are on right especially pro-trumps they tend to buy Russian uh a point of view so if U.S government try to counter that uh do you feel that American people would have some backlash about this thanks well I I don't know that that you can make that kind of broad generality I mean I served in president Trump's Administration for four years and I think I'm pretty good at spotting Russian information uh and I I would defer to the congressmen but I also think there are a lot of of those on the left who are pretty skeptical of China so I think you can you can actually exploit that uh you know to come to a much broader more bipartisan uh consensus on on this kind of issue yeah I I think you know we don't have the same opportunities first of all we don't do this information uh we speak to the speak to the truth and they don't even allow us to tell the truth in their countries but but I would argue the American people are much smarter than the Chinese and the Russians give them credit for and I would say that there is some of this disinformation and there is influence and there there are other opportunities that they use but for the most part I think most of the time it comes down that it is disinformation but what you've got to do is just uh make sure that when we see a campaign that is successful I'll tell you for every 10 that they run nine are unsuccessful we've just got to make sure and in a bipartisan Manner and I can tell you uh four years ago when I was in Congress no one ever talked about China and using malign influence and all those things here in America everyone ignored the problem I can tell you in the last three years in a bipartisan way that we have uh continue to counter uh Chinese Milan influence and Russian Milan influence but it's important we have to win everyone they don't have to win any because we're not doing the same things in their countries and I'll just piggyback on that and I actually recommend a book uh but former Secretary of Defense Gates former CI director I wrote a great book called exercises of power uh it kind of does a case study of what goes well and what goes right or what goes well what can go wrong uh depending on the instruments of power of the government and he goes through kind of case studies historically especially a ton during his time in the 70s and 80s but talks about how we've kind of lost some of this kind of muscle memory of you know the us we have the U.S information agency essentially all this got rolled back into the state department and other things and then Victoria brought this up earlier we've not really had an effective in my opinion uh capability to go broadcast truthful message us about what America is doing what our adversaries are doing as well because if you look at where these you know especially the Iranians the Russians the Chinese you know we talk about it just right now on our domestic side but go look at the polling of some issues related to anywhere else in the world I mean if you go to South America or Africa the polling on what's happening in Ukraine would blow your mind and so because they are of a hyper effort because one you get more bang for your buck and these types of media markets but they can they can invest a lot of that and it pays off for them in the long run and then it works also uh tangentially with all their other economic Investments technology Investments mineral rights I mean you name it these different types of bureaus of uh you know that Craig mentioned where they're trying to get in these International bodies it plays into this longer very uh Insidious framework that we're not doing a very good job of combating and that's something I think we need to really tackle going forward that I think our government's kind of been studying it for a while now but again back to the book recommendation I thought Bob or Bob Gates did a really good job of rolling through some of our previous successes in this area so I think we had a question here [Music] uh sir I'm Benny organ coming from Romania so we are quite good in Russian and how the Russian is acting in that part and we saw pattern uh we call that stupid useful or useful stupids they are using the people's opinion that are just stacked in the old habits of communist habits and these feed them their messages in a way in the end that people are thinking that the Russian messages are exactly their opinion their biases how you plan to counteract that because we realize that on some point some people are just thinking that the Russian system is better because they are feeding with Russian messages online so how do your planning to contract that in Romania we choose all Saint offensive but we realize that even this system this way to counteract the rushing messages online is became more let's say not useful why because it doesn't matter at the end which is the truth because they help they use this awesome offensive in order to promote hey I told you this is wrong this is happening wrong so how would you plan to contract that yeah I think you can start with Ukraine uh you know uh the Russians had a malign information plan from the very get-go and we honored them on that we did classified stuff we started letting people know that they were going to attack from the very get-go uh we were telegraphing everything that was going to happen and so Russia is sitting here going we're not going to invade uh you know they're invading us and all those things and we showed the world that they were lying and they invaded exactly when we said they were going to invade and I think most of those countries I've been to Romania I've been to Bulgaria I I was just in Finland and Sweden and and Estonia and all those places and I can tell you people who live behind the Iron Curtain uh they know the Russian disinformation so we just have to tell them the truth we have to declassify things especially when they're campaign plans as quickly as possible and get them in the hands of those government because the people the government want to get it out to their people but it's so important that we out there this information every time that they do do it and we do it in a quick manner because the people who live behind the Iron Curtain know what kind of propaganda comes out of the Russian government and you guys may have a comment I completely agree and that's exactly where we've seen success on our side is when we've quickly gotten in front of it and it's then the next morning it's not a talking point in the national news it's oh yeah that's what that was great it's disinformation or it's it's a malign influence okay there's no story there and it's not even talked about so for every one of those examples I think you talked about there's nine for every ten there's nine that are unsuccessful a lot of them it's because of that Pro early proactive action that you don't the average American is even hearing about it because it's not newsworthy you're the only thing I'd add to that is to not underestimate the power of mockery uh and that that is certainly what both the Chinese and the Russians and to some extent the Iranians although they're a little less sensitive to it that they're the most is is literally being made fools of and in some of these more ham-handed efforts uh there's a particular Chinese Twitter feed I don't have enough time to mock it uh all day I'm not on Twitter all day Kevin uh but uh you know it it is possible to do that and that will will freeze them out faster than anything and if there's no more comments you know one of the things too uh we don't have time for another question I'm sorry uh we've got to wrap this thing up at two o'clock but we've got to get our businesses here engaged in America we've got to get the American people and the American Business to understand the threats and to identify those threats and be willing to because they have whole of government approaches in China and Russia they have one person and listen the greatness of America is that we have divisions uh in our politics and and it is also one of our weaknesses they uh in Russia and China they have one message we have multiple messages but that's good we value our freedom of speeches so we uh I think this is a good start what a great panel what great answers uh I kind of feel intimidated sitting up here with all these smart people who've uh spent some years but this has been a great opportunity but we've got to continue to do these things and we've got to educate the American people and people across the world about what is going on so thank you very much for your participation in the panel and all y'all online thank you all for watching too and with that I think that concludes the show

i'm chair my constituents just experienced the most expensive thanksgiving dinner in history a 16 pound turkey is up 23 percent costco pumpkin pie is up 17 percent a two pound bag of carrots is near is up nearly 50 percent let's also not forget the outrageous prices at the pump making it too expensive for many americans to drive home and celebrate thanksgiving with their families in the first place this inflation is not transitory as our witnesses finally acknowledged yesterday and it's not a high class problem despite what the biden administration will tell you that is a lie propagated by those who have never had to do mental math at the grocery store to make sure the amount in their cart does not exceed the cash in their wallet for democrat leaders paying 42 percent more at the pub probably isn't a problem when you're riding a government-funded high-speed rail in silicon valley more than 90 percent of my constituents reported the rising prices were impacting their household budgets inflation is destroying americans ability to save for retirement buy a home or build wealth this isn't a tax on the rich it's an enormous burden on working americans we must stop this reckless spending before it financially cripples our nation i yield back the balance of my time

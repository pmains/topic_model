hello i'm lee terry and i served as the representative of nebraska's second district from 1999 to 2015. while in office numerous mechanical problems at omaha's va hospital started occurring such as burst plumbing heating and cooling issues that combined with the closure of the surgery suites hindered the care of our veterans who received in omaha as the v.a built new hospitals elsewhere i knew we couldn't wait so i decided to look at other financing options in 2013 i along with the other congressional delegation began petitioning the secretary of the va to consider the idea of a public-private partnership to build a new medical treatment facility in omaha in 2014 the secretary agreed to the idea i'm thankful to omaha's philanthropic community for standing behind their veterans and supporting this idea ensuring quality health care for our veterans is one of the greatest honors we can give you

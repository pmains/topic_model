hi this is congresswoman jan schakowsky well the supreme court decision on women's reproductive rights is not surprising but it is unacceptable and i really appreciate that the president of the united states said this is not the final word he said that the congress needs to act but he also said you can act vote it is very important this issue will be on the ballot in in november women have had for nearly 70 years the right to abortion to access to abortion privacy rights that's what the supreme court had had ruled on and now they're saying essentially in the last two days that guns have more rights than women have in the united states this is an issue for all families as well the fact that we would have to anyone have to go to a politician to decide whether or not you're able to take care of your own health to make decisions about your family to have bodily autonomy is not american and we need to uh take the steps to do something about it so um i am very very much against this decision that i've called is one of a rogue court a court that has gone against the views of the vast majority of americans who think that roe v wade that access to abortion rights should not be overturned even people who themselves are not for abortion do not think it should be made illegal in the united states and left to politicians to make the decision so we will be mobilizing when i say we i think not only women but men all over this country will be mobilizing to say we will not go back

thank you Mr chairman and thank you to our Witnesses for your testimony today as a daughter of a Green Beret who served in Vietnam as a Navy pilot and married to a Navy pilot and the mother of now uh two midshipmen this is an issue that's super important to me uh and it's just a great honor to be in the room today with you it's fitting that our first hearing is about the threat that's facing our country from the Chinese Communist Party under JiJi ping China seen a rapid military buildup stolen valuable intellectual property increased economic Warfare and increased aggression including a surveillance balloon that we all saw drift across our our nation last week the CCP has demonstrated that it will continue to increase its influence and aggression far beyond the South China Sea as you know the Chinese military operates an overseas base in uh in Djibouti in a recent report from U.S and China economic and Security review commission stated that Chinese Communist parties pla is seeking sites for military installations in the West West Africa a location that would give the Chinese military direct access to the Atlantic Ocean so what if anything can the United States do to disincentivize Nations such as those in West Africa from allowing the pla to operate military installations within their countries and are we contrasting their effort by Contracting with foreign strategic ports and countries ourselves so um you know we we have to to convince countries uh not to yield their sovereignty uh to China and in a case in point I mentioned it before is Hamman Toyota port in Sri Lanka uh and and we're seeing this weaponization of debt by the PRC against these countries all we can do well not all but but what we what we can do what we must do is to ensure that uh we share with them the information about the ramifications of falling under this this debt diplomacy that China is known for but every country is Sovereign and they make their own independent decisions just as we do and that's why diplomats in the diplomacy matter in those countries I think all of that is correct and I would add in addition to diplomacy the purpose of diplomacy is to listen to what the needs and interests of those Sovereign nations are and I think we can do that without being overreactive to China's engagements in those areas a lot of times there are other options for those Nations China just under bids and so wins contracts because it makes the most Financial sense for the country at the time a lot of that is actually self-harming for China because people are getting what they pay for and finding that it's it's not meeting their their needs and their aspirations and that word is spreading and so we can continue to provide an alternative understanding that that alternative might not always be accepted by those Nations and that that's not always a a terrible outcome in terms of the overall strategic relationship along those same lines I'm just wondering about the level of confidence and trust that that all countries in the world have but especially our allies out there have you know we watched a chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan we've seen our response to to Russia and the Ukraine and and we even watched the response of of having a a surveillance balloon drift across our country so I'm and then listening to you talk about just the the the the slowness and feeling the Ambassador positions and this lack of strategic Clarity we have and you know the diplomacy matters and we've canceled these diplomatic meetings and I agree with you very much so so I just wonder if you both get comment about the level of confidence that is out there from not only our NATO allies but other allies in the region so I'll start by simply saying that I think the level of confidence in the United States is on the rise internationally primarily in the recent past due to Ukraine I think the American response of bipartisan American response to Ukraine surprised a lot of people most assuredly surprised Russia and they galvanized our European and NATO allies to do more so we see Germany for example which has increases or stated its intent to increase its defense budget uh to two to over two percent which we have been trying to do since NATO began and now they're doing it and so there's that and then on the other side is China's own bad behavior which is causing countries like Taiwan South Korea Japan and and others to view China differently and understand the kind of partner that China is and I think that's gone a long way to to moving countries away from the Chinese orbit into orbit of free Nations thank you thank you very much

Mr President when it comes to the actions of a party or a presidential Administration legislation sometimes grabs the Lion's Share of the attention but it's equally important to pay attention to what a presidential Administration does with its regulatory power and the bite Administration has been characterized by a lot of deeply troubling regulations the so-called inflation reduction act may be Democrats most prominent Green New Deal effort but the bide administration's radical environmental agenda doesn't stop there the president's also been using regulations to push through Democrats Green New Deal fantasies and these ill-considered overreaching regulations could have serious consequences later today I will be sending a letter to the president about the attempts to use Financial and securities Regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve to push through environmental social and governance or what are referred to as ESG regulations that seek to choke off investment to essential Industries like oil and natural gas and American farms and ranches notable among these is the security exchange commission's proposed climate disclosure rule which would require publicly traded companies to disclose information not only about their own admissions but also about their the greenhouse gas emissions of their suppliers and even their customers now it also require companies to determine the effects of climate related risks on each line item of their Consolidated financial statements well to start with this rule is obviously unworkable companies have zero control over the emissions of their suppliers and customers and little to no ability to accurately gauge those emissions but the most serious aspect of this proposed rule is the fact that it represents a clear effort to coerce companies to sever ties with certain industries notably of course the conventional energy industry but also with other Industries like agriculture and it's hardly the only regulatory action of its kind proposed by the byte Administration the Department of Labor just finalized a rule that would in practice require pension fiduciaries to consider climate change and ESG factors when making investment decisions irrespective of their pecuniary relevance the Federal Reserve which I believe has zero business inserting itself into debates over climate policy recently established a pilot program to analyze climate-related Financial Risk for the nation's largest banks something that clearly clearly exceeds the fed's statutory Authority similarly the office of the Comptroller or the currency the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the FED have issued draft principles for large banks on and I quote climate related Financial Risk Management end quote and the list goes on this present private companies of course have the right to consider whatever factors they want when determining what companies they do business with and where they will invest but the federal government should not be making those decisions for them the president in his cronies in the far left environmental movement may like the idea of choking off investment to the fossil fuel industry and other Industries to hasten the arrival of their fantasy Green New Deal future but reducing or eliminating investment in conventional energy and other essential Industries is likely to create a nightmare for American families and American businesses I am and have long been a strong supporter of alternative energy but the fact of the matter is we are still a long way from being able to rely exclusively on Alternative Energy the technology that would enable us to rely solely on green energy simply doesn't exist yet and pretending that we can rely exclusively on Alternative Energy isn't going to change the reality which is that we still need oil and natural gas and we'll continue to need them for the foreseeable future choking off investment to the conventional energy industry isn't going to magically bring about the green New Deal future but it is going to reduce essential energy supplies and that in turn is going to increase energy prices it's going to increase energy prices for American families and it's going to increase energy prices or American businesses if Democrats succeed in reducing investment in oil and natural gas we could be looking at a very serious reduction in our supply of conventional energy and correspondingly serious price hikes and there's reason to be concerned that Democrats aren't just interested in choking off investment in oil and natural gas but in agriculture as well because of natural livestock emissions and farming inputs like fertilizer the National Credit Union Administration published a since rescinded strategic plan that seem to recommend that credit unions reduce their membership and Loan offerings to farming communities and South Dakota Banks and Credit Unions have repeatedly repeatedly expressed their concerns to my office at the president's far-reaching ESG agenda could ultimately damage their ability to extend Capital to their Farm and Ranch customers should investment in agriculture also drop off we could be looking not only at higher energy prices but higher food prices as well and possibly actual food supply issues and between higher energy prices and higher food prices the kind of financial hardship that Americans have been experiencing during our current inflation crisis could become a fixture for the long term Mr President Democrats like to think of themselves as the party of the little guy but the truth is they become the party of extreme special interests and the little guy often gets end up ends up getting sacrificed as a result since President Biden and Democrats took office two years ago ordinary Americans have faced almost Non-Stop Financial challenges thanks to the inflation crisis Democrats helped create with their massive American Rescue plan spending bill and if the president's ESG agenda continues unchecked that diminished Prosperity could last indefinitely Mr President in the letter that I am sending to the president later today I'm urging his administration to consider the real world effects of rules and regulations on ordinary families and American businesses and to refrain from regulatory actions that would drive up prices even further and I hope that the president will listen but a pass is prologued and I'm worried that we're looking at two more years of extreme Democrat policies and two more years of economic suffering for the American people as president I yield the floor

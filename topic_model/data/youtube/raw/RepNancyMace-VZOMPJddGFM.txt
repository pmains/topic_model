house speaker nancy pelosi keeping her house masked mandate despite new cdc guidelines the move prompting 34 republicans to write a letter asking her quote to immediately return to normal voting procedures and end mandatory mask requirements in the house of representatives congresswoman nancy mace was among those who signed the letter and she joins us live now it's good to see you this morning thanks for being here good morning and thank you for having me and you know if you remove that mask it's a five hundred dollar fine but but are you surprised that this is still in place i really really am particularly now that finally the cdc is is somewhat following the science we know that if you're fully vaccinated indoor outdoor three to six feet apart you are safe and this is a time to lead our country through this crisis and instead she's doubling down on this and we saw during biden's address to the united states that joint session everybody was vaccinated they only had a few people in the room and they were all double masked it's not the right message to send americans we need to be encouraging vaccinations and show what that post-vax life looks like let's pop up on the screen part of the letter it's long i'm not going to read it in full but it basically go over goes over the main points that you just made it seems though she has to cave on this no i mean how ridiculous does she look if she doesn't cave well as she looks ridiculous more and more every day and the masks mandates is just an example of that now she's i'm hearing taking over the infrastructure committee and the the latest infrastructure package it's only going to get worse from here but this is a time to show leadership in our country we're not getting it from nancy pelosi we need to show that our kids can be safe in schools that parents can have a say in whether their kids wear masks and this is a place in congress the halls of congress is the first place in this country where we likely have heart immunity because the vast majority of us are vaccinated or have had covet 19 that it's safe whether we're outdoor indoors spread out washing your hands we need to show the rest of the country how to get it right and there are some like yourself who have had covet 19 and are vaccinated so i mean there are a lot of people in that scenario as well let's talk about the colonial pipeline hack right now in the gas shortage and i'm curious in your estimation the biggest thing you think this exposed well it exposes that energy security is national security it also exposes that we should be paying more attention be more mindful and investing more in protections rather than say creating a civilian climate corps are making our kids school lunches greener in this infrastructure package perhaps just perhaps we should invest in cyber security so that we can prevent cyber attacks from happening in the future that should be a priority for this administration here's what pete buddha judge transportation secretary had to say on this take a listen for many americans this has been a wake-up call on how actors anywhere in the world could impact us right here at home and when you look at our our policy framework our laws a lot of them were not written for the the cyber era i mean congresswoman he's right that was a very thought out answer a very accurate and full answer but why then is he and the rest of the administration labeling so much other junk as infrastructure and distracting from what really needs to be done to carry out what pete buttigieg just said in that sound bite 30 seconds to you absolutely and what i'm hearing about that infrastructure package it will be larger when we finally get to mark up and see it and it'll be even worse than what we've heard so far half of what we're hearing could be spent on green new deal type of wasteful spending that does not make this cyber security a priority for infrastructure and this this hack illustrates the enormous need to do a better uh do a better job for energy grid whether that's pipelines or the energy grid i mean it seems that cyber stuff's bipartisan you guys can get together on one thing it should be that congresswoman nancy mace we appreciate your time as always thank you so much have a great weekend

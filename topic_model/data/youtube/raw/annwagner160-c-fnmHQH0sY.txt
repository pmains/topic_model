I thank the gentlelady for yielding mr. chairman I want to reiterate that's stopping the financing of exploitation is our common goal and right now financial institutions are attempting to aid us in this fight but many suspicious activity reports are based on false flags financial institutions are largely left alone to determine what information is valid and without good and specific verifiable targeted information financial institutions may wrongly identify people over respond and over target or fail to recognize the criminal activity establishing a system that can connect financial institutions to trustworthy partners is critical trustworthy partners like Liberty Asia Polaris who are absolutely in favor of this piece of legislation if we want to continue calling on financial institutions to do their part on anti money laundering and trafficking prevention we must ensure that we are doing our part to help them excess actionable information this bill encourages the Treasury secretary they go to the Treasury Secretary to grant safe harbor only to NGOs that have certain policies and procedures in place to generate good intelligence and correct inaccurate intelligence this bill enables FinCEN and the financial institutions to gather a hard intelligence that can be verified or disproven rather than rely on general useless or even faulty tips from nonprofits private citizens and other sources without technical experience that could lead to false identifications and persecution of innocent actors it is the lack of verifiable specificity and the lack of regulated accreditation that allows for the targeting of innocent groups the bill creates a process a process responsible nonprofits that professionally analyze information and create intelligence products that help financial institutions better identify these crimes can share information without worrying about whether sharing this information is going to end their organization I urge its support in its original fashion mr. chairman I and I yield back the remainder of my I'm too miss love

so here now Republican congressman Matt Gaetz of Florida he's a member of the House Judiciary Committee congressman good to see you tonight but what's your reaction to chairman Nadler who says no actually April 2nd is the deadline we expect this entire unredacted report on Tuesday it's pretty hypocritical of Democrats who criticized too high heaven Republicans who wanted to see the underlying FISA information that justified this entire bizarre investigation in the first place chairman adler was one of the members of congress who said that would be an unprecedented breach in our commitment to the intelligence community to protect sources and methods look bill Barr has operated at lightning speed and it's also inconceivable Martha that the 2-time attorney general the United States would mischaracterized the conclusions of the malla report and then risk his entire legal career and his credibility forever of course if he was mischaracterizing these conclusions Muller or Andrew Weissman or Jeanne Rhee who worked for the Clinton Foundation would be would be doing everything they could to discredit that so here you have Democrats who didn't like the result and so now they're criticizing the referee it's not only losing its being a sore loser you know there's an interesting poll that came out this is an NPR PBS poll that says that only 36% believe that the Muller report clears President Trump of any wrongdoing and you know some might look at that number 56 percent say that questions still exist nine percent are unsure some wait look at that 36% and say well that's you know that's about the size of president Trump's hardcore base and they're the only ones who were so so far convinced by what they've seen what do you think well well I don't think that there remains any large percentage of Americans who believe as Democrats have said that President Trump is a Russian agent or that he somehow compromised I think that would only reflect the hard Democrat base but if anything that data suggests that were right to want to see greater transparency and Bill Barr has committed to that there's no effort to cover anything up if anything Democrats are trying to cover up the fact that they were wrong they have to have to say something the conclusions are the present didn't conclude didn't collude with Russia and so this is a democratic party that is in a really disarray with the absence of a narrative about Russia because they lied to the country for 22 months the greater harm here is not a cover-up the greater harm is that Adam Schiff gets to continue as chairman of the Intelligence Committee while the country and the intelligence community and our foreign partners can't trust somebody who lied for 22 months to the American I got two more questions I got squeezing here for you with with regard to Adams chef here's what Nancy Pelosi said about the attacks against him president Fredo was he afraid of the truth that he would go after a member a chairman of a committee of respected chairman of a committee in the Congress I think they're just scaredy cats they just don't know what to do so they have to make an attack quick thought and then I got one more for you yeah we are afraid of something we're afraid of Adam Schiff continuing to be a member of the gang of eight the reason there's a gang of eight to review the most sensitive intelligence is that the other 435 members have to be able to rely on them we and the country will no longer be able to rely on Adam Schiff that's why we seek is removal and that's what we're truly afraid of before I let you go what I think of the former CIA director John Brennan meeting with Democrats House Democrats you know I think Brennan really has undermined a lot of his work previously for the country and I think he's trying to reconstitute an anti-trump narrative but if anything Democrats need to kick John Brennan out of the meeting and let's work together on legislating some of the stuff the Democrats and Republicans care about like health care immigration infrastructure so these continued cloak-and-dagger type meetings don't bring the country together they continue to highlight the fact the Democrats divided this country over an investigation that was never based on fact it was based on political dirt from the Hillary Clinton campaign in the DNC I gotta go ten seconds but chairman Adler what do you think he's gonna do if he doesn't get the report by April's by the second well if he wants to he could subpoena the report but I think that would risk a lot of the confidence the intelligence community has that there is some process to protect people that do very sensitive work for our country congressman gates thank you good to see you tonight thank you

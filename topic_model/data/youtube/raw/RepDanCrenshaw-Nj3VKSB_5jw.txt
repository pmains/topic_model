all right i've told you about privileged walks and significant emotional events training two training methods our military is using to propagandize critical race theory to our service members now for reference the privileged walks occurred at moody air force base in georgia and the significant emotional event training occurred at patrick air force base in florida it's important to call out these specific commands otherwise we're not going to see these practices get changed so today i'm going to tell you about a really disturbing report we received in my home state of texas at fort bliss according to this report during an inclusion exercise service members were required to create and wear personal identification badges i'm sure you can tell where this is going these personal identification badges which again were mandatory as part of this exercise listed a service member's race ethnicity social class and other things meant to separate people based on their identity groups i think this is outrageous privileged walks and significant emotional events separate service members based on their race or sex these personal identification badges actually require people to reduce themselves to a whole list of new characteristics that have nothing to do with their service or their training or the content of their character for that matter most soldiers do not believe that they are the sum of identity groups and it's absurd that our military is instructing people to view themselves and others that way in the seal teams our bond is forged in large part by our common history our ethos and our trial by fire training we never asked each other for our social class or other identity groups because that would be ridiculous the only thing that should be on a soldier's uniform is their name their rank and most importantly the american flag yes we are all individuals and we're all different but the military requires us to put aside those differences and focus on one mission as one team not highlight differences this type of woke training doesn't help strengthen a unit it weakens it severely and it must stop

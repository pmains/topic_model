well thank you uh mayor uh very much for having us here in Garfield to you to the superintendent of schools to the to the board members to all of the city officials to the incredible faculty and staff here I thank you so much for allowing us to join you today and I had a little opportunity to talk to a couple of the students and they made my day because whenever I meet with young people I ask them what's your favorite subject and I always say don't include Jim because sometimes I've heard that answer not so often by the occasion and each one of them either said math or science and the reason they make my day is because we don't have enough mathematicians and scientists in our nation we give special permits to people from all over the world to come to jobs in the United States that I'd rather see an American do but as I tell them you do math and science and you stick with it you're going to be able to do anything you want so you must be incentivizing them so congratulations we just took a brief tour with the superintendent of the board members of the mayor of the Thomas Jefferson School Elementary and I want to start again by thanking the mayor the superintendent siaka and all the education professionals who are gracious enough to host us walking through these Halls listening to teachers and administrators alike seeing the children in the classroom again one can't help but feel inspired in the stories that they shared with me Tales of perseverance and grit you really get a sense of just how hard covet was on teachers students and families in our state having to adapt to online learning transitioning to hybrid systems having to overcome all kinds of challenges in order to deliver high quality instruction to our kids it would wear on anyone so I put one I'm just about Blown Away by the resilience and the fortitude that our school communities have shown despite these challenges teachers here at Thomas Jefferson School and principal Vogue group have done tremendous work to ensure that each child has the support and resources needed to succeed and I know we have a president of the AFT hero representing teachers all over our state she's got to be incredibly proud of all of them as we come together to talk about securing federal funds to support our schools and help them get back on their feet and Thrive today is a proud moment we get to see firsthand how these federal dollars are making a real meaningful difference in the classroom now my colleague and I who you'll hear from shortly Congressman pascarell uh were tremendous Advocates when we were doing uh the cares act funding of the American Rescue plan for our schools we know that education is the key that unlocks social mobility and Economic Opportunity in our country and we know the challenges during covid that existed and we know some of the long-term challenges that have existed for school districts like Garfield I started off my life in public service as a school board member which is a labor of love so I appreciate the school board members who are here and I I understand the the very significant challenge we were proud Congressman Pascal and I to deliver more than three billion dollars to help New Jersey schools adapt and ultimately reopen through coveted relief packages like the cares Act and the American Rescue plan this money's being used so it's a whole host of things infrastructure Improvement instructional materials we saw so much of that in the other classroom as well as we can see some of them here and other social and emotional programming that so many children need to adapt after a year and a half of remote learning these once in a generation Investments are happening in schools all across New Jersey and we are here in the Garfield School District to highlight what the American Rescue plan has helped unlock for our teachers and children on the ground tucked into one of its Provisions the American Rescue plan replenished the elementary and secondary school emergency relief fund or what we call Esser funds the Garfield School District alone received nearly 8.4 million dollars for improvement renovation and additional support that's on top of the more than four million they received to the 2020 cares act and year-end Appropriations package last year think about that mayor described it as the second biggest city the biggest little city little city okay a lot of a lot of punch here that's about 13 million dollars in total for this school district alone the Esser fund has been a game changer for school districts like this one and it has made all the more impressive when you see where the money is going is going towards a major 6.3 million dollar renovation of the high school that will install new HVAC systems for better air quality it's going towards new windows safer ventilation systems and other long delayed upgrades at other district schools that have been serving Garfield or Generations it's going towards brand new smart boards like the one behind me that bring digital tools and Technologies into every classroom is going into steam Labs that's science technology engineering arts and Mathematics that looks like the room we are in now with 3D printing and Robotics instruction in short this money is going towards improving our schools and supporting the teachers students and administrator who walk their Halls every single day they are an investment in our teachers and our Educators and most importantly they're an investment in our children which are our future these are public service in the true sense of the word through their work they show us what it means to place others before self and so on behalf of a grateful Community I want to thank them all for everything they do day in and day out to support our children and ensure they succeed in the classroom in a moment we'll hear from the AFT New Jersey president Donna Sierra who can speak to the incredible stories of resilience that have come to light over the past two years but as our schools gear up for this second full year of instruction post-pandemic these federal funds are an example of our primary Duty as elected leaders marshalling the resources of our federal government to support every student every teacher and all the families who call New Jersey home we shouldn't be making they're already hard jobs harder we shouldn't be contributing to the stress of a new school year you should be making things easier opening doors and opportunities so that we can deliver on the promise of a high quality public education that is the birthright I believe of every child in America and certainly one of the things that we cherish here in New Jersey as a state a great public education system so now let me turn over to my esteemed colleague in the house if you're in a fight just in case you don't know this Garfield if you're in a fight you want bill pasquerel in the fight with you in order to ensure that you succeed he is a champion he is pugnacious but in a positive powerful way that delivers on behalf of the people of this District congressman thank you senator wanted to have you in Garfield I've been here three times over the weekend I don't know what that does it's great to see you all last evening I had to speak to the civil engineers of New Jersey and New York and New York State at their convention they're looking for people because of the infrastructure bill that we passed our bridges are falling down our airports are inadequate and we can simply walk away and say they'll take care of themselves they're not going to take care of themselves and that is why Madam super I'm so happy that Garfield has spent money and efforts to ensure a great step program listen to me listen to me please stem is our future you say well not every kid's going to go into science congressman yeah I know that I was a teacher but stem is critical it's in schools it's in boys clubs Girls Clubs we're getting out there the word that science is not to be shunned they don't have enough people to do the work that's I mean that's coming their way to fix all our roads and our bridges our airports our ports it's a great opportunity we cannot miss it you cannot let it pass by good paying jobs good paying jobs now when I was in school when I was particularly in grammar school my interest in science was just about milk but done a lot of things were just about nil in my life at that point they're a great opportunities here so the cares act as a as a senator mentioned it brought a lot of good resources those schools of the United States in Garfield 960 3 000 dollars nothing to sneeze in but a cares Act is doing the job the Garfield Public School District received three million seven hundred and thirty nine dollars thirty four dollars and other funding as well the coronavirus response and relief that went to the school system so I thank you for being here we got state and local rescue funding in big part because of the Senators Pilots were on the Senate so I remembered he's in a situation where there's a 50-50 vote at least we have five as an edge in the house we're not doing much better in terms of pluralities the mayor our great mayor but we also and The Madam superintendent Mr cosmano president gonto and president Shira teachers staff thank you all for working day and night to keep our Educators and our students safe recovery for covert has been tough we do not know the consequences of it I am telling you now we're just learn it just learn Ed we lost over 34 600. new jerseys to the economy credit and the crater and the schools were closed the public has entrusted the Congress and the president to help us recover and we're on the way to recovery schools are open with the best economy in decades unemployment is a record of Love wages are up gas prices are full that's a good barometer President Biden has added since he's been the president 10 million jobs mostly everybody who lost and left their job during the pandemic is back to work that's phenomenal can't keep the us down just kidding the Congress delivered some truly historic laws just in a very short period of time things change 1.9 trillion American Rescue plan have powered our recovery and provided States and cities we insisted on that we insisted that money go directly to the communities whether we're talking about Transportation or whether we're talking about education whether we're talking about health Etc our district the ninth congressional district received 341 million and Garfield as I said over 9 million so this Aid kept our communities afloat it expanded vaccines supported small businesses and reinvigorated our public spaces Congress then enacted an additional 2.5 trillion pandemic Aid and 60 billion was given to the schools Across America phenomenal some good comes out of the bad all the time I never saw the fat we we calibrated how we handle health in America that's what we're doing right now great research that's going on in our universities and our hospitals and in our universities about education so based on what I saw in a very short period of time funds are going to good use of course you know folks out there that say you guys don't know how to spend money I was a teacher and I was a member of the board of education so I heard this a lot of times way back when sometimes they're right I'm very confident in the superintendent I don't say that because she's here I don't blow smoke I should know I'm very confident that this school district is going to be one of the best in the state by putting money on and that's our thing and as you heard the senator say new iPads Smart Boards 3D printers you can always get more and we will we're not done the American Garfield are back and America and Garfield are better than ever but we are not done The Best Is Yet To Come I want to thank you for being here today all right way back to Sin City I got another meeting this afternoon further south than that no wonder we're built out of swamp humidity is horrific don't go to Washington on a vacation suppose you do is sweat Garfield it doesn't matter how large geographically you are or how small you have made an imprint to care about our kids to the point that you're not afraid of that isn't that interesting I am so proud of you As I Am The District's towns in my district have a very special love for God I live you know of course the river of Paterson I have a special love for Garfield because I remember what they used to say about Garfield and we used to say in in say County I wrong with water I drove along that River so many times lately I mean you're moving forward and your education is moving forward the parents appreciate it I know they do I talked to them God bless you thank you for inviting me and Bob and I have our backs [Applause] so our our next speaker is the superintendent of schools who runs this entire School District I was telling her I'm so thrilled sometimes I go to schools and I walk through the Halls are somewhat bare this school it's alive even the steps have messaging for their students so very proud to be here superintendent and honestyaca [Applause] good morning Senator Menendez and Congressman pascrow welcome from The Garfield Boilermakers in the city of Champions Senator Menendez from Union City having those roots and Congressman Pascal with his Patterson Roots we are confident that you understand a school Community such as ours the Garfield district has three Pre-K schools seven elementary schools a middle school and a high school our enrollment is approximately 5 000 students we are most proud of our diversity and celebrate the fact that every student is unique and brings their own experiences beliefs strengths and ideas to the classroom in May of 2019 shortly after becoming superintendent of schools we held a strategic planning meeting and invited all shareholders to come together so we could develop a new vision and several Focus areas after the meeting we collaborated as a district to analyze the responses from our shareholders and develop a new strategic plan we created our new vision of Champions and identified six areas that we needed to work on to improve and enhance the quality of Education in Garfield these areas where student learning school climate physical learning environments literacy technology and communication so we earnestly began working on those needs at the beginning of the 2019-2020 school year and then of course covid-19 became a reality in March of 2020. for a brief moment it did seem like our goals were standing still and our progress was halted while health and safety became the main priority but then desperately needed assistance arrived in the form of the cares act esser-1 which provided Garfield with 923 thousand dollars a good portion of this grant was used for PPE equipment as well as credit recovery tutoring summer academic and enrichment and our steam program esther-2 funds followed with the total allocation of about four million dollars and again a big portion of this was designated for learning acceleration and mental health supports esser2 provided the opportunity to purchase Promethean boards establish Innovation Labs such as the one we are sitting in today with steam supplies 3D printers and Robotics we are planning an outdoor instructional Lab at Garfield Middle School Esther II provided much needed relief for summer academic and enrichment programs so that we can continue to support our students with their academic and social emotional needs since sr2 expanded allowable uses to include school facility repairs the district was able to allocate funds to upgrade our high school media center as well as the broadcast room at Garfield High School Esther 3 came along giving us over 8 million dollars in funding and in addition to the similar uses of sr2 we have designated 6.5 million dollars to completely replace and upgrade the HVAC system at Garfield High School foreign [Applause] will be improved efficiency better air quality and consistent temperatures throughout the building and as we know today much needed air conditioning further breakdown of vesser 3 includes 697 000 to address learning loss 305 000 for mental health Staffing and resources 830 000 for summer learning 224 000 for extended day activities and 130 000 for improvement of facilities quite impressive amounts of money that are being used to support our students staff and Families so if we go back to the Strategic plan that I mentioned at the beginning and the fact that we thought that that plan would remain stagnant the Esser grants one two and three have totally made the difference for us and have provided the fuel for us to keep moving forward especially in the areas of supporting student learning technology and Improvement of physical environments these advancements would have taken years an absence of the Esser funds in closing we remain most grateful that these funds are utilized to promote equity in our schools and address the needs of the many underserved students including racial and ethnic minorities students from lower income families are first generation students and students with learning disabilities thank you again Senator Menendez and Congressman pasqurell for all you have done to support funding for public education and for believing and trusting us as Educators to use these funds wisely to educate our students by the way Senator Menendez I appreciate the thank you on your website to a teacher that helped you with public speaking and I want to recognize that teachers deserve that type of acknowledgment and unfortunately we don't see it enough finally I want to recognize

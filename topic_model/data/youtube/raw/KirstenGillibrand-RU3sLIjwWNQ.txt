the biggest problem we have in Washington is the greed and corruption that determine everything determines what bills get voted on what the outcome of the legislation is and I've heard from Americans across this country that they believe there's enormous political corruption and so we need clean elections we have to restore the power to the hands of the people and so I proposed a publicly funded elections bill to offer clean elections to take on political corruption directly by getting money out of politics and making sure that American voters voices are as loud and powerful as the Koch brothers and we do it through democracy dollars telling every American that if they want to participate in federal elections they'd be given these dollars to spend on the campaign's that they see fit in their state in their district and for president it's $600 I believe that you would get from the federal government it's $200 for each federal election so you get $200 a hundred for primary and 100 for general for the presidential election for your congressional election and for your Senate election and that is a very small modest amount of money to cap to say you could really spend up to $200 in each election you would also allow voters to give that amount as well but it would be something that every candidate would choose whether or not to participate in and it would be something that every voter would choose whether or not to participate in and what it does Chris is it allows more people to participate in our democracy it democratizes democracy

very much when we were having our first child 20 she's 26 now almost 27 years ago we went to we thought we're gonna have twins and where we thought that could be twin so we back then they did the ultrasound and at 10 weeks old she was the size of a teddy gram and if you're not as old as I am I guess about the size of a gummy bear she was sucking her thumb and had her own little personality their own so I mean no matter where you are on this issue you can't deny these are human beings I mean and what you feel I have the right to life or not that's a different question I guess for some people but they are human beings well now my 26 year olds gonna have our first grandbaby when she was 13 or 14 weeks along we went to see the ultrasound and our little granddaughter to be and hopefully may 19th was sucking her thumb just like her mother and it was just amazing that was almost looking at the same picture rather than it's clearer and so these are distinct in individuals and with their own personalities and they require their mothers who to come into this world and to be life in Ketil into life and and so as we were looking at some of the questions just collie just asked I was going to ask about so HR to 975 states that women's health is read access to health care is reduced because of abortion anti-abortion laws and miss Collette I mean if you just kind of answer maybe rebut some of the stuff that we just heard my understanding is they have federal qualified health centers are available just because a place providing abortion services isn't available everywhere doesn't mean women are getting access to get health care could you comment on what was just said certainly mr. Northrup I believe mischaracterized the heller stack case the Texas evidentiary record in that case was that there were some difficulties in obtaining admitting privileges but they did not have the legislative record nor did they have the disciplinary record of physicians and clinics that exists in Louisiana in my written testimony which I would ask to have submitted as part of the record I actually quote the fifth written testimonies are part of the record thank you madam chair I would I quote judge Elrod of the Fifth Circuit where she notes that there was even a challenge on the part of the abortion clinics as to whether the supreme court could see the evidentiary record because of the over-broad protective order that was given at the trial court level nonetheless the Louisiana Department of Health has multiple findings that clinics had unsanitary conditions that that physicians were that were hired were unqualified in the area in one case they hired an ophthalmologist to perform abort abort and so the record in the Louisiana case is very very different than the record that was inhale our staff I'm very optimistic in fact that the state of Louisiana will prevail in that case but that's the distinction as far as access even the Guttmacher Institute has published multiple papers showing that regulation is not the primary cause for the decline in access they have as late as 2018 said that there are other reasons for the decline of the abortion rates that while it is a factor things like the fact that abortion rates have declined by 50% women are making different choices and when that when you lose 50% of your market for services you are going to have clinics closed it's very simple and as I testified earlier Planned Parenthood has the strategy of mega clinics now one exists in st. Paul near my home another exists in Houston the newspapers report that they expect to increase their patient rate to a thousand more people that's going to affect the smaller clinics and as dr. Robinson herself testified there are times when clinics are located nearby but that patients choose to go to other clinics for various reasons part of it might be the reputation of the clinic in part so the simple fact is that as far as STI treatment as far as prenatal care that is available from other facilities and if you really are worried about women's health let's deal with the fact that over 50% of the counties in this country do not provide obstetrical care in their hospitals well things I also have a question so the bill before is HR 2 9 7 5 forces states to allow abortion regard of a patient's reasons for seeking abortion does that mean that you can have an abortion for any reason that for any reason accord with along with this bill miss Collette congressman that is the state of the law currently pre-viability and even in many states post viability for example in my home state of Minnesota well I only have 15 so sex selection would be a sex selection would be permitted yes as would for racial reasons or for the disabilities of the child I think you only had five seconds

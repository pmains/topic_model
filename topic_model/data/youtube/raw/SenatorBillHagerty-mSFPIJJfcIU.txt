thank you madam chair and ranking member blood thank you um and thank you for your comment senator ossoff because i i don't think this is a solution in search of a problem i think this is a power grab in search of a crisis and what's happening here right now is we're manufacturing a crisis to resurrect components of a democrat wish list for federalizing elections in the united states this should not be called the for the people act this should be called the for the politicians act what this is is an effort to rewrite election laws in all 50 states of the nation and democrats are using a 50 50 senate in a house of representatives that has the thinnest majority to come in and rewrite our election laws in a way that will forever damage our constitutional system let me tell you what this does this calls for ballot harvesting by paid poll workers no voter id required this increases the chances for fraud it increases the chances for a lack of confidence in the system that we're suffering right now it weaponizes the fec we'll turn it into a democrat controlled entity that can be used to harass the opposition forever and this also takes federal funding taxpayer dollars and utilizes those funds to pay for elections of politicians politicians can even pay themselves a salary from taxpayer funds indeed this is not for the people this is for the politicians it's an abject power grab and i think that we should reject this in its entirety thank you

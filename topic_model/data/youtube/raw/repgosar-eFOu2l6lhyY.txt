oh sorry thank you very much mr. chairman miss Katara check thank you for appearing before the community today no I carefully reviewed your budget request and I have to say this is one of the most ridiculous proposals I have seen so far this year a doubling of the office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement budget really this budget request isn't even worth the paper it's printed on do you think we just parachuted in here today it would have been more realistic if you would erode here today to this hearing on a unicorn your budget request continues your administration's fascination with the war on coal the office of surface mining FY 16 budget request proposes to significantly increase taxes and will harm Americans energy production while many don't consider Arizona to be a coal state Arizona generates 40% of its electricity from coal and produces more than 8,000 tons of coal per year a new analysis by PJM interconnection the country's largest regional grid operator found that proposals by this administration's could trigger the retirement of up to 49 gigawatts of its generating capacity here's a quote from that report today's electricity policy is a risky nationwide experiment and burning the candle at both ends something has to give the report states that means reliability problems and blackouts if emerging emerging policy threats go unchecked your administration's war on coal must cease and I would encourage your administration and stop picking winners and losers and to just to appeal to a radical agenda it is far past time your agency embrace a true all the above energy policy that includes access to wind solar hydro power geothermal oil natural gas and coal now questions I know you had plenty of you've heard plenty of concerns from stakeholders in Congress from the office of surface mining Zuri right of the stream buffer rule as you know information from the Department of Interior was leaked in 2011 which indicated the proposal would kill some 7,000 good-paying mining jobs as the office of surface mining continues to work on the proposal since then what have you done to ensure in this rewrite that the proposal does not result in thousands of lost jobs that's a very important question congressman gosar what we have done is we have used the information from the analysis that we hired outside experts to provide to us as to what would be the impacts of potential changes and we've made revisions to the rulemaking package as we developed it so as I mentioned earlier than that impact of the draft where we have right now would probably be a wash there may be a couple hundred more jobs as a result of the role maybe a couple hundred left it will not be thousands or jobs as was in that document so we should trust so we should trust this administration on the lack of everything that they've gotten wrong in regards to an economy that they can't predict one way or the other right I think you should look at the rulemaking when it comes out is proposed in the cost-benefit analysis and the regulatory impact analysis and make your judgement at that point in time because they believe Trust is a series of promises kept and I have not seen one iota where we ought to have any type of trust so let's let's go to the new estimates on the potential jobs job losses in the revised stream protection rule how many do you think will be taking care of it in that aspect I'm sorry sorry well you've changed was no longer the buff this stream buffer rule you've now called it the revised stream protection rule how many jobs would be lost in that there has been no job losses because of the stream protection rule there how many do you propose in implementation of that aspect how many jobs do you feel would be lost in that applicant we've just transferred or conveyed that rule 200 IRA on that and when the parole comes out you'll see the actual numbers and as I mentioned already a couple of times I expect that the range would be maybe a couple hundred less to maybe a couple hundred more well now you know this issues very important to my constituents can you tell me how many times you personally have met with leaders and families from actual coal mining regions to hear their concerns where any public comment hearings actually occurred in coal country can you elaborate specifically when those took place I've traveled in my job so number of places I've met with citizens in West Virginia and in Kentucky with homeowners with individuals with people who live and work in mines people who live near the mines I've been in Arizona met with people on the Hopi reservation and at a meeting with citizens there both who were opposed and it was supported coal mining I've met with officials and there I can't begin to count all the times in the places I've met with them it has been my practice everywhere I go to offer to meet with the state regulators with the industry and with citizens and environmental groups and I've done that I've done it in Alabama I've done it in Kentucky okay I appreciate that now you know and looking at the new timeline of the rule considering that you just sent the rule tow and B when do you expect there the rules to be proposed I expect it to be proposed sometime this spring spring is goes till June which we expected before May as sir we conveyed it to O IRA yesterday and that process needs to be allowed to go through that deliberative process I'm not exactly sure how long that will take we'll run through that process once it completes that process and then listed with Bart and we published as proposed and the draft EIS will be made available then as well thank you mr. Chairman I yield back

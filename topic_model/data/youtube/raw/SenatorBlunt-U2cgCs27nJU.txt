their response to the coronavirus has made it clear that there are lots of things that are the responsibility of individuals things like stayin home if you're sick frankly staying home if you're more likely than others to be sick practicing the kinds of hygiene our mothers taught us we should follow all along personally I may have set a new personal record for just washing my hands in the last two weeks I've never been adverse to washing my hands but I don't know that I've ever washed them half a dozen times a day or more before but those kinds of things are left up to us and then there are things that are left up to the local level things to determine in a local community where the things should be open or not what kind of activities should be the activities where you draw the line in terms of crowds much likely to be better decided at a local level by even a state or more likely by a mayor or a County Executive than by somebody here in Washington and then at the national level we're moving toward our third package now in the last few days to try to deal with this the first package was about eight billion dollars really focused at the immediate health response supplies developing a vaccine trying to figure out what the right therapies were understanding the things we needed to do to further help hospitals get ready and to further encourage people to go places other than hospitals when that worked all of those things were part of that first package and the package that we sent to the president that the President signed last night about a hundred billion dollars by almost any standard a huge amount of money to put together in just a short period of time that hundred billion dollars it was while it continued to work on the healthcare side also was very focused on just keeping people on a payroll if they're on a payroll that hundred billion dollars focused to a great stand on how you keep people who have decided they needed to be quarantined or who were in quarantined by a doctor or by a business that in fact was quarantined because it was closed up keeping those people on that payroll continuing to keep that part of our economy going and now today we move to the third package which is a trillion dollars 808 billion a hundred billion now a trillion that trillion dollars designed to continue to do all the other things that I've talked about but also designed to to keep this economy at a point where when we get through this we'll be as nearly to where we would have been otherwise as it all possible you know interestingly mr. president here we're going into a into a situation we're trying to protect an economy that didn't have any systemic problems with it it was an economy that was in by all measures unbelievably good and then suddenly people are encouraged sometimes required to back away from that economy to cease participating in lots of that economy partly because we've encouraged part of that economy to cease being part of the active economy and and what do we do there so this is going to be a different kind of response more focused in many cases where in the past people said we need more of your money many of the questions we just need to have an access to more money that we can easily pay back when we get through this we're willing to have securitized loans we're willing to have lots of things figuring out how to deal with that liquidity issue and then there are some things we need to put in this package that simply the government is going to have to look at in ways we haven't looked at before I want to spend a few minutes talking about one of those things today which is just frankly securing our medical supply chain in the past the idea that we'd worry about the supply chain would not have been at the top of the list of the things that the American people would be thinking needed to be on the first list they needed to look at when they think about public health but what we see happening now is a direct reminder that medical supplies we use can come from all over the world and in a pandemic everybody in the world may think they need what you think you would have received and expected to get more than they then they think they should send it to you we depend on manufacturers and other countries approximately 40% of the Finnish drugs and 80% of the active pharmaceutical ingredient inna and India the ongoing global coronavirus outbreak has really highlighted for the first time in today's supply chain what happens if you might not be able to get what you need when you need it there's also a spotlight on our supply chain challenges generally and I think as a result of this we're going to look at that sooner than we would have but right now in this bill I'm hoping we include an immediate look because we have quickly gone through a series of warning signs now that make us understand why we need to look at this this and look at it now on February the 27th the Food and Drug Administration announced the first coronavirus related drug shortage February 27th on March the 10th the FDA halted its routine overseas inspections of drugs and devices last week state health department's and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention raised concern about the looming shortage of the coronavirus extraction kit reagents needed to actually conduct the diagnostic tests not to mention some concerns about the swab you might need in some cases to take just a normal flu exam it's more and more clear that protecting our nation's medical supply chain is both a priority for public health and for national security obviously the supply chain has become more and more global now economic efficiency makes sense being more competitive makes sense it's fine to buy things from other countries but it's better if you have multiple options it's better if you have other options including domestic production it's especially true when it comes to vital options like medical devices medical supplies pharmaceuticals products we need for Public Health and Safety now we see now that this is a problem it's a problem that sort of comes upon us in a in this pandemic environment in a way that we had not thought we'd have to deal with it before but we do have to deal with it and we're hoping in this bill this is one of the places we can deal with it you know in our in our supply chain chain generally if you're making something mr. president and it takes 300 parts and you can get you have 299 of them you're in really good shape except you can't make what you hope to make because you don't have that one essential 300th part if you're lying on factories in China or South Korea or some other place that have shut down temporarily suddenly your factory has become too dependent on a partner that's no longer there so a bipartisan group of senators including myself and Senator Alexander and Senator Durbin and Senator Murray have written legislation to figure out how to Excel our vulnerability in the global supply chain for medical supply we want the national academy of sciences medicine and engineering to look at this issue and to look at it now to look at this issue and determine how dependent we have really become on supplies from other countries and then to make recommendations as to what some of our options might be we also like to hear their views on how we can make our supply chain more resilient for critical drugs and equipment what kind of backup plan we need to always be thinking about if our frontline plan may continue to be that other partner in another country what's our quick go to backup and how essential is it that we had that backup that would include asking how we can encourage domestic manufacturers of some things to be able to step up and reorient what they do when they need it and in a crisis the president to some extent address this idea yesterday by talking about a defense manufacturing strategy that defense manufacturing strategy may need to be more robust in some areas just simply because whether its component parts to a medical device our pharmaceutical ingredients or simply the gloves and mask and swab sticks and things that you need for basic health care when you're trying to determine what your healthcare environment is and then deal with it are out there and we need to look at it one example maybe the just the again the daily dependence on the daily protective equipment that our health care providers have we're interested to know what we need to do and what we need to do over the next 60 90 days what we need to do over the next two or three years but what we're going to be asking this commission to look at is we wanted to look at it quickly this is a priority it has become an immediate priority we need to know as we now look at another one of the in a series of epidemics where this has been a concern whether it's Ebola or swine flu or bird flu or Zinka or SARS we have had too many of these in too short a period of time and at that same period of time the globalisation of the supply chain has dramatically changed so as we prepare for future hazards we want to assure that the supply chains in place to allow us to provide the kind of health care we need the kind of response we need the kind of predict protection we need this should be part of the bill we send to the president hopefully between now and no later than the end of next week it's one of the things that will begin to set us on a better direction and create greater security greater health security as we look at our other security concerns

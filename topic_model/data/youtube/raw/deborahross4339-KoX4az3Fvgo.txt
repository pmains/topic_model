um thank you mr chairman and i want to echo um the great thanks to both the chair and the vice chair of the committee for their hard work for their integrity and for their dedication to this country and its institutions um thank you for everything that you're doing unfortunately we're having to have this committee meeting because now the whole house has to help you do your jobs um and this meeting is about holding people accountable to our nation's laws and to our constitution and former white house chief strategist steve bannon as we know has refused to comply with your duly issued subpoena he refused to come voluntarily his claim of executive privilege now as we know is flimsy at best he has been a private citizen since mid 2017 having served his last executive branch duties in the immediate wake of the unite the right rally in charlottesville virginia his communications with former president trump in the lead-up to the january 6 attack on our democracy can hardly be considered part of any presidential official duties everyone must play by the rules and bannon has already made his fair share of trips to the well he's already been pardoned for a series of crimes defrauding the people of the united states of america not this time i urge my colleagues to support the committee the chair the vice chair the rule and the underlying resolution and mr chairman i yield back

well good morning everybody and welcome so much to come and visit with us and learn more about our coveted vaccination dishonorable discharge prevention act that we'll be admitting we will be offering as an amendment to the ndaa when and if we ever get to vote on that next thursday november the 11th is veterans day a day that we stop that this nation pauses to honor our veterans our president instead is choosing to dishonor our military active duty officers by forcing them to be separated from the military and then pushing upon them a dishonorable discharge my colleagues here joining me will offer some more statements about it but first i want to introduce mike barry mike berry is the general counsel for the first liberty institute he joined first liberty in 2013 after serving seven years as an active duty marine he deployed afghanistan in 2008 and from 2009 to 2012 he served as an adjunct professor of law at the naval academy he continues to proudly serve our nation as a member of the marine corps reserve and is now a lieutenant colonel and today he's working feverishly to defend dozens actually 40 active duty seals and reservists he can exemption to the coveted vaccine mike let me turn it over to you and tell a little bit about your story and the folks that you represent thank you senator um as a veteran i can say that when you raise your right hand and you swear the oath to support and defend the constitution and you join the united states military you certainly give up some of your freedoms we all recognize that but you do not give up your religious freedom when you serve this country and yet that is exactly what first liberty institute's clients are facing today is the loss of their religious freedom being forced to choose between their faith and serving this country and our clients these 40 u.s navy seals collectively have more than 350 years of military service more than 100 combat deployments that's the type of experience and leadership and combat experience that's irreplaceable and incalculable and yet they face the loss of their careers they face being involuntarily separate involuntarily separated their families have been punished by being told that they're not allowed to travel even spouses and children are not allowed to travel simply because they have a sincere religious objection to the vaccine they face the loss of special pay due to their their special operation status and the navy has now threatened these seals with recoupment of the training money spent training them to become navy seals and giving them the the specialized training that they have to do what they do and speaking of doing what navy seals do this is a time in our nation's history when we face very real threats threats from from china and north korea iran russia and we should expect that every one of our able-bodied navy seals and other service members we want them defending this nation fighting for our freedom and instead they're fighting for their livelihoods and their careers that's un-american and that's wrong so first liberty institute it really is one of our greatest honors to represent these warriors these navy seals and all we're asking is that the department of defense honor the constitution and the rule of law honor its own regulations and allow these navy seals to continue to serve with a religious accommodation to avoid having to take this vaccine that violates their conscience and their sincerely held religious beliefs so uh it again i'm i'm i'm proud to represent them i'm proud to be a part of first liberty and i thank the the gentleman the senators behind me uh who are also standing up for religious freedom in our military thank you thanks mike good job thank you rick scott uh first i want to thank senator marshall for putting this together my father served in the second world war he did all the combat jumps as a member of the 82nd airborne i'm very proud of what he did i've got a picture of him in my office along with a rifle from his company um he never thought he'd come back alive very few of his friends came back alive i had the opportunity to join the navy my father told me how great the food was in the army so i decided to join the navy and i i knew there would be wouldn't be any foxholes so i joined the navy at at 18 years old i served as a raider man i never imagined that a federal our federal government that i took the oath to defend the freedoms of this country would come back and say if you don't put something in your body that you don't feel comfortable with right or wrong and i took look i took the vaccine i've had covet but if you don't do this then we're going to give you we're going to one kick you out of the military something that you know so many of my friends served and my family member served for decades and we're going to give you a dishonorable discharge i mean which is going to have a first it's going to impact your livelihood second it's going to impact your future you can't imagine this but joe biden has told you exactly what he thinks of our military whether it's the bash withdrawal from afghanistan whether it's the um not wanting to fund our military and now this he doesn't respect these the sacrifices our men and women and service are taking every day you look at you look at people that put themselves in harm's way they've come back home now and they said we're going to kick you out and we're going to give you a dishonorable discharge even though you went over you went over and defended the freedom of this country and put your life at risk this is disgusting it's wrong it needs to stop joe biden needs to start standing up for the men and women of our military instead of trashing them and tell them he's going to ruin their lives that's exactly what his goal is he is going to ruin their lives by kicking them out of the military and give them a dishonorable discharge this needs to change speaking of the navy another navy person here roger wicker oh okay well uh uh it's air force but i i i do love all the navy stuff in your office i do yeah right uh well we're look we're all in it together and we need all the help we can get we certainly don't need to to be losing our best and our brightest and our bravest from the force at a time like this i am lieutenant colonel roger wicker u.s air force retired and my father was uh also uh in world war ii he by the way he's 97 years old living in pontotoc mississippi and doing very well thank you living in his own home but he served proudly in the european theater four battle stars my son mcdaniel air force just like his dad and served in afghanistan they both served in much more dangerous situations than i ever did but i'm proud we're that we're three generations of military members and and mike yes thank you for your organization and for for what they're doing for liberty and mike is correct uh when i took the oath and when my dad took the oath and my son uh we we did give up uh certain amounts of our freedom but i will tell you this our commander-in-chief is grossly miscalculating the will of the american people and and not only is he going to create a crisis in the united states military but uh writ larger these mandates across our economy mandates to small businesses mandates to businesses that would contract with the federal government they are not going to be well received and the free american citizens that i know and that i talk to when i go back home are not going to stand for this he's going to create a shortage in the military he's going to create morale problems and in the economy as a whole this is going to be a biden recession so uh thank you senator marshall for crafting a very thoughtful approach to this issue and let me once again call on leader schumer bring the ndaa to the floor of the senate as it has been done for 60 straight years let's allow this amendment and let's allow the american people to see where their elected senators stand on this issue thank you to my colleagues especially senator marshall for bringing this thoughtful solution mike thank you for being here for your incredible work advocating for the religious freedom of uh the people who are you're where we're advocating for the religious freedom they're actually willing to die for ours it's quite a remarkable thing when you think about it um you know i don't so sometimes i i in this job i find we're pretty good at complicating simple things occasionally we oversimplify complicated things and i try hard not to do either but but the elegant solution that roger has drafted in this bill i think strikes the perfect balance it simply states that there should be nothing less than a dishonorable nothing less than an honorable discharge for somebody who has taken the oath stood in the gap and makes a decision a a a religious decision or any or for any other reason to not get the covet 19 vaccine what's different about covert 19 vaccine versus the other vaccines that you agreed to you know you agreed to take when you took the oath is that this one came after you took the oath it's not an unreasonable request now why does it matter so much to me in addition to serving with roger and on the armed services committee and roger thank you yes senator schumer let's bring the ndaa to the floor it's time it's long past time it's because i've been hearing from my constituents that serve i've been hearing from the moms of some of my young constituents who serve they're very concerned about this it's not a trifling matter to them this is not some just sort of a macho standoff this is heartfelt conscientious you know liberty issue i mean this is a big deal to them but so is serving and so there's a lot you know there's always a lot of area between you know the front end and the back end of things but this one's really simple and i think it strikes the right balance thank you kevin thank you let me just give you a few closing remarks we'll open up for questions president biden wants to turn heroes into felons that's what his policy is doing he wants to turn heroes into felons think about the consequences of a dishonorable discharge my dad started off his military career as a military policeman he then became a police officer in my hometown rose to the ranks became chief of police for 25 years my dad told me as a young young lad he would never hire a person with a dishonorable discharge from the military and so many of those military folks follow the same career path that my father did they make the people that serve in the military make great police officers but there's also some other issues what a dishonorable discharge would mean as well you would lose your access to gi bill for more education you would lose access to va home loans your va medical benefits military funeral honors i just can't tell you every every week every month we get requests to make sure that someone gets proper military funeral honors how important that is to americans they cannot re-enlist in another branch they will lose ownership of firearms or ammunitions and in some states they can lose their voting rights this is a big issue it is a big deal yeah it's going to make our nation less secure probably over 50 percent of our enlisted soldiers and the national guard the army reserve have not had the vaccine yet so many probably another you know thousands of other people that are active duty have not had the vaccine yet and these these are based upon religious convictions yesterday i sat down with an active duty navy seal officer and said tell me why you don't want the vaccination and he went through a very deep spiritual context of his faith-based decision prayer and thought and that was his conclusion and i'm not saying that i would follow his logic perfectly but i respect his faith and his ability to make that decision and just like one size doesn't fit all when a doctor sees a patient or treating a patient i think the same applies to your religious freedoms as well we should respect their religious freedoms you don't give that up when you go in the military and let me just join my colleagues here on asking senator schumer to bring the nda to the floor with this amendment so our soldiers who are separated because of the vaccine mandate issue are not given a dishonorable discharge so thanks i'll i'll open it up for questions okay go ahead um the overshoot rule that was released this morning just a few minutes ago i want to get your initial reaction on that there is a penalty of fourteen thousand dollars against small addresses who are out of compliance with getting all of their employees vaccinated wanted to get your official reactions on that and if it will you know faster the labor shortages i'm happy to as you know a lot of businesses have been preparing for this rule since the president was pretty clear about it in his previous statements his press statements and and the worst part about it is that every employer has to prepare for the worst case scenario just in case this day happened and it did um as you know we're preparing a congressional review act uh republicans are and going to be offering that that will allow us upon the completion of the rule to immediately bring a privileged motion to the floor and object to it i don't know how many democrats will join us but any democrat that has paid even a little bit of attention to what's gone on the last couple of days in this country particularly in virginia and new jersey ought to be getting the picture if if if inflation wasn't clear enough if a workforce shortage wasn't obvious enough then at the very least the election results should have been obvious enough for them to backtrack clearly they haven't so what we're going to do a weekend to stop it i've heard from lots of employers and frankly a lot of employees i was just down at the the border i was down in mcallen at the rio grande valley border last week the the sector chief there told me and of course these are federal employees he's going to lose 20 percent of the border patrol agents at a time when we have a surge of illegal immigration there are real consequences to this stuff and it is beyond me that there's not somebody with a little bit of economic competence in this administration that understands that if not just common decency kellyanne i'll just follow up and say one word inflation can you spell inflation inflation in this vaccine mandate of the number one and two problem i'm hearing back home about this this rule from the president is going to exacerbate an already horrible labor shortage problem it's going to create more supply chain blocks and that's going to lead to inflation as well this this vaccine mandate federal vaccine mandate is unconstitutional and from a practical standpoint i just couldn't think of another worse decision for this president to make right now yes sir eric rosales with ewtn news 19 thank you so much senators for holding this first question i just have is uh with the air force in particular they've received 5 000 religious exemptions and so far they have granted zero um your reaction to that yeah can mike you want to take a stab at that one yeah um yeah the air force is granted zero the department of the navy has said that it has not granted a single religious accommodation for a vaccine since 2015. they seem to be proud of that statistic which uh surprises me and disappoints me i think what it shows is that there is no intent to grant any religious accommodations to these vaccines and yet that's exactly what the law provides for right you have uh federal law department of defense regulations that all for years have allowed service members to seek religious accommodations and not even just in the vaccine context let's just look at history uh during world war ii uh there is a a conscientious objector who sought a religious accommodation he wanted to continue to serve his nation but he did not want to carry a weapon in combat because of his religious beliefs he was court-martialed for that because he refused to carry a weapon and then the army came to its senses and thought you know what we need every able-bodied person into this fight that we can get and they said we're going to allow him to serve as a medic so that he doesn't have to carry a weapon that that soldier his name is desmond doss he went on to receive the medal of honor for saving 70 lives during world war ii there are 70 sons whose mothers are grateful that the army granted that religious accommodation and i dare say that there will be thousands more today if again the department of defense would come to its senses and grant these religious accommodations yeah i would take a shot at that as well eric because you your question gets to the heart of the matter and i i mean i think it's pretty clear the department of defense has no intention of of issuing any exemptions for religious purposes i mean i think they've always basically stated that and that that's what the main reason we're here but but i want just think for a minute what kind of a person is willing to stand in the gap for their friends scripture tells us right there's no greater love as a man than this that he'd lay down his life for a friend that's a pretty strong religious statement these are the kind of people who make these decisions to to to sign up um to serve they have a servant's heart and then to to to disrespect that servant's heart with this kind of a rule just violates all kinds of common sense and and ethics and and great traditions of our of our great country and so that's we're at a bit of a at an inflection point to say the least this is one issue that i think is the inflection point of of the governing philosophy of this country but what roger has done with this bill this is why i call it elegant because some you know so we have some pretty hard feelings about some people in the dod in the chain of command but what this does is it doesn't necessarily criticize the chain of command it takes this burden from them you know there are times when we need to give our commanders flexibility and then there are times when we need to prescribe the you know one of the great things about the exceptionalism of america is that our military is led by civilians and people that elect those civilians are the people we respond to we have different jobs whether you carry whether you carry a weapon fly a jet you know a sale whether you have stripes or stars or eagles their job's different than our job and our job is to set policy and occasionally that policy needs to be very prescriptive this bill is very prescriptive and i would think every commander because remember at the end of the day there's only one commander in the and that's the commander-in-chief so everybody else is carrying out his orders and so the congress the united states has this opportunity in the national defense authorization act that needs to come to the floor we're already dangerously late no other country is waiting on us certainly not our adversaries and this is just one more thing that that's one more reason why we need to pass the ndaa so that we have a ready ready deployable committed military that's adequately paid compensated and knows that we have their backs yes you talked a little bit about how this is going to have a direct effect on the number of people who want to even serve right who are in the military right now who want to continue to serve but do you think that is the ultimate goal when you're looking at the bigger picture when you look at the spending for defense yeah so i have a heart you know i try to avoid getting in the heads of other people or impugning their motives i don't know what motivates them but it's hard not to be a little bit cynical when you consider the threats in our world you guys i mean in case we hadn't noticed china successfully tested a hypersonic missile recently that that orbited the entire earth a missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead and capable of avoiding our detection they're not screwing around and by the way they don't care about their men and women that wear the uniform they just order them to do it and um and so i do you do sort of wonder what is your goal in all of this um i want every mom and dad in america who has children to consider to be proud if their child should make a decision to join the military what i don't want is every mom and dad in america advising their children whatever you do don't join that outfit because they're going to strip you of more liberties than you're willing to defend yeah so yeah i think it has a real readiness component to it and whether or not that's the goal it certainly is what's being accomplished if we're not careful yeah it's here yeah let's um all righty i got to get wait justice i got to get to committee here and i'm still good go go ahead we're run by our scheduler yes course i do think there's a great possibility of that and this has been included in the on the house side already so i think that's a great first step and there is a path to victory i would sure like to think that there would be as well yes sir i think that every branch of the military is going to be handing handling this differently and certainly they're being threatened with court martial then mike i think this is your expertise do you think anyone might be court-martialed through this it's definitely a fact that commanders have been using the threat of court martial whether that is a hollow threat or it's being used to pressure or coerced service members to get the vaccine uh remains to be seen um i do think that it's an interesting point that it's interesting fact that uh the dod has now admitted that it is it has been granting although relatively few it has been granting some medical exemptions but that thus far it has not granted any religious exemptions so we are now at a point where religion is being treated on a far less favorable status than than other types of of issues such as uh medical waivers etc and and once again that is that violates federal law that violates the dod's own regulations um so i also think that that the department of defense knows that the vast majority of people who have not yet received the vaccine that they haven't received it because they have a sincerely held religious objection and i don't think that that's lost on the department of defense and so you know all that other people speculate and and connect the dots as to why the department of defense might be digging its heels and saying well we're not going to grant any of these religious exemptions when that continues to be the vast majority of those who have yet to be vaccinated this daniel this is why the prescriptions so important um make sure you carry out the sort of the worst case scenario we're just taking that worst case scenario off the table that relieves the commanders and relieves the department of defense it relieves the even the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff for making a different decision and they should be relieved with that relief and a quick follow-up as well remember what the first comments from the white house were in this issue is that the the president wanted the dishonorable discharge to be given to these people was it jinsaki or the president's words out of their their mouth okay so that was the first response from the commander-in-chief's office as well probably got time for one more go ahead john dr marshall the nih put out some information saying they had a study the nih put out some information saying they had a study that proved that vaccines are more effective than natural immunity you're a doctor i was wondering if you've seen this study you're familiar with it if you could open on whether or not vaccines are more effective i appreciate the question i think that their the wealth of evidence the wealth of studies would suggest that natural immunity is better than vaccination immunity and what the nih and the cdc does is they conflate an issue they want to talk about having had the virus plus the vaccine as opposed to immunity from natural immunity as opposed to the vaccine they constantly complete the issue the latest study that they put out we'll be uh in a hearing here in a few minutes submitting articles that dispute and just really tear down that study it was one of the worst quality of studies i've ever seen in my life i can't believe that they printed it and have lots of quotes from doctors just dispelling what a what a horrible representation that was as far as a study i'm begging the cdc to acknowledge natural immunity yeah i thanks for the opportunity here just have a question about what this covers is this just for the code vaccine or would this apply to auto vaccine as well yeah yeah this is specifically for the coveted vaccine [Music] [Music] we've not had that discussion okay and then final question from corey [Music] yes thank you guys um just kind of following up i guess a little bit on leo's i wonder if producer barry for [Music] well we represent 40 different uh navy seals so 40 different individual people with their individual individual consciences and faith so it would be impossible for me to uh characterize in one phrase you know all of their all of their religious beliefs uh in into one bucket um so i can say with 40 different individuals you've got 40 different beliefs uh and that's that's reality right that that's human nature uh but you know i will say that i've spoken to each of them and i've asked them uh about their sincerely held religious beliefs about their objection to the vaccine and the good news is that for american citizens and for service members really the only burden they carry is to establish that they have a sincerely held religious belief that the government is substantially burdening and that's exactly what is happening here is that they are the the government is forcing them to choose between their faith and their service and once that happens the burden now rests on the government on the on the department of defense to show why it should be able to do that uh what is its compelling interest and how is that compelling interest furthered by the least respect least restrictive means and thus far nobody in the department of defense has been able to do that in fact of the hundreds possibly thousands of religious accommodation denials that we've seen every single one of them is identical and by literally the only thing that's different is the the name of the recipient of the denial everything else has is is the proverbial rubber stamp carbon copy of one another which again suggests that the department of defense is not taking its its role seriously it's not taking religious liberty seriously um but i can tell you that these navy seals each take their faith very very seriously and they don't want to be kicked out of the military everybody that i've talked to they do not want to be separated involuntarily they want to continue to serve right there's a famous saying that the american soldier doesn't fight because he hates what the enemy that lies in front of him he fights because he loves the country that lies behind him and i'm asking the department of defense please don't cause these these brave warriors to begin to lose trust and confidence in the country that lies behind them that they love so much thank you close the comments kevin i think okay i i want to wrap it up with just one more thought i want to put a name names and faces on this story i mentioned yesterday that i sat down with the navy seal and listened to his story and just how one size doesn't fit all there's no way the cdc can have a policy to to take care of every situation like this and nor can can the dod as an army doctor once upon a time myself this is how i would view one of mike's clients coming in a navy seal who's 19 years of age young and healthy i would talk to him one-on-one about the vaccine and the potential benefits and the risk that navy seal officer i'm talking about has a 50 out of a million chance of getting heart inflammation a swollen heart from this vaccine that's going to put him out of action for six months that same otherwise healthy navy seal uh maybe five out of a million chance of getting hospitalized probably even less than that as good as shape as they're in so i'm the army doctor and i'm trying to keep my my platoon ready to go ready for action which is worse which which is better and that's why you can't apply one size fits all to everything on the other hand if there was a 55 year old person in the military with type 2 diabetes i would be begging him to get the vaccination and the booster i support the vaccine i don't support mandates i don't support one size fits all and then i want to take it to the religious freedom side of this again like mike said you listen to 40 navy seals why why they want a religious exemption everyone is different i think our chaplains do an amazing job in the military why aren't they involved in this process of listening to this soldier's story and saying i get it you have a deep seated faith here you've made a decision based upon prayer you visited with your pastor your family uh all these people i think that god speaks through the friends and and you're my my god usually talks to me through my wife very often so i think that there that there is an element of individuality here with this nation has always stood to fight for um and just close once again senator schumer please bring the nda to the floor so we can vote on this amendment and make sure that our soldiers don't get a dishonorable discharge thank you so much

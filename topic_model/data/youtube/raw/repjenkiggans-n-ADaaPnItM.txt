welcome back everybody we have now established uh Communications let's bring in congresswoman Jan kiggins we'll try this again the Republican from Virginia joining us now congresswoman um uh you're going with speaker McCarthy on a congressional trip to the southern Border tomorrow what do you expect to come from it that's right we're very excited to head with speaker McCarthy and a few other uh a group of freshmen there just to see the reality of the Border I visited there about six months ago so it's it's been a few months but we're expecting to see the Christ the full-blown crisis the humanitarian crisis the drug crisis uh the wide open border nothing has changed really since Joe Biden took office but especially since Republicans have taken the majority back in the house it's an issue that we continue to highlight uh and we want to to invite the media and everyone else in America to see what is actually going on down there and we see these groups making these trips congresswoman all the time and we hear the outrage and Fox News has been showing what's going on at that border on a daily basis and yet nothing changes to your point the administration is just turning a blind eye how is that possible and how can you get this point across yeah Joe Biden is not doing his job the Biden Administration and not only is he not protecting our Sovereign borders of the Southern border but just that message that it sends that he doesn't prioritize our national security China's watching and the world is watching and we see what's happened last week with the Chinese surveillance balloon that overflow our country the entire part of our country and we did nothing about it and not only that no answers have been provided to the American people our president we demand and that Americans deserve that our president answers questions for us but that show of weakness is really what's projecting from this Administration and Republicans are there we are the new majority Americans spoke in November and and put us there uh so that we can kick and scream and and we will demand answers from the Biden Administration we can't continue to project weakness which is what we've done we're seeing the fentanyl crisis I mean it's the number one killer of of Americans age 18 to 45 that's ridiculous not only that we are seeing an increase in Chinese Nationals that are crossing the border we've seen an 800 percent increase the last three months of 2022. Chinese Nationals that are now coming into our country and this corresponds with this Chinese surveillance balloon so something has to happen because we cannot continue again to project this weakness the world is watching uh the world is watching you're right I also wanted to mention congresswoman I don't know if you watched the Super Bowl or not but the Navy made changes to its initial flyover plans and quietly shift it out shifted it to an all-female pilot team now I should point out you're a former Navy pilot how do you feel about this well obviously it's awesome right I'm a former helicopter pilot so just just we'll fly over with all of them and I I couldn't be more proud of them I think that all of our service men and women I mean we've we've had an opportunity this week to meet with so many of our Sailors here in the Hampton Roads area and and those men and women put their lives on the line every day in defense of our country they deserve so much they deserve resources they deserve the government to have their back they deserve a strong a strong government you know a strong nation and they're a wonderful group of people I'm proud of those women but I'm proud of all of our soldiers salmon Sailors Airmen and Marines who protect our country on a daily basis we'll leave it there on that nice no congresswoman thank you so much for joining us in safe travels to the border for your trip there thank you so much

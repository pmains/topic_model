thank you mr speaker i thank the gentleman for yielding uh i thank him for his leadership and that of the whole rules committee on having to field some really strange notions masquerading as proposals to improve the lives of the american people and we see a lot of that these days but this one on the floor today really takes the cake because it is essentially pull the plug on the affordable care act and while it says that they want to delay the cancellations of that to the insurance companies have written to policyholders the bill does not mandate so this is a conversation it's not an action uh but it does it does violence to the bill in other ways uh that uh idea that it was helping consumers was sort of the trojan horse whose underbelly uh is poisonous uh with uh in terms of the health and well-being of the american people mr speaker i rise have come to the floor on the rule because i think it's really important for members to vote against the rule as a point of fairness if we reject this rule and allow the rules committee to come back to the floor with an opportunity for there to be a democratic alternative of that would be fair and what we would do in the vote on the previous question which i urge people to vote no on would be able to vote yes or consider a voting yes on a bill that does exactly what consumers need in terms of this uh cancellation uh area first of all it would say that there would be a real delay a real for one year for the implementation uh in terms of the individual policy uh holders that's just this piece of the bill that is the question individual policy 95 of the american people as has been said who have policies that they like can keep them it's this five percent and that's a lot of people i want to minimize that but nonetheless it's a discrete market so let's address that district market and in our previous question we bring up a bill that that addresses that discrete market not only by enabling them to hold their policies for a year but by requiring that the insurance companies must tell people not that you're cancelled but these and and we want to sign you up again at a higher cost instead insurance companies would be obliged to tell people what their options are what their options are under the affordable care act in terms of having no lifetime limits on their policies no annual limits on their policies no pre-existing condition increasing the cost of their policy or preventing them from holding their policy should they become sick a b it would also make sure that the insurance companies tell people what their options are in the exchanges or that they may qualify for a subsidy uh that they may compe in that market's place the insurance companies are competing our companies is the free market this exchange they are competing uh for their policy and therefore that is has already lowered cost to consumers so they may have a better policy with better um benefits at a lower cost and if they qualify get a subsidy to do it in addition to that it's really important uh in every respect that the uh and everything we do not only just for this of individual marketplace for people to understand the benefits of the affordable care act that are available to them i mentioned no pre-existing condition no annual limits no lifetime limits but also that already for the past over one year of young people can be on their parents over three million people have benefited in that regard tens of millions of seniors have benefited from the um the free prevention checkup mammograms whatever kinds of things prevention and wellness exams free no copay no deductible already seniors are experienced lowering costs for their prescription drugs because of the affordable care act already small children cannot be discriminated against nor their families and seeking insurance because they have a pre-existing condition imagine a child born with a defect and i think for life they have a pre-existing condition which will cost them dearly in terms of premiums if they can even get insurance and then it would be uh with limits not so that's all change that's why on this upton bill which as i said is uh uh it not only it does bad things the affordable care act in terms of uh disrupting the the risk pools it tries to masquerade as something that does something positive which it does not and that is why the upton bill is opposed by a broad coalition of groups the american heart association american diabetes association the american cancer society action network national partnership for women and families paralyzed veterans of america anyone with a pre-existing medical inc a hundred million people are in families with people with pre-existing medical conditions all of them benefit the stories are so glorious and so beautiful about what a difference the affordable care act has made families especially those with small children or those with pre-existing uh conditions and to seniors and again being a woman is no longer a pre-existing medical condition so this is um this is this is politics it's not about policy it isn't any attempt to improve the affordable care act one way to improve it though is what we have in our previous question give the state commissioners state insurance commissioners the authority all of them some of them have it but ensure that all of them have uh the authority to investigate and act upon rate increases as well as the nature of these letters that were sent out without the integrity that they should have had again we require that they also in these letters that the insurance companies uh make sure that people know what their opportunities are so what we are proposing today really does make a difference in fact we wanted to get this requirement of the uh insurance commissioners into the underlying bill and then we said okay we'll do that as an improvement today as a day that we can do that by voting no on this rule and enabling us to bring a bill to the floor that would do that uh with that mr mr speaker i urge our colleagues to support the affordable care act support what it does for america's families stand with those who fought for social security for medicare affordable care for all americans because these are three pillars of equal weight in terms of the economic and health security of the american people they honor the vows of our founders for life a healthier life liberty the liberty to pursue your happiness so that you're not job locked or constrained by a policy but free to follow passion uh to start to be self-employed to start a business to change jobs to be entrepreneurial life liberty pursuit of not happiness vote no on the rule without your back the balance of my time you

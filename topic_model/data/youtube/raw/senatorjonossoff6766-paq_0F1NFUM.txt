thank you senator hawley uh senator ossoff you're recognized for your questions thank you mr chairman thank you to our witnesses for your service mr rascott like to raise with you a matter that is of particular significance to my constituents in georgia given that we host the port of savannah the fourth largest deep water port in the country a vital logistics hub for the southeast united states and a host of major shipping terminals a 2022 gao report found significant issues and delays with the deployment of new radiation monitors that customs and border protection operates at ports like savannah what impact might these delays and issues have on port operations how can operators of ports like the port of savannah be confident that cwmd will take into account their specific needs and provide them with the tools needed to ensure cargo is scanned for radiological and other threats at the port of savannah thank you for the question uh senator and we and we certainly appreciate gaos looking at the rpm program and we are taking all of their recommendations to heart and actually i'm raising the level of uh how we address those issues i think we were sort of maybe stuck in a little bit of middle management on that but i met with met with the deputy commissioner customs and we continue to meet to make sure we're aligned in our expectations as you know we provide those systems for uh cbp um and they work in the port i you know we're in the middle of a of a sort of a modernization a recapitalization of the uh radiation portal monitors um we're providing 200 of the new ones to high volume ports and to try and reduce the nuisance alarms which is what slows down the flow through the ports savannah is on that list to get those i believe that they're waiting until the the ocean terminals finish before they actually do the deployment and but we work closely with cbp on that and we're very willing to facilitate uh any conversation between ourselves cvp and your port officials um i can get your name and we'll we'll get it we'll get it going the other piece is even though we aren't deploying the new units to savannah we have been working um through our transformational r d programs on some machine learning and artificial intelligence it's a program called ernie i don't name them but um it's a way to reduce the nuisance alarms and we are that technology is going forward in savannah so i i'd be happy to either sit with your staff and give a full brief on that or uh really just meet with the poor partners and make sure they're up to speed with what's going on well i appreciate that was gonna be my next question uh for your commitment to communicate directly with port leadership and other relevant parties at the port to ensure that those lines of communication are open senator we're very willing to do that and and will you commit to working with my office to expedite as possible and practical the deployment of those technologies whether it's the software platforms or the new hardware as possible to ensure the port of savannah is secure the people of georgia are safe and national security is protected yes thank you i appreciate that commitment i'd like to ask you as well about dhs collaboration with the centers for disease control and prevention based in atlanta cdc has worked closely with your office in the past including to test air in public spaces for dangerous pathogens and cdc is part of the biowatch program analyzing air filters for biological threats how can you deepen your partnerships with the cdc and what role does the cdc currently play in your ongoing programs and activities um actually sir the through the covet pandemic i would say that we have become closer to cb a cdc than we have ever been before we have worked hand in glove with them and many of the travel and transportation issues that we had be it airport screening and other things i talk nearly daily to the leadership of cdc i've worked with them on for the airline issues for the cruise ship issues we also work them on bio detection issues and they are pro i spoke about earlier we're taking a new strategic direction in buyer surveillance they're a big partner with that as long as with the along with the hhs and asper the other piece of that is is we do boiler surveillance with our national biosurveillance integration center it's a your staffs get these reports we put our reports on all that's going on in the world in the uh in the bio arena cdc is creating a similar but not but complementary capability under the cares act we have got people down there on the ground floor helping them with the less what we don't need is two we call it nbc we don't need two end bigs we need another entity that does what nbc doesn't do so we're working hand in glove with them to make sure that we get the mo the government gets the most out of these two surveillance centers so i would i don't think our relationship with cdc can be stronger we just signed in a letter of agreement with them that will ease our support of their operations be it at the airports or other ports of entry based on the lessons learned through kovid so um and as i said sir i talked to their leadership nearly daily thank you mr rascon final question for you mr rascott and also for you dr sherman please over the long run what are the potential privacy or fourth amendment or health privacy implications of the deployment of these sensors at scale perhaps in some future scenarios beyond just at ports of entry have you given any thought to that to the privacy implications of the proliferation of biosensors across our economy we can start with you dr sherman yes thank you that um uh the issue of privacy with respect to the biosensors is it's not uh something that we look closely at as part of our review in april so if um you'd be willing i'd like to take that question back and uh provide a response to your office certainly and mr rasca thank you dr sherman and mr rascal just based upon your experience and expertise i'd invite you even if it's not something that you've recently committed deep thought to to give the committee a sense of how you approach that issue and how you consider it yeah at the the department at large and you've heard secretary marcus say uh how important privacy is to all of us and um so no it's one of our primary concerns whenever we put out any sort of surveillance piece and we we consult regularly with our chief privacy officer uh on any of these type of issues sir so it's in it it i wanted it's in the foreground of all these discussions and the secretary's clear on how that works well these technologies are obviously vital to national security and public health but as with any system of sensors as they become more advanced and more prevalent we do need to consider the potential long-term implications for for privacy and civil liberties so dr sherman let's have my office and yours have a conversation about that all right thank you thank you mr chairman

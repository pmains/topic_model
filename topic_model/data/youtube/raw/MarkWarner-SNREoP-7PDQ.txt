we've seen a white house and a president that it first tried to deny that there were going to be economic consequences of this illness and then when they reluctantly acknowledged that our economy was being hit what do they come up with traditional macroeconomic tools let's do a monetary policy rate cut let's talk about a general stimulus to all families let's do a payroll tax cut these are not the tools that we need to use at this moment in this challenge we don't know how long this economic challenge will extend but what we need to do and why I'm proud to support these efforts is we need targeted assistance to those workers and families who are being directly affected by the coronavirus that's why today I'm leading a letter with 33 of my Democratic colleagues to the president urging him yes to take economic action but to have that economic action targeted to the two universes that we know are effective no one should lose their job their pay or not have the freedom and take care of their children if they're home from school if they have to self quarantine or if they get sick the whole universe of individuals we see this particularly in Washington State we're gonna see this unfortunately I believe across the country in the coming weeks where people are going to follow the directions of the health care officials and help to self quarantine they should not pay an economic price and then there's another whole set of industries from airline the hotel to restaurant to a whole series of service industries whoo and Ben Cardin will speak to this in a moment many times small businesses they just aren't going to have customers we've got to make sure that we get economic assistance to those workers as well what you have here is the first round of specific items from UI two paid six leave the direct support for small businesses CDBG a grants and I would echo again something Senator Brown and I've been working on if we're going to give the kind of relief on that mortgage or rent payment we are going to need forbearance from the regulators for those institutions that actually provide that leave this is a great first step senator Cardin's gonna close us out with small businesses we may need to do more but let's make sure that in this initial activity for those workers and families who are directly affected they get this assistance right away

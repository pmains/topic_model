one of the questions asked by a reporter when we were leaving afghanistan is what is our exit strategy from afghanistan and i replied that the exit strategy is really the new strategy that the obama administration has proposed it's one it's not just military if all we do is simply add 17 000 more troops 10 000 marines and a bunch of helicopters that's not going to win this uh this battle with the terrorists even if we add to that 4 000 trainers to train the afghan army to train the afghan police double them in size and increase their proficiency that's not going to get the job done we've got to help those uh particularly the the afghanistan farmers in uh southern part of the country to get off of poppies to stop going poppies for the opening trade which helps support the taliban and help them to diversify their agricultural economy this is a country a surprise it's a country that as recently as the 1970s fed itself there is a lot of fruits and vegetables and wheat and cotton and saffron and stuff like that they can do that again part of what effort is going to be the civilian part of our strategy the president will be to help diversify the economy of this country diversify their agricultural economy get them off of poppies to help but develop their mining and mineral economy they have a lot of those valuable minerals and those mountains that are all over that country they have the ability to create electricity from windmill farms off their mountains from solar energy fields huge expanse of land where solar energy would work very well they have rivers for hydro you have irrigation systems that are centuries old and well proven this is a country where the oil and natural gas resources are three times what they were believed to be just as recently as a year ago and this is a country where corruption is rampant at every level from the national to the provincial to the local level part of what our strategy is is to work on all those things not just the military side but to make sure we help strengthen the economy help get rid of the corruption out of the government and make sure that people can make a living and to be self-supporting without relying on opium or frankly resorting to terrorism so that's it's a smart strategy it's one that i think is uh one that we should implement we've got a new leadership team to do just that i met some some folks who were in the military in southern afghanistan from delaware most of our delawareans are over in iraq uh the national guard and other units here in iraq we have so we have a c5 aircraft c-17 aircraft that sometimes fly into afghanistan for the most part our folks overseas from iraq i met with a bunch of them there but a handful of them in delaware really cool thing one of the fellas uh from the captain from from dover was over there he pulled out his delaware flag he knew i was coming i met him by a bunch of folks that breakfasted one of their uh southern afghanistan he pulled out his delaware flag we took a picture it's a cool thing

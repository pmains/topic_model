hi I'm Julie fate Sullivan my husband Dan is running for the US Senate so I'd like to share a little bit about our story we met while I was working for Senator Ted Stevens and the first place I brought Dan was to my family's fish camp on the Yukon River he fell hard for me and for Alaska and after Dan completed his active-duty service in the Marines we came home to Fairbanks to raise our family but Dan is more than a great husband and father as Alaska's Attorney General he protected women from domestic abuse and fought to protect us all from Obama care as the DNR Commissioner he expanded Alaskan energy production and created jobs Dan Sullivan a husband a father a proven leader he's accomplished a lot but more than anything dan has a big heart and a strong commitment to making things better in Alaska I'm Dan Sullivan and I approve this message

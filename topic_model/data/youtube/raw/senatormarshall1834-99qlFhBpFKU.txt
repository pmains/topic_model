as a gentleman from Kansas dr. Marshall for three minutes Thank You chairman for the opportunity to come and talk and share some of my 30 years of experience as an ob/gyn in rural Kansas as most of the members of the committee know 92 people die in this country every day 92 people die in this country every day from opioid addiction what I wanted to do was described a couple Sentinel events why why did we end up in this situation and as I as I look back in these last 10 years the number of pills that I would send home for a post-op patient doubled for the average c-section the average hysterectomy all of a sudden there's each week to get the people that post-op visit the number of pills they wouldn't need literally doubled so I went back to try to figure out why and how come and the first thing I think of patient Bill of Rights came about 1993 or so and over the next 10 years there was a great document patients suddenly began to expect that they should have no pain no pain after surgery they were coming to the ER at the sprained ankle and expect to have no pain and the demand for narcotics went up and up somewhere in the early 2000s something was introduced called a pain skill and they called it the fifth vital sign it's probably the worst thing I've ever seen introduced to my medical career where they suddenly described the amount of pain they had which was very subjective and beyond that eventually became part of a measure of how good of medicine you were practically ambersmith1978 severy six hours they were getting them every four hours and the PCA pumps increased doses so what I'm trying to say is we almost double the amount of takes people were getting in the hospital and then they wanted twice the amount to go home with as well so efficient physicians were faced with this struggle of saying well I don't think you need this much but patients becoming more and more in control of how many of their own healthcare so I think those are a couple reasons why we ended up here and I think there needs to be some reason done I'd like to point towards Valley Hope at in Kansas they treated over 300,000 patients over the past 50 years they've kept incredible statistics they have incredible treatment plans and what they taught me is about a month after release a month after they started their to their path to recovery that they had a second physiological reaction and that's when they these people OD and die people need to recognize that for a month that they need to have very close treatment and probably for two months and even a year so it's during that second episode when they went before they had treatment they were taking a certain amount of heroin and a handful of pills and a pint of whiskey when they retreated from that for a month and they went back to that same dose they overdosed and stopped dying we need to understand what kills people is that as that if I gave anybody enough morphine you would stop breathing so they're unable to metabolize that we need to recognize that that's a very critical moment treatment plans cannot last a week they're gonna last months and years probably we need to make sure adequately funding outpatient treatment and that we're making sure that there's good follow-up at home and we need to reward facilities like Valley Hope who have great outcomes great long-term outcomes mr. chairman thank you so much for taking on this task and look forward to working with you as always chair thanks the gentleman gentleman heels

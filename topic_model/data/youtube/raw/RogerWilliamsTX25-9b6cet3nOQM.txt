they're doing that well because some ordinary people get swept up into it they lose their assets they lose their businesses doesn't affect the super rich they get out of it we're talking middle america that gets hit joining us now congressman roger williams republican from texas sir you have a personal story about the estate tax will you take it through us please well i do stuart uh my father started our business in 1939 a small business i lost both my parents in the late 80s and i was the only heir of the of the business uh shortly after they passed away the irs was in my office saying here's your tax bill and it was a sizable a sizable bill i didn't have the ability to pay it i had to uh consider actually taking bankruptcy into business that employed 400 people was profitable uh fortunately i was able to uh sit down and uh and uh work a situation out where i paid my taxes over a 20-year period uh you know it's money that could have gone to start another business could money could have gone to help people uh uh reach some of their goals and of course has gone into government 18 trillion debt that's the big objection to the estate tax isn't it that it sweeps in like farms and small businesses which have been built up over a lifetime and they get hit with the estate tax that's just not right you're a sponsor of this bill i think well i am and i was very anxious to sponsor because it's for traditionally it's always been a money grab and it's double taxation and you're pulling money out of the private sector you're pulling capital out of the private sector that could go back in to create jobs and like i say goes to the federal government that we don't know where it's going but you know that president obama will veto this um i'm pretty sure he wouldn't he well i'm sure that i i can't speak for the president but i know he's spoken against it but i think was the right thing and a good thing to get out of the house yesterday i think it'll pass the senate and let's see what president obama thinks about it i think in principle most people would agree with you however in practice i don't think we're ever going to see the estate tax go away a president obama will veto it and b if you did get rid of it at the federal level the states would simply introduce their own much higher estate tax i don't think it's ever going to go away would you agree with me on that well i don't know if that's correct i know here in texas we don't have the tax and we get along just fine uh and uh so i i i don't know but the fact of the matter is it is double taxation as i said and you know that a lot of the democrats will say it's a small amount of the population but it doesn't matter if it's one person or million people it's just wrong and it's capital it could go into the into our economy to help create jobs it's a job destroyer the rich don't pay anyway i mean the rich is surrounded by lawyers who will get them out of this tax i mean unless they die a very early age intestate as they say but there's an army of lawyers to protect the wealthy people in this country well there's countless number of stories just like mine from family farms are small as in if you remember back in 2011 uh that was the year that you could die and not pay any estate taxes and uh one of the famous stories is of course george steinbrenner the great yankee owner passed away in 2011 and no telling what good that that money has done uh uh to help uh help people that would have gone the federal government otherwise well said congresswoman patrick morrissey i'm sorry congressman roger williams we appreciate you being with us sir thanks very much indeed thank you stewart appreciate you charlie cook young man what do you think about doing it with this you've got a long way to go

this week congressman troy carter celebrated millions of dollars coming in for a new athletic stadium for the ninth ward carter says the facility will help students and the community to grow and have updated facilities to support them i think the student that spoke said it best because at the end of the day that's what this is about it's not about us it's about them it's about the great work that they do and the great work we know they can do and the commitment that we have as leaders rather elected civic financial business or otherwise clergy or whatever our commitment is to making sure that we're providing the best possible opportunities for our young people the stadium will be open to all students and athletes in new orleans no word yet on when they will start construction

one minute thank you madam speaker i rise today to address president biden's attack on american energy independence from day one the biden administration has opposed domestic energy production in the gulf of mexico and onshore the drastic reduction in domestic energy production has made the u.s even more reliant on foreign energy since president biden took office the u.s has imported around 228 million barrels of oil from russia alone that adds up to 17.5 billion in 2021 to help fuel putin's war on ukraine and jeopardize our national security instead of increasing the amount of domestic energy production to help ease the high fuel price the president is now looking to venezuela and iran to help supply the u.s with even more foreign oil and gas we cannot allow the united states to cut funding from one tarrant to hand it out to another the united states has the world's largest oil and gas reserves we can produce energy resources more cleanly and efficiently than anywhere else in the world and we should produce them as a former offshore oil worker now a member of congress an energy independent united states is one of my top priorities in congress our country must cut back its reliance on foreign oil american oil natural gas or clean coal the method is flexible but the reason is not we must increase our domestic production of energy our national security depends on it madam speaker i yield back thank you

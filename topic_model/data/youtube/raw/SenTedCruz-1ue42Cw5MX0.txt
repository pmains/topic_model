this hearing is called to order welcome free speech is foundational to our Constitution the First Amendment and the Bill of Rights begins by protecting our rights to free speech and our democratic processes depend upon robust free speech speech with which we agree and speech with which we disagree the marketplace of ideas since the beginning of journalism there has been bias in the media from the first journalists carving on stone tablets media bias and and bias of human beings has been a fact of life but today we face an altogether different threat to the power a big tech is something that William Randolph Hearst at the height of yellow journalism could not have imagined in particular what makes the threat of political censorship so problematic is the lack of transparency the invisibility the ability for a handful of giant tech companies to decide if a particular speaker is disfavored that he or she may speak and their words simply fade into the ether that no one hears what they say and nobody knows that no one hears what they say not only does big tech have the power to silence voices which with which they disagree but big tech likewise has that has the power to collate a person's feed so that they only receive the news that comports with their own political agenda polling shows roughly 70% of Americans receive their political news from social media that power is enormous and I will tell you and travel in the state of Texas and traveling the country over and over again I've heard from Americans concerned about a consistent pattern of political bias and censorship on the part of big tech big tech enjoys a special immunity from liability under what's called section 230 of the Communications Decency Act now a great many people agree that the pattern the anti conservative bias and the pattern of censorship we're seeing from big tech is concerning the question of remedy is a more complicated one what to do about it is a thorny question it's a thorny legal question it's a thorny policy question nobody or at least nobody in their right mind wants to see a government speech police no one wants to see the federal government regulating what is allowed to be said but there at least three potential remedies that can be considered either by Congress or the administration or both the first I mentioned is section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that provides a special immunity from liability that big tech enjoys that nobody else gets the predicate for that immunity from liability is that the social media platforms were understood to be neutral public fora in other words they were simply posting what others said they weren't engaging in their own political advocacy now I will note some commentators have misunderstood the argument I'm making in this in that they've suggested that I'm arguing that section 230 requires in its statutory text that big tech companies be neutral public fora that's not my argument my argument is that big tech made effectively a bargain with Congress and a bargain with the American P people will be neutral we'll be fair we won't be biased in exchange for that we'll receive what is effectively a federal subsidy of immunity for liability if big tech wants to be partisan political speakers it has that right but it has no entitlement to a special immunity from liability under Section 230 that the New York Times doesn't enjoy that the Washington Post doesn't enjoy that nobody else enjoys other than big tech the second potential Avenue for remedy is the antitrust laws applying the antitrust laws in this area is complicated but by almost any measure the giant tech companies today are larger and more powerful than Standard Oil was when it was broken up they're larger and more powerful than AT&T was when it was broken up and if we have tech companies using the powers of monopolies to censor political speech I think that raises real antitrust issues the third potential Avenue of remedy is under principles of fraud most users of Facebook or Twitter or Google when they use those services they don't envision that they're participating in a biased forum they believe that when they speak the people who've chosen to follow them will hear what they say and there are distressing pieces of evidence that suggest that's not the case now I will note much of the argument in this topic is anecdotal it's based on one example or another example there's a reason for that because we have no data there is no transparency nobody knows how many speakers Twitter is blocking how many speakers Facebook is blocking nobody knows what the raw data is in terms of bias so one of the first things that this hearing seeks to accomplish is simply move us towards transparency to understand what the facts are argument by anecdote is less than satisfying but it is all we are left with as long as big big tech remains a black box that simply says trust us senator Khurana I joined the chairman and welcoming our witnesses this afternoon there are many areas where the Senate should be conducting oversight of the tech industry baseless allegations of anti conservative bias is not one of them we still need a full accounting of the ways that Russia used Facebook and other forms of social media to influence the 2016 election YouTube is full of misleading and outright false information about vaccines that has put the public at risk the alt-right continues to use twitter to organize and spread hate each of the companies that will be testifying here this morning failed to contain the spread of the video of the mosque shootings in New Zealand videos that can still be found on these platforms these are just a few of the real and serious issues we could investigate about the tech industry yet here we are discussing claims of anti conservative bias that have been disproven time and again one of our witnesses professor francesca Tripodi studies partisanship on social media and finds that conservative perspectives abound on Facebook Google and Twitter she describes claims of anti conservative bias as nothing more than a mix of anecdotal evidence which the Chairman has acknowledged and a failure to understand the company's algorithms and content moderation practices professor chapatis conclusions are consistent with those of media watchdog Media Matters and others that anti conservative bias simply does not exist so why are we here if anti conservative bias by the ticket industry has been proven false why in the world are we holding a hearing on it in the United States Senate the answer is simple people it's politics for decades Republicans have bashed the supposedly liberal mainstream media in an effort to work the refs and gain more favorable coverage and the strategy has worked research shows that major news outlets have over compensated for their perceived liberal bias by treating Democrats more harshly than Republicans for example the Harvard Kennedy School Shorenstein Center on media politics and public policy found that Hillary Clinton received a larger share of negative news coverage over the course of the 2016 election then Donald Donald Trump did now that two thirds of Americans get their news from social media Republicans have a new boogeyman to target big tech and just like traditional media to media tech companies have responded to false claims of bias by trying to placate the right in June 2016 Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg went to the conservative American Enterprise Institute to announce that Facebook would offer political bias training to its employees over the past two years Facebook and Twitter have dispatched emissaries to meet with Republican leaders and conservative commentators behind closed doors last summer Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey seemingly apologized in response to baseless claims that Twitter engaged in so-called shadow banning of conservatives tweeting we have a lot more work to do to earn people's trust on how we work we simply cannot allow the Republican Party to harass tech companies into weakening content moderation moderation policies that already that already failed to remove hateful dangerous and misleading content anyone who frequents social media knows that the online world can be a pretty vile place unfortunately few people know this better than another one of our witnesses Robbie Parker Robbie is the father of Emily Parker one of the 20 children and six adults murdered at Sandy Hook elementary school in December of 2012 after suffering through this terrible tragedy Robbie and his family have spent the past six plus years dealing with online harassment from conspiracy theorists who claimed the shooting was a hoax think about that Robbie had his daughter tragically taken from him while he struggled to cope with that loss he had to deal with people telling him that his daughter didn't die then he was a crisis actor paid to stage a shooting as a way for the government to confiscate people's guns to this day if you google Robbie's name you are presented with links to conspiracy sites and just yesterday I Google Robbie Parker and this is what I got two other three videos claimed the Sandy Hook was a hoax and the very first web page returned is called quote if Sandy Hook was not a hoax how do you explain the Robbie Parker video and quote this is over six years since the shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school and these lies are still being featured by Google I had hoped to discuss this and other concerns I have with Google during today's hearing unfortunately the Chairman rejected Google's proposed witness and wouldn't even let him attend at my invitation so there is an empty seat over there at the witness table this is important because Robbie is an example of the real world harm that comes with content posted on the Internet he is an example of why strong content moderation is necessary now I understand that some conservatives have had content removed based on Facebook Google's and Twitter's content moderation policies but let's be clear it's not because they're conservative after all Google and Facebook are two of the biggest and most profitable companies on the planet acknowledged by the chair - they did not reach this level of success by turning away a portion of their potential customers if conservatives have had their content removed maybe they should look at the content at the content that they're posting maybe they shouldn't post lies about Planned Parenthood selling baby body parts maybe they shouldn't inflame religious tensions by misrepresenting the tenets of one of the world's major religions or maybe they shouldn't use their platform to harass and spread lies about a dad who lost his little girl in the most tragic way possible I hope that going forward this subcommittee will focus on the real issues facing America like hate speech like voter suppression like looking into the emoluments clause that's what I'd like this committee to pursue mr. chairman thank you Thank You senator Hirono and now to address the question of whether or not bias and censorship exists we have a member of this committee who indeed has faced it firsthand senator Blackburn Thank You mr. chairman and I think it is fair to say I've had a couple of brushes with social media companies in the past couple of years and I will also say it is indeed a pleasure and an honor to live in a country that values free speech we see this as a cherished constitutional right in authoritarian countries like Russia or China there is no such thing as free speech and if you were to voice any form of dissent or criticism then surprise a communist party official shows up on your doorstep and they take you to prison fortunately we live in America I will tell you that I do think it's time for tech companies like Google and Facebook to start embracing the spirit of the First Amendment not just for their own employees but for all the Americans who use their platforms what value is there in platforms that are more concerned with inserting their bias than providing a neutral place for people to discuss their ideas companies like Facebook and Google which have transformed society in revolutionary ways need to recognize that with that power comes great responsibility Facebook is a corporation not a state actor yet Facebook runs a forum for debate like the town public square except there is no mayor or sheriff that would be allowed to police conversation the way that Facebook censors conversation online last June I published an op-ed urging Silicon Valley companies to respect a diversity of opinions and to address allegations of conservative bias on their platforms if they truly were impartial actors encountering a series of unfortunate events lay their case out for the American public lay out your case my suggestions really didn't go over very well in the Silicon Valley little has changed since then earlier this month Google bent the need to employ demands to shut down its external AI Ethics Board because heaven forbid a woman serving on the committee was the president of a respected conservative think-tank for these employees in Silicon Valley conservative credentials are absolutely a scarlet letter unfortunately Facebook is no different by one count Facebook had nearly two dozen scandals over privacy violations in 2018 alone at some point Facebook will have to atone for these sins clearly gdpr isn't causing the company much pain if anything it appears to have solidified their dominance in the marketplace while increasing barriers to entry for potential competitors I think we should be clear that at least here in the United States Senate Mark Zuckerberg pivot to privacy isn't fooling anybody this sudden support for european-style privacy protections is disingenuous by allowing the Europeans to force their hand when it comes to addressing content including political speech Facebook can cloak itself in altruistic cloth while conveniently evading any constitutional arguments back at home in order to arrive at consensus on privacy data security and net neutrality issues we're maintaining a bipartisan posture both on the commerce and Judiciary Committees this week senator Klobuchar and I sent a letter to the FTC urging stronger action for bad actors in the tech sector Americans are rightly concerned about who owns their virtual you they want to be certain that their privacy is protected both in the physical and the virtual space the FTC has a responsibility to hold tech companies accountable for securing their platforms big tech is accustomed to living in a bubble with the same comfortable and progressive ideas but let me tell you right now that bubble is bursting when I voiced my concerns about infringement on our freedom of speech a senior Google search engineer called me a terrorist I was a congressman when I voiced my concerns in 2018 and I sit before you now as a senator and a member of this no matter what I will continue to protect the right of Americans to engage in free speech even speech I disagree with I wish big tech which show the same respect whether Californians like it or not they are going to need to work with us and negotiate with us to see how we can bring meaningful privacy reforms to the people of the United States of America I yield back Thank You senator Blackburn will now introduce each of the two witnesses on our first panel the first witness is Carl Carlos Monge Jr who is twitter's director of policy and philanthropy for the United States and Canada before joining Twitter mr. mange spent over a decade in public service including multiple senior level in the Obama administration from 2014 through 2016 he served as in the US Department of Transportation rising to acting under secretary and assistant secretary for transportation policy where he oversaw the implementation of surface trans transportation programs prior to joining the Department of Transportation mr. mange served for three years in the White House Domestic Policy Council where he oversaw all aspects of policy message and invent development across a wide spectrum of domestic policy issues mr. Manjhi is from New Orleans a first-generation American and a graduate of Harvard College the second witness is Neil Potts Neil Potts is the public policy director at Facebook where he currently leads the content policy and strategic response teams he oversees the development and implementation of Facebook's community standards the rules for what types of content are allowed on the platform mr. Potts previously spent a decade in Washington DC as a public policy and legislative affairs attorney including five years at the Truman national security project he is a veteran of the United States Marine Corps having served five years as an intelligence officer after graduating with a degree in mathematics from the United States Naval Academy and he's a graduate at the University of Virginia School of Law welcome to you both I would ask that you stand raise your white right hand and be sworn in do you swear or affirm that the testimony you're about to give before this committee will be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you God Mr Bond G you may go first thank you sir chairman Cruze ranking member of row no members of the subcommittee thank you for the opportunity to appear today Twitter is an American company and Twitter's purpose is to serve the public conversation we welcome perspectives and insights from diverse sources and embrace being a platform where the open and free exchange of ideas can occur we put the people who use our service first in every step we take we have rules in place that are designed to ensure the safety and security of the people who come to our service safety and free expression go hand-in-hand both online and in the real world if people don't feel safe to speak they very often won't these two guideposts free expression for all perspectives and rules of the road to promote safety are not only in our users interest but also paramount to sustaining our business let me be clear about an important and foundational fact Twitter does not use political viewpoints perspectives or party affiliation to make any decisions whether related to automatically rank and content or how we enforce our rules every day elected representatives use Twitter to communicate with their constituents with their peers and international counterparts in the United States every single senator and governor and House member has a Twitter account millions of people around the globe take to Twitter to engage in conversations on a wide range of issues the notion that we would silence any political perspective is antithetical to our commitment to free expression there has never been a time in history when individuals have had more tools to reach a broad audience and Twitter continues to be one of the most popular platforms for conservative voices in preparation for this hearing and to better inform the members of the subcommittee our data scientists analyzed tweets sent by all members of the House and Senate for a five-week period from February to March of this year after controlling for factors like number of followers we observed that there is no statistically significant difference between the number of times a tweet by a Democrat is viewed versus a tweet by a Republican their performance is the same because the Twitter platform does not take sides let me address a few high profile issues that have led some to question our impartiality in July of last year we acknowledged that some accounts including those Republicans and Democrats were not being Auto suggested when people were searching for specific name this means that you had to hit enter before seeing them in the search results this issue impacted 600 thousand accounts across the globe the vast majority of which were not political and however 10 accounts a Republican members of Congress were affected the autosuggest issue happened because Twitter had tweaked a behavioral based algorithm designed to reduce abuse specifically we're down ranking content if a significant number of an accounts followers had histories of breaking our rules once we identify this issue we've properly resolved it within 24 hours and it is important to note that because Twitter is so transparent follower counts of those members of Congress spiked following the publicity on the issue I would like to discuss another recent issue the account at unplanned movie this account was caught in our automated systems used to detect ban evasion ban evasion technology is an important tool to reduce the number of repeat offenders on our platform specifically the person who created the movie's account was previously suspended for breaking our rules we reinstated at unplanned movie as soon who was brought to our attention that the account was not being used for similar violative activity and the hashtag unplanned movie became a trending topic on Twitter many other accusations of bias stem from issues about how our platform organizes information and often very serious violations of our Terms of Service which are not always visible to the public I explained these in greater detail in my written testimony every day we see hundreds of millions of tweets and thousands of violations of our policies we try to get each one of those right but we do make mistakes on all sides of the political spectrum and all around the world we will consistently work to get better and to be more transparent about our efforts senator Blackburn we apologize to your Senate office and to the campaign but on behalf of Twitter I apologize again we made the wrong call we developed policies governing advertisements that run on Twitter that try to balance allowing our advertisers to promote messages with protecting individuals who did not ask to see that ad I'm sorry Twitter wouldn't be Twitter if everyone had the same viewpoint we strive to balance safety and freedom of expression every day we believe strongly and being impartial and we endeavour to enforce our rules dispassionately we work extremely hard to make sure our algorithms are fair and aim to be transparent and fix issues when we make mistakes in order to maintain the trust of our users advertisers and the general public thank you and I look forward to your questions Thank You mr. Potts Thank You chairman chairman Cruz ranking member Hirono and distinguished members of the subcommittee thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today my name is Neil Potts and I'm a director at Facebook with oversight of our community standards those are the rules which allow which types of content we have on the platform I'm a graduate the United States Naval Academy and the University of Virginia of Virginia School of Law prior to joining Facebook I serve as a ground intelligence officer in the United States Marine Corps where I was deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom Facebook's mission is to give people the power to build community and to bring the world closer together more than 2 billion people come to our platform every month to connect with family to connect with friends to find out what's going on in their world to build their businesses to volunteer or donate to organizations they care about and to help those in need are you sure share billions of pictures stories and videos about their lives and their beliefs every single day it's this diversity of viewpoints expression experiences that highlights much of what is good about Facebook but can also mean that it's tough to make decisions about what should be and should not be allowed on the platform I would like to make one point clear Facebook does not favor one political viewpoint over another and we do not suppress conservative speech we are committed to encouraging dialogue and the free flow of ideas by designing our products to give people a voice by implementing standards and to ensure a fair and transparent processes for removing content that does not belong on Facebook we created our community standards to standardize our content removal decisions so they can be applied consistently fairly neutrally to community that transcends regions cultures religions and languages we take that neutrality seriously our artificial intelligence algorithms have been designed our human content reviewers have been trained to ensure that content is reviewed in a neutral unbiased way and we're really focused on what's needed to keep our users safe our community standard should not prohibit users from discussing controversial topics or supporting a debate at point of view nor do they favor opinions on one end of the political spectrum or another given the vast amount of content we have on our platform our reviewers have to respond to millions of reports each week from people all over the world we we don't always get it right you know there have been a number of high profile content removal incidents we're taking several steps to respond to those concerns raised by the subcommittee and others first a community standards enforcement report twice a year now that report describes the amount and types of content we have taken action against we published comprehensive guidelines to provide more clarity around content moderation decisions second we have solicited external feedback on our content moderation policies and sources across the political spectrum for example former senator Kyl he is leading a team gathering insights from members of Congress a number of conservative groups assessing whether there are any ways which the companies unintentionally biased against conservative points of view another example is Laura Murphy she's a national civil liberties and civil rights leader who's guiding an independent civil rights audit of our platform third we've created an appeals process for content that's been removed from our platform as hate speech we're working to extend that process further by creating an independent oversight board of experts for on free speech and Safety to render binding and transparent decisions on these appeals fourth we've partnered with over 100 groups across the political spectrum we're continuing to expand that list of outside port partner organizations to ensure we receive feedback on our content policies from a diverse set of viewpoints and finally we're getting our work to refine enhance the quality of our machine learning the machine learning which is the our first line of defense the cosmic content assessment on our platform we hope that these improvements and safeguards will help ensure that Facebook remains a platform that enables the broadest spectrum of free expression possible while still keeping our space welcoming and safe for the entire community there's a lot more to do but we're proud of the significant progress we've made over the last few years still we know that people have questions I appreciate the opportunity to be here today thank you to both of the witnesses and I'll note also for the record that originally there was planned to be a third witness from Google as the ranking member observed however Google declined to provide a witness of comparable seniority and responsibilities in the company as the other two witnesses here and so accordingly this committee will be conducting a separate and subsequent hearing focused directly on Google and the issues of Google's censorship of speech gentlemen let me let me start with a question that I have asked both of your companies more than once which is a a simple and straightforward question that I'd like to get a simple and straightforward answer to which is and let's start with you mr. mange does Twitter consider itself a neutral public forum Twitter strides everyday to be impartial platform where all voices can come in submit mr. manciu you answered this recently in the house and gave an answer that was a long paragraph and and and it didn't answer it so so I'm gonna try I don't actually expect to get an answer because I've asked you this before but are you able to answer yes or no whether you consider yourself a neutral public forum I didn't testify in the house sir I answer the same woodleigh's please do that which is that twitter is an open internet platform where people from all stripes and political affiliations all around the globe come and speak ok let me help you recently and let me help you on this so recently the CEO of Twitter Jack Dorsey said quote I don't believe that we can afford to take a neutral stance anymore I don't believe that we should optimize for neutrality this represent the policy of Twitter I have not seen that quote sir do you agree with it that is not how he is building the platform and how everybody who comes to Twitter every day I think it's important to note sir that 3/4 of our users are are overseas and that we are a global company that is staffed globally all right mr. Potts same question for Facebook does this Facebook consider itself a neutral public forum Thank You chairman I think first and foremost we consider ourself a technology company we are a platform for a diversity of viewpoints and we might have read those viewpoints on our community Stanford standards ok I'm gonna try one more time to get a yes or no but but but your company is likewise consistently refused to answer this so I probably can't do you consider yourself a neutral public you have a choice you could be yes or no I died fine either way again again chairman I we are a technology company we have a mission to build a community to bring the world closer together we try to do that through our community standards and ensure that diverse viewpoints are allowed on the platform alright let's let's try a second area of inquiry the ranking member suggested that there is no censorship and and indeed she said they're just a handful of anecdotes you know I will note among other things that Senator Blackburn her announcement video announcing for the United States Senate was pulled down as mr. mangy rightly apologized for but yet these anecdotes all seem to be consistently on one side of the spectrum so let me ask a question mr. mangy in the year 2018 how many tweets from elected officials did Facebook pulled out I'm sorry Twitter pulled out I'd have to get back to you on those specific cases if I if I could follow up though sir every day we see 500 million tweets and we have to action thousands of accounts and that those happen literally all across the political spectrum and literally all over the globe one in a million happens 500 times a day on Twitter and if you are looking for data points to support any narrative you can find it we do have a number aware of even a single democratic politician who has had a tweet pulled down I'm not I am would you share that please yes sir and I will note that we are as committed to transparency as you have described and have taken a number steps to improve transparency we also have to protect the privacy and security of our users people who didn't ask to be part of the spotlight but let me let me follow up on your question sir let it be fair if someone's tweeting they are asking the world to see what they're saying I mean that's the the essence of a social media post as you're posting it that's true but our actions on those accounts are also matters of that are extremely sensitive and and their but if I could follow up on your specific question I'm not going to mention specific names in a public forum but very recent examples we recently changed our impersonation policy that allows if I if I could sir you got you ask the question our impersonation policy that allows third third parties to report impersonation and we had to current u.s. sitting senator is a sitting governor and a sitting state attorney general all Democrats who were impacted by that second case advertising transparency we honored the the the ideas that were part of the honest ads act and agree with the idea that political advertising should be more transparent in the process of setting that up a number of accounts got caught up in that that include three current Democratic candidates for president and a major national pro-choice group somebody mentioned the general data protection regulations out of Europe okay so the main the main purpose being sir is that these folks didn't put out a press release about it they they called us we do trainings to all members of Congress well miss Bacall this you will answer the questions when we provide them in writing I'd like to get specific answers to the question let me let me pose it to mr. potts and I'll point mr. potts in 2018 how many posts from elected officials did facebook pulled out a Sherman I don't have that figure but I'm happy to follow up with you at a later time well I would ask you to and I would note that when mr. Zuckerberg testified before this full committee I submitted that question and a number of other questions in writing to Facebook and and you at the time refused to answer it and gave the company instead gave legal boilerplate and refused to answer the question and nobody here knows we know that senator Blackburn's post was was pulled down but let me ask a comparable question because it's not just political it's also ideological there have been multiple instances of in particular pro-life groups being just favored for example here is a tweet that says abortion is profoundly anti women and it's a quote from Mother Teresa and this tweet was blocked out and now it is fairly remarkable that mother Teresa is now deemed hate speech do either of you agree with the proposition that mother Teresa is is issuing hate speech is this hate speech if I could take a step back from that I believe that that account is from the susan b anthony list and susan b anthony is currently an advertiser and good standing on our platform last week last promoted found you you're very good at not answering questions it just is this hate speech i every every tweet has context behind it and every decision that's made has no more context i you i can tell you that we have actioned accounts on both sides of this debate including tweets by pro-choice groups who have said that everybody who's pro-life is misogynistic there are many pro-life groups that advertise on our platforms currently in good standing and advertisers across the board whether they're selling soap or NFL sometimes have advertisements that are caught in our in our systems and the reason why i and and that is an area we'll be following up as well so i appreciate your saying there are groups of the pro-choice eyes that you blocked and and and this committee is going to attempt to understand and quantify if there is a disparate treatment or not if there's not a disparate treatment that will benefit twitter to show that you're being even-handed the anecdotes we're aware of are consistently on one side of the aisle mr. potts do you consider this hate speech doesn't face book consider this a speech in germany I don't believe this is on our our site but looking at that quote right now lights are a little bright so my eyes are trying to zero in or focus I should say that would not be in violation of our policies and same question to that Mr Man G was asked is are you has facebook to your knowledge ever blocked a post from Planned Parenthood I believe that is correct I believe we have senator okay I we would be very interested in learning about that when I asked Facebook that in writing after the after mr. Zuckerberg hearing you again refused to answer that question as well and and so the basic data if you are not engaged in censorship releasing the data how many people you're blocking how many people you're downgrading and what side of the political aisle or ideological aisle they're on would go a long way to either clearing it up or to demonstrating there's a persistent persistent pattern of bias Senator Ron senator you may take the time you like I see they're all these I'll tell you what when you chair the committee you can decide on the time we'll do our best to be really amicable around here so mr. Potts how many postings are on Facebook every day Thank You ranking member there are over a billion postings on Facebook every day that includes images text posts videos and other types of content 1 billion and Twitter mr. mangy it's monje thank you so much you save 500 million tweets every single day and I think both of you said you're not perfect in your efforts to try and get rid of some of the the what dangerous violent hateful content I think did both of you say that yes ma'am and neither one of you is perfect your company's no ma'am okay so with 1 billion postings every single day 500 million every single day would it be accurate for me to say that I could find all kinds of I in fact as to one of our other witnesses I found you know just yesterday all kinds of what I would say totally false allegations about that winner so I probably could find all kinds of things that are on Facebook right now that in my view should be taken down but I don't expect you all to be perfect so it's in that context let's just make it really plain and clear do your platforms discriminate against a conservative users do your algorithms have something that says oh these are the kinds of words that conservatives use so we're just gonna get rid of those postings or it tweets a ranking member our algorithms our policies our enforcement we do not couldn't suppress any type of views whether conservative or liberal so you don't have any algorithm that says here are the kind of words and the areas that they go to and we're just gonna get rid of there you don't have anything like that no senator what about you no ma'am party affiliation political ideology is never an input so do your do either of your platform its discriminate against conservative content senator we we review our content under our community standards if it violates our community standards we apply those community standards evenly despite political ideology so your community Sanders by the way is a little bit different than when you when you said that you try to ID and remove violent hateful or dangerous content but the community standards are a little bit broader or different than those three there I'm sorry think thank you senator they are a bit more broad they do include those but they cover over twenty-two sections they are we are transparent with our community standards the same guidelines that our reviewers used to a moderate content those are available at facebook.com backslash community standards for the public to review so that the public also knows how to regulate their behavior on the platform it does Twitter have something that's akin to Facebook's community standards yes ma'am we call them our Terms of Service and they're available at help Twitter terms of service terms of service but you also try to ID and remove violent hateful or dangerous content that's right yes we have we have a range of rules does a user's political party affiliation play and application of a company's content moderation policies in fact are your users supposed to identify them their political affiliations before they use your platforms no ma'am how are you even supposed to know what their political affiliations are do you certainly don't ask for them right so okay now there are some things that really you know I you are huge entities I agree with the chairman on that so after the tragedy at Sandy Hook elementary school in 2012 the families didn't even have time to buy their children very sorry their children before cuz spear see Furies began to spread around the internet claiming that the shooting was all a hoax I understand that many of the families reached out to each of your companies to remove these lies but that most of their requests went unanswered the content was only removed if it included a photo or video protected by copyright why did your companies allow these lies on your platforms even after they have been identified by the families you can start mr. potts Thank You senator we now have strong policies to prevent that type of behavior my heart goes out to the members here who have connection to Sandy Hook and other violent tragedies if someone accuses a victim of a violent tragedy as being a crisis actor or that it never happened we do remove that content as of today you saw my board right there and is still on there I believe that is uh Google okay who's not here today okay I wish they were here so why you say that you now have policies when did you adopt those policies I will have to go back to check to confirm but it was about a year or maybe a little over a year ago it took you quite a while after the tragedy 2012 I'd like to have mr. mange answer also before we move on I thank you senator it is a terrible tragedy I just met mr. Parker and our hearts break for for his families and those that lost loved ones we have also updated our internal abusive behavior policy to make clear that targeting other people with content that denies the violent events happens is or is against our rules when did you update your it was last year so it took both are you quite a long time to get to that I would ask that that well now that you have these policies and I guess I'm hopeful that these kinds of lies against individuals do not get on your platforms thank you what senator Hirono like any additional time thank you actually yes Google is not here and so I mentioned in my opening statement that I am disappointed that we don't have a witness from Google and Google was ready and willing to send its acting director a political and stakeholder outreach max Pappas to testify you rejected Google's offer and myself asked to invite mr. Pappas as a minority witness they we're told by your staff that they could not do so because you had decided that no Google witness would be permitted to testify at the hearing and in fact mr. Pappas is at the same level of responsibility as our two other witnesses right now so I would like to enter into the record I'd like to ask for unanimous consent to enter into the record the testimony of mr. Pappas Thank You senator Lee Thank You mr. chairman thanks to both of you for being here this is an important issue and I think it's important to remember that anytime we're talking about speech someone brings up hate speech there is a difference of course between what could lawfully be prohibited if we were talking about a government prohibition on speech on the one hand and speech that someone hates on the other hand and I'd like to start with you mr. Paws can you tell me yeah Facebook has a different standard for content generated by a user who is not a paid advertisers versus paid advertisements is that right that's correct senator our content policies apply to all user-generated content that's the community standards that is the baseline for advertisers there are more stringent standards that sit on top of that of those policies and the reason for that is you're being paid for that content and you feel a responsibility to moderate that content to a greater degree is that accurate okay are you familiar with an instance a few months ago in which susan b anthony list a topic that came up in slightly different context a few minutes ago ran a couple of ads dealing with to prematurely born babies who survived Charlotte Ryan and Micah Pickering yes senator I'm definitely familiar with the Micra Pickering example maybe a little less so with the Charlotte okay so let's go with the Micah Pickering example I met Michael Pickering he's a healthy happy little boy now his images were featured in an advertisement purchased by the susan b anthony list in order to promote life in order to promote the idea that children even children born very prematurely in the range of 20 to 22 gestational weeks can still survive and go on to live as hath happy healthy human beings and as i recall that advertisement was taken bent down by facebook is it that's correct and I believe that we reinstated that advertisement uh within 24 hours okay at the time what was Facebook's explanation for why it was taken down if he could violate at one of our advertising policies which policy would that have been I believe it was around we have a policy around somewhat graphic content in someone viewed that to be a graphic that I think the exact name is the sensationalism of policies and okay graphic content perhaps because it involved a medical procedure or perhaps because it depicted an infant in a position in which the infant had tubes they'd only into it or something like it is a medical procedure okay a medical procedure going on that's depicted and that's regarded as graphic does your policy work even-handedly such that regardless of whether we're talking about pro-life versus pro-choice what if the same image were depicted in a slightly different context not advertising perhaps a pro-choice cause but just another cause unrelated to pro-life for example what if that same image of Micah Pickering or series of images had been used in the context of an advertisement designed to focus on the dangers associated with drug abuse by a mother carrying a child Thank You senator if it was the same picture I'm assuming that the same policy would have been applied the hopefully the same way we would like consistency there as you know that if there are different pictures that would perhaps force either the office use me the automation and or the reviewer to make it come to a different decision so if a child is viewed that is twenty weeks maybe versus twenty four we said no that's very narrow for the reviewer it may be different but if the but surely the reviewer is not gonna be able to differentiate right when he's - in 24 weeks surely that's not going to make no action I don't want to I don't want to try to get too nuanced there but depending on if the the view was that this was too graphic and I think because of the the image which I which I recall that decision was made although it was made incorrectly to disallow the the bad but in in fact mr. boss this is not hypothetical is it I mean that this has happened we did in fact see the susan b anthony list advertisement taken down well we had corresponding images used in advertisements that have not been taken down isn't that right we have but again i don't think we've had the same image you get okay that's what happens not the same n right but a an image of an infant in a comparably vulnerable position and i think it all in center i think it all turns on the word comparably i think there were similar images but not the same image so it makes the comparison that look a bit more difficult but if they were the same image i would expect them to have both been taken down by that same reviewer with a misapplication of our policies and what explanation can you provide for me as to why one might have been taken down and the other not regardless of whether you say they should have been consistent with Facebook's policy what might account for why they might receive differential treatment sometimes senator I I would like to say that as we mentioned we review billions of post another pieces of content sometimes we make mistakes in this case of this reviewer that reviewed that piece of content with Micah he removed it incorrectly or he or she removed it incorrectly if that's the case I would expect that reviewer to make the same mistake no regardless of who shared that image now if we take a different image run by the SBA run by anyone and place it there and he would and if that person were to allow it I assume that they would allow it across the board that's why I don't know if I'm doing a great job of explaining that but and I think I understand what you're suggesting and I I understand and appreciate the point could it not also have to do with other factors including possibly who is more likely to complain about the susan b anthony image who is more likely to work at facebook could that have something to do with it i don't believe so senator i think to a question of whether someone would try to influence a decision with their bias that's something that we really try to exclude to bring out the process to check any type of bias at the door we have very strong managing bias curriculum within the company it's a rigorous program I've never been in a position where I've written a policy or made it an enforcement decision or sat with a product team building an engineering product where someone asks anyone's political affiliation or whether they were a pro-life or pro-choice again this one seems like a mistake that I would expect it to have been made no matter who posted it okay the chair is politely and gently reminded me that I'm over my time limit I'm gonna want to get back to this later and gotta go cast a vote I do think it's worth mentioning here that it is something I consider a mathematical impossibility that there isn't a subjective component to this that involves who is reviewing it you can't entirely mechanize this you can't program it into an AI feature to monitor there's there it seems to me mathematically impossible to suggest that there isn't some subjective judgment calling going on and that some of that might not be impacted by who works there now Facebook is a private company I differ from some of my colleagues in the approach I take to this I don't view you as a public utility I don't view you as being owned by the government but some of my colleagues see it differently and so that is why it's important for us to flag this as long as some of my colleagues see it that way I think this is something that your company ought to focus on ought to try to work to resolve we'll get back to that later thank you madam chair thank you and before I get to my questions and we do have a vote on the board mr. Mundy you mentioned the gdpr let me just say privacy as we know it as the world knows it today primarily is something the US has led the way in creating privacy law and then when you see this european-style privacy that is gdpr you know that Europe doesn't have the most innovative and dynamic economy and the major players in this market are going to be US companies and needing to have a privacy standard one set of rules for the entire ecosystem is the reason I've reintroduced the browser act today so that we can do that let me just touching on content for a second and we all I think have hoped that you would have a diversity of opinion in your platforms and that it would be a Town Square and I know that Facebook has a 27 page memo on censorship and we would hope that while you are rooting out violence and terrorist propaganda and keeping that off your pages that you also are having your reviewers and your community that sets that's to those standards and those that live and work there in California aware that free speech requires that they be respectful of speech with which they do not agree and we would hope that you all would go back to California focused on exercising that with that respect to the law and respect to individuals so I've got a few questions mr. Potts should Facebook promote spirited debate on all sides of the political spectrum and will do these is yes or no Thank You senator yes we allow security debate on mr. mangy same question yes ma'am okay mr. potts should Facebook allow ads urging that we save sea turtles or baby seals I believe that would be fine okay mr. mangy should Twitter allow ads that denounce Planned Parenthood for selling baby body parts ma'am thank you for that question and I I'd like to get apologize for you yeah every every ad is is judged and we made a mistake on your head and I apologize okay mr. mangy should Twitter allow ads from Starbucks and Patagonia if they follow our Terms of Service and mr. Potts should Facebook allow ads from chick-fil-a and Hobby Lobby if they follow her as policies okay and who sets those policies there are teammates of mine we have separate teams that work on as well are they subjective they are meant to be objective so you're meant to be objective the people are your attitudes to work with them political attitudes to work with them I was in correcting my statement they are objective and we try to strive for Kay mr. Monty should Twitter equally promote Democrats and Republicans in search rankings yes and we strive to mr. Potts same question I'm sorry did you promote Democrats and Republicans in the search rankings yes Turner and mr.

Munchie please tell me what Twitter is doing to prepare its platform for censorship free debate thank you so much senator we we people come to Twitter to figure out what's going on in the war and never is that more important than during elections we spent a great amount of time in the lead-up to the midterm elections which were the most tweeted about midterm elections in history we dramatically improved our ability to find efforts at disinformation improved our partnerships with all the major parties with the government and with NGOs to figure out vectors of threats and we had what we believe was incredibly clean election and as the world turns there are additional elections in the U and Japan and India in Israel yesterday and we're going to continue to try to improve our systems to find this information to make sure that there's a greater context about who speak now I know Facebook is harder news director have you all hired a news director we are structured differently than Facebook we do m'm we are running towards news and work with news publishers of all sorts to make sure that they can get their their their products out on our on our platforms okay and mr.

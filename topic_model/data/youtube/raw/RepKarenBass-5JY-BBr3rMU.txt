the ongoing still being told story of police violence against people of color in this country is a story that largely gets told in terms of the individual lives lost the individual police officers involved the individual court cases that have or haven't been brought against them but even though this story gets told case-by-case police killing by police killing the national movement that has risen up around this has inspired some federal lawmakers to try to address this systemically on a national level right now there is a bill pending in the senate that would dramatically change how policing happens all over the country it's a bill called the george floyd justice and policing act and it passed the house in march on a mostly party line vote mostly because one republican did vote for it though he later said he only voted for it by accident inspiring the bill among other things would require body cams it would ban military equipment for police use it would ban no knock warrants it would end the kinds of special legal protections that police officers have used in court to avoid accountability for excessive use of force and a lot more like i said this bill has already passed out of the house the lead house sponsor of this bill congresswoman karen bass of california says she is now working with democratic senator cory booker and republican senator tim scott to try to pass that bill in the senate and today more than any other time in the past it feels like there may be momentum to actually do this joining us now congresswoman karen bass of california she's the former chair of the congressional black caucus she is the lead sponsor of the george floyd justice and policing act congresswoman bass it's pleasure to see you thanks for making time tonight thank you let me just ask you about the verdict today and how much focus turned very quickly toward your bill being the next potential step that we could take nationwide to make a real change um a lot of people talking about that today state level leaders faith leaders members of the floyd family national leaders saying this is the thing that we could do to really make a difference well absolutely because we see case after case and then there's word that another case happened today so clearly we have to do something to transform policing in the united states i have been watching this and have been involved in this issue for decades and it's terrible that it took the world witnessing the torture and murder of an individual to bring about this type of change but i do feel like we're on the cusp of doing that so i am hopeful today i don't know what i would have done if the verdict had turned out wrong but it didn't and so i am hoping that the measure of hope that we all got today will be enough to get us over the finish line and put a bill on president biden's desk i want to ask about the focus in the bill and the bill has a lot of different components but there is a focus on police officers getting training around things like implicit bias one of the things that i found just disheartening about watching the chauvin trial was the focus over the course of the trial on just how much training he had had how many hundreds of hours of training that he had had and of course that played a role in the decision by the jury to decide whether or not he was following his training when he killed mr floyd but i wonder if there is if if there is reason to feel hopeful that some sort of different focus and training some sort of national standards in training um could make a difference in real life and not just on paper well i mean i think it has to i mean you also have to take into consideration what is the type of training he received i mean the woman that killed dante wright had been on the service had been on the force for 26 years after 26 years don't you know the difference between a taser and a gun so you know i would raise a question as to what is the type and quality of training and you raised a key issue there are no national standards we have eighteen thousand police departments around the country no national standards which is why chokeholds is okay one place and another place it isn't no knock warrants are okay you need to have standardized uh accreditation and and and pro testing for officers we want policing to be like most other professions that have national standards that have accountability and so when we looked at derek shaven look at the camera when he was torturing george floyd he did it with complete impunity because he didn't think anything was going to happen we need to take that away which is why qualified immunity is really important and why we have to lower the standards to prosecute officers so we won't see case after case that aren't even prosecuted welcome back after tuesday's courtroom decision that held a bad cop accountable for his actions california congresswoman karen bass is taking the next step forward towards meaningful change as lead author of the george floyd justice in policing act she joins us now live from dc welcome congresswoman welcome welcome thank you thank you it's it it's been almost 48 hours since the jury reached the guilty verdict on all three counts what do you think was the was the thing that really moved this needle what was different well i think what was different is that the evidence was just overwhelming and to see a man tortured to death over nine minutes and to have all the expert witnesses come on and say that the only reason he died was because of the knee on the neck and the defense was not able to put on credible witnesses in fact their main scientific witness was uh had it was under a lawsuit for fabricating his testimony in previous uh cases and so i think it was just overwhelming congresswoman you know police officers are so rarely convicted especially of murder by president biden said that this could be a moment could be a moment of significant change do you agree that this is a tipping point for police reform yes instead of saying could be i would say will be i absolutely believe that we're going to get this over the finish line and it's tremendous positive momentum from tuesday because exactly as you said this is a rare moment and so we have to capture that energy and channel it and i do believe that we're going to do that there's a lot of good will going on here on the hill democrats and republicans working together um lawrence we're going to bring into the conversation though now congresswoman karen bass of california who has been working with senator cory booker democrat of new jersey and senator tim scott republican of south carolina who we just heard on the george floyd justice and policing act congresswoman bassett it's great to see you tonight on this big night thank you so much thank you so talk to us a little bit about what we just heard um from senator scott my beloved colleague here joy reid was just expressing her disappointment that she didn't hear more substance from senator scott on what's possible in police reform and what he wants to do and what could happen in the future it sounded to me like he was just saying democrats are against policing reform as somebody who's intimately involved with this issue how did you hear it and and what should we know well uh i heard him probably speaking on behalf of his caucus and his party but i will tell you in my conversations with him in the meetings and discussions that we've been having he has been very open very inclusive and at the end of the day he says i am a republican i am a conservative but i am a black man who has experienced harassment and being pulled over and stopped by police and wants to get this on president biden's desk this has been going on for just decades and officers right now are not really held accountable let me give you an example in minneapolis for for instance if chavin had not been convicted even though he was fired do you know that he could go through arbitration and that police chief has no ability not to rehire him so we have got to figure out how to stop this and holding officers accountable is key i want to excuse me i want to turn to another part of our conversation you heard senator graham's answer about systemic racism in this country yes and he says there isn't that and then that continuing to talk about this is running the country down well your response my response is at some point in our country's history we have got to figure out a way to talk about race where we can talk about it objectively and people don't feel individual guilt you can look back at our history's laws and over time there were many laws that were put in place that were absolutely racist and over time those laws might have changed but the conditions haven't changed you can look at each of our institutions why is there such massive inequality when it comes to education when it comes to health care why does that exist and so we have to figure out a way to talk about it right now to say it doesn't exist does not help anyone joining me now congresswoman karen bass of california the lead author of the george floyd justice and policing act congresswoman bass thank you very much for coming back to the sunday show thank you for having me so i would love to have you respond to senator scott will things be wrapped up in a couple of weeks and what are these suggestions that he has put forth well i certainly think things do need to be wrapped up we've talked about these issues now for just about a year and so there's a number of key topics that are important i know to senator scott you know one of them is his bill the justice act which we felt did not go far enough and so you put the two pieces of legislation together and maybe ideas from other people it might be an opportunity to address some issues we didn't address the first time such as how you respond to people who are in a mental health crisis so there's a lot on the table and i am looking forward to wrapping this up soon i remember you know as a teenager when the civil rights law was passed in 1964 everybody said oh my god this is this is game changing this is incredible and yet it didn't take and i understand what you're saying and i get it but even if you pass a law a really good law like the one you're talking about i don't understand how that is going to translate given how everything is so embedded in the culture of policing that you know i guess what i'm saying is i feel like it needs more than just a law and i know you say protests and everything else but that's been going on and even in the face of protests and cell phones we still have situations like what we've just saw in north carolina it just seems to me a law doesn't necessarily make people wake up and say oh okay we're on board you are a hundred percent correct in my district i represent both types of communities poor communities and affluent areas same police department completely different perspectives when they go from one side of town to the other and so this is a long battle policing developed in our country over many many years and one of the things that's happened over the last i would say 20 years is that police departments police unions have systematically gone from state to state to state to change state law that essentially makes them less and less accountable over time we think policing should be elevated like any other profession where there has to be transparency and accountability so here you have the profession where i can take away your light your freedom as well as your life but i do not want to be held accountable to anybody for anything good morning and welcome to the tom rook on news center here at universal city i'm conan nolan with us now is congresswoman karen bass of the 37th district of california including culver city and parts of west and south los angeles so congresswoman thanks for taking the time you're the author of the george floyd justice in policing act which passed the house and is now being negotiated in the senate one of the key provisions is to get rid of something called qualified immunity which would make it easier for someone to sue a police officer individually in civil court for alleged misconduct why is that so critical to your efforts well the bottom line with qualified immunity and a couple of other parts of the bill is the need for communities individual families to be able to hold officers accountable when their actions result in great bodily harm or death and qualified immunity is actually not a law it's a court decision it's so messy that it has come before the supreme court a couple of times in hopes that the supreme court would clarify the law and since the supreme court has not a couple of times we need to we have to do something that changes the behavior of individual officers and individual departments and so one of the things that we saw with the torture and murder of george floyd is that derek chavin was looking at the cell phone he knew he was being recorded and he didn't even care and i think one of the reasons he didn't care is because he didn't think anything was going to happen to him so senator tim scott republican of south carolina has suggested a compromise make it easier to sue the officer's police department instead of the officer himself will your side accept that well we don't know i mean right now we are definitely having discussions like i said what is most important to me is accountability and changing the culture and individual behavior of officers and so if he has some ideas we're willing to hear them but as of right now we want to make sure that qualified immunity uh stays in the bill as it passed the house [Music] hello everyone in the 37th district let me just say that i hope everyone that is watching this first of all is double vaxxed by now or if you had johnson johnson you have you received your vaccine i so miss our town hall meetings the in-person town hall meetings and our end of the year celebration which is usually when we do this report but this report's a little different because it's a report on the first hundred days and i'll tell you hasn't it been a nice hundred days the trauma that we went through every day of the year for four years is over it has been so exciting to see president biden and vice president harris i love seeing the two of them together he has represented us so well of course in the country but even around the world it just feels like everything is different and it's just been fabulous to see our own very own vice president and it was wonderful i hope you saw the state of the union and saw the two women sitting behind the president of the united states for the first time in u.s history so that was an iconic moment but just flash back a minute when you think of the cabinet that we have now i hate to bring up bad memories but think of the cabinet that was there just a few months ago compared to the cabinet that is there now a cabinet that actually represents america and i am excited that we have one of our very own members from the house representative marsha fudge for all of you deltas that are watching she's your former national president former chair of the congressional black caucus our very own javier bassetta our former attorney general but before that he was my colleague here in the house and so it has been very exciting to see the most diverse leadership of any administration so just think about how we started in january the house we do have a really small majority so we have to make sure that those seats that we lost in california we get them back but we have 219 democrats well that's right now in a few months we'll have more democrats than that but because several people went to the administration do you know to pass legislation we need 218 votes so when those four vacancies are filled we'll have a little larger majority but not by much and then the senate because of what everyone did in the state of georgia i always think about that we have a black man and a jewish man from the state of georgia you know what was sad though was that we didn't even have a chance to celebrate their election because the day after they were elected was january 6 when we had the insurrection and the attempt to block the transfer of power so within the first few days of this administration we passed the american rescue plan and i know there are many many different parts to the plan but a few that i hope residents from the 37th district have taken advantage of i hope you got your 2 000 direct payment now it was 1400 because you had gotten 600 before 3 600 in the child tax credit so for those of you that qualify beginning in july you actually are going to get monthly payments so you know how a tax refund you get it the next year when you file your taxes and you get it all all at once so that's how child tax credits have usually been done but the way we're doing it now is we're not telling you to wait until the next year we want to give you what we think you need and of course it could be a lot more every month and then unemployment benefits you know the unemployment enhancement we've continued that for 300 a week and then of course emergency rental assistance and if any place needs it it's certainly los angeles considering the homeless issue and then money to school so that schools can reopen and money to small businesses i know now that we're kind of up and up and around you're going back to uh your favorite restaurant and i have to say sad to say we're finding that some of the restaurants are are not uh have not reopened and might not reopen so you know i mentioned that a lot of money was put in the american rescue act for vaccines and so we thought that you might benefit from hearing from the chief of staff darren harris he is going to have a sit-down brief conversation with dr gregory taylor he's the medical director of the usc keck signature care unit and he's going to talk to you about vaccines in just a second but let me just say that the next time you see her talk to darren harris you need to congratulate him because he is now the official chief of staff darren last year was the acting chief of staff but now he has to live like me which means he's living in both dc and los angeles and i have another announcement to make jacqueline hamilton that all of you know she has been just an incredible first as a senior field representative and then as the lead council she is now the district director so next time you see her make sure you call her director jacqueline the district staff has just done such great work and we are looking forward to her leadership in the district office so now you'll hear from chief of staff darren harris first i just want to thank you for doing this thank you for making yourself available thank you for having me um you know can you just tell me a little bit about yourself you know why did you choose a career in medicine let's just start there yeah yeah well you know my dad's a minister okay my mom's in public health so i thought maybe you know i could get into politics i'd be a center i used to watch c-span and stuff like that i was like well maybe not you know i i gravitated towards medicine okay i thought it was a good well i know it's a good blend between art and science putting that all together so that's kind of how i got into you know the field of medicine you know obviously i had to go to college and do all that kind of stuff med school but it was it started off right there at that moment uh you know wanting to blend uh the art and the science together gotcha are you from like the community or what part of the country yeah you know what so i'm a los angeles native okay okay a native bandalino indonesian battle you know my parents are actually born in los angeles but my grandparents okay from louisiana and arkansas right so they came out here many many years ago working for you know different industry to kind of get a better life out of the south okay so we've been here i moved around many places obviously you know college down south okay uh med school up north came back here to business school residency here in los angeles but now i live in la county so i'm back well welcome back welcome back and you know you've been here for some time so we're here to talk about the um the vaccine yes sir um and i do appreciate you taking time to talk about it president biden during his address to congress he said a few things he mentioned the george floyd justice of police and act the american families plan american jobs plan but around covet he said that you know they have 200 million vaccines in american arms right now okay within the first one today yes sir he just also said that if you're over 16 you're eligible you know every american within five miles would be within five miles of the site um he also you know gave us stats and saying when he first took office they're at one percent now they have 70 as far as seniors yes sir um and so it seems like we're on a good track when it comes to um the vaccine um in fact you know california is like you know leading the way right now you know we are the lowest in the nation yes sir um yet when i came home last night you know i'm talking to my aunt and you know she told me that we have a relative young man 35 years old just died you know didn't want to take the backs and he had questions about it and so i'm hoping that we can yes you know dismissify some of the information that's out there right and the twitterverse right um to kind of set the record straight yes sir you know about how safe is a vaccine you know um you know is there anything to um fear you know with the vaccine and what exactly it is so i'm just going to ask a few questions and you can just you know tell us a little bit more um about it so my first question is how does a vaccine work yeah well you know that's actually one of my favorite questions okay because as a science buff it's nothing like explaining the science in a way okay so as a professor a way that's easily interpreted to the people okay to the individual so how does a vaccine work so basically it's actually very very exciting all right so what it is doing is it's actually sending instructions to your body on a microscopic level to do something okay so i'm saying that one more time because that's that's that's what that's what it's doing okay it's sending instructions okay to your body on a cellular level to do something it normally doesn't do now what is that it's sitting instructions to make the spike protein and the spike protein is what the virus has so that we can go effectively fight the virus all right okay so again it's doing two things though it's not just doing one okay this is exciting okay and this is part of some of the education and understanding that needs to kind of get out there all right so not only is it sending these instructions microscopically to start making these spike proteins okay but at the same time your body is actually sending kind of the neighborhood watch to go figure out like who are these spike proteins we just made uh who are these characters what are they up to right right and so that's work being done that's why some people feel fatigued and tired after you get the vaccine because your body is working double time wow making vaccine making spike proteins something it usually does not do all right and also going to find out these new sprite pro who are these people and are they here to help us or not that's the immune response being generated all right so that's kind of in a nutshell what it does i mean there's a little bit of differences between the the three vaccines small differences in terms of the the delivery of the instructions right there's difference in the delivery of the instructions between the pfizer the moderna and the johnson and johnson but the concept is the same so you mentioned a few yes um side effects well again you know some people use the word side effects i like to use the word normal effects for example if i were to stick a foreign object a needle in your arm and if you were to tell me you did not feel pain that would be abnormal okay so it's normal people out there to have pain in your arm after someone sticks a foreign object that would be normal okay so so so all that being said okay yes i would expect you to have some pain in your arm okay i would expect you to feel fatigued okay because we talked about the mechanism of action your body is doing work on the vaccine double work right making the spike protein and then going to find the spike protein that's work so you should be fatigued that would be a little bit abnormal if you weren't okay now listen some people do have fevers okay uh some people may have headache all right so those things would be normal okay now there have been some side effects that we should be more concerned about okay that are would be abnormal these are not normal effects nausea severe headache okay severe fevers higher than 102 103. okay those are some of the things we may need to be concerned about painting a leg okay so those would prompt the individual to seek care their physician or the urgent care or emergency department right um the other day i was in the grocery store okay um i like to talk to people while i'm in the line because that's how i kind of hear what's happening in the community that's right um and so um this lady she had a question and i wasn't able to answer it okay and her question was if i am vaccinated okay can i still catch copic you know so it's no real simple solution to all this okay but the answer unfortunately to this question is yes you can still catch covet after getting vaccinated however okay the majority of the cases that we found have been mild okay so the vaccine reduces your risk of death and hospitalization that's what you want right that's what you really want right right but yes you can get code with after being vaccinated but however your chances of being severely ill and dying have been reduced significantly right and cannot spread it also so we're still going into that and researching that but if i were to say from what i've seen in my practice the answer is yes although the likelihood of spreading it has been reduced significantly in addition okay which goes into what happens in the future should i still wear my mask should i still be diligent right should i still be diligent should i still make sure i'm protecting myself and my family and the answer is yes got you got you well you know i really do appreciate you taking this time to um you know um inform you know our community our constituents about um the cova vaccine um and so i would say my last question is you know i you know was vaccinated back in january yes sir um you mentioned that you were vaccinated as well you know do we need booster shots how long does it last you know would it be an annual thing yeah um do you have any information about that is the cdc blowing anything out yeah well uh the information that's coming across my desk okay uh is that more than likely okay we will have booster vaccines all right our weather's going to be annually every you know eight months 11 months 15 months i think that's unclear right now but i think people the public should prepare okay not only in the united states but worldwide to have booster vaccinations until the kind of globe cools down from our current interaction with this organism well dr taylor i just want to say thank you so much for taking the time out of your day to talk to me and talk to our constituents about um the copa vaccine you know clearing up all the misinformation that's out there um and you know just want to say thank you i'm here to help thank you thank you for informing us about vaccines of course we talked about the rescue plan but there's also we passed gun control so the bipartisan background check bill is over in the senate the charleston loophole remember the mass murderer dylan roof who killed the people in the church mother emanuel church in south carolina he shouldn't have gotten a gun he went to apply for a a registration and you know you have those days that you have to wait well they went ahead and gave him the gun and so that is the charleston loophole we want to close that to say it doesn't do anything to tell somebody you have to wait 72 hours before you get your registration but go ahead here and take the gun we passed the equality act so that discrimination against lgbt uh folks is included now in the civil rights act now not quite yet because it's over in the senate but if you remember president biden's speech he wants to sign the equality act so hopefully that will get through we do have the challenge of the filibuster but more on that a little later and then asian hate crimes you know i know everybody that's watching this has just been horrified at what our asian brothers and sisters have been going through all around the country and we know why that is we know because trump essentially instigated it i mean he spent four years fomenting and fanning the flames of racism in the country and to see that people are taking it out on asian americans because he linked it up to the virus the china virus such a racist characterization and the way he did it in a hateful way and that has certainly caused a lot of problems but we came together for the most part you might have seen in the senate the bill did pass and hopefully by the time you're watching this president biden has sat has signed it one senator voted against it of course that was the same senator that was given the fist bump uh to the rioters to the insurrectionists to the people that were committing treason in my eyes as president biden said during his speech uh it was the worst scene since the civil war the worst act direct act against the government since the civil war that's huge to say that and then of course there's voting rights everybody talks about hr one and hr one is great hr one is not voting rights though hr one is about expanding access to voting and it's great and hopefully you've seen all the commercials and all the news coverage about it so it increases access to voting and it deals with a lot of other issues related to the electoral process but the other bill the john lewis voting rights act that hasn't come up yet because we needed to we need to get more evidence which is the charge that the supreme court gave us to do so i'm not exactly sure when that's going to come up it might come up we think uh toward the end of summer to me that is like the most important bill we could do this year because frankly if we don't stop what is going on all around the country not in california of course but all around the country they're passing these laws to restrict voting and you know that i work in foreign affairs and i run around the world not around the world just in africa talking about democracy and wanting people to have the access to the ballot and you know i feel like a hypocrite because here we're trying to tell everybody copy us copy us except for don't copy that because frankly that man injured our democracy and we're still suffering from it so to me it is an existential issue to get the voting rights act passed and so hopefully that will happen and then i hope that you've seen that my focus has been on the george floyd justice and policing act how many times do we have to watch these murders on video i don't know where you guys were when the derrick shove and verdict came out i don't know if you were having flashbacks like i was but i was just thinking about rodney king and thinking about how we all watched to see that verdict that we were so sure was going to be guilty and it wasn't so i wasn't that confident but you know what my former colleague my former colleague in the cbc keith ellison he did a marvelous job leading that prosecution guilty on all counts but now we have to wait and see what the sentence is going to be so while that's going on i'm busy working on the george floyd justice and policing act and i made a commitment and i was so glad to hear the president reinforce it that we're going to put this on his desk before we hit the anniversary which is may 21st may 25th may 25th so that's what we have been up to lots and lots of other bills as well but you know one of the really important issues as excited as we are at all we've been able to do in the house you know the bills goes over to the senate and you you guys always ask me what about that filibuster well i'm not sure about that filibuster i think that at some point we're gonna have to deal with it for me voting rights is the line in the sand i actually think we're gonna get the votes we need for the george floyd justice and policing act for some of those other bills that i just went through we won't get the 10 votes so i think at some point all the leadership is going to have to come together and say is now the time but let me just caution you as much as i want to see the filibuster be gone tomorrow i've signed on to all the letters i'm supportive of all of the efforts but between you and me we got rid of part of the filibuster and had that work for us we got all those judges confirmed by trump last year by the senate ones he put forward we got two supreme court justices so there's a part of me that's a little reluctance because you know history is not on our side with the filibuster uh it isn't um the problem is is that historically the party that's in the white house loses seats and in both our houses were hanging by a thread so if we lose power then essentially the president biden and vice president harris will not be able to do anything in their last two years except for veto bills because you can only imagine what is going to happen if we were to lose power they're going to go ballistic because of all that happened in the two years when we had power so i want to see it go on trust me but we'll see i think the the discussions might be happening i don't know if and when the senate pulls the trigger and gets rid of the filibuster so i continue to be on the same committees now i'm like you know i'm in my 11th year six terms so now i'm a senior member on both of these committees i have the honor and privilege of chairing the subcommittee on africa global health and global human rights so needless to say what we're dealing with there now i haven't been to africa in a year because we're not allowed to travel right now i'll probably be going toward the end of the year but we are looking at covet in africa and we're looking at many other issues as well and you know my whole focus on africa is how to change the paradigm so that we are focusing on business and investment and not the traditional way of dealing with africa which is just focusing on all of the conflicts that are happening there i think the continent of africa should be a partner with the united states and we need to stop treating the entire continent like a charity case so i'm on judiciary and i am on the committee on intellectual properties which is very important for our district because that covers the entertainment industry and the entertainment industry is the number one industry in our district so staying on that committee and then i continue to be on the subcommittee on crime terrorism and homeland security and on the subcommittee on crime i am continuing to work on criminal justice reform so you'll hear about that because i'm going to introduce a slew of bills related to women and children in criminal justice and you know what i have bipartisan support and over these last few months i've been building a good solid relationship with tim scott regardless of what you might think of tim scott i need a republican partner and he wants to do criminal justice reform with me as well so after we get the george floyd justice and policing act together and on president biden's desk then we are going to be working together on bipartisan criminal justice bills and i continue to do the work of the congressional caucus on foster youth you know i started that in my first term i continue to co-chair it and it is a bipartisan caucus we have a couple of bills from me that we're working on we have six co-chairs and so each of us have legislation but two bills i'm working on is a bill to provide dental care to foster youth who age out after they are 18 you know a lot of kids get kicked to the curb when they're 18 and so we want to make sure number one they should never be kicked to the curb but two we want to make sure that they have access to medicaid so they can get health care as well as dental care so so far i've introduced 12 pieces of legislation i'm not going to go through all of them with you but i will go through a couple you know i had an incredible experience because of our amazing staff member kenneth on who introduced me to some elders in the korean community who want to reunite with their family members in north korea and oh my god some of the stories they haven't seen their siblings in decades and they know that their parents are gone by now so we want to make sure that in the united states they can go visit uh north korea because you know we don't want people to go to north korea we ban folks from going but they need to have an exemption personally i think as a u.s citizen i should be able to go anywhere in the world i want to go but that's another story but we at least want them to be able to do that and then immigration reform i have the honor of being what's called the closers i want you to know there's seven of us ladies who are taking the lead on whipping and what that means is is that we gotta whip everybody in shape and make sure they vote for the bill so linda sanchez from los angeles lucille roybal allard from los angeles judy chu from los angeles we're all uh whips and we call ourselves the closers so it's our job to make sure that this bill passes the house makes it through the senate and lands on president biden's desk it's actually a bill that came from the white house but you know once we get a hold of it no telling what it'll look like when we're done but we have passed some immigration reform bills including the dream act so criminal justice reform i mentioned these are all pieces of legislation that i am working on and will continue to work on so let me just talk about the district itself casework you know our office has been closed but let me just take a minute to hats off congratulations to the district staff the d.c staff too the d.c staff has been working hard even though you know the majority of the building is closed i want you to know the 37th district staff is in every day and the district staff have definitely been doing an incredible job interestingly these are the top casework issues for 2020 irs issues small business administration especially because of the resources that we put in the bill and then people have trouble accessing the postal service and then immigration so always feel free to uh call our office you know claudia heads up the casework and uh she wants me to read you a note so i'm going to read you a note right now that says with stimulus checks and employment development department benefits and verification still coming out she wants me to take a moment to discuss the numerous constituent complaints that my office have received especially regarding the post office post office customers are experiencing frequent and harmful delays in their mail service and that's due to slow processing times system backlogs and staff shortages by the post office but we also know it's because of what trump did right before he left trying to mess with the post office that guy's still around it's going to take us a while to get rid of him but also to get the post office back in shape so this year i have joined my colleagues in requesting that there are no budgetary cuts or changes to the post office or any changes in policy that would slow the mail down and we also want to make sure that prices aren't raised and that we have the appropriate staff so my office is going to continue to communicate and support the local post office do you remember how an uh um we had the in cover city they decided to stop delivering um delivering the mail to one of the housing units the public housing that's right outside of culver city and so we really criticized them and told them you know if you don't figure out how to deliver folks mail we are going to have a press conference and fortunately uh they got their mail because that was really outrageous so let me just thank you for listening i promise you we will have i was talking to darren harris about this and we think we can have a live town hall by the fall okay by then hopefully we are looking back and talking about how awful it was to go through covid because we have managed it and we're past it and so i want to tell you that i'll look forward to seeing you now the other thing is is that i hope by now really that

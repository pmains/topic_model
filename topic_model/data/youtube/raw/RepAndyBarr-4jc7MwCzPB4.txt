more than 15 months ago we first began to see reports coming from muhan china about a new sars-like virus the reports were troubling and experts around the world began to express concerns about the virus spreading but we were assured by authorities within the chinese communist party the virus was not transmissible from human to human a sentiment echoed publicly by the world health organization of course we now know that behind closed doors the ccp was doing everything it could to cover up the virus they were silencing doctors and arresting journalists who dared to tell the world the truth while destroying samples and shutting down labs who are racing to discover what this novel virus meant for the world and as the republican committee report on the origins of the kobit 19 discovered the ccp never actually warned the who of the outbreak as required by the international health regulations because of the ccp's cover-up and the who's deference to the ccp it took weeks weeks that were critical in stopping the spread of the virus for the truth to come out now a little more than a year after the who finally declared a pandemic we face a worldwide death toll of 2.6 million people including 535 000 right here in america those numbers demonstrate the heartbreaking impact felt because of this virus and the devastating effect of the ccp's cover-up but these numbers sadly only show the surface of the true fallout from kobit 19. the economic political and physical ramifications of the virus is putting countries and regions that were already considered fragile at risk of further destabilization we've already seen a rise in food insecurity extreme poverty and increased deaths from other diseases like hiv aids tb and malaria and as this virus spreads chaos and fear authoritarian regimes terrorist groups and hostile nation states will try to take advantage the u.s has been a leader in providing global health and development assistance for decades and now congress has provided over 15 billion dollars to help control the spread of this deadly disease and mitigate its long-term impact we cannot truly bring an end to this pandemic here at home without fighting the pandemic overseas and i support funding for global efforts to combat covid19 that's why i was so frustrated the foreign affairs committee was shut out of the reconciliation process especially when leader hoyer assured us this process would be bipartisan and involve all relevant committees this disenfranchisement of our committee members is not the way we were supposed to operate in congress a partisan rush to pass even though this is a bipartisan issue was prioritized over a sound policy process and without our committee's input we abdicated critical oversight responsibilities i would laugh i would like to ask for unanimous consent to enter into the record a letter from ranking member mccall and ranking member reese that was sent to secretary blinken urging rigorous oversight of the 10 billion dollars provided through the american rescue plan these funds must be implemented with clear us government branding and spent only when we see additional money from other donors especially with skyrocketing domestic needs it is critically important that every dollar is targeted strategic and effective there is hope on the horizon however more and more vaccines are being distributed every day u.s companies thanks to operation warp speed have created an astounding three vaccines in record time it's truly historic over 71 million americans have received at least one dose worldwide that number tops 225 million increasingly our private sector has played a significant role in helping small and medium businesses survive the pandemic including by connecting them with new markets abroad cooperation between governments ngos medical experts and the private sector is the key to an effective response again i want to thank the chairman for this hearing and thank our panel for joining us today we look forward to your testimony and examining the international impact on cobia 19 and with that mr speaker i yield back the balance of my time

my parents taught me to love the Constitution from the time I was young my father was also a lawyer and he served as President Reagan solicitor general he was the founding dean of BYU's law school he died 26 years ago he taught me to love the Constitution and taught me the basics of it from the time I was very young listening to Michael and my dad talk about the Constitution and the law and if they would get deep into these conversations but I was kind of like okay you tell me about the the most important features of it being structural the vertical protection of federalism and the horizontal protection of separation of powers we've all talked so much about how much he's out he's starting to sound like Dad his mannerisms are like Dad when I hear him on TV or you know giving a speech or whatever and I hear my dad coming through it's almost it's this amazing little moment where I feel like Spirits Collide and because he's the son that's doing the job I think in the way our dad would have wanted him to do he's doing it in a way that's committed to the document that our dad spent his career advancing and and cementing he taught me to Revere it because it it plays a role and he taught me that to the extent we followed it as a country we've benefited tremendously as a result he would be so proud of you he's so proud he would love to talk to him every day and debrief I mean he would want to hear it all I don't think Rex would be trying to teach him I think Rex would be listening to and would be so proud of the things he has learned the things he has accomplished and the things that he's doing every day in his everyday life if he thinks he has the right answer he's always open to listening to somebody else he's always been that way our dad taught us that he treats everyone with respect everyone with Civility and he listens and he engages he's just not going to move from his core positions that are rooted to the Constitution I appreciate that this conscience is such that he he will take the time to read or make sure that a member of his staff has read every single page of that bill and that's that's pretty rare he's that same good kind-hearted to the soul he is always the same and he stands for good for our state for our country and he always will I think that's one of the things rexley would be most proud about Michael Lee the man and the senator

hey guys as we're ending uh a week here in dc uh we also are having a a a walk people are gathering and i can't use the name what it's called today because of ethic reasons but basically they're standing in in recognizing the anniversary is coming up roe versus wade which is the 49th anniversary of of the disastrous decision that the court made to allow us to kill innocent babies since this disastrous ruling went in place over 60 million innocent babies have been killed how many liters have we lost how many sons and daughters and fathers and mothers and movers and shakers and entrepreneurs and creators have we lost what what did we cost this world by saying that we're willing to kill an innocent baby that's in the womb that's no fault of that child but you're willing to end this life guys i don't understand it as a father as six as someone that my wife and i we tried for seven years to have baby and then and then when she did get pregnant the first time and we had a miscarriage i remember how how devastating that was because we were so excited the first time we heard the heartbeat and then when we went back in for another checkup and we didn't hear that heartbeat how how it destroyed us that was never ever just a fetus it was our child for the first time we heard the heartbeat and now at the same time that we're trying to end roe versus wade and bill to save these innocent babies the democrats are trying to push what they call the on-demand act which would allow you to kill the innocent baby all the way up till birth i don't understand it i just i can't even wrap my head around it nothing changed my life then the first day when i held my first child in my hand and how everything inside of me changed everything my whole world changed my perspective changed and the love that i i thought i knew went to a whole other level guys we can't be silent on this we have to continue to fight until we end roe versus wade may god bless you and may god bless united states of america

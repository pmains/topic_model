you give me well thanks everybody for joining us um i'm carrie from sodding with tri-state livestock news and i'm moderating the conversation today so i appreciate being asked to be here i think this is just a really important day for cattle producers and retailers we're all in this together and i think we all share a number of common goals i guess we'd like to do a quick overview of our intent today nearly every sector of the us economy is under pressure right now as we know whether it's labor shortages inflation production lag overall supply and demand challenges and everyday cost of goods nearly every sector of the economy would tell you that they're financially stressed the coronavirus pushed our economy to the brink last year we saw that impact in our communities not every sector impacts every person every single day except for one and that would be our food supply as we all know every american eats not every american though is concerned about our food security and the impact that the supply chain issues can have on consumers coming from south dakota our beef supply is at the top of our list of concerns being our number one industry here in south dakota both at the producer level and the end of the retail chain where product is sold to consumers our intent today is to bring these total beef supply chain issues to light to start the conversation and get the perspective from cattle producers and grocers we should discuss the impact both ends of the beef supply chain have on our local economy on our state economy um there's lots of pressure on the system right now as we know and ultimately as south dakotans we should be looking for ways to start partnerships build partnerships continue partnerships on policy objectives that bring relate to these supply chain issues that are harming not only cattle producers but consumers and likely everyone in between if we all agree that our food supply is important and the food security is then we should be able to start a discussion here in south dakota and we're excited to do that if we can partner here maybe other states and their national affiliates will follow so we're excited to have this diverse panel here representing a multitude of sectors within the beef industry everybody is key to the industry we all know that we all need each other for this to work we have producers here that raise cattle we have people that feed cattle we have grocers and restauranteers that interact with consumers that buy the end product so i guess right now i'd like to introduce our panelists we have dan kahoe who owns kahoe's general stores with locations in bone steel tyndall lake andes and spencer nebraska thank you for being here um is the owner of buoy foods with locations in gregory mission oklahoma pine ridge assistant and wagner keisha veronic i say that yeah everyone mispronounces my name so i don't want to do it owns the turtle creek steakhouse in miller and eric iverson is an independent producer from white river south dakota james halverson the executive director of the south dakota stock growers association brett kenzie region 3 director with our calf and a backgrounder and cattle producer himself um and i guess i could introduce myself i'm as i said i'm curious thought i'm with tri-state livestock news i my husband and i also ranch on the north dakota south korea state line um we are 100 miles north of newall is the best description i can give you so i was just telling someone else you can travel 170 miles on our on the highway that goes past our place without being able to access fuel in the evening if if you uh don't catch riva open during the daytime so um so the cattle industry is important to me i grew up on a ranch my family has done it has branched for generations on both sides and it's the life that i know and love and so this is something crucial i feel to myself to our local communities which is what makes up the state of south dakota i think the general interest in having this group together today is to discuss these different perspectives of business people that work in the beef industry have them share their experiences to educate one another as well as consumers and the general public we all know that's um that's who our end user is we're going to move to having each of our guests on this panel provide a brief quick summary of their experience and introduce themselves so i guess um go ahead if you would like to dan all right my name own four is stores i'm very involved in the meat cutting in our stores and i order all the meats fresh meats for the grocery stores so i feel our meat part makes our store successful um and growing so i'm glad to have center rounds um looking into the packers and um check and see how we can improve the supply chain better and get some more consistent pricing and make it more reliable great we're hoping to work on that as well you should go ahead okay hi i'm keisha veronic i'm one of the 10 owners of the turtle creek steakhouse in miller south dakota so back in 2019 my husband and i rounded up four other couples to buy our steakhouse because all at one time our we didn't have a place to eat miller no place to eat and get a beer so the five of us came together bought the steakhouse cleaned it up and we've gone through some challenges since 2019 but we're we're still all friends and we're all still married one of our biggest challenges is keeping our costs down to our customers obviously we live with these people every day we do life with them so we know they're going through the same struggles as us so we want to make sure that they're paying a fair price for a really good product so that's why i'm here today um i really appreciate this opportunity i've never done anything like this before so bear with me okay but yeah super excited um and we care about our community so that's why we do what we do awesome all right my name is rf bowie i am a fourth generation grocer we've been operating since 1905 here in november we'll turn 116 years i'm very passionate about this business um and just as dan said our meat departments make our store uh buoy foods we only focus on quality which means we only carry certified angus beef um today i'm hoping to accomplish a couple things one shed some light on the beef packing industry and and hopefully we can figure out a path forward for uh some fair competition um i'd like to see our cattle producers make money and be paid fairly for the hard work that they do and finally i'd like to help grocery store customers understand that high beef prices um actually caused the grocers to actually make less money which has a severe impact in small town south dakota very good i'm very insightful thank you very much nathan hi i'm nathan sanderson i'm the executive director of the south dakota retailers association we've got about 4 000 members across south dakota and uh the the name retailers association might be a little bit of a misnomer we represent several hundred restaurants and grocery stores and small meat processors and the like and so appreciate these folks uh serving on the panel here you know i think we've had the opportunity to talk with a lot of different businesses around south dakota over the last few weeks both in the lead up to this conversation and then also sort of the larger national conversation senator that you've really started to push and one of the things that i think that we've really heard from our members is these guys really really care about their customers i mean this is this is absolutely essential to what they do i mean when you're in miller or when you're in gregory or when you're in bones field if you don't care for your customers you don't have any further customers and so i think when rf is talking about the quality products as dan's talking about making sure we get quality products at a really really reasonable price you know our guys know that there are people on fixed incomes they know that food expenses are an important aspect of a family's household budget and so they care about the friends their neighbors their family and the communities that they serve in and so i think that's a piece of the conversation that we want to make sure that is included and thank senator rounds and his staff certainly for helping to organize this conversation eric iverson grew up in myrtle south dakota have a ranch in white river south dakota i too am uncomfortable sitting up here i'd much rather be home checking thousand bailing hey um chase is chasing a windroll but i think it's important for for us as ranchers to to get more connected with our consuming public because we do have a story to share with them and i think it's important to our rural communities i think it's important to to main street um and uh if we don't share our message i think we're just gonna get gobbled up and swallowed by the the consolidation of this industry and uh we will slowly become more and more reliant on foreign countries or foreign companies you know owning our food supply and that that really scares me um i guess the main reason i do this is because of my sunset back there i want him to to be able to carry on what i've done and what my dad did before me i don't want to hand him a prison sentence when i'm done and say well you know go work really really hard and i hope you make enough money to pass it on to your son i want him to be able to make some money and be profitable because we've seen there is a profit to be made in this industry uh quite a bit of it it's just not working the way it's it's going so you know i can't no longer just be the the grower of the trees for the cabinet makers you know we need to get aligned with with the next step to uh share our message and get a higher percentage of that consumer dollar because i think i read somewhere that our share of the consumer dollar went from 53 cents to 14 cents in the last 30 or 40 years and that's that's the wrong direction as our bee prices continue to go up and go up so raise angus cattle do some bar a little bit of farming race crops and kids uh i'm james halverson um you think you're uncomfortable i went out and bought a new white shirt and the only guy that didn't get the memo to not wear a tiger but no i i work for the south coast doctors association full-time and and on the side my family and i also are cattle producers we have a cow calf herd the stock growers mission is to promote and protect the livestock industry so i just appreciate uh the opportunity to be here i appreciate the the relationship that we've built with the senator and his office and his team and just the fact that he's out there championing our issues uh all the time right now and i think that that speaks volumes to what he's doing and what he wants to accomplish and just to have this opportunity here today um what a great opportunity to talk to people on the other end of the chain you know i i know a lot of people in this room but i don't know these people and i'm looking forward to getting to know you because communication is key if we can all come together if we can make those relationships happen if we can start to have that dialogue that's where we can start to put some pressure on on those guys that are putting the pressure on us right now and so i i just i'm really excited to be here and get to know you folks and see what what problems you have as well you know as has been stated as cattle producers that we represent we just want to do what you guys want to do we want to provide the consumers what they want and we want to be able to compete for their business but competition is predicated on having some some fair ground rules and i think that's what we need to talk about right here and i i truly believe and i know eric and brett do too if if we have a level playing field our south dakota producers will absolutely compete with anybody in the world for that dollar and for that awesome product that we know as great american people all right i'm brett kinsey i'm from south central south dakota down by gregory where we have a grocery store right in town my brother and i have a partnership we have a cow calf herd a dnr permitted feedlot we have traditionally been feeder cattle producers but we recently got into finishing program cattle because it's a lot of work it's a lot of paperwork nobody wants to do it so we do it and it turns a little bit of money usually uh i guess i'm region three director of our caf usa the largest producer-led group in the united states we have members in 42 states i've always been politically active because i just come from the perspective that i'm important to south dakota south dakota is important to me the return that comes to me is what i pay in to sustain this state and uh you know right now we find ourselves like in that great story the best of times the worst of times um these are the best of times because people like senator rounds and his contemporaries that i think really get it now i mean probably always have but more producers are actually starting to get behind the efforts that a few senators are leading and it's the worst of times because of the concentration issues the antitrust issues traditionally i've had to rethink my position when invited to a meeting like this i've said that we started with one track which is competition issues but now we've developed into another track which i didn't even know was possible but it's becoming possible which is the antitrust track and now we have a third track developing which could be visiting with our grocers and our restaurant tours to get you know south dakota beef should be maine lobster it should be california wine and i'll be honest i don't have the time to develop that i love being a part of that conversation because i've already i like to say i'm max i'm completely invested in our operation plus a substantial amount more but there are opportunities within this state and every time we get good beef to a willing consumer we win so with that thank you thanks fred um i guess you know with that i just i think all of us here in this room have had our eyes on dc uh for months if not years this industry particularly producers but um i feel like each of us sitting here is uh struggling and wondering if we're gonna turn a profit this year and as everybody really has said each of these small businesses whether they raise cattle or sell meat or sell something else to the public is crucial to the survival of this state the small businesses are just are what make up this state so we've been watching dc hoping for some help knowing that we need help in some form or another um because things just are not working right now for the cattle producer feeder and i don't think working ideally for the retailers either it doesn't sound like so senator rounds we appreciate a lot of the pieces of legislation that you have brought recently particularly this spring and as i said we've really been watching a lot of us have made calls to your office other offices asking for help and i think sometimes there's a level of frustration particularly again among ranchers feeling like our voice isn't being heard can you help us understand what legislation you're working on and where it's going what your challenges are in getting some legislation passed that might be able to help us sure let me begin just by saying thanks for being here and i want to thank kerry because we asked her if she would mind wouldn't mind moderating this and kind of carrying it we're going to turn this into a conversation along with it we'd ask nathan if they i mean they see this every day their consumers the folks that they do business with they're in talking about why they're paying 19 for rib eyes they're in one know why there's this huge spread when it comes to hamburger over five bucks a pound and the question on it is is so who's making all this money and why is it that the consumer shouldn't be able to understand why it is that the prices on this stuff are going out of sight at the same time back here in south dakota we've got producers who for years for a generation have said look we're not going to make it and our kids aren't going to be able to stay here if we don't do something about it not a new problem 100 years ago they started putting together anti-trust laws teddy roosevelt he wasn't exactly what you'd call a regulator so much as he was an open competition and a fair market guy and they start putting together ni trust laws now since that time the four major packers at that time controlled a little over 50 percent of the processing market on beef if you move it up now 100 years later they control over 80 percent four major packers not the same four they're like everybody else there's been consolidation changes and so forth but they still control over 80 percent of the market when it comes to processing they know each other now they don't have to come back in and sit down and have emails going back and forth all they got to do is watch three other folks understand exactly what the market's doing you know when you go on in and you're going to try to figure out what you're going to get for the price or for your livestock whether you are a cow calf guy or whether you are a background or whether you are a feeder you know in advance that they're going to tell you kind of what it's going to be for a price at the same time consumer on the other end on the other side of this choke point of four major processors they walk into the grocery store and the price is set now they look at the grocery store guy and think he's making a hell of a profit here the guy in the grocery store is frustrated because he looks back and knows that the guy who is his consumer in many cases the guy who's actually raising or a family that's actually raising the livestock isn't getting that share and yet at the same time he knows that he's been given a price as to what he's got to pay for it at at the level that he's then going to mark up to just to make a profit in the middle of this whole thing we're all pointing at the same at the same location and that is is that we've got a choke point in the ability in our country to process beef and to have open competition on our side of it our producers if you take a look at the united states today um nine states maybe where cows outnumber people now multiply that times two senators apiece that's 18 senators out of a hundred now you can get every one of those senators together and you won't make 20 of the votes in the place you got to add another 40 votes just to have a debate on an issue in the senate the only way you do that is not by limiting your team but by growing your team we got a pretty good bench out there called consumers and our focus has got to be on getting the message to the consumer about what's going on and why they pay this huge price and who's actually in the middle of it making the dollars and keeping the dollars and the only way we do that is by sharing our story and by having these kinds of discussions right here our grocery store folks see and visit with consumers every day but they are dependent on a limited number of locations where they can actually go to get the beef that they need or the pork that they need or the chicken that they need so they're a little bit careful about what they say and who they say it too it's time that we number one build the team now we've got a lot of different groups and i'm going to say this for again look i've been in this business now since 1991 um i've been in the insurance business making a living but i've also been on the side in the legislative process since 1991 then as governor for eight years and now as a member of the united states senate going on seven years you don't win this by having fights among yourselves you do this by sitting down and figuring out what we can agree on and then you move forward and you build that team and we got a ways to go to build that team this is what we're going to do and if we can do it here in this state and if we can build a coalition of folks sharing with consumers along with the producers we're going to make an impact but we're one of those nine states where cows outnumber people we've got to be able to do this and replicate it across the country and you say how the hell can we do that well we just had a department of ag or we just had a a senate ag hearing and and by the way if you see uh justin tupper he runs st onge out there out west you tell him thank you for what he did because i'll tell you what he was a rock star he came in and shared with them in real simple terms just exactly what it was and kind of gave him a sense of what it was like in a sale bar uh john thune was there and john was right down on top of it but i think the guy that probably made our case for us was probably one of the more liberal democrats in the united states senate cory booker representing consumers and asking hard questions about what's going on with this thing here and the message is is there is an open appetite out there to learn the whole story and to talk about not just quality of food and food safety but about the pricing on food as well from consumers so what i want to do and the reason why we want this together is how do we build this team and how do we take it national how do we make this a bigger program because it isn't just it's not going to be one piece of legislation that makes this work this is going to be a movement that has a whole lot of things that open us up to price transparency to make sure that the rules that are on the books right now for antitrust are being followed and if they're not what we got to do to fix them and then how do we get more competition for beef and bring the price down in the grocery store and there's a way to do it i'm just going to say i i love the idea i look i i got beat up a little bit when i was governor because in aberdeen we had a beef plant and people say oh what's going on and why you got a beef plant up there and how come you know you're looking at all sorts of financing and everything because i want to be able to make another market for cattle producers in south dakota and it's working now but on the other side you got 50 hutterite communities in the state of south dakota that put together because they were getting paid a commodity price for their turkeys they built their own plant and today they not only they not only produce turkeys but they process turkeys and they make end products for some of the major retailers in the united states there's more than one way to skin this thing i don't know exactly what it is but if we get folks talking back and forth with one another we're going to be able to come up with multiple ways to open this market up if it was easy it would have been done a long time ago so i want this to be a conversation i want this to be an idea thing but the biggest thing that we can accomplish today is to build the team and make it bigger not to find reasons to disagree with one another okay we're in this together i want that next generation of kids to make what's next where we i got to do this i had a guy stand up for st onge a year ago and say he thought we could get something done pat trask is here pat i want to thank you for all your support and for your persistence i'm trying to make this a better place for the next generation but thank you we're we're going to get this is there a latitude for me to speak a little bit well what i'd like to do right now i really want to get this crew going on this thing and have this conversation right now and then if we've got some time here one way or another we'll try to get some other comments and stuff going in here okay but i wanted to recognize this is something that's got to have a whole lot of folks driving and pat's been one of the drivers on this thing we appreciate it thank you okay guys let's do it let's get a roll thank you senator and um i i i do actually i think later on i want to circle back to some of what you're talking about particularly getting the other senators and representatives involved um hopefully on a bipartisan manner it has to be bipartisan in the united states senate it has to be bipartisan and it's doable yeah so i i'm hoping to ask you how we do that at um a little bit later but i think we like you said we want to kind of move forward with this so everybody gets a chance so first off we're going to start with our producers um and we've obviously all heard the economic concerns the livestock industry has had for several years specifically the processors consolidating and controlling prices um what makes now a critical time for your industry and what do you think are some of the most immediate steps that can and should be taken to help return profit to the cattle industry in south dakota i can start um i'll go back to college a little bit and don't worry nathan carrie i know i know you guys at college i'll say you can't share any stories one of my favorite movies is called office space and there's a scene in there where where he's he's going to some counseling he's had a bad day and and he basically tells the counselor that every day was worse than the day before so every day that you see him is on the worst day of his life and and i think that's kind of similar to this why is today critical every day is more critical than the day before because people are going out of business we're losing our industry a little bit at a time and every single day do you want to ask why is today more critical because we lost people yesterday and the day before that and the year before that and so i think the reason today is the most critical and moving forward is the most critical is exactly that you know we saw in 2015 um when cool was repealed and we can talk about cool later but that that's when we started to see it before that it was parallel the the live cattle and the box beef prices and at that point you started to see that spread and you started to see no correlation between the live cattle market and box beef prices in an article that you wrote you know quoted a regional packer from texas last year that spoke in south dakota that said there can be no correlation between box beef prices and live cattle and in my world that just doesn't make any sense if we can't correlate the raw product to the actual retail product you know so in 2015 the packers started dabbling in in unexpected market practices and market behavior we started to see that we've had some of these black salon events and every time you know first it was they were gaining you know three or four or five hundred dollars ahead and after the fire in 2019 it was 700 ahead and and they started dabbling in those practices and they figured out that nobody's hitting the reset button though nobody's watching over them cattle producers are going out of business and losing more and more money and they just keep jacking their prices up for for you guys and jacking our prices down and so you know lately we've seen them over a thousand dollars ahead and so i think every day is absolutely more critical um and nobody wants the packers to go out of business we realize they're an important part of this process but if there's a thousand or twelve hundred dollars to be made on every head that goes through their doors if that was shared amongst all of us you know a few hundred dollars each i think this conversation probably wouldn't even be happening but right now that's not happening because they're putting that squeeze in that pinch point i guess i i would add to that you're seeing develop as two different markets entirely you have the cash market and you have the alternative marketing arrangement market okay every year we kill 650 to spare every week we kill 650 to 680 000 finished cattle in this country 85 percent of them go through four companies two foreign two globe the other two are global that's 26 million head of cattle a year so any local initiatives that we have are not going to fix that problem but that's where we go back to the different tracks the big antitrust track the direct legislation track and then also this track because some people laugh about ranchers but we are the risk takers and entrepreneurs and i know you guys are too small business is a better way to put that not ranchers we're all small businessmen and we understand that it takes profit to innovate and i guess that's why this panel excites me because i think that there's so many opportunities for economic development some will have gold shovels and some will not you know what senator rounds is working on is not gold shovel but that is economic development when we can return more of that producer dollar back to producers rural america south dakota that's the the hand that feeds us all but then also it'll be interesting to hear from you guys about what you think because you know that's so much of what i see in in our caf or in politics or in business in general we all think we know what each other think but we don't so so i'm excited for that and then issues like amcool you know i i did a couple charts for the panelists and they're very simple charts this is just the return to the ranch of the consumer retail dollar and for every year in my life that trajectory has been down the other chart is almost the same thing but it shows the value of finished cattle versus the value that your customers the consumers and me i shop grocery stores that they pay and up to 2014 we ran together and sometimes the cattlemen was above what the consumer is paying because of the drop value that's the the byproduct value which now is 10 to 12 100 that's what a lot of old-timers say that's what packing plants used to run on was the drop value that was their profit they got to keep that because that whole animal has value but then in 14 when a lot of things happen droughts happened but to me the most important thing was when the cool was repealed because what justin tupper did in dc is he said competition competition competition have no capitalism if you don't have competition and and we lost a crucial piece of competition in 2014 when we lost the ability to compete with imports and so i'm sure that somebody else will expand upon that you know when we lost m cool it gave the processors the ability to import beef unwrap it re-wrap it and put a product to the usa label yeah let me just add that's a department of ag rule that's been in effect since at least 2003 that we've got legislation in to fix but they could do it with the stroke of a pen right now they won't do it and when you tell somebody that they look at you like you're crazy because it doesn't make any sense and so those are the things but you know i i really wanted this chart to show you guys who probably know i mean it's not us right it's not the cattleman it's that processor that global processor that's gobbling that up and taking it away so so that's what i fight for is to get these trends back in line get the producer share back in line because it's a it's a valuable product so that's what i've got let me break this up just a little bit don't you guys think it would be worthwhile if on your market shelf you had an item that said basically look here's our beef but on these items that may have a voluntary and it's a voluntary sticker by the way what what the rule says is if you bring in box beef and it's from overseas if you're a processor all you got to do is repackage it well when it's box b they're going to repackage it when it's repackaged you can put a voluntary label on it product of the usa so if you repackage it so when it comes in to you folks can you share a little bit about how that works within the grocery store sure sure so when it when it comes into us i mean we're seeing just exactly what senators are saying we're seeing a a box beef product usa we buy uh 90 plus percent of our beef from awg associated wholesale grocers based on kansas city norfolk division but it all comes in just just exactly like you're talking about and then we've got to cut it up and package it up for customers okay what about if it was pork uh let's just talk pork butt it's it's it's smoking time of the year pork butt how does that come to you uh that pork butt i'm sorry go ahead well usually like from smithfield we get most of our meat from smithfield for pork it comes repackaged retail label already on all we have to do is weigh it and put it out we don't have to cut it up with pork butts pork chops different stores we cut those up but some of that stuff comes retail on it um that's the product it's an integrated part of the part of the process right now for the grocer for a lot of the stuff that's out there ribs is probably the same way pre-packaged brought them on in ready to go good quality but nonetheless part of the process now where the grocer's getting it and setting it on the shelf but it's pre-packed and ready to be laid out in front of the consumer it's pretty efficient if i could ask you guys a question you know i i like to do a little you know hobby meat processing so i'm going to a local grocery store and i'll i'll get a case of pork bellies or this or that and and the old guy in there has a has a sheet of paper that says you know we get monday delivery so if we go in there pork bellies are you know x number dollars this week it's just what it is right it's sort of like us when we go you know if brett has a low in fat cattle he's got one guy maybe that comes out this week and says dollar ten take it or leave it and i and is that true with you guys you have a basically a sheet an order sheet that says here's your price for the week take it or leave it and they know you're gonna take it because like you said earlier you've got to have meat that's what gets the people into your stores and your restaurants yeah i actually have an experience from last week we had the everybody knows that capcom tubes of the hamburger 80 we have them in our at 269 a pound well the warehouse our grocery company got shorter to come to packer that week so we got a shipment in that friday they raised the price of three dollars and thirty cents or a cost so we were losing over four dollars a two um but we had to sell it to the consumer also we're gonna get upset that we're raising the price and not doing the ad price so um the prices have gone up 50 in the last two months and it's just our market i mean probably 50 of our meat that we're selling we're selling breakeven or lose money on it so and if i could i'd just like to highlight and hear what what dan is saying you know when you put an advertisement out for a consumer these guys have to honor that i mean it's sort of an unwritten contract between you know the owners of the grocery store and the consumer regardless of what the back end price is and so it's not just on hamburger it's on a lot of different products where the price the price that they pay is not consistent necessarily and it fluctuates but the price that they advertise on the back end of the consumer they've got to honor it's an unwritten contract and that's sort of the challenge that we've heard from a number of folks including these guys is no wonder they're not making any money because they're having to advertise for a price this year and they're having to pay for a price that's here and so a lot they're not making any money on the product that they're selling even though it's more expensive to the consumer keisha where do you get where do you get your beef well we get ours our reinhardt but i was going to add to that nathan when you were talking about the farmers making the money at turtle creek we don't have any problem not raising our prices if we would know that the farmers and ranchers were getting that money because then we know that that money is going to come back to our community but the problem is is that money's not coming back right because they're in the same crunch that we're in so we really wouldn't have a problem if we knew you guys were getting it but we know you're not because of the when we went to that rally to stop the stealing and omaha that was held a few years ago we really chuckled when we stopped on our way home and had a 50 state after we were talking you know to nationwide producers about the low cattle presence so yeah it's the same thing so following up some more on that brett tucked competition competition and that's i think what we're hearing from you folks so um what is your situation when you're sourcing your meet do you have options more than one sort of um most independent groceries are gonna pick one wholesaler um and that's gonna uh uh that will accommodate probably about fifty percent of your purchases the rest might be you know coke and pepsi and frito-lay we have one wholesaler which is awg we probably buy 90 of our product there for uh mostly for uh our cost and also for the quality but we also can buy beef from you know maybe 10 percent at the most we would pick up from uh restaurant supply chains stuff like that u.s foods reinhardt et cetera so let me ask this then so make the connection there between those guys that you're dealing directly with and one of the major packers out there that we all complain about well our wholesaler would be negotiating price for the box beef from from those packers and then that that is taking on the pencils does well maybe i think what centers is getting at is you've got cattle producer over here who's got a calf and maybe they feed that out or maybe they sell that calf to a cattle feeder who then sells that calf steer heifer whatever it be at a market weight to the packer the packer is processing that animal and maybe they're selling it to a wholesaler who's maybe selling it to a grocer or maybe direct to a retailer who then ultimately gets it to the consumer so from the time that you guys you know have your calf drop in the spring till the time that it ends up on a dinner plate there's probably six different steps in the process so uh theoretically let's say you decided you um wanted to get your beef somewhere else would that be possible could you get your other products still from that sure company yes absolutely source your meat somewhere else yeah yeah okay how about you keisha do you have more than one option for buying we we get ours just from one option because of quality consistency it's always going to be the same that's very important in the restaurant world we want to make sure that they get the top quality and the price but also the service that they give us there's a few options we'd love to source it locally we have a couple owners that actually are our cattle producers so we'd love to do that but it's just not feasible we we we're barely making it as it is if we start doing that but that would be we've had requests to do that let's have some you know hand county beef but we can't so to tell us why you that isn't feasible for you it's just we just aren't set up for it in miller we just don't have the options and the price obviously it's just not something that we can do but we'd love to well the 30-second answer there is obviously in a you know 1400 pound steer there's all sorts of different cuts right you've got steak you've got roasts you've got hamburger you've got ribs you've got brisket you've got all sorts of things well those folks aren't necessarily selling the exact proportion of that in their steak house that a steer or after a market weight produces and so you've got to have some sort of excess way to get rid of the cuts that aren't being purchased at a steak house right and that's really the disconnect for a lot of folks between say a small meat processor like angela leiferman and the audience here and turtle creek steakhouse that's part of the disconnect part of the reason why a lot of these folks need a packer in some way shape or form but if a bunch of producers were to get together with a bunch of south dakota feeders and work with some south dakota processors to work to come up with the consistent supply of what you guys can market year-round try to take the consumers hate this they want consistency so if we can take that i'm used to not making any money so you can pay me break even for my stairs probably take a break even for for his once they're back you don't get you know ken or somebody a wall needs to do a sizable amount so we have a consistent supply of this so when you go to your price sheets and looking for what you're going to supply to your customers all that's already been worked out i would think that would be a pretty easy sell then one part on it which is that processor uh would quickly exceed the demand in south dakota because we got a whole lot of beef out here and if they can't sell across state lines without getting a federal license to begin with one more major step yeah and then they've got to have access to a pretty in an in-depth marketplace that's pretty comfortable with the lines of distribution right now and i i agree with you there are some very high quality wholesalers out there that really do have it set up to where it's a turnkey operation and so it's a matter of this is when you bought the operation this is these are the folks that supply it for you and to break that chain is a real challenge right the issue is is in the middle of it there's still this choke point of major processors that distribute to all the wholesalers and negotiate with the wholesalers to produce that product but they're they understand because they look at each other and they don't have to communicate with each other they can see the market in terms of what's going on in the market right now because there's basically four of them and i and i think that's the part it's the reason why teddy roosevelt was concerned about antitrust way back over 100 years ago you need the open competition and transparency and so i'm going to come back in on this thing here wouldn't it be interesting to be able to know what the guy down the street's getting for formula beef um and and and that's part of the transparency demand that we think is missing in the industry today so that you know what to expect and the guy down the street isn't getting a really good deal to supply a certain percentage of all the beef coming to a particular supplier so they don't really need everybody else's and they can wait for that price to come back down again particularly if they've got an outside source from another country that's frozen boxed and part of their vertical supply chain to kind of feed in when they want to yeah the irony of all this and i think these guys have talked about it just a little bit uh as the price is going up you know the consumer is able to purchase less of really good quality south dakota beef i mean just give us a couple of anecdotes about what you're seeing right now related to sort of consumer behavior well i mean most of our customers are on fixed income so you know they've only got 100 a month or 200 a month spent and so they come into our stores and they you know geez everybody deserves a nice fat ribeye once in a while and they see that that's 16 18 bucks a pound but they're not going to buy it okay so they're going to trade down to a mid-level steak and those that were buying a mid-level steak are trading down to a lower level steak or going to pork or chicken or smoked meats um it's and what happens there is that that penny profit the dollars going through the till shrinks and so does our margin so we're actually making less money with these high beef prices and when we make less money um you know we you know can't afford to sponsor ball teams we can't afford to donate to the parish supper help a local person with cancer give scholarships all the things that we do uh that puts that in jeopardy so have you been forced into changing your offerings based on what consumers are looking for are you pulling things off the shelves like rib eyes that aren't selling yeah we have like let's say uh t-bones um normally we sell them at 7.99 8.99 pounds um last week they wanted them an ad for 13.99 a pound well we're not going to advertise that um we're not going to sell them with that so usually we're still going to have them on the shelf um which i sell a few of them but the amount of meat that we're selling at the high prices goes way down people are going from 10 pounds to diameter down to one and two pounders um like rf said buying um chicken or frozen meats and processed meats lunch meats and stuff like that just make it work so do you have a thought as to where this meat is going i mean obviously box beef prices are through the rough and somebody's buying it i mean it can you make a guess as to whether that must be wealthier people in other parts of the country well obviously that's that's some of it at least for our stores and our customers um it just is it just kind of trickles down i mean they're just they've only got so much money to spend and they're certainly not going to spend it on a 16 18 ribeye it's a really good point and like in the restaurant business we've decided not to increase our prices because we know that the people ordering the stakes are also on the other end of this financial hit so we can't you know well you can't in the restaurant world anyways if you raise your prices in a small town they'll never come back they'll say they'll look at your menu and be like oh my gosh they're getting a dollar more for french fries you know but so we can't um because we don't want them to pay more because they're already taking a huge hit you know it's interesting that over on the far end over there he's way different than me he's retailing losing money i'm clear over here i'm producing it i'm losing money if that's not a clear illustration of market power and what actions to limit competition and transparency can do because that market power isn't just harming me the market power is harming the guy at the polar opposite of the food supply chain and i think that's the argument for food security is once he's lost enough money retailing it what do you have to do as a small businessman you gotta quit yeah it's it's everybody in rural south dakota especially i mean no offense you two but restaurants restaurants bars and steak houses are the heart of every community that's where people go they gather no offense that's where they go but they gather they make memories they i mean after church so if you don't have these places if you don't have grocery stores for these rural communities i mean we see it happen all the time right they go away they they will go to the next town that has a grocery store has a bar so it's doing more than just hurting the farmers ranchers grocery stores restaurants it's hurting the schools it's hurting the churches it's hurting it's hurting everybody because of this um anti-competitive behavior well as i was listening to the senate testimony the other day the argument they said of why beef prices are so high in cattle our church are so cheap is over supply it's not over it's a bottleneck in the industry because of the pack control of what's being processed right now if it's an oversupply issue we wouldn't continue to to import record levels of beef and cattle and you know put that product of the usa label on that now let me let me share a little bit because there's a there's a little bit of a complication here that we got to recognize okay uh if you talk to one of the major packers and i i talked to her one of them is running about 70 capacity right now and they said the reason why they're running 70 is because they got to get their folks back to work again and they're having a difficult time getting all their people back to work again but they've still got a demand out there and they're going elsewhere picking up boxed beef that's available to them and bringing it in and when they do that that's a sale we don't get but somebody else does but the rest of the folks out there don't know the difference between what's been boxed elsewhere and brought in because you got a product of the usa marker on it to begin with and meantime there is an issue there because they'll say i i can only harvest or i can only process so much and so they don't take your product and part of what should be harvested on time is not and that's means that there's an over glut of the fats ready to go here in the united states with a processing thing that they're still moving it back out and you're still getting the product out there but they're bringing it in because it's boxed as part of a vertical integrated process that they've got and livestock they may very well they may very well own from overseas to bring in now they're supplying this consumer but they're also picking up a pretty damn good spread on what they're delivering to the consumer but that's a problem we can fix if shackle space is a problem we can fix that as long as we don't have to compete through our processing facility with stuff that's coming in from somewhere else furthermore on the shackle space throughout let's talk here there's another thing on this thing here listen when you're in the industry we talk backgrounders uh we talk to cow calf guy we talk a feeder and consumer only knows you know that there's somebody with cows and they have calves and they grow them and they're you know the if they're if they're white they give white milk if they're a cow they get chocolate milk you know but they also know that their food comes from a grocery store now those consumers understand price and they understand quality to a certain extent but they get the fact if prices are going up or if they can't find it now these guys can't be in a position where they can't get the product to begin with or that consumer's map and if that price is up high that consumer is not very happy at all either and so there's got to be a consistency in the quality and consistency on the price and availability all the time on the other side of it we talk the markets in our own lingo about this stuff and in the middle of it we got to build a team of consumers who are really you know you're getting hit you're getting hit so is the consumer getting hit we need them and we've got to be able to share this story with them so that when they go back in no matter what state they're in in the united states they're talking to a member of the senator remember the house saying my prices on this stuff is too high and i understand that i got guys out there that make these cows and and these calves they're going broke what's going on here and why aren't you doing something about it i mean that's where we got to go with this thing so we got to build this team across state lines and we've got to talk in terms that a consumer would understand and get because they got to send that message back in to congress so every morning i wake up when i'm having my coffee i get to well almost every morning i see that iv commercial that comes on on cbs it talks about how they're sourcing the best cattle in the upper midwest to serve to their customers i'm like well those are my cattle but my cattle go to iowa nebraska they're finished down there and then they're ending up at tyson or somewhere else and then reinhardt or u.s foods comes in there and cherry picks coolers and then they take the cream of the crop and they offer it to you guys why are we doing that why not why can't we take credit you know for what we're doing and that's yeah i think a platform needs to be built to connect the consumer to the cattlemen and share that message and and start the consistent supply of what we're doing here so so tyson and you know they don't take credit for it so we're we're adding value to what we have right here so i can make a dollar and leverage it and go to town and spend two that's the greatest economic development in the world i i'm gonna pull and then run here okay this was set up to have this kind of discussion in front of a group to kind of get active going on here a little bit let's just do this because i think you folks understand this and there's going to be questions out here with all due respect no speeches but if you've got a specific question for somebody up here a little bit let's try a couple of quick questions here because we said we'd have a hard stop at 11 at 11 o'clock and it's it's it's 10 30 now let's do this let's just open this thing up is that okay if we just do this thing here but let's do this thing quick pat i told you earlier i appreciated what you did back there to try to pull this thing together if you got a question for this group up here i'm going to give you first shot well i wanted to give a speech so i better just questions out there yeah yeah yeah my name is kenny fox kenny and i yes hi katie how are you good thank you for what you've been trying to do for us appreciate it very much uh i have to agree with eric on the import issue we can just look at our sheep industry and see what's happening in that and that's that's the path that we're going down in the gallery industry we import fifty percent of the land that we eat in the united states there's really no reason for that uh and uh if we want to make our own country profitable and take care of everyone here uh so i think the fact that that is the one single thing that we can do right away that would put money in the producers pocket is limit these imports we we need some kind of quota system tariffs you know we get into some mucky water there but a quarter will slow it down uh i have a nephew that was trucking hey in nebraska during the coca thingy bring it back up to south dakota he met truckload after truckload of canadian cattle coming in here when american producers could not market their cap now we as producers pay our taxes here we should get first first service and then take care worry about imports later i understand there's trade agreements that we're involved in that make that somewhat difficult uh when it comes to the issue of trade we need to be more persistent and get our country more than labeling uh in those agreements thank you can you let me just hit one item on it real quick i don't think we're going to be successful if we say we're going to limit imports today but what i think we can do is to differentiate what we're an import that where stuff is coming in from outside but i think the way that we got to do it and what we've tried to share is is we can legislate direction to our trade reps to build that into our trade agreements which is the part that's been lacking in the past because you can legislate in the in in in congress that we're going to put it in but that violates if we've already made a treaty with somebody that'll violate a treaty that's where the w where the wto comes in and bangs on us and says we're going to charge you or we're going to put a tariff on other products and that's what got us into trouble originally with the the original m cool process now it was working while it was in place until wto made the ruling and basically said mexico and canada have been harmed by it but if you build that in like we do with other stuff you can make it work okay pat you got a question could i ask you a question like his yeah this book has nas data verified by economic research service and the focus that we have to have and this is not just swabbing his ego because senator rounds is mucho with us he is and he gets the picture and so the picture is this the damage to justice of the consumers is the holocaust and it is completely imploding not just the meat industry and the food industry but the globalist organizations are deceiving everyone and the data that's available is the true data from national ag statistics service and collaborated by economic research service and it runs like this we right now we're told that mandatory cool which was the most unified piece of legislation to consumer demands ever in history of our nation senator tim johnson told me that it was 85 to 90 percent of every survey the consumer said we want to know where our meat and food come from it's a consumer justice issue and senator rounds is on that in a huge way we've got to hold his arm up and here's how it goes the wto wrote to the us department of agriculture and told the biggest lie that could ever affect cowboys and consumers they said in 2014 and 2015 when mandatory pool were fully enforced you've damaged canada and mexico who were the other two partners in this tri-party trade agreement and that damaged their trade exports to the united states of capital was it the truth not only was it not the truth it was the opposite of the truth they were the two highest years in 11 years and that's available from any nas office in any state or any fsa office and it could have been gleaned by just saying okay have a show cause hearing bring your information so this is how it comes down you've got about 342 million people in this country they eat 90 pounds of beef a year from average for a long time but we at that time were importing a huge amount of livestock but the amount of cattle that were coming in from canada and mexico was humongously grown during those two years that we were enforcing mandatory schools so when we took the legislation away because the wto threatened now think of the fact think of the macroeconomics of this they said we're going to find you 1.1 billion if you don't rescind that legislation so okay we'll get rid of it the cattle market dropped immediately by more than 50 but just take 50 so you got 43 million head of cattle they dropped from 1500 to 750 whether they're a dry cow or a calf that's the 30 billion with a b hit because we didn't want to pay the 1.1 billion dollar fine what cowboy thinks like that this is so stupid in every economics college in the world says that a dollar made by the addition of capital and labor is times seven in its effect in the whole economy so take six years of no mandatory pool we lost 30 billion plus per year to the producers in the infrastructure economy he did have a question in his i'm getting to the question [Music] to the nation because we didn't even check the numbers to see if the wto is run by globalist cabals of money changers and so all we have to do is restore consumer justice the nation is screaming to know that what i paid for is really that because they're being lied to right now they're totally being lied to and we've got to get back to the fundamentals of that and senator rounds is focused on that we've got to support him in a big way and so the question is this given that we can do this by animating the unity bringing our team together and causing a whole bunch of cowboys that are deluded by the bribed effect of certain ag organizations that are just following after the wto and the jbs and packer companies all we have to do is focus on the truth if there's any question in your mind if me or the usda national ag statistics service numbers are maybe out there just exaggerating will ask that question but it's there it's there and it was there the whole time and so we've got to empower our leaders all of them right here to know the truth because right now this is this is solid numbers we have less than half of the cows that it takes to feed our own nation don't tell me anymore about how we need to expand exports pat you gotta get to the question the question is this if we do our duty and restore mandatory cool how many minutes would it be from the time that we announced that we're going to restore mandatory cool change the script in the usmca before there is an inflammation to the market discovery of our cattle and our sheep and the whole national economy including our milk how long would that take here's what will happen let me just share with you once once we're able to negotiate the mandatory country of origin labeling at that stage of the game consumers will now be able to determine where their beef is coming from the value of u.s beef in my humble opinion begins to climb again but something else happens as well we export beef and once we have trade agreements in place that recognize our ability to do that it doesn't limit our ability to continue to export more beef and so we want to be able to not only export and to have a free market internally we want it externally as well to other countries as well and so look do we want to get to mandatory country of original labeling the answer is yes is there a way to do it the answer is yes it requires that we put it in treaty in order to make it work the challenge and pat's right when he says there was a billion dollars that was the first threat and then it was going to be increased after that by another billion dollars in terms of what they were going to assess us but the assessment wasn't going to be a fine the assessment was going to be a tariff on other commodities so if you're one of the producers of other commodities you're in knocking on your legislators door on your congress person's door saying wait a minute i didn't have anything to do with this but wto is gonna assess a tariff on my commodity that's where the hang-up on it becomes not so much that the federal government would pay a penalty but other other producers of other products would pay a penalty when they go to export their products that was the reason why the wto movement was so devastating in this thing but i i i'm just going to say this again i appreciate past support i appreciate his comments i don't disagree with the analysis that says that this is a critical thing and it will help to rebuild our economy but i am going to give some other folks a chance pat here to actually ask questions if they want to ask questions one more question well i mean let me just run this by and give some other folks the opportunity here yeah you bet any uh state policy that can help out in this area maybe for for nathan or james or new senators had a lot of i mean experience and wins in that area let's get it what do you think tons of policy i mean just a couple of weeks ago unprecedented uh all the livestock groups within the state got together our calf stock growers cattlemen bureau union and then missing one lma um and we talked about that we said you know we disagree on a few things let's leave them at the door let's get together and actually talk about things similar to what we're doing today and one of the biggest things that came out of there is that transparency piece and the senator alluded to that earlier you know if we've got 70 or more of the cattle in this country being sold captive supply and and those backdoor sweetheart deals we never know what those are that's not good i heard this just the other day that those backdoor sweetheart deals is the tool that corporations big corporations have used for hundreds of years to eliminate competition in the little guys so we can just get that one thing out there get some some actual transparency get a market but that transparency has got to be done at the national level absolutely it's been tried at the state level and it was unconstitutional it was declared unconstitutional you can't do it at the state level you got to do it at the national level what do you think of complete transparency define it complete when i go to sport pair and buy light calves everybody knows how many i bought what sex they were what they weighed what i paid for them i take them home i grow them up i bring them back in the fall everybody knows how many i brought the sex the weight and the price that's total transparency that most of us in the cash market operate in by the way commentators all over this country make their living reporting on cash trade right now it's about 17 percent of the market there's price transparency another that's that's how much of the stuff is actually transferred today if i'm on a bill with chuck grassley and by the way chuck grassley is a champion on this stuff uh he when chuck grassley speaks he's on the judiciary committee and so forth when chuck grassley speaks on this stuff people listen chuck wants and i'm with him on one that says fifty percent of whatever a a process whatever processors does when they buy it they gotta buy it fifty percent of what they buy is gonna be on the open market and they got to move it every two weeks that we caught 50 14. okay right now that one is one of his bills now there's another bill out there that says look we don't know if they can make that work or not but if we could get 30 and and then 14 or whatever the number is even that would make a major change in this entire process to do it so i don't know if we never get to 100 but i think if we continue to push them to say if you're gonna bring it in the stuff that you do has got to be price transparent open market cash price well i'm on the bill with him at fifty percent yep transparency though yeah if we could get that you'd make a major change in the market today a major change in the market today yes sir i'd love to add to that creating we trade fat cattle on a negotiated basis creating a rule to do that does not change how many buyers there are they're still going to go back in my opinion to the same people that they have deals with and buy those cattle first comments to that justin tupper uh said this to me the other night he said you know the most important person in the entire ring is the second bidder there's a lot of truth to that also that a free market if there's this much profit at the processing level how come the free market's not filling that void is there barriers is it labor shortages is it capital i don't think it's capital we see big projects happen all the time i would add inspections and the senators introduced bill several times for for state inspections to be able to go federal uh have the same rights privileges better i would guess i would gather that's a that's a barrier to that entry i mean if we know we can build a certain size packing plan then we're going to come get attacked from either the inspections or the big processors it really inhibits that capital influx in the processing sector uh when you ask the question about what can the state do i think a major step forward would be provide incentives and opportunities for more small processors to get into this thing and i like the idea that the state has done now with regard to joining a compact a cooperative to sell across state lines that's very healthy we need more states doing that but to provide an incentive to be able to process meats means value added in our state and allow them to be able to move across state lines and to market they're not going to make it's not going to make huge impact compared to the major guys but it's one more and if we can get enough of those you do make a difference senator stop looking at my sheet because that was what i wrote down and answer your question okay that's exactly right make it easier for smaller processors to operate uh we've got you know the secretary of agriculture in here we've got dr rodakova in here part of the conversation and they've been working on that for quite a long time and certainly appreciate that program that was uh that governor noam helped put together the five million dollar assistance for small meat processors more of that kind of thing certainly uh is gonna create more market opportunities for these guys over here who are raising cattle and make it easier for these guys to source their product in a consistent high quality manner that's the table we're missing up here maybe is we need to hear from our process we've got small processors and we've got a great big processor and nothing in between we've got a whole bunch of cattle and retailers that are saying hey we can sell this stuff but our only source of it right now is reinhardt or u.s foods or whoever it is you know we need to talk to our local processors to see can they fill that you know is it is it five to 15 a week or is it 150 a week how many cattle do we have to kill in south dakota and where are we going to do this so we can supply what we're raising and feeding in south dakota to the people that are asking for it there's a gentleman right here that has ham too yeah i'm i'm backstage we farm and ranch and i have a feedlot and i own the belt and phillips livestock sailboats um i i'm glad i get to ask you this question i'm glad you grabbed that but we're all talking about market transparency and all these backdoor deals and all this that happens and it exists i mean we handle hundreds of thousands of cattle i understand backdoor deals that i understand negotiations but this 54 i think it sounds really good but the part that i hang up on it is and maybe i'll stop myself there and say we deal with the pns all the time the usda the state that they're on us all the time but i deal with the package a lot too and i see what they do and i want to know who's going to regulate 50 14. who's going to be the police force on that let me share with you i think the intent was the current regulators for the packers would probably be challenged with it but nonetheless the first step on it is is you write the legislation and then you lay out the guidelines for creating the regulation that's the way washington works on it the challenge we've got right now and it's the reason why beginning last year we started out with a letter that four of us got on asking these folks to actually investigate whether or not we had anti-trust activity going on among the major packers we got four folks to sign out of the first letter 18 days later we had 18 more people that signed on that first set of letters asking again seriously to get on now that was a previous administration but we got some action on it anecdotally we understand that there's an investigation that was started because we had some folks come back to some of our members of the senate and tell them that they've been contacted now since that time there have been two more letters that have gone out asking the new administration and the new attorney general to actually investigate the packers for anti-trust activities and furthermore if there do not have evidences of anti-trust violations to work with us on amending the laws to modernize the laws to actually make them enforceable since that time the second time around now a lot of the cattle producers that are here belong to associations that have supported the letter that we put together uh and got and got 28 members of congress now to sign on with us laying out the problem of the disparity between what the consumer is paying and what the cattle of a producer is getting paid and where that disparity is being held at to point out the fact that there is a problem within the free market system today the reason why i go through that whole program is is we may very well have a problem with uh the system that we have in place for regulating any part of the major packers today in the department of ag or to the department of justice which is the reason and this is a we just added additional legislation this last week on a bipartisan basis asking for a separate specific office with the ability to investigate whether or not those anti-trust rules and so forth are being violated bipartisan legislation and the same thing is going on in the house of representatives because they're seeing what's happening to consumers and they're seeing what's happening to producers and they know there's a problem in there so to answer your question if we're successful in our legislation it may very well be that new office that would be challenged with actually doing the investigation not just a single person but an office in the department of ag but with affiliation with the department of justice we don't have that connection today so your question is a very valid question either way it would be a government entity office yeah okay can i ask one more question yeah yeah i'm getting a lot of signals here i think we need to wrap it up we can can we take we can talk on i'll i'll visit with you afterwards but i appreciate your in-depth question yeah thank you yeah i i just think all of this conversation is obviously very very important to everybody here um i wanted actually to circle back around with you guys for one more question uh during when the covid pandemic kind of first started affecting us last spring um and we were seeing of course in news reports that beef was not available on a lot of grocery store shelves i don't know if you guys dealt with that or not um i as a writer was hearing from a lot of ranchers saying can you please write a story so people know that we are still producing beef that you know we we're still doing everything we can it's not our fault there isn't beef in the grocery store we want to help our consumers we want to make sure that they can get what they want i guess my question to you guys is do you feel like consumers are still concerned about food security were they concerned about food security or has their concern gone more to price now um and also i'm just going to throw this in there too since i know we're running really short of time what what do you think your consumers feel about are they interested in country words and labeling are they concerned about where their beef is coming from i absolutely think that they're interested in knowing where their beef comes from i think they're itched cool [Music] during the pandemic we definitely had some supply issues some shortages those have kind of ironed out by now but you know just the same thing the prices were up and down and consumers not knowing where to go and we and quite frankly we didn't know where to go yeah thank you uh yeah for my stories we're really about local selling local products and stuff and i would love to sell and say this is from south florida or nebraska or the local beef um man i know our customers will spend more money to buy local stuff i mean they would pay a dollar more steak to know where decorators come from um and yeah with during cobit we ran into spy issues people were stocking up on me and getting nervous that's gonna run out so trying to educate the consumer like it's not going to run out the plenty of beef around but now it's more i think the pricing we have the meat but the pricing's just way up there that there can't afford it so they're buying them more on healthier products and you need to fix that somehow yeah mine's a little different so i know they want to know where their beef comes from absolutely and there's when they come in they want to know and like it comes from reiheart like they cherry pick it it's just the way it works um but they they want a fair price as well i mean they think when they see a price tag on the menu or the grocery store they think that these guys are making a lot of money and that's just not the case um so yeah i think they they want a good quality product they want to know where it comes from but they want a fair price as well so what can we do for you to make your job easier it's consistency it's a consistent supply yeah it's education but i kind of got to dumb it down a little bit guys like you all use words that i am like what are they talking about what is today's generation z consumer really asking for i mean they're way more in tune than than my generation you know i gotta after i switch from the hyvee commercial and uh on my way to fox news you know i hit cbs and i got to hear you know vladimir dutie talking about the belching and farting cow ruining the environment you know what is cool what is it is today's consumer really going to consider other plant-based protein sources and is that going to be what you guys are selling in your grocery stores if they get their way is it education that we need to is it the one on one with with the the the minneapolis soccer moms that say you know you spend a lot of money on panagonia and under armour and everything else image is really important to the american consumer why wouldn't what we're putting in their mouth be just as important i would give them a reason to to you know buy the best yeah they're advertising that um it's just like let's look at milk um the soy milk the almond milk um that's increasing i mean every year and the milk is going down i mean it's going it could be the same with the meat we gotta educate the consumer that beef is where it's at but and we're not destroying the environment and and being cruel whatever it is they they're thinking yeah that's i think that's the platform maybe we're missing is that that network to to reach out to the consumers and find out what they really want and we're probably not that far off in what we're doing but to keesha's point you know in order to get this settled at a local level you know i had a lot of producers reaching out to me during the pandemic can i sell you something and and or trying to set up for the future how can we get this figured out but we just aren't talking the same language i mean i have no idea how many head of cattle we would sell in a year you know i know how many pounds of burger i sell i know how many pounds of stew meat i sell and how many minute steaks and uh t-bones but i have no idea how that equates on your side but the salt can be reconciled right oh i think so absolutely and i think more conversations like this this is great what south dakota retailers did bringing in such different perspectives and then having somebody sit down with us and explain but just working together i think more of this would be would help a lot is there a site out there through through the retail association that says you know this is how many ribeyes south dakota grocers and and restaurants go through in a week this is how many t-bones okay so we've got twenty percent of the carcass sold now we got to figure out what we're going to do with the chucks and the rounds and do we work with our hotels prisons school systems to utilize 100 of the carcass and once we know that and that's all collected then you come to us and say okay you get some feeders and cowboys lined up and let's get a consistent supply of this 365 days a year now now let's go find out where we're going to process these things are we going to toll process them at some big packing plant or are we going to help all of our local processors go from from five to ten had a week to 50 to 100 head a week or a month and then solve all those challenges of workforce and the things that go along with a local processing facility in a small community and i think you just articulated why what you're talking about hasn't happened yet there are a lot of different dials that need to be adjusted and there's no one single entity who can sort of see the big picture but i think when all that has been done i think we're gonna see a big gaping hole there that says you know what we need four or five processing facilities in south dakota that can do 30 40 head a week 50 head a week whatever it is is that better than one great big one absolutely for national security it is for flow for diversity for for our rural access our in our local communities and somebody actually thought about that 20 years ago 20 years ago somebody in this room thought about that very thing so i guess um to kind of pull everything together uh as a rancher myself as also working in the livestock industry in the newspaper industry raising cattle there's few things i enjoy more than serving good meat to my family and i think i'm hearing the same thing from you all as far as your customers go on behalf of the cattle industry thank you for selling meat thank you for representing me so well and being proud to sell meat and being interested in south dakota meet that is um just i think a huge step forward and just really music to our ears to hear how interested you are in that um and and thank you to everyone for being here and hearing the concerns of the industry today i think we're gonna wrap things up with some closing comments if i don't know we'll just go back maybe the same direction as we open if you all wanna just share your closing thoughts um yeah i guess we're just we want to be selling a quality product at the best price we can for our consumer um i think there's been some at the state level we sell like locker on sticks and jerky we use like flat locker and he wants to sell at our store in nebraska but he can't right now because they cross state line so just small things like that will gradually increase the local production um going forward so people like local stuff in this area yeah so i mean we're doing the best we can do and if we just keep getting that message out that we want farmers and ranchers to make money so that our communities make money because we want to make sure we have these communities for our kids and our grandkids to come back to and have the same quality of life that we have that's it's part of our culture it's part of who we are and we we we need something to be done with this anti-competitive um meat packing it's just devastating to south dakota right now especially to our rural communities for sure and i'm so excited to be here this was this is great thank you for the opportunity so that's going to be down buoy foods we certainly pride ourselves in quality meat which is why we offer sort of by angus beef but more importantly we pride ourselves in being a big part of the community so we need our farmers and ranchers and producers to make money so they could spend money in our stores but i'd like to see everybody stay diligent in how we can get the farmers and ranchers producers making more money and keeping our small towns thriving because that's that's what i'm passionate about yeah i think competition is a wonderful thing and maybe that's that's what we're lacking right now all the way from from the cow calf to the feedlot all the way up to the retailers is diversity is great um it's we don't want to have all our eggs in one basket because it creates a toilet paper shortage you know when you have a panda again i think one key thing we need to walk away with is what is our consumer asking for it's we live in a world now where social media just we know know everything and we want to know everything so we need to we need to share our message i feel i would be happy to have any consumer come to my ranch and see what i do and how i care for my animals it's i'm passionate about it that's why i do it i don't do it for the money i do it because i get to raise my kids as i'm out working and watch my kids gain some responsibility and and trust in themselves i think that's wonderful so i think we just we don't want to just put our heads down and just continue to work that's why i'm here i love to work that's what i wish i could just do but but we need to do this we need to find out what our consumers are asking for and work towards that i think to add to that you know moving forward there's going to be a social aspect that the younger generation wants with whatever they buy and that that's a good thing for us we have a great story to tell we really do and and we so often like you you said we tell it to ourselves all the time when we sit here and talk all these but but we need you guys and i'm so happy to get together with you to get to know you maybe mr sanderson and i need to get together and come up with you know some legislative issues at the state and level and to take to the dc delegation but but there's going to be a social aspect especially with with the food that people buy moving ahead and i think that's a battle that we can win we just got to figure out how to do it in an efficient way from a cattle producer side our cap and i am cool is my issue it's right it's true it's competitive but things like mpool 5014 antitrust issues to go at this consolidated processing is consolidated global processing group that's looking out the front door of the packing plant at the cattlemen telling him what his cattle are worth without proper value discovery also wheeled that same power out the back door loading the trucks coming to grocery stores and restaurants across this nation now senator rounds had a great letter with the ron smith letter that he sent to the attorney general because bipartisan bipartisan by camera because we had an independent on there right because it it didn't just call on somebody else to do something it called for cooperation between the attorney general congress and the doj to get to the bottom of what's really going on with this and then it went to list several specific things which is something no other letter had done i believe that that letter and the amount of calls from real producers and consumers are what educated so well educated the senate ag committee for the hearing that we had last week so it's no one big step it's a series of small steps that add to it but i want to thank the senator for that i want to thank these guys for this and i think the realization that i take is just the fact that we're both looking down the same barrel of guns pointing in opposing directions and competition not harming anyone but just mandating competition and transparency is the answer for that but we have to get moving we've been fighting this battle too long it has to happen soon so thank you thank you well from my perspective thanks to the 50 or so people that we've got in the audience here on a friday morning talk for a couple hours about this really important issue you know i think we've heard today that market stability you know that regular supply chain at a reasonable cost that benefits everybody and we're not necessarily seeing that right now and so you know these guys that i love working with they they own and operate these stores and restaurants and grocery stores and meat processors in south dakota these guys love their communities they love their customers they want to give them a good product at a reasonable price and this is the kind of thing that it impacts us all and we're happy to be part of the conversation and working with you all and certainly thanks to senator rounds for your really diligent interest in this important issue thank you let me just say thanks to kerry for coordinating and helping to to make this whole thing come together appreciate what you're doing here nathan thanks for helping to put together the team here it is greatly appreciated uh look i i would love to see more local processors number one and i think that's something that is very doable uh we need to provide the incentives uh and and and make it as easy in terms of a regulatory process for small processors to compete and to stay in business and to get employees here second piece on it is is we're not going to be living in a world during our lifetime in which you don't have major processors and if you're doing 650 000 head plus on a regular basis you you need major packers to be able to do that but they also have to have first of all laws that are very clear about what the rules of the road are in terms of competition and then you've got to have a good series of enforcement activities to make sure that the rules are followed to allow for a fair playing field for everybody that's not happening today so i think what this comes back to is is consumers expect to have a consistent flow they expect to have a consistent product they expect to have a high quality product at an affordable price a fair price producers want a fair market where they can compete but to where they're not being manipulated by a vertically integrated system that that's just simply a not not a fair competitive price to where everybody knows what the market really is for me what i want is is to be able to step by step work our way through what congress has to do in order to get back to a good market that treats people fairly and i i think teddy roosevelt was right when he said you got to have the rules of the road laid out i think he was right when he tried to do anti-competitive legislation back in the 1920s and i think it's time that we either number one get to the bottom of whether or not the folks that are out there right now have figured out ways to manipulate the market and if they are we got to fix it and if we can't it means we got to rewrite the legislation that's out there and finally we've got to be able to provide the same incentives for food producers to recognize our need for food security food quality and availability to a consumer to where the regulatory activities in washington promote that and it's not going to be easy it's not going to get done overnight but we're in it for the long haul and one step at a time i would also say this if we can take one piece of all these things that we've talked about the way congress works is you take a piece then you start adding to it and when you're all done you can get a whole lot more done than what you thought you could have when you started consumers have got to be with us we've got to be with them what we've done here today in south dakota could be duplicated in other states where more and more consumers can see what's impacting the price that they pay and the quality of the food they've got let's see if we can't be a promoter of that and get those other 49 or 41 states that don't have as many cows as we do to recognize that they're in this with us and that if they really want that food safety in food quality they got to step up to the plate as well thank you and thank you all here for being here and participating you

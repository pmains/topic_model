thank you madam chair ranking member and thank you everyone for being here today title 10 of the public service health the public health service act provides family planning services to low-income women today there are approximately 4 000 title ten service sites in the united states including state and county health departments community health centers non-profit clinics and planned parenthood the protect life rule ensures that taxpayer-funded family planning centers will serve their intended purpose to help women receive comprehensive preventative health care while ensuring the separation of taxpayer funds from abortion services ms foster i have a couple of questions for you first how do these centers that are eligible for title 10 funding under the protect life rule provide comprehensive and primary care to women centers that will be eligible under the protect life rule will be able to to provide the range of family planning services thanks to pooling on not not every center may provide a full range that's true but within a geographical area the full range of family planning services will be will be provided if abortions only make up a small percentage of services offered by planned parenthood it should be no problem for them to comply with this rule if they or organizations similar to them were willing to comply with these simple rules would they continue to receive funding any organization that complies with the rule which again supports title 10 as enacted by congress will be eligible to continue to receive funding so if they choose to prioritize abortion over preventative women's health care they would be denying their own access to this funding i would i would consider that to be detrimental to women and girls who will fill the gap if planned parenthood refuses to comply with the protect life rule we know that there are many organizations in the marketplace of course we don't know exactly how it will impact the market because we don't know who will enter the market who may leave the market and to whom hhs will award grants but we are confident that the market can accommodate this change between community health centers federally qualified health centers and the the range of providers that um that have expressed interest and are applying in some cases have been denied like oprah group um but would be eligible under the protect life rule to receive title 10 funding for family planning services out of 4 000 title 10 sites less than 500 are planned parenthoods in my district alone there are 26 federal qualified health care centers the fqhcs compared to four planned parenthoods so this change would only allow for an expansion of coverage to more locations including all of those 26 fqhcs that don't offer abortions as well as allowing faith-based family planning centers to apply for grants without slashing access to women's health care by opening the process and allowing for religious protections this will actually expand preventative health care services for more providers to receive funding and provide additional preventative health care to low-income communities thank you madam chair for allowing me to join you today and i thank you so much for coming

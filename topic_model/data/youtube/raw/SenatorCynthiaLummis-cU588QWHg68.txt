madam chairman uh miss sagama um who sets gasoline prices at the gas pump like across the street they're like 550 a gallon back in wyoming they're like 440 a gallon sometimes i go visit my daughter in texas they're around 4 10 420 senator cruz isn't that right so they're cheaper in texas than wyoming way more expensive here of course california's off the charts who sets those prices at the gas pump well it's a it's a complex market it's not one person or one entity sending setting prices and certainly the price of gas at the pump is different in different states and different regions because of different refinery capacity um different state taxes etc so i'm not sure i've got a clear answer for you on that um as far as it's not one single person okay so so if the refinery uh in a region uh sets uh prices and only five percent which which isn't true of course but um if they set the prices and only five percent of the gas stations are owned by refiners how can that be enforced well the refiners don't set the price exactly thank you so the price at the pump is set by the person who's selling the gasoline the person who owns the gas station is that correct there are hundreds of different if not thousands of different factors that go into why prices are different at different gas stations etc but yes ultimately um the owner of that gas station is going to set the price based on what he or she is paying to get the gas in and the to the distributors there are thousands of transactions that go into this okay so who prices oil at brent or west texas intermediate crude who price is that i mean that's a global commodity price so set by who um i mean it's set by the market i'm not sure so what factors go into the market what factors um so as a producer we are price takers off of that global commodity price so i i don't i mean so let me ask you this um president biden took office january 2nd he halted new oil and gas leases on january 27th and prices went up do you think there's a correlation between those two um actions well just like any market i mean it's hard to say on any given day why a stock went up or down or the price of a commodity went up or down but signals like political signals are very important uh obviously fundamental market factors are important or are fundamental price shocks like from the invasion of ukraine all these things can affect the price of is there a connection between the supply and the price absolutely okay so uh we used to be energy independent we produced more than we needed to consume and were prices lower than um yes okay so now um all these uh policies um canceling the keystone pipeline take 30 of land off limits to oil and gas federal land halting drilling in anwar reversing the trump natural gas regulations uh reversing trump nepa regulations doe hiring a thousand employees to eliminate oil russia invading ukraine did these activities affect supply absolutely because our producers are affected by all of those regulatory measures okay so we're not consuming less we're producing less so it's got to come from somewhere so when we used to be energy independent and produce more than we needed we could export and help other countries so they're not dependent on bad actors like mr putin but now we're even the ones who are asking other countries to put more oil on the market to sell us oil when we used to produce our our oil is our oil dirtier and more environmentally toxic than their oil we probably produce the most sustainable and the cleanest oil in the world i would say the united states and canada okay so why do they call climate change global climate change because clearly we must have a bubble over north america where we can solve everybody's climate problems by the whole world's climate problems by quitting producing oil and gas here is that the case actually if we produce more natural gas we could export more and we could deliver those greenhouse gas reductions that we've enjoyed in the united states to other countries as well does india have cleaner air than we do no does it produce more uh greenhouse gas emissions than we do what about eastern europe i i don't know off the top of my head i can tell you they produce way more greenhouse gas emissions what about you talking about their oil yes absolutely russian oil is much uh has much more emissions okay what about china well their their greenhouse gas emissions are off the charts what about ours ours have been going down because of uh primarily because of increased natural gas use okay so we had six lng terminal permit requests sitting in this administration ungranted while germany is having to buy russian uh oil and natural gas why ours is cleaner quit quickly because i'd like to get to a second round quickly excuse me thank you you know what my point is global climate change is global we're producing the cleanest air of any developed nation on earth and if climate change really matter to the people who say it does we'd be spending money to help india and eastern europe get their greenhouse gas emissions now instead of these costly incremental changes that we're producing in this country when we are the global leader in clean air technology for developed nations thank you i yield back

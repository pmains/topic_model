so joining me now is kentucky senator rand paul he's spoken out about investigating potential voter fraud and he joins me now so senator paul good to have you here tonight um i'm sure you heard the news at the top of the hour tonight about the gsa beginning their process of the transition and michigan has certified their vote philadelphia county has now certified their vote but the president said there are still outstanding cases that and that they want to continue to pursue and you hear in this uh instance this this mathematician you know just really looking at this mail-in process which in in some aspects is very perplexing you know i think the first thing that we need to acknowledge is that this was an unprecedented election in the sense that normally 99 of people show up in person and we can kind of police that the right people showed up because you don't have the same people showing up again and again they sign in they show an id and it's pretty easy to validate the vote but now we have an election where maybe a third to a half mailed in their ballots this has never ever happened in our history so we have to validate were they the right people and the left keeps saying there's no evidence or there's insufficient evidence but what professor williams has done here is he's taken a random sample of republican voters and found out that there's an extraordinary number of republican voters who said they voted that weren't counted and then there's an extraordinary number of republican voters who said i didn't request about i didn't vote and yet they're recorded as having voted and when you take a random sample when you do statistics and you apply it to the whole now we have evidence of large-scale problems with the vote i think they can take this to court and show that this is a random sample that represents of a million votes now we may be talking about a hundred thousand votes that'd be enough to tip the difference i would think that if we took this to a court the court would then mandate that you have to look at all of the absentee votes one at a time not count them but verify whether or not the person who you say voted you actually call them and ask them did you vote and who did you vote for to verify the vote yeah i mean it's mind-boggling actually uh how much room there is for these kinds of mistakes and you hear these things anecdotally so it's very interesting to hear uh this this sampling of these numbers and what it what it adds up to from this professor um you know the president indicated in this tweet tonight that they've started the gsa transition process what you know you're a senator obviously you're concerned about the georgia election we know that joe biden's heading there to campaign what would be your advice for president trump tonight with regard to his own position and with regard to that senate race with regards to the senate race i think the president would be an asset to campaign for the candidates down there there's not been a politician in my lifetime or even in the previous generation that's been able to draw crowds and enthusiasm like president trump he's very popular in georgia i think he would help quite a bit to go down there and campaign for him and what about the presidency and continuing to pursue the legal avenues i think that this is an unprecedented election we've never had one like this when a third of the people vote by mail yes we need to validate that those are the correct people they actually did vote if we're not willing to do that it means we're really not willing to examine this election in its extraordinary fashion but it also means that an easiest way to validate election is to vote in person i'm not against voting early or having early voting but the majority of the vote the vast majority needs to be in person because there's so many checkpoints can you imagine calling up a million people in philadelphia and saying did you vote who you voted for and checking if that was accurate so the first thing you do is a sample like president professor williams did and when you look at this sample in a plaque to the whole you're astounded that there could be a hundred thousand invalid votes just in philadelphia so i think in the future we have to go back to in-person voting we can't just say oh here's a ballot we're gonna mail it to anyone i think it's rife for fraud and now we have scientific evidence that there may well have been widespread changes in votes in philadelphia that could have affected the election well i mean we know jimmy carter and james baker both did a study way back and said you know male and voter has a huge potential for fraud so we need to get this right before i let you go you said on outnumbered overtime today it's getting some attention there's no indication any lockdowns have slowed this down with regard to the virus obviously i think the wall street journal put it best when they said the virus is insidious it's largely spreading regardless of human behavior does that mean that you know following the guidelines for thanksgiving and all of that doesn't really keep us safer is that what you're suggesting i think if you look at the mandates and the lockdowns and you can look at chart after chart state after state country after country as the mandates have become more severe as the mass wearing has become more widespread the incidence of the infection has gone up we're going up exponentially now despite all the mandates so you can argue there may be some benefit and i think there are benefit to n95 masks the other masks don't work and there would be benefit if you are at high risk to wear one but having everyone wear one is not a good idea in the sense that i don't think is necessarily helping it's incredibly invasive and one point on your herd immunity your doctors were saying we need two thirds well in new york city a third of the people have antibodies so it may be that you get to hurt immunity must much faster with only a third being vaccinated i'm still for everybody being vaccinated yeah it's interesting that we have a lot of antibodies out there and many more people have had this actually know it yeah and if you did massive antibody testing you probably could get the vaccines to the people who need them more effectively um and you would reach immunity in a quicker way uh through that way thank you all right thanks yeah go ahead i was just going to say interestingly the way we know how we do the antibody testing is also random sampling they sample 3 000 people in new york they take that percentage but then they extrapolate it to the whole of new york and they find out that about a third of new york has had antibodies which is a good it wasn't good because a lot of people unfortunately died by getting the infection but the good news now is it's going to speed up herd immunity as we get the vaccine that it may come quicker than some people think yeah makes a lot of sense senator paul good to see you thank you very much thank you

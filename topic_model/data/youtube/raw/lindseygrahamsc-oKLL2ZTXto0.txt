and now here's the happy conservative warrior Mike Gallagher I believe there's a a go-to guy over the Benghazi scandal Senator Lindsey Graham has been you know sounding the clarion call for truth from day one of course senator Graham is member of the Senate Armed Services Committee he also logged six and a half years of services active duty as an active duty as an Air Force lawyer and served his country in the US Air Force Reserves he's the only u.s. senator serving in the guard of the reserves he has always dealt with this Benghazi issue in a very forthright way let's welcome on our guest line from the great state of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham senator great having you back on the program have you been sir I've been doing great thanks for that lead in yesterday was a phenomenal day for the truth trey Gowdy from South Carolina did a terrific job sir David's aiza but these three witnesses just to get to the heart of the matter completely contradicted the story being told by the white house after Benghazi they've contradicted the Pentagon narrative that nobody was told to stand down they provided information that Hillary Clinton's right-hand person sure Mills was trying to censor what the State Department was telling members of Congress have visited uh-uh Libya after the attack uh there's just so much that came out of this hearing and we're gonna keep pushing well and Senator you know I years ago you told me in your office the you didn't come to Washington to not get anything done you know and I was very impressed by that it always stuck with me I also wonder if you feel like I do sometimes that you know the old lone voice in a wilderness crying out saying wait a minute is anybody paying attention to this I mean a lot you know what I mean I mean honestly then the reaction to Benghazi from Democrats I mean I played earlier to Democrat congressman's response Elijah comin the Cummings litter he said we can know remember something death is a part of life that with that that's the reaction to the depth of the murder of these four miracles another congressman out of Vermont said listen ambassador Stevens knew the risk I mean these are the kinds of things they're saying I think in an effort to minimize what I believe is this is a scandal of Watergate like proportions well let's get to the heart of the matter those who serve us in harm's way do so as volunteers on the State Department CIA and department defense I've never seen the brought the bond that has existed between those in harm's way and their government broken more than been gotten people are furious in the military in the State Department and if you're going to put people out into the wilderness in places like Benghazi in Libya and do the bidding of the American people they've got to believe one you won't lie about what happened to them and to you will help them when they need your help and you will listen to them when they tell you something all of those things have been destroyed from Benghazi what's my goal is to let people know what happened hold those accountable who let it become a death trap who did not provide aid when they could and who lied about what happened and to make sure that the next group who finds themselves in harm's way harm's way believes the system responded to my Democratic friends you should want to know why the administration blamed a video and a riot that never existed as much as I do you should want people to believe who serve our nation that they're going to be better protected the next time they're hit by al-qaeda why don't you why don't why don't they senator guns they're worried I think obsessively and we do that at times the reason I took on a burr grave is not in listen I've been a military lawyer for 30 years it wasn't a few bad MPs in that prison the system got overwhelmed because we had a rock wrong it wasn't a few dead Enders we didn't have enough troops and when I spoke truth to power to the bush years I was a patriot you know at the end of the day when I said that we don't have enough troops no matter what you're being told is not working in Iraq abra group ever grade with system failure well Benghazi assist I'm failure before during and after and it's tempting to rally around your partisan flag but the people who are in harm's way those in the military those in the State Department have had the morale hurt by this did you see the emotion coming out these are professionals Greg Hicks has been in the state perform for 22 years he's a he's the heart and soul of State Department a very nice fella who just loves this job could you see how it pained him to be there and the heartbreak of having his friend Chris Stevens abandons right exactly and that and that then that heartbreak I kept a keen for him and listening to the pain and his voice and the tears and I i I'm sorry I had to I had to put that against the backdrop of a press secretary the other day who said I Benghazi was a long time ago well let me tell you in the end the minds of who lived through it it's yesterday and those who are in harm's way it's a defining moment room my goal is to make sure that this administration pays a price for allowing it to become a death trap and misleading the American public and that we correct the failures that led to Benghazi and the only way you're correct affairs is understand the truth and they have been shielding the American public from the truth seven weeks before an election this was politically inspired manipulation trying to keep the story line bin Laden's dead al Qaeda is on the run Benghazi destroyed that storyline Susan Rice Secretary Clinton in the president themselves were selling misleading information senator Graham you mentioned pay pay the price if the facts are revealed and if it's confirmed that this is as we fear it is that this administration and indeed the State Department deliberately lied to the world about what happened in Benghazi what caused it what precipitated and all of that what would that price be well I want the people who ignored the security requests repeated requests upbraid security uh to be held accountable as if you were in the military I want the people who responsible for changing the narrative from a terrorist attack to a riot spawned by video to be identified and be held accountable in terms of their present job and future job opportunities and when it comes to during the attack I want to re-interview the senior leadership of our military because we now have a special operator in the shadows on Fox News thing there was a c-130 available in Croatia I was told the closest one was in djibouti africa and i want to go back at the Pentagon because Craig said that a lieutenant colonel member of the military in Libya was willing to go to Benghazi was urging to go to Benghazi and was told to stand down that directly contradicts what I was told by the the highest level of our military and I want to get to the truth and hold people accountable but the main thing is to show President Obama your foreign policies failing Libya's a case study and what happens when you lead from behind outsourcing to non-existent government trying not to be bushed to a fault I know how busy you are a final question before you have to leave us do you believe that that in your gut that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton there is any culpability and what happened well certainly as she deserved parade the president deserve praise for bin Laden that was a gutsy call he deserves accountability when it comes to men Benghazi here's what I can't get out of my mind on sep tember the 14th three days after the attack the bodies are coming back to America to Andrews Air Force Base I believe Secretary Clinton tells Charles woods the father of ty woods one of the rumor seals that was killed we're going to get the guy who made this video hmm for that she have said that to a family member it ruled out everything but the video either she was completely in the dark about what happened or she was selling a narrative that was politically helpful to the president but senator is a conceivable that she could have been in the dark well one won't know until you have another discussion with her I want her to come back to the Congress and I want her to answer the question did you know that Cheryl Mills called members of the State Department team in Libya the deputy Brett kicks to tell them to not answer any questions of jason Chaffetz wrote they sent a lawyer down to watch him did you know all that did you know that your State Department spokesman looked at the first edition of the talking points where they named al Qaeda al-nusrah as being responsible attack and that she said we can't put that out Congress will jump on us for not having adequate security well she needs to answer these questions and the trust that needs to answer the question why he told the American public for two straight weeks we think this was caused by hateful video scary stuff I'll tell you one thing senator grandma President Obama bragged about transparency within his administration if this story doesn't define a lack of transparency I don't know what does and yet your office and indeed you personally have always responded to our questions and our calls to come on and tell us where you are on some of these issues and you I hope you know how grateful we are for I am and have requested to five security officers who were in charge of security Benghazi two days ago from the State Department got a letter we're not gonna provide you their names I'm not going to put up with that we want another the survivors arm we want to talk to we need you more than ever senator Graham keep fighting the good fight thanks so much for joining us or appreciate your time very much senator lindsey graham taking a few minutes to join us here on the Mike Gallagher show to bring us up to date on Benghazi because let me tell you something I don't care what your political affiliation is if you don't as Senator Graham said you hear the heartbreak in these veteran state Department officials voices over the loss of these four lives and then you hear the way Democrats are trying to minimize Benghazi you know something is big-time wrong big-time wrong

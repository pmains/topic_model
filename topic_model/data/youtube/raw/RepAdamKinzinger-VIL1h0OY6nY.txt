reporting for us uh let's discuss what's going on with one of two republicans on the january six select committee congressman adam kinziger of illinois congressman thanks as usual for joining us why is bannon's testimony so important to your select committee that you're willing to go all the way to the u.s justice department potentially with a criminal referral well i think all you have to do is look at the history of steve bannon with donald trump no he's been there from the beginning you see obviously his comments the day before uh and there's a lot of other information out there but here's i think the key is this you know you can't resist a subpoena from congress congress has the same authority in essence as a court in that and you can't resist a subpoena from court but while we're going to continue to push and we hope that the and expect the justice department will take up uh the contempt when we send it um the bottom line is there's a lot of people out there that know pieces of this some of which have already willingly testified in front of us given us information some that will and some that will not resist subpoenas to this level it's very costly to do that as it should be because congress and this isn't the january 6 committee or even the congress through congress it's the american people demanding transparency and accountability a lot of your republican colleagues in the house are going to vote against this criminal referral you know that yeah sadly it's not surprising um you know i hope it's not just two of us voting for it i hope there's more uh i think you can look back at a lot of statements from when the house including me voted to hold eric holder in contempt it'll be interesting to compare some of the people's speeches from that day uh to today when we talk about contempt and this is a direct assault on the u.s democracy in the capitol your republican colleague congressman liz cheney even suggested that bannon might have been in her words personally involved in planning the attack on the u.s capitol back on january 6 is there any evidence he was directly responsible i don't want to get into the evidence that we have or don't have i'll keep that under wraps obviously we're going to continue to find out what we can know what we need to find out but look all you have to play the sound bite of steve bannon saying look tomorrow's gonna be wild it's not gonna go down how you expect either he was clairvoyant uh or he knew something you know a lot of us predicted violence i predicted violence on january 6 a week or two prior but i never expected that it would be to this level that they would sack the capital steve baylen seemed to know some and we want to know what he knew the congresswoman cheney also accused the house minority leader kevin mccarthy of disrupting your investigation the select committee's investigation do you agree well look i mean we had an opportunity to have a uh nonpartisan commission made up of former members so you take the politics out of it then he had an opportunity to seat republicans and he pulled them uh so i certainly wouldn't say that's cooperated and i think if they're whipping against as i've heard they are against this uh vote for contempt yes i mean look the day after the insurrection kevin mccarthy said that donald trump holds the responsibility for this two weeks later he went down and resurrected his political life when he met with him in mar-a-lago and since then has been doing nothing but donald trump's bidding and bringing him back to political life look people have to stand up and say this is wrong you know we've got to if you think of the heroics on flight 93 that saved the capital on 2001 it wasn't todd beamer alone it was everybody standing up and saying we've had enough we're going to sacrifice ourselves to do this and right now we need more republicans to stand up and lead your people lead your people tell them the truth you know the truth tell them the truth let's see if that happens is there any chance congressman uh that this uh criminal referral will actually prompt a bannon to start cooperating with the select committee i think it's certainly the case particularly if you see real movement in the justice department so after tomorrow it'll be out of our hands i hope the attorney general does the right thing i hope the justice department does the right things we have other tools in our toolkit but our focus right now is on this and making it clear to others that will be subpoenaed uh don't resist congress you don't have a right to resist congress because this is the by the people of the people for the people governance of this country congressman kinziger thank you so much for joining us we really appreciate it we'll

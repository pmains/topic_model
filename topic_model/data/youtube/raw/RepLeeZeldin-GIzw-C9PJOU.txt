Thank You mr. chairman miss McCoy a by chance do you know of a case involving a mr. John Mitchell I'm familiar with mr. Mitchell yes okay why is he not receiving aid in attendance I would I would say that we could I'd be happy to have myself and our compensation service folks sit down and have a deeper conversation I think the overall answer is that the evidence that we reviewed in that case doesn't substantiate entitlement to that benefit and I know that there has been a lot of back and forth on that case we have I personally have asked our headquarters experts to look at make sure we did it right and we've done that a couple of times so we are not finding entitlement based on the evidence we have we admit that John Mitchell is a veteran and that he served in Special Operations for over 20 years there's there's no doubt about that biographical part of a service correct sir I'm not that intricately familiar with his particular case I know that we have had multiple reviews and a lot of conversation okay that he served in the military you came here you admit that you know his case yes and you're not even willing to you're not intrude on intimately involved in his case enough to even vouch that he served in the military I on the spot in this moment I don't know those intricacies I believe he did but I don't I did not write the case okay so just imagine this you serve for over 20 years in the military you're in Special Operations you deploy into combat you suffer a traumatic brain injury after a twelve hundred and fifty foot parachute fall you're involved in a military vehicle accident you are at the point now legally blind and you desperately need Aid and Attendance and you completely koala lie for it after suffering multiple military injuries connected to your service serving a country willing to lay down your life for it and you you reach out for help and despite meeting all of the legal obligations all legal requirements to qualify for aid in attendance after serving your country for over 20 years you can be watching a video where a House Veterans Affairs Committee is speaking with a V representative from the Department of Veterans Affairs on this topic of the handling of paperwork and taking care of our veterans and never wanting to tell a veteran that there's been any type of mishandling of your paperwork and I'm asking about his case you you acknowledge that you know of his case and even though this has been brought up at past Veterans Affairs Committee hearings I can't even get you an admit that he served our country now just imagine if you're if you're at home and and and after serving I mean your country for literally decades and deploying into combat you can't even get the Department of Veterans Affairs to acknowledge that you served let alone the fact you have to live your entire life with traumatic brain injury from a parachute fall and a military vehicle accident that's how you personalize what what this isn't just about paper I'm offended on behalf of my constituent I thank him for his service I'm willing to not only acknowledge that he served our country but that his traumatic brain injury that he suffered as a result of it which qualifies him for this benefit at the very least at the very least at this point in June of 2016 after everything he's gone through trying to get this approval maybe the Department of Veterans Affairs can at least acknowledge that he served this is that that right there was one of the most if not the most offensive answers I've heard in any committee that hearing that I've been in and if you put yourself in a position of John Mitchell I implore you please at the end of this committee hearing to relook at his paperwork because everything is there to get this man the help that he needs and at the very least at this point after what we just witnessed with the answer to that question I think the secretary owes John Mitchell an apology and a thank-you for his service at the very least your department can acknowledge he served

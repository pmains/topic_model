hello I'm congressman Paul Gosar from Arizona sport district and I wanted to take a moment to wish you a Happy Thanksgiving I was actually born on Thanksgiving Day so it's a special holiday for me that year instead of a turkey dinner my mom had me her turkey Thanksgiving is a time for family and a time to think about what we're thankful for I hope we take a moment this week to remember those who fought to protect us those who never returned and the families who have an empty seat at their table this Thanksgiving coming from a family with ten kids of mixed political views I understand that we may disagree from time to time we may even strongly disagree but that's what's great about this country even with our differences we can agree that we live in a great nation with much to be thankful for so let's get serious about protecting our Republic and its constitution and preserve this great country for future generations I'll help you and your family have a happy Thanksgiving may God bless you and may he continue to bless the United States of America

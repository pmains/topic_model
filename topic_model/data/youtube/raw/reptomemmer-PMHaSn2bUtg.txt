five minutes thank you mr chairman and thank you again to our witnesses for appearing before this committee look crime is running rampant across our country so it's imperative that congress focus on the serious damaging impact that lawlessness has had on our communities we must restore order as we examine the impact crime has had on local economies we are grateful to mr brian ingram for joining us today from st paul minnesota he's the only business owner on this witness panel who has first-hand experience trying to live and trying to operate a business in a nearly lawless environment catastrophic crime rates are not unique to the twin cities in minnesota it's plaguing communities across the united states from new york to san francisco and cities in between americans in urban areas face increases in carjack jackings theft burglaries vandalism and assault this has led to a divestment in local economies because safety trumps all other priorities and many people cannot safely run a business in such dangerous conditions that divestment hits low-income communities the hardest so how did we get here and why is crime running rampant across the united states we locked down our citizens for a year stripped them of in-person activities that help keep people out of a life of crime school extracurriculars community engagement and mental health resources then democrats championed a nationwide campaign against law enforcement which has made the police force so politically unpopular that many communities like saint paul minnesota where mr ingram lives and runs his businesses don't have enough sworn in law enforcement officers to protect the community as we heard from mr ingram when residents call 9-1-1 it's not uncommon to be told no one can help them mr ingram can you please share with the committee what changes you've had to make to your business to protect your employees and customers from crime yeah one of the things we've had to do of course is shortening our hours uh even bringing in our staff a little later we have a breakfast restaurant that used to open at 6 a.m and now we push that back to 7 am uh just because we wanted to be light out before our staff would come in our restaurants closing at 10 o'clock we have a pub that would primarily do business late night that's now closed security cameras um gosh alarm systems we we've spent so much on those types of things with no it doesn't deter anybody okay the safety stuff we've done is no deterrence do you have a number uh that you have spent how much of these additional measures hundreds of thousands of dollars um i can't i don't know that i can even put a number on the sales we have two new restaurants we're reinvesting those restaurants we're planning on not keeping open that's going to lead into the millions of dollars until something changes in our city lastly how have other businesses in your community reacted to the violence so many of them are gone and what you're seeing so much is in minority parts of the city restaurants are closing at a rapid pace i believe it's one in three now that are closing down uh and typically those are in areas that are underserved we're seeing restaurants we're seeing businesses close day in and day out and it continues to grow right now in minneapolis it's a ghost town when you drive through minneapolis and you talk to many of these restaurant tours like yourself and are they experiencing similar issues yeah i i believe all of us and i mean you could own a yarn store across the street from us we've seen it they've been robbed uh little mailbox etc it's it's across the board and there's no business we thought we were being targeted we had seven robberies within a year and thought we were being targeted and we went out to our neighborhoods nope i got robbed yesterday no i got robbed the day before and nobody seems to want to share that message and talk about it well thank you for doing it these catastrophic levels of crime across this country have made people afraid to go to work to eat out with their families to park their cars in the street and simply to just be outside when it's dark this is no way to live let's be very clear democrats have normalized this lawlessness and demonized law enforcement as a result law enforcement in many of these urban areas like the twin cities do not have the resources they need to keep people and their businesses and property safe when residents call 911 for help they are often told no one can come out mr ingram thank you for your time today as democrats have politicized safety and championed the destructive defund the police movement your perspective is invaluable as a business owner doing your best to support your community i yield back the general

everyone Jamie schwarzwald sitting down with United States congressman who hails from Fort Yukon Alaska congressman thank you for joining us today Thank You Jamie for having me you bet well August so we're on this congressional break how much do you enjoy this time where you can get back to Alaska and see you can always live to come back to Alaska in August because in August back east it gets about 95 degrees and the moisture is about ninety percent is like walking to a sauna so I just love getting back here in August although it's real warm out today I will say according to the reports that I like to take credit for something other than some sayings you may see on television I got here Saturday night it had been raining for a week or more and the Sun was out sunday announced Monday and it's going to be out tuesday so it's really pretty when it's warm well on behalf of my sister and we took a trip down to delta clear water for fish and sunday so uh catch everything we did my nephew got some nice grayling oh good show that's a great little river it is so thanks where the weather or one major issue facing Alaskans in the August nineteenth primary is the ballot referendum of Alaska Senate bill 21 a yes vote would repeal the more Alaska production shouldn't act which replaced the oil producer tax structure known as aces as an Alaskan how do you feel about Belvin I am really very supportive of a proposition voting no on Proposition 21 I really think that's important some people I know the arguments I respect everybody has arguments but we are not getting the oil in the pipeline that we we have to have the maintain this state I am confident that the the Senate bill 21 has worked it has an increased the amount of participation just look at the figures the people that are hired the slope activity the potential more production is much higher I think we ought to look at that now a lot of people say oh we're giving it away the big oil company I don't believe that and I have a right to that belief I just want us to get morale and that pipeline make sure that people still have that permanent dividend check schools are being paid for by the oil and most municipality get most of the funding from oil industry in this state through the production of oil and we have to keep the pipeline full or at least partially full better than it is now or they can shut it down so I'm for voting no on proposition one what's alyssa's do you see to help stem the rising energy energy costs for interior Alaskans and in all of Alaska it's not going to be solved and by the federal government it's going to be if anything we have to get the federal government out of it the state should be addressing this is not a new issue we became a state primarily because of the lack of natural gas in the Fairbanks bill snedden for the news-miner when it used to be a real real first-class newspaper it in fact promoted statehood because we wanted to bring gas and I can't think of the field but it's not Prudhoe Bay bring that down here we knew it was there and put gas in the Fairbanks and we're still talking about it we should have it there and if we don't do the gas we should at least have electricity and that's a sensational project either one has to be done or we can't be a groin area within the state the state will grow to a further extent as it has in Palmer Wasilla and Anchorage and Kenai because they have natural gas and will be sort of the back end of the bus and so I'm just saying it's very important that we get energy and the state has to be more actively involved this legislature they looks like they're actually on the right track now the federal government our big job is to keep the federal government agencies from imposing restrictions so it can't be done the EPA Fish and Wildlife federally I can go on down a line we can't let them in fact stop the project I was lucky that was my bill in the house when we passed the trans-alaskan pipeline that would not allow any lawsuits that's why we were able to build it in four years delivered we surpassed it in 73 and we ended up as I think pumping the first oil in 76 that is a very fast rapid period of time 800 mile pipeline with all the pump stations etc because they could not interest groups or anyone else file a suit on the construction of it so I'm working on the concept of getting gas to Fairbanks region and a dam built so that we don't have any type of restriction on the federal government you bring up the EPA have they overstepped their bounds in regards to the pebble mind absolutely and I know people don't always agree with me on pebble mine it's not about pebble mine has never been about pebble mine it's about the state the state chose that land and put it up for discovery it was discovered another discovery Clause of mining laws the state of Alaska right for expiration on the right of exploration if you think you can develop it you have a right to develop it it's the state issue that permits to have an outside federal agency come in and tell the state they can't do that prior to the issuing of a permit as far as I'm concerned against the state constitution and I hear all kinds all right we got to worry about the fish yes I worry about the fish but who has control the fish it is the state as the state has control of its land and it's up to the state to decide whether it should or should not be done not the federal government if we allow this to happen apparently it is going to happen we've lost our state it can be on any other areas we try to develop resources it can be on any of the native lands they could say a know you can do it on when we promised them 44 million acres of land for the social economic well-being there can be an interest groups come out trout's unlimited come out and say oh no you can't do that because it affects so and so and so and so it could be a view said it could be a sound shed all type of different sheds which they can impose a lawsuit on take away our state for those of you believe in the state of Alaska you better think about that a while if you want to become a territory then let's have a boat and go back to be a territory I want to be a state so business is a hand you supported legislated legislation that addresses our nation's the crisis on our nation's southern border it passed 20 22 22 to 1 89 and I'm lose to the US Senate resolution includes nearly 700 million dollars of support of ice the National Guard about department of health and human services why was this legislation needed well firstly let me say the president asked for 3.6 billion actually four billion dollars a blank check and I wasn't about to give this president a blank check we didn't know how he's going to spend it where he's going to air any Theus a blank check and he was going to solve the problems the Senate very frankly didn't do anything he went home we tried to pass a bill that would make it actually more strict than it is now about someone coming into the United States to seek asylum you have to actually under this bill prove the need for asylum and the money is for humanitarian purposes for the kids are here but there's got to be a way and this bill will give it to the homeland security at not just the border patrol but Homeland Security to discourage the continue seeking of asylum in the United States from these young people they're being told through their governments and through a cartel that they they need their they can come the United States and they will be able to stay here and become a citizen and that's not the way it really is and so I would like to see some of these young people and go through them make sure that they're not sick or not hurt or they need immediate care and send them back take them back and say this is not true where the crime is here that the Mules of the the cartels are going into villages and saying and now if you go to the United States you can stay and so get a seven thousand dollars i think that's about a ten-year wage in Ecuador and Bolivia in those type areas and they scrape the money give it the meal they get them on a train Mexico does not stop them as long as they go through the Mexico has a very strict border patrol facing the central countries and they in fact as long as they go through they let them go on through and this this is what's occurring that the original active the 1998 act only allowed children from Mexico and Canada have asylum and protection not the rest of so long signals are Mexico microphone perfectly happy our bill is a good bill now consequently I don't know what's going to happen the president made price some things but the issue the long-term solution of this problem is we have to make getting in the United States legally much easier not that's not what I saw just court bling but you know you think about it I had a guy on the floor the other day talking about well my father came over every other day yes he did he came over from Ireland or he came over from it later came over from Bosnia and they went through Ellis Island and they were checked and if they were had a clean health bill they were allowed to come into the United States not too much of a problem when you think about it but now it takes on the average 12 to 19 years to come in the United States legally that causes this illegal problem and I'm saying make sure they check background check healthcheck background checks cetera and if they have a sponsor or they got a trade let them have have a chance to become an assist in the United States now some people say don't do that and I'm saying think about it for a moment there's only really one group of people the United States is about immigrants and that's the American Indians and Alaska Natives they were here first and the rest of the people are and fathers grandfathers great-grandfather's came here for a reason they built the railroads they've mined the mines in Minnesota they've created to steal that one world war one and two I mean this is what we have to accept we can't can say no now we're already here nobody else can come in but we have to make sure that they're good citizens when they come in will we get their citizenship and go forth can write final question Alaska has a high population of US military veterans you yourself are a proud veteran how crucial is it that we get this problem with the VA saw well they're very crucial I will you know this is where I get in a little trouble asst of my veterans group I think overall Alaska had one of the best VA systems because of Senator Stevens and myself I keep stressing this we built clinically big big out Federation and a hospital in Anchorage I was there for the ribbon-cutting we've had clinics across the state that we've done well and we have access to government clinics now which they did not have in other states every village has a clinic for instance they have access to that the problem we have is not just the secretary and I and I will I will say this i'm not beating the present up on this it is the people under them and the system over a period of time has become stagnant and we have people within the VA itself that are not held responsible I'm talking about all the way to the desk clerk that really maybe I'm cleaning my fingernail and I got a veteran coming needs the pointman and then we'll I'll get to you when I finish cleaning my fingernails that person should be reprimanded and actually relieved of the job we can't do that so until they get a better attitude across the nation the veterans are going to regardless of this bill we just passed which is a big bill 17 billion dollars it's still not quite fine tune and how it's going to improve and I argue that it has to be improved by going from the bottom up and the top if the tops not function you make sure they no longer the supervisor and then lower as they're not functioning they're no longer in a position because we're trying to help the veteran the veteran who served this country committed this country was obligated to this country and we obligated service to him and I hot have that kind of service have a person died because inactivity is dead wrong and I'm hoping we keep pursuing this we've got tungsten Miller is very good about this he's going to be bird dog in this real closely to see how this money is it's dispersed is is utilized and hopefully the next veterans that go into VA are treated I think adequately not only adequately to the best service we can give them all right Congress no I want to thank thank you very for us thank you all right that's going to wrap it up for us we are getting a half

the most significant financial crisis since the great depression dodd-frank was signed into law with a promise that never again will the taxpayers be forced to bail out wall street simply put what we now know is that dodd-frank does not work over the past several months this subcommittee has attempted to dissect section by section the parts of dodd-frank that pretend to rein in the large interconnected financial institutions that brought us to the brink five years ago it also pretends to uh end too big to fail which is in fact not the case what we have discovered is something to the contrary in over 840 pages of law dodd-frank granted an incredible amount of power and discretion to the federal reserve the fdic and the newly created financial stability oversight council almost three years later as the law slowly works its way through the regulatory process we discover that dodd-frank their designation and resolution processes do not protect too big to fail banks not only protects them actually not only protects too big to fail banks it subsidizes their businesses quite to the disadvantage of their small bank competition this new economic reality is illustrated when two large credit rating agencies continue to single out the eight largest banks for a systemic ratings uplift by virtue of their size interconnectedness and difficulty unto to unwind and furthermore their ripeness for taxpayer bailouts in times of trouble as the markets quantify this newly designated safety net uh these banks experience a lower cost of borrowing which is the lifeblood of financial institutions um likewise they do say that that costs borrowing may not exist and there's debate about that but the world bank says clearly there is a cost of borrowing advantage well not surprisingly this impressive and unprecedented power designed to protect the largest and most interconnected financial institutions is also being criticized as being unconstitutional several states including alabama georgia kansas michigan montana nebraska ohio oklahoma south carolina texas and west virginia have joined with the national bank of big spring as plaintiffs and his suit against the department of treasury the fsoc the federal reserve the fdic as well as the cfpb their claim is that dodd-frank violates the constitution's separation of powers and its protections afforded through due process legal scholars are analyzing similar constitutional claims as well our founders understood that government is imperfect and must be kept in check as a co-equal branch of government congress has an obligation to interpret the constitution and to act within the bounds of its interpretation when carrying out its oversight and legislative functions as james madison discussed congress's rights to interpret the constitution in relation to that of the judicial branch he said quote but the great objection is that the legislature itself has no right to expound the constitution that wherever it its meaning is doubtful you must leave it to take its course until the judiciary is called upon to declare its meaning the constitution is the character of the people of the government it specifies certain great powers as absolutely granted and marks out the departments to exercise them if the constitutional boundary of either be brought into question i do not see that any one of these independent departments has more right than another to declare their sentiments on this point today we will be declaring our sentiments on that very point of the constitutionality of the dodd-frank act accordingly this hearing will examine why certain provisions in title 1 and title ii of dodd-frank may be susceptible to constitutional challenge we'll also explore the manner and circumstances in which a party with legal interest affected by the orderly liquidation authority could challenge the commencement of and well let's use it in quote marks order the liquidation and thereby delay or prevent the liquidation from functioning as intended in the dodd-frank act this panel before us today has an impressive background in constitutional law as well as a depth and understanding of the dodd-frank law i certainly appreciate the three gentlemen here today their willingness to be here we'll now recognize the ranking member mr green for five minutes

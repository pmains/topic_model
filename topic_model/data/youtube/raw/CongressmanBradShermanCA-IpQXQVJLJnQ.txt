tax cuts we're asking Democratic congressman from California Brad Sherman good to see you sir Trish thanks for having me on to talk about this deficit exploding job or sourcing economic disaster for our country you're being fair and balanced when Tucker had me on to talk about nonsense he promised that he would have me on once the tax bill was published but he's been a coward every single time because he knows he cannot defend this that's come on that's not fair on this show right now with me and we're going to talk about all this because you think it's gonna be painful for the deficit etc it's funny how these talking points have kind of reversed right because I seem to recall that was a conservative talking point but have at it sir what is your biggest concern right now especially when you look at Dow 25,000 GDP growth better than 3% unemployment at record lows and wages now increasing thanks to hundreds of companies giving out wage increases there are some small wage increases in some extent these wage increases are just to match minimum wage statutes that have been passed in democratic states Walmart says they're raising to $11 an hour we require that in California and then they can say well it's because we love the Republicans no it's because California requires it to the tune of the grand Rite something that Nancy Pelosi calls just crumbs with hundred with well over a hundred million employees the fact that a few companies are giving a few bonuses doesn't disguise the fact that when we have democratic tax policies in force we have much higher economic growth rates than we have when we have Republican economic policies and tax policies really I mean because you know the last eight years under President Obama that didn't turn out so well you have of one-and-a-half percent it should have been a whole lot better but we had no economic policy that's what the Obama administration Trish you've got to look at what tax law is in force not who's sitting in the White House it took several years for Obama to change his tax policies we had democratic tax policies with almost 2 and 2/3 percent economic growth compare that to the low economic growth we had under george w bush's tax policies look at reagan's and look at Clinton's economic win their tax you know that congressman Clinton benefited from the tech boom there was a actual structural shift in our economy at that point in time at all times and Clinton promoted that tech boom you know read an economics 101 textbook you can actually chart this stuff out when you put more money in the hands of people and more money in the hands of corporations the people and the corporations that are actually earning it in the first place that has 30 years of history proves you wrong when we had Republican tax policies in force we had lowered because you run that huge trick you run that huge deficit you think you're putting more money in the hands of people but then the federal government goes into the capital pool and takes the money out we're going to be borrowing 1.7 trillion dollars that's taking money out of the economy out of where it's available for the economic growth sir we had higher economic growth in 2016 in terms of jobs than 2017 but after we passed Obamacare after we passed dodd-frank we suddenly had two million or more almost hit a million in one case new jobs every year this from someone who's fiscally conservative as you just suggested you're so concerned about the deficit yet you want more entitlement programs I mean it just doesn't make any sense I'm not here to yeah did I say I was for more entitlement programs I'm here to preserve Medicare and Social Security moral volunteer I mean that you're telling me that Obamacare good for the economy co√±o Bhama care correlated with a great increase in the number of jobs created each year we were told it was a job killer but we had far more jobs created each year sir can be disputed I guess I just want to this country you will and what we created only two million jobs last year we created two and a quarter million jobs the year before after we adopted Obamacare and dodd-frank we created over two million jobs the news today the news that 63 Sam's Clubs and they didn't put that in their press release well you don't want to talk about the 63 Sam's Clubs and the businesses closed all the time to keep it open you can't attribute it to a tax bill almost as though I fear some members of your party do not want to see this economy succeed because if this economy succeeds people will credit Donald Trump with that man United to succeed that's why we're there fighting to preserve Social Security and Medicare that's why we're there trying to make sure that we don't deport nobody's people that's why we're there not wanting the federal government to close down in the eken problems that would have we're working to improve the economy every day and if the America succeeds everybody succeeds but you look at this tax bill here's what it does for factories you can have a zero percent tax on the profits of your factory only if you move it overseas that's the offshoring provision of this bill not only does it provide 85 percent of its benefits the top one percent it provides a 100 percent tax break for those who move their factories overseas those are the facts you can make up alternative facts if you want there's two point seven trillion dollars sitting overseas possibly more there is now an opportunity to bring all that money back on shore so that it's working for us competitive because it is a competitive world out there and America should lead the way on this you know that we are competitive because we have the best workers and the best entrepreneurs we do now we're competing for that work ethic by taxing people more and more and more to you know cover these concerns and recent concerns about that unfortunately I am out of time I got a hard commercial probably been fighting for a balanced budget for a lot of years we adopted I appreciate hearing your side thank you very much okay wonderful curtsy same

Thank You mr. president mr. president in this day and age it'd be easy to grow cynical and simply tune out the noise of a 24-hour cable news psycho that feeds off the latest Trump tweet from Donald Trump's recent decision to invite the Taliban to join him for a retreat at Camp David for the week on the anniversary of 9/11 terrorist attacks to his earlier statements caught on tape bragging about sexually assaulting women I fear that too many including members of this chamber have become numb to this repeated debasing of the presidency numb to a president who lacks even a hint of remorse or shame as he spews lies of the people he was elected to serve but we cannot afford to be numb we cannot cannot let this become normal no we must hold Donald Trump accountable for his false promises and for his lies we must ask what happened to Mexico paying for the wall Trump promised every American over and over again that they wouldn't have to spend a dime on his wall pledging that Mexico would pick up the tab 100% he even said it's an easy decision for Mexico to make a one-time payment of five to ten billion dollars but of course it wasn't so easy and now Trump has done a 180 falsely claiming that he never said Mexico could write that check trying to Gaslight us all with every lie that he tells we simply can't let him get away with it the truth is that Donald Trump already revealed who he really wants to pay for his wall he discloses it every time his administration begs Congress to spend billions of your tax dollars building it he doesn't care that many who live on the border believe building a wall from sea to shining sea is the least effective and most expensive way to secure the border Trump may not care but that helps explains Trump's failure to convince Congress to fund his vanity project even when Republicans controlled both chambers for two years and his outrageous response to his failure another sad truth the presidency hasn't changed Donald Trump one bit president Donald Trump is a very same Oh Donald Trump whose true character was revealed on the leaked Access Hollywood tapes in Trump's mine when you're the president you can do anything Congress did not appropriate funds for your ineffective wall well just grab funds that Congress authorized for more important programs tired of failing to convince Congress to spend American tax dollars on your wall we'll just declare a fake emergency Senate Republicans will let you do it listen Trump's decision to build his vanity wall with fun stolen from military construction projects and homeland security initiatives isn't really about border security it's about politics if he actually wanted to secure our nation's border he wouldn't be stripping away funding from the dedicated men and women who are responsible for defending it the United States Coast Guard yet that's exactly what he's done ripping tens of millions of dollars away from Coast Guard programs ignoring that his actions could endanger our national security ignoring that we're right in the middle of hurricane season as if that weren't bad enough he's also defunding facilities dedicated to cyber warfare operations and bomb defusing trainings he's slashing money from schools and child care centers for our servicemembers children too Donald Trump told us over and over again that Mexico would pay for his wall well that was a lie Mexico isn't paying for his wall our servicemembers and their families are the families of Fort Campbell are as their children will now have to keep eating lunch in their school's library because Donald Trump decided that revving up his political base was more important than upgrading an aging military school my blood boils when I hear that children of US service members are being forced to learn in makeshift classrooms within classrooms no child should have to learn in that kind of environment in my view that is a true national emergency let me tell you about three other case where the president is stealing money to go pay for his wall one is at Channel Islands Air National Guard stationed in California the project that is losing funds is this this project will supply the Colorado Air National Guard with an adequately sized and properly configured space to support a space control squadron function in accordance with for structure changes the facility must provide adequate space to support the squadrons operations maintenance security command and administration and storage areas the facility must have an unobstructed view of the southern horizon the current situation is that this space control squadron most likely happening at Peterson Air Force Base does not currently exist and there are no adequate facilities located at either Peterson or Buckley Air Force bases for this space control squadron the only solution that meets all mission requirements is to construct a new facility at Peterson Air Force Base if this facility is not provided the squadron will be unable to bed down the space control mission and equipment with operation and strategic mission impacts due to inadequate facilities this is what he's stealing money from in order to build his vanity wall a section a second project is at Fort Greely Alaska the impact of taking the money from this project will mean that Fort Greely Alaska will not have the enhancement in capabilities for the ballistic missile defense system the mission of the agency is to develop and feed an integrated layered ballistic missile defense system to defend the United States the deployed forces allies and friends against our range of enemy ballistic missiles and all phases of flight this expansion project will provide the bead MDS with increased ground-based interceptor capabilities to allow operational capabilities what happens if this is not prime if the funds are not provided the plan enhancements and capabilities of the ballistic missile defense system to meet emerging threats will not be available for our nation's homeland defense he is stealing money away from our nation's homeland defense to build his vanity wall and finally and Fort Huachuca Arizona the current situation is that the facilities do not meet the current mandatory criteria specified for vehicle testing and maintenance facilities if current facilities date back to the 1930s and 1940s and have surpassed their estimated life expectancy the facilities violate current anti-terrorism force protection standards existing utility systems such as water sewer electric and gas require replacement there are no other suitable buildings on the installation available in support of this mission if they were to lose this mission this the funding for this project personnel will continue to work in substandard and unsafe facilities the motor pool facilities do not comply with current life safety building codes and quality of life standards the current HVAC fire suppression the existing ATF P and infrastructure deficiencies jeopardize personnel health security and safety this is what he's taken money from to build this wall the Senate could put a stop to this it is up to us our actions in this very chamber will determine whether children at Fort Campbell whether personnel at Fort Huachuca where the staff at Fort Greely can Alaska can do their job we can defend the power of the purse or we can be complicit in its destruction look I'm not naive I know that some don't share my outrage that some believe overcrowded military schools a decrease in our national security offense our ability to defend against hostile ballistic missiles is not a crisis let alone a national disgrace these Trump loyalists coward - his bullying tactics and in the coming days they'll try to reward his abuse of power they won't stop Trump and return the stolen taxpayer dollars rather their argue that we should dig even deeper into the nation's funds to spend more of your time dollars to replace the money that Trump stole this is wrong the Constitution and trust Congress to authorize and appropriate funds not the president I urge all my colleagues to join me in condemning this raid of taxpayer funds we must block these outrageous cuts that will harm military readiness we cannot border security and hurt families of those who are brave enough to serve and with this a year before

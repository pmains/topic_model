moving over Congress joining us right now is House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer good morning to you congressman before we before we get to to the to what's now looming upon us I do want to get your thoughts on the tax bill and specifically given that you didn't support it how you react and think about some of the statements that some of these companies like AT&T and the parent company this network I have put out around bonuses and other investments that they plan to make as a result of it well the issue is is are they going to be sustained are they happy about getting huge tax cuts I'm sure they are as you know 83% of the 1.5 trillion dollars in deficits will be going to the top one percent in America and 17% to everybody else so obviously there are people who are very happy about this and it appears that it's going to have some positive effect immediately but what we are really concerned about is the long term effect of this the skewing of benefits to the wealthiest in America the fact that Medicare is going to be exposed to a twenty five billion dollar cut next year and that 13 million Americans are going to lose health care so we think there going to be a lot of very negative effects of this tax bill going to undermine the ability of the United States to funding priorities so that yes there are short-term benefits apparently and that's not surprising but what we've seen is the long-term downside of these tax cuts whether there were an 81 or a no one and O three they didn't work out for our economy right congressman it gets very complicated very quickly yeah Becky and Joe and I were talking earlier Joe Joe was asking me whether today the Democrats have to effectively root against the economy route against the market if you will over the next year or two as it may go up give it given what you're talking about how do you think about that well as I say I've been here for some period of time and I've seen the downturn of what can be short-term stimulus but long-term adverse impact both in terms of the deficit that is created and the stress to the economy as I said like yesterday on the floor of the house and they were talking about their tax cuts much of the rhetoric was very much like we heard in oh one and O three and what did we end up with at the end of the Bush administration the worst economy we've seen so hopefully I don't want to wish against the economy I want to see employees doing well and our country doing well this was an irresponsible act leader those were those weren't corporate tax cuts for Bush this the the rationale of trying to get the the US corporate sector more competitive with some of the the tax rates around the world I mean even Democrats in the past have signed on for that and we're for that we should have as you know President Obama in the State of the Union in some three years ago said we needed to bring the corporate tax rate down so that would be competitive with the rest of the world we think that's correct we would have supported that as you know Joe this was a totally partisan bill and unlike the 86 bill which was a bipartisan bill M was paid for this was paid for all with deficit spending which we think will have ultimately a down turn on the economy but yes we are we could have worked on and we support in many respects bringing the corporate rate down so that we're competitive with the rest of the world that's a good thing when you use the 83 17 number but I mean by definition when the the main part of the of the Act is is based on lowering the corporate tax rate are you throwing that the one percent that so the corporations are part of the one percent benefiting is that how you're doing because I've seen figures where if you take out the corporate side of things the middle class shares a much better part of the tax cuts if you if you exclude the so but you know what I mean if you just gonna say yeah I think you're gonna say eighty-three percent and most of that is the corporate tax at which you agree it's something we should try to do yeah I don't know if that it just sort of that the you know it's apples and oranges kind of well it may be Jo but the point that we make is yesterday chairman Brady and Paul Ryan when we in initially passed the bill through the house what they talked about they talked about the average family making fifty nine thousand four people they were the corporate taxes even though it might be something that you think we ought to do it's never gonna be it's never going to pull greater than partly thirty four well the bill doesn't pull very well as you know only a third of the people think this bill is going to help them or help our country right so that doesn't roll well we don't think it's going to pull well but the point is that if you're selling a bill for the struggling people who are working day-to-day and week-to-week paychecks and then you give 83% of the benefits not to them it's hard to just argue that this is what this bill is about it's not about that yes you're right bringing the corporate rate down being competitive with the rest of the world can have a long-term benefit on the creation of jobs but it's a fair figure when you hear this constant discussion about how this is for them exposing working people of the country have you seen it those numbers on on the individual mandate I get that too and and so the thirteen million that lose insurance are going to decide not not to buy because they don't have to pay the penalty anymore but you've seen that and but you've seen that figure that the people that pay the penalty for the vast majority 80 80 percent make less than 50,000 a year and here they are paying a tax on not getting health insurance so that was just as that's just designed the wrong way well you know what Joe this was a Heritage Foundation idea which was everybody needed to take personal responsibility and they needed to have insurance for themselves and the Massachusetts model which was applied in the ACA was that look if you can't you need to have insurance because everybody needs to be coverage so you're not passing the expense along to somebody else but if you can't afford it we'll help you that was the premise and the 13 million people many of them are going to say look I'm not going to go why because I'm healthy I'm young right and what's that going to do to the premiums of everybody else it's going to raise it because the risk pool will be more expensive that's the point and the whole point of the mandate was to sort like corn if it were only the reckless people that drove what you couldn't afford your car insurance but it because the brisk is spread and most of us don't have accidents it brings down the cost to an affordable level for us it seems like there's a better waves unintended consequences well the way frankly Joe let me say there was a better way if we would have come together for the last month last eleven months and worked in a bipartisan way I think we could have come up with some really good improvements to the Affordable Care Act but that was never the intention of Republicans either on taxes which was this is the most partisan bill secret bill non-transparent bill rushed to

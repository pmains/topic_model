hello i'm united states senator saxby chambliss and it's really nice to have a chance to be with you today as you recognize my dear friend senator lindsey graham lindsay and i came to the congress together in 1994 and i do not have a better friend in the world than lindsey graham and he and i have traveled all over the world together we played golf all over the country together so needless to say i got lots of lindsey graham stories that i could spend the evening with you on you know things like uh instead of taking his sleeping pill when he got on the airplane he took it as we're getting off the airplane and that made him go to sleep in the middle of a conversation with the president of one of our best allies or the time we were in africa when a wild animal was going to attack uh our group and lindsey grabs the wife of one of our colleagues and says hey take her not me take her but actually my favorite lindsey graham story took place in 2004. i found out that summer that i had prostate cancer and lindsay was very sympathetic and empathetic with my situation and followed the course of my procedure and whatnot so i made a decision as to what i was going to do and lindsay knew i was going into the hospital on a certain day so he gives me a call that morning but the problem was i got the call as i'm being rolled down the hallway on a gurney all dressed up in my operative uniform my wife is standing there with me and the phone rings and she grabs the phone and says it's lindsey so i get on the phone with lindsay and he said hey sax i i know you're being wheeled down the hall right now and he said i know you're going to be fine this is all going to work out but just in case it doesn't how about leaving me that new driver you just got that's lindsey graham what a classic guy i think it's really appropriate that the citadel republican society is giving him an award that is called the nathan hale patriot award there is no greater patriot in the united states congress or in our great country than lindsey graham he is one of those folks who gives up more time than anybody else to the service of our country literally by virtue of the fact that he does his reserve duty in afghanistan now i always worry about him being in afghanistan because when he's there he has to wear a pistol and having hunted with him on numerous occasions i'm always afraid he's going to shoot himself in the foot but he always manages to survive he's a great guy he's a great member of the united states senate and he's truly a great patriot so it's appropriate that you honor him in this way he represents the great state of south carolina in a magnificent way but most importantly he represents our country in an outstanding manner he's a great patriot and i commend you for selecting him for this award god bless you and god continue to bless our great country thank you

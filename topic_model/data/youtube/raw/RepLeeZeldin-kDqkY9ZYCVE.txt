well thank you mr. speaker i rise in support of HR 6303 which would create a new unique zip code for the hamlets of Flanders Riverside in Northampton in my district these three Hamlet's currently share the same zip code with the nearby town of riverhead and there are at least 18 identical street names and 32 similar street names this causes a number of issues including delay of mail and packages which can hold important goods like medications shared street names can also delay the response time of emergency and medical personnel in situations where every second counts this could all be avoided by assigning a new and unique zip code to Flanders Northampton and riverside which is why I've been working closely with chairman chaffetz even bringing him to Long Island to speak with those impacted in the community firsthand I thank chairman chaffetz for his exceptional help with this issue for many years residents local elected officials and community organizations have been aware of this issue and the problems it brings but despite their previous efforts the issue still serves to be a burden for those in this area of the first congressional district of new york i would also like to thank ron fisher chairman of the flanders riverside in Northampton Citizens Advisory Council and president of the Flanders Riverside in Northampton Community Association and all the members of these organizations for continuing this effort over the years this has been a priority for them for many years and is an honor to be their voice in the house I know this legislation also includes a new zip code for the area including Glendale I have spoken with my colleague miss mang who has been a tireless advocate on behalf of those residents in Glendale and real thrill to see that that's included as well thank you mr. Gosar for your support your efforts to the entire staff of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee chairman Chaffetz is fortunate to have an amazing team working with him I yield back

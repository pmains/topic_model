about a year ago the President signed into law legislation is designed to make health care more affordable in this country we spend twice as much as just about any other nation on earth we don't get better results we have roughly 30 to 40 million people go to bed at night they don't have health care coverage for small businesses is tough to provide healthcare coverage for their employees and one of the provisions in our law says employer small business 25 people or less you'll be able to get a tax credit you're eligible for a tax credit in most cases it will buy down the cost of health care for your employees by thirty-five percent in a couple years by down the cost of your health care for your employees by about fifty percent another thing that we're doing is trying to want to make sure that senior citizens that are need to take medicines to stay out of the hospital to be healthy trying to make sure that they continue to take medicines even when they're the amount that they've spent each year exceeds three thousand dollars we actually now do that we're closing the what's called the doughnut hole so the seniors will continue to take their medicines the cost of that is blown by believe or not the pharmaceutical companies third thing that we're doing I'm an old navy guy we used to take annual physicals every year for all the years I was in the Navy we did it because we wanted to catch problems early and when they weren't expensive and it used to be until literally till this year folks through Medicare they got an annual physical paid for by Medicare one time one time in their life they would be a hundred and five they'd never get another one starting this year for the rest of their lives every year they're eligible for a metaphysical paid for by Medicare we want to catch problems when you early deal with them when they're early another thing with respect to our senior citizens we want to make sure that that folks if they were getting under 50 s or six you want to make sure 71 make sure that is getting a colonoscopy is every five years we want to make sure that women are getting mammography screenings the men are getting pottery schemes we want to take it all these preventive steps to make sure we catch again problems when they're small can be dealt with rather than waiting until people get really sick and have colon cancer and we spend a boatload of money and people have a terrible way to live their lives so the we've taken away the co-pays and basically said we want you to get the preventive screams don't do it it won't cost you anything in the end Medicare will save money this is my thing to do for folks who have adult children up until this year when people reach diving age 21 or 22 they went off their parents house health care plan whether they had a job where they had health care or not beginning this year that changes and now adult children can be covered under their their parents health care plan for for up up till the age of 26 there's a restriction another thing I think it's helpful for a lot of folks so if you happen to be a child up to the age of 18 and you have a pre-existing condition you can't be denied health insurance and eventually we'll take that provision and and extend it up to two adults and I think that'll kick in a couple of years from now another thing I would mention at the end of this year when know when people go into a restaurant chain restaurant with 15 restaurants or more in the chain across the country they look at the menu board if there is a menu board they'll find the item being served the price and the calorie count for that item being served people there's no tax on calories and people in order whatever they want they're going to know what's being served the price and how many calories there are there's a menu the same thing for national restaurant and the the other thing if folks want more information at that restaurant on all sodium or fats or trans fats or cholesterol that kind of thing you asked for it will be provided for them like that right on an on site those are just some of the provisions some of the provisions for their health care bill it's a perfect I don't think so almost nothing but I do is perfect but is it is it designed to help us get to a place where we'll have better health care outcomes for less money I believe it will do that and the parts of it that need to be changed over time to make a conectar do it to fix it or to improve it let's do that i like to say amend it don't end it heal it don't repeal it but that's I think that's a much smarter approach in the months years that I might have had of me innocent it that's what I'm going to do thank you so much for tuning in

recognize thank you very much i want to thank our ranking member for yielding and for your tremendous leadership on so many of these very critical issues Mr Speaker I rise though in strong opposition to the National Defense Authorization Act which would authorize another 618 billion dollars in spending to our already out of control defense budget it would also expand funding for wars that Congress has never debated and once again publican colleagues has have used an off-the-books spending gimmick to further expand the already bloated Pentagon budget enough is enough instead of writing blank checks to the Pentagon Congress needs to live up to its constitutional obligation to debate matters of war and peace we need to rip up the 2001 blank check for endless war we need to stop funding wars without in with no debate on the costs and consequences to our troops or to the American people let's just figure i do have to say that i'm pleased at my amendment would i co-authored with my good friend congressman burges to report on the audit readiness of the pentagon that bill an amendment passed but much work remains so i call on our speaker to act to bring some accountability to pentagon spending and to bring forth an authorization to use force to support or oppose these new wars we need to do our job so i urge my colleagues to vote no on this bill and reject this wasteful spending

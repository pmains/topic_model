President Obama to lead an international effort to end that war in Syria their appeal is even more urgent now that Russia has launched these airstrikes in a letter signed by some 55 House Democrats congressman jim Himes writes that I'm quoting it is time to devote ourselves to a negotiated peace and work with allies including surrounding Arab states that have a vested interest in the security and stability of the region moving forward with both a peace plan and a coordinated assault against ISIL or Isis as it's also called congressman Himes is joining us from Capitol Hill first your reaction to the start of Russian airstrikes on various targets in Syria that began today yeah well wolf you know it's one more reason why I think there's urgency for the United States to exercise some leadership and really pull everybody together around a table to solve this thing with Russia now engaged and of course we've been seeing a move in weapons and and personnel for a while now that's just that much more violence that is going to occur that much less predictability you know we now have all kinds of countries flying in Syria and and so this is just one more reason why it's time for everybody to stand down and realize that we've all got a common interest in an outcome that you know may not be one that's to our liking you know when Russia and Iran get a vote and they do in that region we're not necessarily getting the deal that we would want but it's a deal that will stop the violence and hopefully stop the flow of now hundreds of thousands of migrants out of Syrian into places like Europe and soon the United States some seven million displaced people internally and externally maybe 300,000 people have been killed in these four years of this civil war that's going on in Syria in this letter among other things you say the situation worsens day-to-day shows no sign of improving you wrote the letter together with your colleagues all Democrats are you losing confidence in the president that his ability to do anything about what's going on well you know it's funny I was listening to Senator McCain earlier you know there's a mistake that we make in Washington that a lot of people make which is to think that if we just get the right answer if we just do the right things that everything will be fine in the Middle East that's just you know couldn't be further from the truth and I've always felt this isn't a dawning realization for me I've always felt that the effort that you know have got has gotten a lot of publicity lately to arm and train Syrian so-called moderates you know you don't need to be a you know a foreign policy Einstein to know that if you're putting a force into Syria to fight both Assad and Isis you know not only are you fighting on one side of a Middle Eastern civil war which is probably never a good idea you're actually fighting on both sides of a civil war and that's what we're doing and so I never had much confidence in that and you know sure enough the results that have become clear in the last couple of weeks suggest that that particular aspect of the policy has not worked so yes it's tried to time to try something different so what do you want the president to do in the immediate days and weeks ahead I want the president to get together with all of the other countries that have a steak or influence in the region and yes that will include Vladimir Putin you know people forget that Syria for decades and decades and decades was a client state of the Soviet Union there is a Russian naval base there they like it or not get a vote so I want the president to get together with Putin to get together with Turkey and Jordan the surrounding countries yes with Iran that's an uncomfortable thing to say because of course that's an appalling regime but they have influence in the region to get those folks together to say it to come up with a deal that ultimately will phase Assad out of power and do two things describe what the post-assad Syria looks like and that's going to be participation by Sunnis and Kurds and others and then and this is really critical once we've done that we all align Russians Iran the people who are doing it right now but we all around a line strategically around eradicated I sis only when we've sort of reached that level of agreement on where we go from here to I think we're going to be really effective at going after Isis one final question you remember the House Intelligence Committee you're obviously well briefed on what's going on Russia's intention right now in Syria a lot of experts say it's simply to bolster Bashar al-assad but even further to strengthen its own prestige its own influence in the region at the expense of the United States do you accept them um yeah I think that's probably accurate so far as it goes but again remember Syria has four generations been a Soviet and Russian client State you know Assad and his father got their military hardware their training and everything else from the Soviet Union and from Russia so you know what we're seeing here is Putin asserting himself not in areas you know where he's sort of breaking new ground but think of of Crimea which of course does in fact have a long Russian history asserting himself in areas where he can make the case that this there's a tradition of Russian participation there the other thing we need to remember about Putin and Russia look you know as much as I respect senator mccain they are not our geostrategic threat right now they are a problem for us no question but let's remember this is a country whose economy is imploding whose currency has been tanked who's president is playing very dangerous games all over the world and while he is dangerous we need to remember that we've got a lot of common interest with the guy in terms of fighting Islamic terrorism doing things like making sure Iran doesn't arrive at a nuclear weapon so we need we need to remember that part to Congress bragaw Himes thanks very much for joining us thanks a lot wolf

[Music] welcome back tonight President Biden once again called on Congress act on police reform exactly one month after Tyree Nichols was stopped and beaten by five officers at a traffic stop in Memphis his parents were in the audience tonight to hear President Biden's words about their son they were at the State of the Union as guests of chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Congressman Stephen horseford who joins us now Congressman thank you so much for being here thank you I really appreciate it what was your reaction to that moment tonight when President Biden called for police reform and that entire moment when he talked about Tyree Nichols uh honestly I I'm so I was so grateful and I am to President Biden uh to vice president Harris I immediately looked up to um the first lady's box and I wanted to hug um Tyree Nichols mother and father because this was their plea that their son's death would not be in vain in fact his mother said he was on assignment hmm think about that for a moment a loved one who's still grieving comes to the State of the Union most people come to celebrate she came as a part of the loss but now a purpose around making sure that Congress takes action and that it's meaningful and that it saves other lives and we we're just calling for Public Safety and accountability which is not a Republican or Democratic issue it's not a black brown or white issue this is a public safety issue that all of us should focus on getting done I don't want to be pollyanish but sometimes I think symbolism mattered and it I thought tonight because tyree's parents were there that you had a chamber that United even for a second even for a moment in that moment they all heard they all heard what he said um are you hearing anything from your friends on the other side of the aisle are they saying you know what let's he's right we got to do something I mean he didn't put any markers down he'll take anything which means a couple of things James Comer came on here and said you know maybe we ought to have a list of bad cops he was basically for the the national list something what's there what's possible first this the work that we've done around police reform uh accountability and Justice didn't just start now it's been months and years in the in the making uh our former chair Joyce Beatty and uh former congresswoman now mayor of Los Angeles Karen bass did a lot of work to lay the groundwork and and we are now at a moment where it's time to act yes there are Republicans who I have talked with that other members of our caucus have talked with and the president extended an olive branch to them today and I am as well we know we need Republicans um to get meaningful reform passed and we're not going to just take anything what is Meaningful I was just going to say Define that I mean it's because every everybody's got a different definition well it needs to number one deal with transparency which goes to the data for example in Memphis the use of force was used three times more on black residents than on white residents the only reason we know that is because they collect data we need that data on 18 000 police departments across the country we need to focus on accountability so that officers that do abuse their power can be held accountable what that looks like we're working on and finally we need to increase Professional Standards to improve the culture of policing and all of us should agree that bad policing shouldn't exist anywhere in America like we're not going to play matchmaker here but that that didn't seem like yeah I mean it seems like that something can get done yeah I mean one of the biggest sticking points in these negotiations has been the issue of qualified immunity essentially protecting police officers um from any liability if someone is killed in a police involved incident would you be willing to support legislation that didn't include that well what I'm not I'm not going to negotiate on TV what I'm gonna do is say to my colleagues on the other side you know we got we get James come over that we can get this done right here if you want tonight as long as my colleagues understand as they did tonight that accountability meaningful accountability should be part of any package then that we can make a whole lot of progress ultimately George Floyd Justice and policing we're going to continue to fight for that for as long as it takes that doesn't mean we can't make progress along the way Senator Tim Scott is seen as just being pivotal and critical to getting a bipartisan piece of legislation done on police reform where do you see him fitting into these latest round of talks has he been present do you think he is energized to get something done right now I think Senator Scott is an honorable person and is working with several of our colleagues including Senator um Cory Booker I talked to several Republican members even tonight leaving the floor one side took the Nichols family off the gallery floor as we were leaving several members came up to them came up to her to talk and you know of course they say I'm praying for you I'm I I'm lifting you up and she said I need more than prayer I need you all to act wow and that is what it's going to take and there are so many other we met we had 15 guests of members from the Congressional Black Caucus sitting in that Gallery tonight all of them touched in One Way by police incidents some who lost a loved one others who were traumatized by incidents but here's the bottom line no parent as the president said tonight should have to worry when their child leaves as a black father of three children I know what that feels like to worry about them when they're at the park or at the gym or getting stopped at a during a traffic incident that should not mean that they lose their life and we're calling for Public Safety and accountability and all of us should be able to stand for that well you leave this conversation on a powerful Point Congressman Horsford we really appreciate your being here thank you so much

I better present I wasn't sure if I would continue to wear my mask come over here I saw you were wearing yours and I said well I'll just keep wearing mine too and all of our staff on the floor including the one on one of our staff members she takes down our words for the Congressional Record and folks who accept the documents at the the desk in front of us all wiring their masks and I was wearing a mask earlier today going into a local mark of a business meeting the Environment and Public Works Committee and they're they're also wearing a mask as I was about to go into the hearing I know the business meeting was a police officer and I asked her she'd get a Capitol police officer and I said to her have how are we doing and how are you doing today and she said I'm doing fine she said I said a any idea how many of our Capitol police officers have been infected developed symptoms and have they have had the virus at some point in recent weeks and she said I believe that somewhere between 15 and 20 which came as a surprise to me we haven't heard that much about it but come on over here today this afternoon we've been here to vote several times and just coming over here to this afternoon to say a few words about a legislation that we passed unanimously out of the Environment and Public Works Committee today I pass any number of people capital police officers people that were cleaning the building maintaining the building folks who serve food in the cafeteria so that people who are working here can get something to to eat they they were almost without exception wearing masks and the reason why it's important for us to do that is because they are at risk and we need to execs it but as leaders we need to exhibit levi's our example and I know my colleagues are endeavoring to do that and it's important these are people who serve our country just as we do and they deserve not just our respect and our thanks but they deserve our protection and for everybody who maybe does something they're not comfortable doing or used to doing and wearing a mask or santa hand sanitizing a lot they're watching her hands even more these are good things not just for us not just for our families but for the people who are serving this country here with us in their nation's capital Madam President I didn't come here today to say those words but I wanted to run my heart tonight I just wanted to share them with with that with you and others but I I've come today to talk about a couple bills that the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works reported out today unanimously that will invest and improve our nation's water infrastructure a water infrastructure what does the infrastructure including includes the pipes that bring us our water or the that take our wastewater effluent where it can be treated the they our infrastructure includes our dams includes our harbors our ports our waterways all that in a whole lot more when we talked about improving our water infrastructure while we're really talking about is keeping the promises afforded to every American through the Declaration of indepen some of those words life liberty and the pursuit of happiness the legislation that we acted on today two bills will be combined into one here later on the floor call the Water Resources Development Act but the underlying the underlying message is our work today directly reflects words and they those words in the Declaration of Independance life liberty and the pursuit of happiness certainly none of those things life liberty pursuit of happiness are possible without access to clean water whether it's to wash our hands or to drink we can't have life without clean water to drink the Acoma 19 pandemic has reminded us of that - just how important it is to have access to clean water to wash our hands and and soap to wash our hands we reminded daily I seen almost hourly that wash our hands with soap and water is a simple yet effective way to prevent the spread of this Berlin disease and our committee today Environment Committee today senator Sullivan from Alaska talked about the the Native Americans who live in his state who don't have running water they don't have a spigot to but to turn on adriaen have the ability to flush toilets they for them this is like the idea that you thought you do those things is just a dream that they would never imagine being realized the thing is too many communities across our country to not have access to clean water because of harmful contamination in their groundwater or water supply pipes sadly this public health disparity usually goes hand-in-hand with economic opportunity while water is the essence of life it's also an essential part of our economy more than 99 percent of the u.s. overseas trade more than 99 percent of u.s. overseas trade moves through our waterways imagine that most people would never imagine that a nation's water infrastructure our ports our shipping channels and other related projects support economic growth facilitate commerce sustain jobs and create new jobs as well Americans cannot truly pursue happiness without the economic opportunity that comes with having strong water infrastructure a lot of which we can't see we've enjoyed on the floor of our chairman of our committee there's pipes and and wastewater treatment plants and the facilities are clean the water floors we don't see those fortunately somebody does somebody's built them somebody maintains them in order for us to have that life liberty and the pursuit of happiness well today our committee led by John Ferraro senator from Wyoming I have had the privilege of being the ranking Democrat on that the committee we approved two bills are going to help us keep those promises laid out in that declaration of independence life liberty and the pursuit of happiness America's water infrastructure infrastructure act of 2020 and the drinking water infrastructure Act of 2010 will help the US Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency make improvements to key water infrastructure systems throughout our country the programs we pass and our committee today will support the Army Corps of Engineers operation and maintenance of listen to this 13,000 miles of commercial deep draft ship channels 13,000 miles 12,000 miles of commercial inland waterways I said yesterday mr. chairman before he joined us that explained how 99% of the cargo that we send to other countries or that comes into ours comes by ship doesn't come by airplanes doesn't come by train it comes by ships and those ships don't move without waterways largely maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers these are little known projects that keep our economy moving they're essential to our way of life as well and what comes into the Port of Los Angeles today will be on shelves of stores in the Midwest and they are so later in Delaware we have a port on the Delaware River it's called the port of Wilmington not far from where I live my wife and I live supports more than 19,000 jobs in our region for a little state and lot big States 19,000 jobs that's not much that's a rounding error Delaware Wyoming that's a huge deal port of Wilmington is Dell the United States top seaport for fresh food imports capital live in the eastern part of the United States and you got up and had cereal this morning with some banana on your cereal it's a good chance that that banana came through before the Wilmington the Army Corps is working diligently with our port on an expansion project that will open a channel to a new containment facility just north couple of miles north of the current port along the Delaware River the Army Corps is responsible for dredging and maintaining access to new to this new channel which over at the time will support more commerce more jobs for our region largest for our state but for our region for such a small state we're like you can stand probably what brought a circle around my the house where my wife and I live about 10 mile radius you got you cover in New Jersey you cover that's the lane Ian he gets pretty darn close to Maryland as well so the impact is will be a regional impact in addition to authorizing necessary core projects the two bills that we reported out of a committee today unanimously clean water revolving loan fund authorized and let me say that again that the two bills that we were reported out of our committee today included authorizing the clean water revolving fund for the first time since 1987 we created used to be EPA would provide grant programs to fund water projects and States telephone and water projects is set to help fund a wastewater treatment projects in our state and we change that when Donald rondalee was president and we have these revolving loan funds federal government replenishes them every now and then and the state's the destitute ship the money and invested money out of those those funds but we haven't reauthorized the clean water revolving fund which focuses less on drinking water and more on just clean water reducing the effluent that we're putting out and for in our communities so many of our communities rely on this fund to improve their wastewater systems in the drinking water bill corollary we also authorized more than a half billion dollars to provide critical drinking water infrastructure through the small and disadvantaged communities grant program that I just talked about earlier what I spoke of mr. senator Dan Sullivan comments and our hearing today what he talked about Native American communities in in his state who don't have flushed wires in a number of cases they don't have clean 20 they don't turn on the faucets and the clean water just comes it comes out and there are other communities not just there in my state at one time not long ago in other states where they're disadvantaged programs the communities and we will have a grant program that we're going to use to help more and more of them not all of them but more of them and this will help us keep the promise of clean safe drinking water of maybe not for every American before Americans and no matter what their zip code is or what kind of bank account they have I think Matthew 25:14 see I don't care what our faith is there's Matthew 25 with these words when I was thirsty did you give me to drink for hungry did you feed me well when I was thirsty and I didn't have any clean water to drink what did you do about it well in this bill we do something about it I'm proud of what we've done and as we work to ensure clean water for all our drinking water bill we'll continue our work to address what are called forever chemicals a forever chemical is the chemical doesn't degrade and there is a a word that's about a mile long there are a couple of words that describe it but we call it P FAS that's the acronym I'm not big on acronyms but on this one I like this one a lot but these are forever chemicals as a whole there's thousands of them that that never die don't just don't degrade in in our environment and for the most part they're not dangerous but some of them a couple more really dangerous and they can lead to thyroid and liver disorders they can increase risk of cancer they can adversely affect people's immune systems we have a pretty good idea which ones they are and we need to do something about it and we thought to do that or earlier this year late last year through other legislation we have an opportunity with a bill that we pulled out today to do more good work on on addressing these forever chemicals and one of the ways is by developing a clean drinking water standard for two of them that are most most concerning PFOA are called follow and PF OSP pause and wait between today we're reporting the bill out of committee and the time we come back to the floor to debate it here we have the opportunity I hope to do either more good work addressing that matter Madam President I know you have a military base in your state I've been to Oakland one or two of them we have one big military base in our state it's the Dover Air Force Base biggest employer will have in southern central and southern part of our state 6,000 uniformed and civilian personnel they have some of the biggest planes in the world sea fives they have c-17s it's a cargo base and it's been recognized many times is the best cargo base in the world that's the Air Force Base in the world too and about five six seven years ago one of our c5 took off the to fly around the world preparing a full boatload of fuel full load of cargo and as he took off the four engine airplane the flight engineer noticed an engine light came on and one of the engines not a good sign and the flight engineer turned off not that engine turned off another engine and then he had like two engines working in two engines not working Lockette long story short okay the airplane came around and landed tried to land again where it gets taken taking off crashed a mile short of a runway and fortunately nobody was killed firefighting teams the fire department came rushing out and foam down the area and help put put out the fire nobody died I'm sad to say here when I was on active duty as a naval flight officer Moffett Field Naval Air Station one morning driving into work many years ago the huge fire one the NASA airplane big plane landed on top of one in a VP three airplanes killed everybody I think one person surprised in the whole the whole crash again folks the firefighters rushed out and tried to save lives with his firefighting foam be it's the iron is a cruel irony here because that firefighting foam which is used to save lives and air crashes and all actually when it rains it gets washed into the the ground and a lot of times ends up in in Weatherford wells and and underground water that people drink and consuming and great very serious help that helped results for that so anyway between now and today and time our bill comes to the floor bills come to the floor we hope to make some lot more progress and address adjusting those for every chemicals well millions of millions of Americans rely on the Army Corps projects to safely navigate our waters to stay safe from flooding and storm damage and reap the benefits of healthy aquatic ecosystems and marshlands but we know the impacts of the climate change it posed a real threat to public safety and to the durability of our infrastructure I like to use the example Ellicott City Maryland not even 30 40 miles from here a couple years ago within 18 months of each other they had two thousand year floods what is it two thousand year flood it's a flood that's supposed to occur every thousand years we had two of them within 18 months of each other and we're seeing in that kind of extreme weather places all over the country and we needed dolly wrecks havoc on our homes and our businesses and our road transportation system but also our drinking water systems and one of the things that we do on our bill is to address that and these two bills expand grants that will help small and medium sized communities in crisis with the resiliency of their water systems to natural hazards and extreme weather like what they've experienced in Ellicott City and any number of places around our country before I yield the floor Madam President to my friend and colleague our Chairman John Barrasso is patiently waiting for me to stop talking I want to thank him again I already thanked you once but now that your honor would thank you again it's colleague but I want to thank you for for your leadership and helping us to move this legislation through we've we've all heard the saying says it's Joe Biden saying so just because somebody is my my adversary or somebody on the other side of the aisle they don't have to be my enemy and we're actually don't let this work get out in Wyoming serve either I think it would say if we could save her friends and we if we like to work together nice desk most days I like to to work together and hopefully we can do even better but I want to thank you mama Thank You staff I want to thank all the center's we and I pleaded with our colleagues from all 50 states to give us their ideas of what should go into this bill and the bun a bunch of our colleagues the majority of them did that so it's not just something we dreamed up on our committee but that great input from a whole bunch of our colleagues Democrats and Republicans and were able to put together a bill that passed our committee unanimously our about I just want to mention the names of a couple of people who on both sides Dale and and they include Richard Russell Bryan Clifford Andy Harding Lizzy Olson Susan Lucas Craig Thomas Beth Lang Christina Rob use Matt Leggett who worked for Senator Barrasso and and on my team Mary Francis rep core staff director mark Mendenhall Annie D'Amato and John Cain who works he works harder than any spot anybody person I've ever had the privilege of working with the last leader senator Barrasso introduced me last year so to follow from Wyoming and who been nominated to be very senior official in the Commerce Department and he'd been nominated for a position where he would be an assistant or as Assistant Secretary of Interior to handle among other things national parks national wildlife refuges fish and wildlife big job an important job for all all of our state's certainly - certainly Wyoming and during his testimony Rob Wallace testified I thought so well and it's hard not to like the guys just liked him almost immediately but he said these words to our committee said bipartisan solutions are lasting solutions that's what he said bipartisan solutions are lasting solutions and I said there that day thinking boy he nailed it I've sold on that line sometimes I give him credit for it sometimes I don't but think about that bipartisan solutions are lasting solutions we need a lasting solutions we especially need them with respect to making sure those words in the declaration of independence life liberty and pursuit of happiness are just words on a sheet of paper and old words on a piece of parchment but they're real words today and then we have renewed our commitment to them and we've done that with the legislation we put it out of our committee so some work to do Harbor meanness fees or try to resolve that people have strong views modernizing the sync with one another and the legislation these forever chemicals and how do we deal with that in ways that are smart and respect science and and enable us to make sure that we better protect people's health so that I think that's it these bills in closing are a win-win-win for a nation's economy for public health and for our environment and a time we desperately needed and as we face down the Cova 19 crisis before it for us I hope that these two pieces of legislation will serve as a model for how we can continue to work together which is what I intend to do with our Chairman and I'm not the oldest thank you

action and we'll go down to mr chase of hawaii before we get to questions so it stands very if you just stand by um mr chase case thank you so much uh chair johnson ranking member lucas and members of the committee and mahalo for the opportunity to share my thoughts with the committee on climate change especially as it relates to our oceans which is of course a critical issue impacting my home state of hawaii we are of course severely impacting our climate through our actions throughout our nation this year we've seen record temperatures expansive droughts massive wildfires increased hurricanes and more this is of course tragically led to the deaths of many americans it affected the lives and livelihoods of many more these weather events will only increase in frequency and severity on our present course in my home state of hawaii we are on the front lines of the fight against climate change because of its severe effects on our federal ecosystems especially our oceans ocean acidification is killing off our native greece and shellfish ocean rises washing away our beaches and threatening roads and communities and increasing temperatures are having effects such as pushing mosquitoes and other invasive species further into our native forests killing more and more of our endemic endangered species i want to thank this committee for your leadership on climate-related issues to help protect hawaii from these threats your work in investments in climate science research and observation technology have focused squarely on the challenges we're facing for example continued congressional support for noaa's mauna loa observatory on the island of hawaii over decades has confirmed the existence extent and pace of climate change earlier this year mauna loa recorded atmospheric co2 levels exceeding 470 417 parts per million which is 50 percent higher than the beginning of the industrial revolution and it's on an accelerating course i speak before you today requested this committee make sure to include our oceans in your future climate work perhaps this is not always top of mind to many people but oceans cover 71 of our earth's surface government scientists agree that oceans are critical in climate change since they absorb solar radiation and release heat needed to drive the atmospheric circulation they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it for years to millions of years and our ocean greatly impacts weather events from hurricanes to droughts to help do my part together with other colleagues on a bipartisan basis i'm an original co-sponsor of hr 3764 the ocean based climate solutions act hr 3906 the blue carbon protection act and h.r 3748 the blue globe act these measures would help restore marine and coastal ecosystems make coastal communities more resilient and conserve marine mammal and fish populations these bills have all been referred to my natural resources committee but they've also been referred to this committee your input and markup and serious attention to these measures are critical to their success given your expertise in research and development and scientific issues more broadly their advancement is important to assisting coastal communities and constituencies like mine adapt to new realities of higher sea level increased flooding and depleted fish stocks furthermore your continued investment in monitoring and forecasting can help us mitigate climate change effects until we develop long-term solutions i grew up in the town of hilo hawaii on the coast on the island of hawaii and i remember personally the 1960s tsunami that killed 61 people in my hometown because of the excellent work of the national weather service and other federal agencies well we have had tsunamis since then we have not seen a tragedy of that nature in america on that scale since we can follow this model to help develop ways to save lives as we confront climate change head-on in this congress and beyond in closing thank you again for your leadership in addressing the science of climate change and work towards advancing american innovation to address climate-related issues i look forward to continuing to work with you on this critical issue that is affecting all of our constituencies and especially our oceans thank you very much i yield back thank you very much at this point we'll begin our question period um mr case the science committee has held many productive ocean-related hearings and are working on significant related bills we've talked about the importance of the ocean and the earth system and the ocean climate nexus on june 7th we held a hearing entitled defining a national ocean shot accelerating ocean and great lakes science and technology earlier this year we passed miss vonamicia's coast research act out of the house and i'm committed to working with you and chairman valhalla of the committee of natural resources to move these um important jurisdictional ocean bills including our forthcoming ocean exploration bill in the general's informed opinion what would you say would be the most important ocean science questions you think the science committee should address well i think thank you so much madam chair and first of all i do definitely want to again recognize the work of this committee uh to date um you've been real leaders on this issue you have been entirely cognizant and fully appreciative of the oceans from from climate change perspective you collectively and um it has been a wonderful working partnership from that perspective i guess what i would say to you is that when of course when we talk about the oceans the oceans are not some integrated um you know separate ecosystem from the land and from from our air and so i guess i would answer you very very generally which is your broader work on on climate change is is obviously critical uh to to to the oceans as well as every other part of our of our global ecosystem and so i don't want to i don't want to get away from that at all um i definitely uh believe that that that that your your emphasis on research and development uh in terms of climate change with specific regard to impacts on the oceans is invaluable uh because um it does demonstrate the actual effect of climate change which many of us don't perceive in the oceans because you know we don't tend to go into the oceans i do but many of us don't um is is is is critical from from just appreciating the the acidification the the increase in temperatures in our oceans the impacts on coastal communities um that research and development proves a cause and effect um um you know uh relationship that that i think is is critical from that perspective together with your broader research thank you very much and now i'll open the floor to anyone on the committee who has a question of our testifying colleagues uh mr lucas would you like to be recognized you moot it better now madam chair i hope thank you yes allocating your time i'd simply say to my colleagues i appreciate the input that both of you offered it's important the committee in particular congressman case some years ago when i was a subcommittee chairman on agriculture you and i conducted a hearing addressing the agriculture conservation programs and the unique nature of hawaii and the islands would you remind us today about the climate the different climate zones when you're on an island you literally have everything from rainforest potentially to arid deserts or semi-arid mention a few details about that the unique challenges in hawaii well first of all uh congressman it was it was great to host you in hawaii in conjunction with our both of our membership then on the agriculture committee and i really appreciated your interest and attention to unique challenges of agriculture in tropical parts of our country which again is not most of our country but we certainly have our specialty agriculture you saw that in spades and and your visit is remembered by the way um so in hawaii and this is this is relevant to our conversation we have um all of the microclimates of the world in one place we we go from from you know alpine to to montane to a deep tropical rainforest to desert and everywhere in between and by the way this goes out into the ocean so we have many many of the of the characteristics of the ocean in one place as well we have we have certainly the the near shore uh tropical uh world of you know corals and and tropical fish but we go very quickly to deep ocean where we have impacts from climate change in our deep oceans and this is within our our you know eez and so um and so really um um you know from from a positive and a negative perspective excuse me on the positive side you've got uh every impact of climate change uh there is out there in a very small area which makes the research and development that we do in hawaii uh really integral to our to our our international understanding on the negative side would get impacted on a lot of different ways and to your point on agriculture as one very specific area i spoke to it a little bit earlier but as the climate changes as the temperature changes those micro climbs adjust to that and the agriculture adjusts to that and the invasive species that we have adjusted that as well i i made mention of the of the fact that we saw mosquitoes and other pests coming deeper into native forests where the natural flora and fauna never had to deal with mosquitoes before and so as a result and i think it's pretty clearly uh directly impacted by climate change and increased air temperatures which are causing that we are seeing uh devastation and that is true also uh in our in our agriculture in hawaii so there are broad-ranging effects that you can see in a very you know uh very small and confined area and way i'm sure this is the case in many many parts of our country and world but i i happen to live it so i i see it i thank you both and i yield back madam chair thank you very much anyone else seeking time we're hearing none uh i will bring this meeting to a close and i want to thank the members for their attendance and this really concludes uh our member day hearing thank you again thank you very much

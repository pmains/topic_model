Christmas parade attack last year was a glaring example of how the justice system failed when it came to repeat offender most notably there Daryl Brooks in that one who mowed down six people in an SUV unfortunately sometimes it's going to be set low and and an offender is going to go off and same thing as putting someone on probation they may go off and commit a crime and we can't we can't prevent all that but this one seems Seems substantially lower than it should have been again that was Daryl Brooks there one Wisconsin lawmaker now has introduced the keeping violent offenders off our streets act joining us now is Wisconsin Republican Congressman Scott Fitzgerald Congressman good to see you thank you so much for coming on we appreciate that joining us here from the capitol um difficult to think back to that Waukesha Christmas parade you're thinking about children and the elderly and the the dancing grannies and those who lost their lives I mean just watching this video again for a reminder and it it's just shocking this this Tiny Town Waukesha looking forward to this uh this event only to be struck by a tragedy they will never forget talk to me about this and what can be done or implemented uh that can perhaps stop something like this from happening yeah Sean I think first of all uh you know the city of Waukesha and the surrounding area is uh still very much healing from what happened as we come upon that one year anniversary uh it's it's not something that uh many people are going to get over soon they're working on a permanent Memorial that's going to be built in the city as well so it's still very much on on people's minds in my district I would say that one of the things when I'm in the district a lot of constituents would approach us and say what can be done uh and and the first thing I tell them is listen what what did happen in Waukesha could have been prevented uh if there would have been some simple measures taken and what we've done is we've worked with other members of our conference to try and develop a strategy and a piece of legislation that we think would would help to end what our serious issues related to some of the District Attorney's offices and quite honestly some of the judges who just don't have enough information in front of them when they're setting bail for these individuals yeah like this from um thank you by the way for updating us on the residents of Waukesha there we continue to think about that but thinking about handling this from a congressional level when many would would point to as you alluded to the DA's in the the district attorneys in these areas implementing laws perhaps pulling back some I wanted to play this for you this is Wisconsin governor Tony Evers and what he said about Milwaukee County D.A John Chisholm who set that low thousand dollar cash bail for the man who uh mowed down those victims in Waukesha Darrell Brooks watch in the case of Chisholm it was not necessarily him per se it was the system kind of broke down they didn't they didn't have the the appropriate risk assessment hadn't been done and so there's lots of things that should be done differently and that's why I'm really glad that we're talking about this as a state and as a nation and hopefully we can find a better way to do that your response to the governor and do you have something to add to that well first and foremost Governor Evers could and does have the ability to simply fire the D.A D.A Chism this is not his first misstep when it comes to bail so so let me put that out there first of all uh and I and I wish the governor would have done that and I think many residents of the state of Wisconsin feel the same way the the second piece is uh there there are dollars there are revenues that make their way to municipalities and to the counties into the states that is specifically there to monitor uh what what otherwise would be an incomplete system and I think that's what we're still looking at one of the things that we try and Achieve with this piece of legislation is to break down the barriers state to state so if somebody does commit a number of crimes in the South or in the western states that if they commit a crime in the midwest that the judge the D.A and everybody involved in Prosecuting that crime has all the information that should be available to them and then if they make an unfortunate decision like Chisholm did in this instance then it's on them so the burn grants is is the stream of money that makes its way to these many levels of government and what we're proposing is that listen if you don't comply if you don't make this information available then there's going to be a reduction in that and and again the interstate concept of all of this information should be available to everyone so they know just what the background is on these individuals before they actually set bail sure and a lot of folks are campaigning on getting rid of their District Attorneys there is a district attorney recall effort there in California New York's running on a campaigning Governors campaigning on removing DA's it'll be an interesting time to watch for that again all effort to to make sure something like Waukesha does not happen again on the the topic of this segment Congressman Scott Fitzgerald joining us live from the capitol we'll let you get back to work Congressman thank you for that

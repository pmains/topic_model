as rolla where postal service has been struggling with some serious long-standing financial challenges for a while and one of my top goals since i joined his committee 400 years ago 15 years ago has been to address these challenges in to help postal service to find a way to thrive in the 21st century the postal service operates as we know as the center of a 1.4 trillion dollar mailing industry that employs I'm told about seven half million people across our country this industry provides six percent of our nation's job six percent and that puts it on par when it comes to total jobs and revenues with the airline industry and I'm told the gas industry all the gas industry as well and businesses both large and small depend on the Postal Service's one-of-a-kind retail processing and delivery network 200 year old legacy delivery network but as we sit here today there are some real questions that continue to be asked about the future what the future holds for the postal service despite having finished 2015 with an operating profit the postal service continues to report billions of dollars of losses on top of that it's maxed out is 15 billion dollar line of credit with the Treasury this is left postal management with no other choice but to default on another 5.7 billion dollar health care payment last year the fourth year in a row that the Postal Service has been unable to fill that statutory obligation when the Postal Service closed its books on fiscal year 2015 it announced a 5.1 billion dollar loss its ninth consecutive multi-billion dollar loss complicating matters is the fact that the the emergency rate surcharge that went into effect in 2014 to compensate the postal service for its losses during your session is set to expire I believe in late march or early april by all accounts the income being generated by this increase is now the only thing keeping they are the biggest thing keeping the Postal Service's head above water when the surcharge expires rates for the Postal Service's core products will decline diminishing the postal services revenues and liquidity and racing the small operating profits it has recently shown but I think we can still be optimistic about the future of the postal service I am and I hope you are too and I say that because despite what the Postal Service's them through we've seen some significant growth in important area and that is package delivery the postal service total volume for this line of business jump more than fourteen percent is that right general fourteen percent last year in addition this is even more encouraging least to me the steady decline of first-class mail volume since 2006 appears to be leveling off and by some accounts we may be starting to see some new demand for this product that's always been the biggest moneymaker for the Postal Service as that happens we're off to the races so we'll keep our fingers cost and this past holiday season was much stronger if the postal service that anticipated with mail volume related to the e-commerce reportedly exceeding expectations for the Postal Service Oh to truly be successful in the digital age Congress must enable we need to be enabler but we notice to enable the Postal Service to take full advantage of the opportunities odd to offer by the package boom and other recent successes I like to say as they say it's a home depot you could do it we can help and that's our job to help nearly ten years have passed since major postal reform legislation was last signed into law although we've made several attempts in recent years without getting the ball into the scynthians own it's now for Congress to get off the bench get into the game and let's score touchdown absent legislative intervention the Postal Service will continue twisting in the wind remain unable to fully invest in its future its employees and customers will continue to be uncertain about what the future holds for them there are a handful of post-reform provisions that we've debated it on this committee is some of us know for years taken together they would set the Postal Service in its leadership up to turn the agency's finances around further and set it up to succeed in the years to come the most important of these provisions we know is the addresses to address the health care costs that the Postal Service and in fact that this agency is the same as larger single largest payer into the Medicare yet does not receive full value from the program for its contributions I put forward legislation in the last Congress with our former colleague dr. Coburn many of our colleagues here have supported and this year with senators Moran McCaskill and blunt that would allow the Postal Service to do what private businesses do when they coordinate their health care with Medicare this has a potential to largely eliminate the unfunded liability for the retiree health benefits and save the Postal Service some 32 billion dollars over the next 10 years our proposal would also give the Postal Service significant savings when it comes to pension costs which LPM now determines using inaccurate data the don't account for makeup Postal Service's workforce and other important factors making OPM requiring OPM to use the right data would also reap more than two and a half billion dollars in savings over the next five years alone we're also freed in our legislation the Postal Service to innovate and explore new business opportunities by removing dated restrictions and current law on the type of products and services that they can offer this part of our bill would let the Postal Service do some specific things like join UPS and FedEx and others in offering and delivering beer wine and spirits would also encourage the Postal Service to test new innovations much like its existing authority to initiate Sunday package delivery and to experiment with things like grocery delivery and other parts of the country coupled with our proposal to make permanent the emergency rate increase currently set to expire as part of our bill has the potential to bring in significant revenues in the coming years finally I bill would also push her pride the Postal Service to do what the late to Postmaster General the lake the last Postmaster General hufton told me was his top goal if we were able to get post reform done and that's to put the service back in postal service since 2002 the Postal Service has made great strides to be more efficient cutting total work hours by nearly thirty percent ealing 17 billion dollars in savings we've also seen the number of mail processing centers cut in half from more than 600 about 300 today but the solution to the challenge to the Postal Service faces today can't be just about more cuts cutting costs was certainly necessary concern has been raised that further cuts will only two great service and end up chasing customers away I share those concerns we may also be seeing service suffer due to deep cuts that have been made in some areas in order to thrive in coming years the Postal Service actually needs to invest in a new generation of delivery vehicles we know that and its packaging a project rather its processing plants and its post offices themselves it needs to harness and deploy new technology that can improve service and contain costs rather than continue making cuts that will further erode service all right coming to the end that's why our bill a bipartisan bill would permit a pause further service standard changes for five years in mail processing closes for two years this will give the Postal Service and the Postal Regulatory Commission time to explore what the appropriate level of service should be and hopefully return service to the levels that were provided to customers until last year when service standards I think the last Congress know last year when service standards were set at the modified one two three day delivery standard that many of us supporting so on some I believe our bill bipartisan bill represents the Lulu real lasting reform that can help the Postal Service be just as important for my son's generation as it was for my generation our generation and for my parents generation we've offered legislation that enjoys wide support among with postal stakeholders who's often widely diverging priorities and goals have made postal reform hard to about to achieve in recent years that's because after months of effort to find common ground the Postal Service its unions a large contingencies of postal customers and stakeholders have finally succeeded in coming to agreement on a number of key provisions that they feel that we feel need to be contained in any postal bill for the Postal Service to succeed truly succeed these key provisions are in contained in our bill last fall last thought working together it's important that Congress provides some certainty to both postal employees and customers and ensure the taxpayers taxpayers along with all of our fiscal challenges we face are not saddled with shoring up a failing Postal Service we can't afford to be here a year from now discussing how we can dig ourselves out of yet and other postal crisis I don't believe any of us want to do that I sure don't we don't want to kick the can down the road one more time as it turns out if we're smart enough and creative enough and bold enough we don't have to and we can do what needs to be done to actually fix the problem so mr. chairman thanks again for holding this hearing for everybody attending and without providing our testimony my colleagues to be here I look forward to working with our colleagues in the weeks ahead to enact postal reform legislation promptly that will enable the postal service in his employees deceives the day and provide the services that are needed in the 21st century I think they really have it right at home depot let me say you can do it we can help and the time has come let's just do it thank you

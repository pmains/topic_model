congressman mark DC of Texas congressman it's great to have you with us thank you very much for taking the time to join us let's begin with that last point that I just mentioned there which is we know House Democrats they're expecting to hear from a number of State Department officials next week they certainly have that on the docket but given the signals coming up from the White House including the Secretary of State how optimistic are you sir about the ability to move forward if these committees hit more stonewalling we're going to move forward regardless the committees have lots of power obviously they're led by very competent individuals and we're going to do we're going to lay the process out for the people so we can present facts to them on this and you know we're learning more and more every day without them releasing very much we're learning more and more every day and we're going to get we're going to continue and I think it's incumbent on them to now prove to the American public that we especially with the poll and going against the White House that they don't have anything to hide okay well let me just say get some clarity on that you say going forward we will continue and certainly the Democrats will push forward but legally speaking tactically speaking what do you have at your disposal to go forward that can answer some of the questions that are still lingering without this becoming the delayed drawn-out process like the Moller report over two years that can see as we saw from the president constant confusion and attacks on some of these democratic committee leaders right exactly well you know chairmanship can talk you know more about the process obviously as he chairs the the relevant committee that's going to be overseeing a lot of this but you know there have been information that that's obviously been found out and there's I think there's going to be more every day it seems like that there's something in the news cycle every day now on this something new that's breaking and again there if there are certainly things that the committee will be able to find out through their hearings that they're going to conduct by interviewing certain people and and and I believe that again this is just the very beginning of this process but we're going to go through this and we're going to move forward there's nothing in the house rules there's nothing in the Constitution that says that we have to have a vote on this first like the presidents is suggesting we're going to continue to have this impeachment inquiry and we're going to try to find as much information as we can with what's available to us and as we learn more that information including some of those text messages that we saw illustrating the u.s. ambassadors working to persuade the Ukrainian government to publicly commit to investigating the bitings do you serve feel comfortable voting on articles of impeachment at this time why not just go ahead and hold the vote today or tomorrow no because my personal opinion is that the American public wants to see everything laid out before the public so they can see for themselves that this is not a political process that this is very serious and that's why we want to have an inquiry so we can present for the people hey this is what the president has done this is what has been presented to us and and we want to have the the full backing of the American public behind you there are obviously going to be people that are always going to support Donald Trump as he said he can stand in the middle of Times Square and shoot people and there's always going to be that crowd that sticks next to him but there are a lot of people that are backing away from him including people that voted for him in 2016 and again it's it's incumbent on them and I think it's a benefit to them to cooperate with the Democrats who cooperate with the house panels that are looking into this to show that they have nothing to hide all right

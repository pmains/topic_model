I rise in strong opposition to HJ Res 43 it's no surprise that once again congressional Republicans are trying to undermine women's access to health care and basic family planning services this ideological crusade and that's what it is it will hurt those who need help including low-income women women of color and young women it will also denied thousands of families from choosing their provider of choice and sometimes the only accessible provider and that's under Title 10 not only is this resolution anti-woman it's also counterproductive we know that for every dollar spent on title 10 family planning we say more than seven dollars on Medicaid related costs but my Republican colleagues are so determined to take family planning options away from low-income women that they are prepared to put ideological perspectives above public health as a member of the labor Health and Human Services Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee I unfortunately see these attacks on women's health all too well last year Republicans tried to completely eliminate funding for title 10 so

jeremy diamond mexico city thanks so much joining me now to discuss california democratic congressman raul ruiz he's the chair of the congressional hispanic caucus his district just about an hour north of the border uh in mexico congressman thanks so much for taking the time this morning thank you it's good to be here again so so the goal of this trip is to address the root causes of migration here to the u.s uh a consistent point from the bite administration and you said i'm quoting you here if you just treat the simpsons you'll never get at the cure i just wonder though can the us truly solve the root problems here when you're talking about issues of poverty and corruption what ability realistically does the us have to make a real difference on those issues well we can make a real difference and vice president harris has already mounted a very comprehensive aggressive approach by bringing in the the private sector the non-profit organizations the international human rights organizations to address why the families are making the desperate decision to leave their countries and come up north they're addressing the violence the threats to violence the corruption the democratic backsliding and food insecurity and hunger and extreme poverty and so this issue is important they've been there for years i mean they're not going to turn on a dime with outside help well they they've gotten worse uh one is because of the climate change hurricanes are more frequent and aggressive they've devastated their agricultural industry you're seeing uh governments that are have democratic backsliding and the cartels and the coyotes are more aggressive in their exploitation so now is the time to really intervene look we just had an administration they used hate fear cruelty and family separations they focused on the border wall which was useless uh and they've defunded all those programs that that help people in their home countries and so we're starting from below scratch and and having to build what the past trump administration has demolished in order to give people the hope because they want to stay in their countries they're making difficult decisions to come north because of their home conditions but many do won't want to come north i was down at the border with my team couple weeks ago the arizona border what the border agents tell us is is that the migrants are under the impression the false impression the the agents say but the under the impression that the u.s is more welcoming now under the bible administration and there there have been they're still enforcing the laws of the border but there have been changes uh made and and i wonder do you believe the by administration has taken steps that unwittingly feed that impression you know that that impression is not that it's more welcoming per se it's more humane uh when the trump administration rips children from the arms of their mothers and and really tries to use intimidation and fear to send a signal not to come and now we don't do that well they may say well it's they're friendlier they're more humane but we're a country of laws and we follow our laws and when people come to our country to seek asylum our laws state that they have a claim to make in court and that we would grant that claim if they meet certain criteria and seeking asylum so that's the difference is that the biden administration is professional humane and they're smart about this approach while the trump administration demolished made things worse with their hate fear and cruelty and i don't think the american people want to have a cruel approach to uh to the border in separating children from their mothers okay i down at the border i i saw the the new border barrier far different from what it replaced i mean much 30 feet high the other one you know anybody could kind of walk over or under and i just wonder is continuing border construction stopped by the bite administration is that part of the solution here you don't have to be cruel right but but do you see that as being an element that helps address the issue at the border look um the the us citizenship act with the big bold immigration reform which was president biden's immigration bill carried by the congressional hispanic caucus members linda sanchez and bob menendez focuses on border construction but in a smart way using technology where the evidence shows that people are smuggled through the border entries and drugs and guns etc so when you focus on the border construction with technology to identify uh the the smugglers and go after the coyotes then that's the right and smart approach okay uh final question if i can you heard our uh white house correspondent jeremy diamond referenced there uh the vice president's answer on going to the border we don't have time to play the whole answer here but short answer is she hasn't visited the border yet and this is part of her portfolio should the vice president have gone to the border already should she go now no look she's where she needs to be she's addressing the root causes people are making the desperate decision to come north due to conditions in their home countries not in our country and so that's why she's dealing with the violence she's dealing with corruption she's dealing with economic opportunity she's dealing with human rights the rule of law and the democratic backsliding that's happening in those countries look she's already spoken to asylum seekers to families she she knows the issues well and so the republicans like to be very fixated on this one after having four years of failed policies themselves and she's doing a great job at addressing those root causes because as i as you mentioned earlier uh you know you've got to deal with the root causes or this is going to continue to happen regardless of president congressman raul ruiz thanks so much for joining the program thank you you

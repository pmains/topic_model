future house minority whip steve scalise joins us now to react so congressman he's taking he's taking a lot of abuse from his own party especially on the left even took a shot last week from the president can he withstand this type of pressure in your estimation you know joe's joe manchin yeah sure joseph and and first of all remember we're going to be with you brian but uh remember when joe biden promised that he was going to unite and work with everybody he's out there undermining people on his own side because joe manchin says he wants to help president biden fulfill his promise of working with people and by the way in not passing more bad legislation because you know a democrat only infrastructure bill that would be much more a green new deal things that have nothing to do with roads and bridges would not be good for the country at least joe manchin putting this marker down on that and on hr1 which is a bad piece of legislation says that it's time that president putin has to start working with republicans like he promised i mean uh the president did hire his wife uh and then they are in conversation but did call him out last weekend there's more and more pressure for joe biden to pressure joe manchin we'll see if that'll work but the so-called for the people's act is scary crazy i mean they're going to nationalize elections expand mail and voting restore voting rights for convicted felons encourage statehood varsity d.c allow voters to substitute a photo id with a sworn written statement and it's 900 pages 900 pages to take over elections from the states it seems to me joe manchin's also taking bullets for other democrats like maybe john tester angus king kurz or center cinema yeah and think about this you know you've got a lot of states out there that have their own voter integrity protections in place west virginia didn't have issues in their election you know go look at florida back in 2000 you had the disaster with broward county where they're counting ballots that don't even have marks on them and florida fixed those laws uh if you look at what hr one does it it overrides all that it basically takes california's election turns it into america's law and gets rid of voter uh fraud protections which is something you don't want to do so again uh what joe manchin did joe's tough i mean they might threaten him i think it's a mistake for them to threaten him they ought to listen to what he's saying what he's saying is joe biden you ran saying you were going to unify the country and work with everybody it's time you start doing that so congressman here's the thing uh the one of the worst things that mitch mcconnell said about barack obama going to do everything i can to make him a one-term president they hung around his neck and it helped the president uh at the time and then he said something similar about joe biden that's the one thing that would get joe manchin to go with the left do you feel as though people should look at senator capito and mitch mcconnell as somebody who's really dealing let's say with infrastructure and show a sincerity there at the very least to give joe mention some some breathing room yeah look i mean regardless of of the elections in 2022 or 2024 we've got to do what's right for the country the policies right now are destroying the fabric of america look look at our economy you've got a lot of problems there you've got inflation through the roof our adversaries russia china iran are all on the move they're all testing president biden right now and frankly president biden is failing those tests just look at the recent hacks look at what china is doing he's trying to give away the intellectual property of the vaccine to china right now so i think in the end what any president has judged on is their performance and right now the performance has been very dismal bad for american jobs keystone's gone uh president biden approved the russian pipeline nordstrom to germany so he's killing american jobs giving jobs to foreign countries those aren't good fundamentals right let's just see if you guys can negotiate and get start getting stuff done that would back up joe manchin if you blow it up and don't try to do anything then he's going to have no cover thanks congressman appreciate it always great to be with

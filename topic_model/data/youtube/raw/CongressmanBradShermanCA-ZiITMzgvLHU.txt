now let's talk about the Republican tax bill this is a bill which will raise taxes on millions of middle-class families now it gets worse in a few years there's a bit of a bait-and-switch they'll want to tell you just look at how this bill will affect your tax return in nine twenty nineteen well if you plan to still be alive in 2027 take a look at the effect it's going to have then let's look at middle-class families not the poorest 20% in our country not the richest 20% that middle 60% roughly 30% of those families in the middle class are going to see a tax increase on their 2027 tax return and that tax increase is likely is calculated at an average of $1,300 per family well let's look at the individual provisions to see how fair they are to middle-class families first right off the bat they take away the personal exemption which on next year's tax return the first year that this new bill would be effective is worth four thousand one hundred and fifty dollars per person in your family that's nearly $21,000 for a family like mine of five they take away twenty one thousand dollars of deductions even from the poorest families in America and from every middle-class family as well now they say they're going to replace that with a child tax credit but if you're oh if your children are over age 16 that credit is limited to a few hundred dollars next year and then they make it zero five years from now so if your kids are going to turn age 17 sometime in the next five years they've got your name on this bill and they also do increase the standard deduction but tens of millions of Americans don't even take the standard deduction they choose to itemize their deductions so one replacement is inapplicable in a few years to kids of a few years old and the other is inapplicable to the millions of families that don't itemize their deductions but even if it is applicable to you you're losing for a family of five $2,100 roughly and what about a family of six a family of seven a family of eight another forty 150 dollars per child and they replace it with an increase in the standard deduction of twelve hundred dollars and a per child credit of six hundred dollars or $300 or absolutely zero if your kids are over age 16 and it's a few years from now next let's talk about moving expenses the current code says that you're working at a factory and it closes down and it's moving 100 miles 300 miles away and you have to move your home you have to find a new home to live in you get to deduct your moving expense they take that away but what do they leave if you own a factory and you shut it down and you move it to China all of the moving expenses are tax deductible so don't let them tell you they're taking away the moving expense deduction sure they're taking it away from individuals and employees but they are leaving the moving tax deduction for those who are moving their factories to China and of course they take away the student loan debt interest deduction so if you are investing in yourself or in a family member in education the interest deduction wiped off your tax return but if you're investing in a Chinese factory that suctions are there for you so they're not anti investment they're just anti investment in the skills and capacities of American workers next is the medical deduction you know there is a deduction for medical expenses it's available only to a few families with particularly large medical needs because you don't get the medical deduction unless your medical expenses unreimbursed medical expenses and thanks to the Affordable Care Act most people have at least decent insurance but you still have some medical expenses that are out-of-pocket if your out-of-pocket medical expenses exceed 10 percent of your income then to the extent of that excess you can take a deduction so if your out-of-pocket uncovered medical expenses are 13% of your income you can deduct the 3% that's not overly generous it's not even applicable to most families who needs it people with disabilities families with children with special needs people with cancer and other severe diagnoses that's who they target and they say well if you make some money and then you have to spend it dealing with medical services dealing with therapies for special needs children for disabled for cancer well just because you don't have the money because you had to spend it on medical services doesn't mean we can't tax you on the money and they do well there's another group of people with who are lucky enough to have extraordinary expenses and that is casualty losses so if you have a small fire or some small casualty you're not going to get a deduction the deduction applies only when your casualty losses exceed ten percent of your income and then only to the extent that they exceed 10% of your income we've had the wildfires in my state of California not to mention the Hurricanes in the Caribbean and there are people who are going to say well thank God if the disaster had to hit our community had hit us in 2017 because our casualty losses are deductible but what about the next disaster people with uninsured out of pocket losses exceeding 10% of their income will not get a deduction here's the Republican response they say look if it's an enormous disaster that happens to take your house and the CNN cameras are there then your congressional delegation can come beg for a special tax rule for those affected by that disaster well first what if your home burns down and CNN isn't there because it's not part of an enormous disaster it's just something that hits you in a couple of neighbors you'll never get his tests special tax provision right gonna write one for three or four people or 30 or 40 people or 80 or 90 people affected by a small brush fire but what if you are part of the next enormous catastrophe your congressional delegation will be here having to decide whether to bargain to give you a chance to take the same deduction that's been in the code since the 1950s or whether to bargain to try to get disaster relief to rebuild the infrastructure and the public assets in your community your congressional dickin get a delegation probably doesn't have enough clout to do both so which are they going to do it is clearly wrong and unfair to tax people on that portion of their income that they have to use to deal with in a truly extraordinary casualty loss ah but there's another provision this one hasn't been talked about much and that is the way in which they end up tax code provisions for inflation the there's some of the provisions they don't index at all so they say well you can take your property tax deduction and itemize it slowly the portion up to ten thousand dollars well ten thousand dollars sounds like a lot of money but they don't index it so what about ten years from now what about twenty years from now you say well I won't be in my house twenty years from now yes but the person you sell your house to will be there and if they say my god all the prices are higher all the wages are higher all taxes are higher at ten thousand dollar limit on property taxes means I basically can't deduct but half my property tax bill that will be factored into the price of your house so as to the things affecting home ownership no indexing everything that looks big now gets smaller and smaller every year as a result of inflation and oh by the way this tax bill is gonna cause more inflation but then there are other provisions where they say they're keeping the indexing but they change from CPI indexing to chained CPI indexing what does that mean it's a system for indexing the brackets less than would be if you just looked at the Consumer Price Index so you say well I'm only going to be in the twenty five percent bracket on this under this bill and as I get raises to just compensate me for inflation I'll still just be in the twenty five percent no you won't because what if you're fortunate your employer will adjust your wages for real inflation but the brackets are only going to increase for chained CPI we take away the state and local tax deduction first this is a departure as other provisions are from the concept that we should tax people based on their ability to pay if you make a certain salary and ten percent of it is taken out and used by your local and state governments than your ability to pay is the 90% of your salary you get to keep but they don't want to tax you on what you keep after state and local taxes they want to tax you on the money that has already been spent on taxes the effect of this is not just on the middle-class families who are gonna lose the tax deduction on their return and be taxed unfairly because if you read what is put out by the right-wing think tanks they say we know why we're pushing this state and local tax deduction elimination because that will create a political atmosphere where states like California and New York in New Jersey will slash the amount of money that they spend on things like public service Public Safety and education and so we won't just be affecting the people who are not taking the tax deduction we'll be turning to poorer families and lower middle-class families who depend upon public schools and we'll just cause a political situation where less money is spent on local education so this doesn't just affect those who it affects on their tax return this affects everyone who lives in the community now they as I've alluded to before take away a big chunk of the home mortgage deduction particularly to the person you'd sell your house to later so ah if you sell your house and God knows what the inflation rate will be it may be significant it may be five hundred thousand dollars doesn't sound like a whole lot of money then even though it does sound like a big chunk of money now I remember 150 thousand dollars for a home was thought to be a very high price so anyway the home mortgage deduction limited for that buyer to five hundred thousand dollars of mortgage and the property tax limited to ten thousand dollars of property tax what effect is this going to have on the ability to sell your home which in many parts of the country is your whole nest egg people in my part of the country pay a big mortgage payment every month and they have equity in their home and maybe they can retire because they've got twenty twenty-five percent equity in their home well yesterday before the Financial Services Committee we had testifying Mark Zandi one of the leading economists in this country who the head of the economics operation at Moody's Analytics and he said that in major metropolitan areas like the one I represent we're going to see a double-digit decline in home values as a result of this bill a lot of that is the limit on home mortgage deduction the and the property tax there are other elements of this bill that also adversely affect home prices double-digit decline and then what does that do to the community you may say I don't own a home I just work at a restaurant I live in an apartment who's going to be able to is gonna come to that restaurant and how big are they gonna tip if they've just been told you'll go to Zillow and they see the value of their home and oh my god we've seen a double-digit decline the whole community and so whether and this has affects folks from the New York metro area the Philly Philly metro area Los Angeles at San Diego Orange County in California you're sucking money out of the local economy and giving it to the federal government by taking away the state and local property tax deduction you're then slashing the value of homes double-digit decline what money is going to be in circulation to buy goods and services to support the entire regional economy this is going to hit like a hurricane even areas of the country that did not experience a hurricane now my party is so focused on the great unfairness of this bill the fact that it provides the bulk of its benefits to the top 5% even the top 1% the and that fact is hidden by the the by the the anomaly that most of the economic projections of this bill don't even look at the repeal of the estate tax they only look at the income tax provisions you can't just exclude a whole chunk of this tax bill in analyzing it but we as a party are so focused on the huge unfairness that we almost don't want to talk about the effect it will have on the overall national economy this isn't just an unfair bill this isn't just a bill that enriches the rich this is a deficit exploding outsource promoting job-killing growth reducing disaster for a nation's economy now you want to know the effect of huge tax cuts on on an economy look at Kansas they slash their taxes and now a Republican legislature is reversing it because of what that has done to tax receipts and to the Kansas economy but let's take a look and see what effect this is likely to have at the national level I turn to the Center for on Budget and Policy Priorities where they say that this tax cut is an ineffective way to spur economic growth and is likely to harm the economy if it adds to the deficit well what's the plan in the budget Republicans all voted for to deliberately use this tax cut to increase the deficit by one and a half trillion dollars but the Congressional Budget Office under Republican administration of this house and of this Congress says it's going to do 1.7 trillion dollars but they say well let's look at it more dynamically if you look more dynamically it's going to increase the is it by two or two-and-a-half trillion dollars because it raises interest rates it encourages offshore investment stripping economic growth out of the United States and for a host of reasons I'll get to the more you look at the tax cut the more apparent it is that it will cut economic growth and increase the deficit by even more than the 1.7 trillion dollars that the Congressional Budget Office during congressional Republican control of Congress the Congressional Budget Office is currently estimating why is this well first because incentives to invest in the tax code have little or no effect on private savings according to a Congressional Research Service report because the empirical evidence in numerous reports shows that the 2003 tax cuts had little impact on investment or employment now I speak with a little bit of experience here because I lived 20 years of my life in the tax world most of it right at the intersection of investment and tax law i sat with families and charged them a large amount per hour to describe what the latest tax law said and what investments what effect it would have on different investments and my experience as a CPA and tax attorney and certified tax law specialist by my State Bar was identical to that of Warren Buffett who said I've worked with investors for 60 years and I have yet to see anyone not even when capital gains rates were at thirty nine point nine percent or when they were fifteen percent as they are now I've never seen anyone shy away from a sensible investment because the tax rate on the potent because of the tax rate on the potential gain people invest to make money and potential taxes have never scared them off now that is why when you look at the effect of this bill you come to the conclusion as the Congressional Budget Office did in looking at the Bush tax cuts and whether to extend them or allow them to expire that if you have taxes and you use that money to pay the deficit that does more to help the economy it is more important to fight the deficit than it is to tell various families often at the very high end that they get a tax cut well let's look at American economic history I've designed this chart here and I focused only after the 1986 tax cut for which Ronald Reagan is famous there were many things about our economy back in the early 80s and the 70s and 60s that aren't relevant today we didn't have the trade policies back in the 70s that we have today so we look at the nineteen the Ronald Reagan 1986 tax policy as slightly adjusted by George HW Bush we look at the policies that we had I know the 86 tax law you think well that must have affected 86 no it really became effective in 88 so you look at 88 to 93 and you see that we had economic growth of 2.6 7% then in 1994 you see the effect of the Clinton tax policies adopted in 1993 and we see economic growth of well over 4% and these figures here are real economic growth per year adjusted for inflation 4.4 percent so then George W Bush gets elected and starting in 2001 his tax policies are adopted by this Congress and enacted into law and we see that economic growth is only one point seven percent now those Bush tax policies continued in force until 2013 because Democrats allowed them to stay in force until we finally adopted Obama tax policies in effective in 2013 those policies continue to be in force right up to today and the most recent statistics we have are up through September 30th of this year the economic growth under those policies has been 2.2 2% so what we've seen here is that when we adopt Republican economic policies and they become effective we have substantially lower economic growth than when we adopt democratic tax policies and we have and when Democrats actually pass those policies and have the guts to pass those policies and put them into law so you've got to admire the Republican Party they're able to get member after member after member to say without any proof that trickle-down economics works that have you just cut taxes you somehow up the economy doesn't matter if you can line up a hundred members to say the same falsehood at the same lectern in the same congressional Hall on the same House floor what matters is the real history and the real history is that the higher rates imposed under Democratic administrations have not just led to higher higher tax revenues they've led to higher rates of economic growth why is this well first and perhaps most important is having money available for business investment there's a pool of savings capital available in our markets and in our economy and the Republican proposal would come in and scoop 1.2 trillion dollars of that take it out of the markets take it out of the banks where it could be lent to small businesses take it out of the bond markets where it can be used for expansions by big business and just use it to pay for the tax cuts no wonder tax cuts that increase deficits hurt business investment and hurt the economy but there's more we then add to our national debt and the national debt is forever not only do we have the increase in the debt of 1.55 to 1.7 trillion dollars but that debt will be here not just 10 years from now it's there forever your great-grandchildren are going to be paying interest on that debt but then we have the international impact you see their proposal provides for a 0% tax 0% u.s. tax on any money made by any Factory as long as you move that factory abroad and if the wage rates are too high in China you can put it in Vietnam now they do in addition to saying you move your factory abroad you pay zero tax on all the manufacturing profits but um because because that manufacturing is being done abroad so we encourage moving the factory abroad the work is being done abroad we no tax but in addition what is an area of economic activity where Americans excel it is the creation of intellectual property while the manufacturing might be done abroad the design the patents the copyrights the trade names the marketing plans the trade secrets the intellectual property is created here but under this bill not only the profit you make on the foreign factory but the profit you make from all that intellectual property can pay almost zero percent American tax if you just take that patent and put it in a file in the Cayman Islands now I don't want to say that our current system for taxing international transactions is anything that we can be proud of the present system if you make money in that for in a US factory as a tax of thirty five percent you make in a foreign factory we also have a tax of thirty five percent but you can defer it so right now if you're just trying to decide where to put the factory you've got a tax in the United States that you actually have to pay and attacks on a factory abroad that you'll pay eventually well what do they do they take that 35% eventually tax and turn it into a zero percent forever tax how much more incentives could they could provide to move American factories overseas now the present system also has a problem in that you can defer tax only on the money you keep offshore so their solution is to say well bring it on shore will provide a little tiny tax on it and and then all the money you've made overseas last ten or twenty years no US tax and at least the money gets repatriated Democrats are anxious to work with Republicans on repatriation they could probably get a more Republican plan adopted than one that I would endorse in this speech but why not tax the unrep a tree ated money that way we would be saying bring that money back or don't bring it back you pay the same tax so you might as well bring it back what we can also do is move to worldwide unitary apportionment eliminate all the tax games and most of them are international eliminate all the reasons to move factories abroad and generate another trillion dollars every ten years for our Treasury that's the system that we ought to be moving to I'm not here to say our present system is wonderful I'm here to say that we should not adopt a Republican system because it moves us either further away from what would be a fair system that would not encourage offshoring another way in which were affected internationally is that this tax bill would change currency values change the exchange rate between the euro the yen the the Chinese currency rebbe and and other currencies around the world in a way that will encourage Americans to import and discourage those abroad from buying our products just another economic harm another economic harm is touted by the conservative supporters of this policy they say that by cutting taxes will get the federal government and state and local governments to spend less money on infrastructure and education well if you want to ask what is it that makes a country wealthier than others it's first and foremost the education of its workers and then second the infrastructure that's available to productive activity in addition as I mentioned before they're gonna cut the value of homes nationwide most pronounced in the major metropolitan areas what does that do to middle-class spending which drives our economy and it drives that middle-class spending down who's going to go out to a restaurant if you've just been told that you've had a double-digit decline in the value of your home this bill will also cause higher interest rates because the federal government is going to be borrowing another trillion and a half to 1.7 trillion dollars now so there is a difference between me and my party leadership they say that the main reason to vote against this bill is that it is unfair by giving huge tax breaks to the top one percent and increasing taxes for millions of American families I say you should vote against this bill because it's a deficit exploding outs or outsourcing promoting job-killing economic growth depressing bill but I think we'll agree whether you vote against this bill because it's unfair or you vote against this bill because it's bad for our economy you will be performing an important service to our country but let me not neglect let me not neglect the fact that if you vote that the bill isn't totally without being useful to somebody it will reduce taxes for the donald trump family by over 1 billion dollars in estate tax and tens of millions of dollars in income tax but maybe that's not enough for you look at what it will do for the koch brothers far more than it will do for the Trump family so if that's important to you if that's the result you want to achieve then vote for the bill by 2027 roughly a third of middle-class families will be paying more in taxes and that average family will be paying $1,300 more the personal exemption worth forty one hundred and fifty dollars per person in the family that's twenty one thousand for a family of five they take it away the moving expense deduction if you have to move to keep your job you don't get it I think you don't get to deduct that but if you move a factory to China you get to deduct all the moving expenses student loan debt they will let you deduct it as for the effect on simplicity my homeboys my CPA and tax law homeboys are going to be rolling in big dollars because just from the provisions that define the difference between personal service income passive income active business income the litigation and planning opportunities talk about complexity it's all there and my homeboys love it we can currently adduct extraordinary medical expenses that's important to those with this a disabilities and families with children with special needs they wipe it out the extraordinary casualty loss deduction they wipe out very important to people who face floods and fires they Olymp they change the rule so we don't have adequate indexing for inflation so everybody's pushed into a higher tax bracket by inflation except those at the very top they are protected but look at the effect on our nation's economy this is a job-killing deficit exploding growth reducing disaster look what happened to Kansas it's these policies have already devastated one of our states you're going to be taking a trillion and a half dollars out of the money available for business investment the federal government will come in and borrow all that money leaving less money for factories farms and homes and as Ron kind pointed out there's an extra eight hundred eight point eight eight hundred billion dollars of interest on top of that just the next ten years and keep in mind this increase in our debt is forever your grandchildren will be paying taxes on this debt look at the chart we had the policies of Ronald Reagan from 1988 when his 1986 law became effective through 1993 and we had two point six seven percent growth in 1994 we got Clinton tax policies we exploded over 4% annual growth then with George W Bush we dropped to 1.7 and then when we adopted Obama tax policies which are enforced today we're back up to two point two percent economic growth which policies give you economic growth the let's look internationally they say if you'd move a only you can manufacture and pay zero percent on the profits you earn by a factory but only but only if it's a foreign factory we can and finally mr. Zandi one of the top economists in the country testified before a Financial Services Committee that this bill means double digit declines in the value of homes in American metropolitan areas what effect does that have on the amount of time is excluded to go out and spend in the middle class when they're told that they are the equity in their home has been virtually wiped out so you can vote against our here or you can vote against this bill because it will be a crushing weight on our economy but don't engage in the fantasy that you can cut taxes and make it up for a quote economic growth

  JULY 22. I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE   THREE BILLS IN THIS RULE, H.R.   2467, THE PFAS ACTION ACT OF   2021.  H.R. 2668, THE CONSUMER  PROTECTION AND RECOVERY ACT. AND H.R. 3985, THE ALLIES ACT  OF 2021. H.R. 2467 WILL REQUIRE   COMPREHENSIVE REGULATION OF  PFAS UNDER OUR NATION'S  LANDMARK ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. PFAS COMPOUNDS, DANGEROUS  MAN-MADE CHEMICALS WHICH DO NOT  BREAK DOWN EASILY AND KNOWN AS   FOREVER CHEMICALS HAVE   CONTAMINATED OUR WATER, SOIL,  AND AIR FOR DECADES. THE C.D.C. ESTIMATES THAT  NEARLY EVERY AMERICAN HAS BEEN   EXPOSED TO THEM, ESPECIALLY OUR  BRAVE FIREFIGHTERS, SERVICE  MEMBERS, AND THEIR FAMILIES. IN MY HOME STATE OF NORTH  CAROLINA, WE KNOW THIS ISSUE   TOO WELL.  CHEMICAL COMPANIES HAVE  POLLUTED THE CAPE FEAR RIVER   WITH PFAS FOR YEARS. TEST OF DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS   IN MY DISTRICT, INCLUDING RAL  LEE AND CARY, HAVE DETECTED  PFAS.  THIS BILL WOULD ACCOMPLISH   MULTIPLE GOALS, INCLUDING  DIRECTING THE E.P.A. TO  ESTABLISH STANDARDS TO PROTECT   OUR DRINKING WATER FROM  CONTAMINATION AND AUTHORIZING  GRANTS TO DRINKING WATER   UTILITIES TREATING PFAS  CONTAMINATION. SOME UTILITIES ARE ALREADY   INVESTING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS  TO UPGRADE THEIR WATER   TREATMENT TECHNOLOGY.  I WAS PROUD TO OFFER A   BIPARTISAN AMENDMENT WITH  CONGRESSMAN ROUZER TO CLARIFY  REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS GRANT  PROGRAM. HELPING TO ENSURE THAT   COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ALREADY   INVESTING MONEY TO ADDRESS THIS  PROBLEM CAN STILL BENEFIT FROM   THE FUNDING INCLUDED IN THIS   BILL.  H.R. 2467 IS A STRONG STEP   FORWARD TO PROTECT THE HEALTH  OF OUR WATER, AIR, SOIL, AND   OUR PEOPLE.  AND I'M

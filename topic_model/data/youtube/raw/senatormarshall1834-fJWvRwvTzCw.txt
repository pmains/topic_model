but Emma Speaker I'm horribly disappointed and ashamed that today taxpayers remain the top funding source for America's abortion leader Planned Parenthood as an obstetrician and gynecologist I've delivered thousands of babies from Kansas and I dedicated my career to protecting the sanctity of life and I firmly and wholeheartedly believe that life begins at conception there are countless stories that I could share today and I can tell you that some of the children I delivered are now in college some are star athletes some are leaders at the church and in their communities and some are at the top of their class they're nurses and soldiers doctors and pharmacists police officers and teachers clergy and judges and perhaps most importantly many are now moms and dads themselves I know these stories because as I travel throughout Kansas I see the moms the moms I've delivered and I see their children and they're now adults leading their own lives but what no one on this earth can do is tell this is it the babies that were aborted and given no chance to share their gifts with the world

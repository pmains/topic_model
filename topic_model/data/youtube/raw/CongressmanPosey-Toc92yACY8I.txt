today just speak about the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 I can remember sitting class with the teacher discussing president john f kennedy's speech about why go to the moon at rice university in 1961 when he committed this country to putting a man on the moon and bring him safely back to earth within the decade he said great nations do things not because they're easy but because the hod and it certainly was hard I remember doing the math of my fingers and saying you know I'm gonna be old enough to be involved in that program and my goal became to have my fingerprints on the rocket that took the first man to the moon make a long story short five years later I was an inspector working on the third stage of the Apollo rocket one of the highlights of my life Americans were united in those days in their zeal for space the Apollo moon landing being the greatest technological advancement in the history of mankind some writers is to scroat describe those times as a Camelot era where people respected their president even if they didn't vote for him not since 9/11 have I seen America's as United as they were around the Apollo program space of course is important to our national security it's important to our economic prosperity it's important to our technological advancement I asked people how often they benefit from space and the response usually averages six percent say they benefit from space once a year four percent said a beneficial in space once a month and only two percent say they benefits a space once a week and we won't even go to once a day and I guess those people have roosters in the backyard to give them their their weather reports you know they don't pay any attention to the images we have from the satellites I guess they don't use cellphones or use credit cards or even make cash transactions because those are all satellite-linked and ultimately spaces is important to us for the ultimate survival of our species Neil deGrasse Tyson lectured our Science Space and Technology Committee several years ago on the benefits of space and while he was here he gave a lecture for staff and members over at the Jefferson buildings library Congress very well attended and well taken and during his presentation he mentioned that space is the only thing Congress really spends money on to truly benefit the next generation and I believe that I believe those are trees that we plant without the expectation of being around to enjoy all the shade I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle on the Science Space and Technology Committee for helping keep space a bipartisan issue I hope we can build on the legacy of Apollo 11 and that someday our children and their children can come together and enjoy positive achievements for their generation and generations to follow thank Mr Speaker I yield back

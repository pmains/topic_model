Thank You mr. chairman well thank senator Cornyn for that terrific introduction and I want to likewise add my words of introduction both for Jeff Brown and Brantley Starr you know I think there is little if anything that is more important that the president is doing this committee is doing than nominating and confirming strong principled constitutionalist to serve on the federal bench to protect the constitutional rights of Texans and all Americans and to follow the rule of law and and I am confident that both of these nominees will will honor their oath and and carry through on that task with extraordinary distinction let me start with justice brown justice brown and I have known each other for three decades we met when we were at Baker Botts in Houston where both summer associates together it happened to be a blessed summer because both in 94 and 95 the Houston Rockets won the NBA championship and Baker Botts represented the Rockets and so we were blessed to go to an awful lot of those games having the the happy coincidence of being summer associates the two two years the Rockets were world champions Jeff graduated from the University of Houston Law Center with high honors serving as an editor of the Law Review he then clerked for the Texas Supreme Court first for justice Jack Hightower and then for then justice Greg Abbott he returned to Baker Botts where he became a skilled trial lawyer trying a dozen jury trials in the years there Jeff likely would have continued becoming quite the trial lawyer if not for Governor Rick Perry selecting him for the Texas bench in 2001 Jeff began his judicial service at just 31 years old taking the trial bench in Harris County for six years in his time there he presided over 100 jury trials over a hundred 1/2 judge of the Year awards and was widely admired by both the Houston and the Texas bars governor Perry Ella Jeff to the Texas 14th Court of Appeals in Houston in 2007 where again Jeff was named judge of the year governor Perry took notice again now an elevated Jeff to the Texas Supreme Court in 2013 he is only the fourth person in history to clerk on the Texas Supreme Court and to serve as a justice there and and as Senator Cornyn observed we have if I'm counting right to two of his colleagues on the Texas Supreme Court Chief Justice Hecht and in justice Guzman and a former colleague of his judge Willett who or you used to be justice Willett and is now judge Willett I do hope you have not left justice behind although the title has changed and so that is a testament to the respect his colleagues hold for him that they have come up to be here for his confirmation hearing likewise Brantly star is someone I've known for over two decades who has an extraordinary legal background and I think will make a extraordinary district judge Brantley a native of Abilene Texas graduated from Abilene Christian University summa laude in 2001 and he then attended the University of Texas School of Law Brantley and I first met when he was a law student and he was the editor in chief of the Texas review of law and politics say a Law Review at UT that I've served on the board of advisors for for more than a decade and in fact Brantley was editor-in-chief of trope as it is called the year that the journal chose as their jurist of the year another extraordinary lawyer Senator John Cornyn and indeed Senator Cornyn gave a speech that that that that earned a standing ovation from the law students and immediately after senator Cornyn brently gave the speeches the editor in chief and and he had big shoes to fill but remarkably Brantley as as a law student gave a speech that likewise and a standing ovation including from then senator Cornyn and so when Brantley returned I said that's pretty remarkable that that you you've gotten a US Senator give you a standing ovation that doesn't happen too often Brantley then came to work at the Texas Solicitor General's Office at the time I was SG and so I was proud to hire Brantley we worked work together he did a tremendous job he continued working for my successor as SG Jim Howe who is also a judge on the Fifth Circuit so Brantley has has known his way around the judicial circuits he spent several years in private practice at King & Spalding and then he returned to work for justice Eva Guzman who was who is here today as I mentioned earlier and then when Ken Paxton became Texas Attorney General he recruited Brantley ironically enough to fill Don Willits old spot in the AG's office and and Brantley had been Don's very first law clerk on the Texas Supreme Court I would note that Don did text me when when Brantley was nominating lamenting how damn old he felt to see his law clerks being nominated to the federal bench and I had to concur you you are pretty damn ahold both of these nominees I am proud the president made the nominations I'm proud to support to stand with Senator Cornyn and supporting these nominations and I'm confident that they will do honor to the role of federal district judge thank you thank you

I know the new tax law pretty well. 
Anson Avery does the taxes for hundreds of people and businesses in Spokane. Avery says there's a good reason why
business is booming in Spokane, the federal tax cuts. When you cut taxes, you
put more money in the hands of people that are hiring other people and making
decisions. We're a third generation family business. Companies looking to hire more
workers now find themselves having to be more competitive.
We're so active now our problem is getting steady and quality labor. I believe in the promise of America. A key benefit for small business is the ability to write off investments at a
greater rate. Contractors and manufacturers have seen an immediate impact finding good guys and paying the ones we have to stick around It's nice to know that someone's fighting for us. Overall, business in Spokane has
increased over ten percent in just the last year. Local experts say it's because
of the tax cuts and the business legislation that was championed by
Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers. And it cuts taxes mostly for the middle
class and so the people saying it's for the rich they haven't read the law or
they haven't studied it. As a Democrat I recognize that this is a very divisive time and I look at what's causing the divisiveness and it's not Cathy. With Cathy, I'm always confident that her votes going to be in favor of small
business and I don't believe that Lisa Brown has read the new tax law but I do believe that Cathy McMorris Rogers wrote it and she was a part of the team. And so
for me, on if it's an issue of taxes Cathy gets my vote.

what i want to ask about something that's going to expire at the end of next week and that is this proxy voting scheme that's been going on since may of last year and and from what the majority had presented when this got created was the reason that proxy voting was there is because we had a pandemic and things were shut down and people had trouble getting around and maybe were concerned about the virus and not wanting to leave maybe their home or their local community obviously now with with a vaccine readily available for for any american who wants to take it with more states opening up and you're seeing even here in congress many committees that were not having in-person hearings are now getting back to in-person hearings so what i would ask the gentleman is when proxy voting expires in july on july 3rd can we let congress get back to the normal work and not renew proxy voting because as we've seen there's a lot more cooperation a lot more agreements you can reach when you're here in person working together that you just can't get on a zoom or webex call or just somebody standing at home proxy voting and not coming here to washington when now everyone who wants to can come and you know we've looked at uh what what this has done it's it's hurt the institution in in our opinion but there are six democrats who since this got started last year have never come to vote in person except for the vote for speaker the house because that is a vote that you cannot cast by proxy and so if they were able to get here for the vote for speaker in january yet on every other vote have not cast a single vote in person then declare it's not because they have no ability to get to washington and it feels like there's an abuse of this proxy voting that's shown it needs to end and i don't know if there's a if there's an expectation next week that the majority would renew this we would urge strongly that we let it expire on july 3rd and then get back to the work that we do in person

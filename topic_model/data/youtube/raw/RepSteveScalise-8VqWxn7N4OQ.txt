fox news getting this exclusive look at the day-to-day challenges that these agents continue to face we are on board for a ride-along it happened last night with the national border patrol council and a delegation led by house republican whip steve scalise all of this as we learn more about the cost of caring for migrant children in u.s custody brand new numbers showing the federal government is now spending at least 60 million dollars a week john to house them that's a lot of money we've got team coverage arizona sheriff mark daniels met with homeland security secretary alejandra mayorkas yesterday the sheriff will join us in just moments he's got a lot to say but we begin with alex hogan she is live on the border in mission texas for us to kick things off hi alex hi sandra hi john so we just got off a boat with texas dpf and dps and of course we are here with this delegation 10 congressmen who are here to talk about what they're seeing on the border we have a live drone that we can give you an aerial view of this part of the country right now we are seeing thousands of migrants last month alone 172 000 people crossed the border into the u.s 19 000 children and last night we were able to go out with border patrol and they showed us the ins and outs of what they see every single day of course all of these congressmen and women were there with us and we do have a statement from steve scalise who is the house republican whip and he says that this is happening every single day if you're not heartbroken by that you don't realize the devastating impact that this is having on people and these stories calling on the president to come down himself now we were out there last night with border patrol initially it was dark we were there for about three hours in the middle of the night and without the lights on it was pitch black but we were able to hear people in the forest in the weeds we stopped and there was a group they were actually all strangers who'd banded together for solidarity in numbers there was a 17 year old i talked with he was crying his whole goal was just to make it to north carolina to eventually find his mother he had been traveling for one month taking trains and boats and walking doing whatever he could he had scratches all over his body that actually found a seven-year-old girl who was traveling by herself and they brought her in on their group just to be able to protect her eventually when they got there last night he asked me which way is america he didn't even realize he had made it to u.s soil so those were his first steps after arriving here in the u.s in his first conversations eventually figuring out that he had made it again a very tearful moment but this is just the sad reality of what we're seeing here every single day on the border that these children they're caught in the crossroads it's not the politics that they're facing but it's rather the desire to be with their family we know that 80 percent of the cases of children who are in u.s facilities they do have at least one relative and 40 percent of them that relative is their parent or guardian sandra john alex when you go out with texas dps on those gun boats what's their perspective obviously these are state agencies what's their perspective on how the federal government is dealing with this so what we're hearing from them pretty much across the board is people are frustrated they feel overwhelmed they thought that february was a lot then they thought march was a lot and now they're seeing even more so they're excited that people are here especially some of the congressmen they're actually holding a presser right now to talk about the issues that they need help with but on the other hand they do feel cautiously optimistic hopeful that something will change but not certain at this point because so far what we've seen is just the numbers continue to increase i will say however they've all expressed sadness for these children because they realize these are not kids who are waking up and deciding to do this journey by themselves but rather being told to do it or thinking based on other people's reaction that they will be able to do this safely and this is not a safe journey for children we've seen them arrive with injuries and and much worse so the idea that they can do this trip and be reunited without any danger or violence along the way is not an idea that these agents and dps are hoping that is continued to be shared quick last question for you alex and by the way as you were talking you don't see this anywhere else our fox flight team really giving that overview um that that that drone view of mission texas we've got these along the border right now and then there was that look at the border that we got from steve scalise leading that delegation last night take us a little bit more inside of what we're seeing with these images uh there they he led the delegation in with flashlights we know that he spoke with a sense of urgency at the number of children in just a matter of minutes every few minutes the number of children that they were seeing the rafts that were coming over when scalise was talking about this you got the sense of urgency when then he called and railed on the current administration for not getting down there well you can't look at these images and not picture children that you know children that are those similar ages and imagining them do that at the exact same age and do that without any guardianship any supervision or any protection out there alone in the woods again there's no street lights in there the people that we saw the children were walking hoping they would run into someone so eventually they ran into us while we were out there again i think this was an emotional moment for some of the people who were able to see this alongside of us it's something you can see in video but experiencing it and having these conversations with people a very devastating and that's exactly what they felt good stuff alex really appreciate your reporting from there we'll continue to uh to check back in with you thank you alex thanks you know the problems of the border differ depending on what area of the country that you're in you know there are similarities across the entire southern border but you know sometimes problem with drug smuggling is is bigger in one area uh people coming across the border is a bigger problem in some of the other areas let's bring in cochise county arizona sheriff mark daniels a big stretch of his uh his county is right there along the border just east of tucson he met with homeland security secretary mayorkas during his visit to the border yesterday sheriff daniels joins us now what did you tell the secretary yesterday uh sheriff daniels well hello john hello sandra thanks for having me again myself and a handful of border sheriffs and sheriffs from national and also western sheriffs convened in el paso texas yesterday to speak with secretary of orches it was a very candid conversation it was very passionate driven and i'll just share with you there was frustration to include myself that was shared with the secretary for the lack of intervention the lack of an active plan and we challenged up the secretary to work with sheriffs i asked the secretary to meet with us once a week whether that's virtual in person or through zoom that we need to be working together to solve this you can't ignore us right you provided us with some pictures uh just a little while ago of some of what you're seeing down there as i mentioned at the top of this the problems with the borders sometimes differ there are common problems but you also get different problems depending on which area of the border you're in this is pictures of drug cartel smugglers these are pictures of the cartel smuggling people into the united states and what's unique on john is the fact that they they're outfitted the exact same way from the water bottles the blanket the camouflage they're outfitted before they even enter the us that shows how organized how coordinated their efforts are that's smuggling in my county almost a daily basis all right one thing that i was interested to read in just the last few hours is that you you were a member of the homeland security advisory committee uh you were appointed back in 2018 you were suddenly removed from that uh that council as were all of the other members what's that about well there were 29 members removed and and this was addressed yesterday and i won't go into detail we're in closed doors on this but i shared my frustration with that this is a nonpartisan committee that was appointed by different administrations throughout the year since 2002 29 people first time ever in history that these hsac members homeland security advisory council members were removed in mass even removed um and the only thing i could think of with everything i've seen and i brought this up is it's political it's truly political and now in fairness to the secretary he's trying to restructure this time will tell this goes forward he wants to get back into the community with it which i support 100 time will tell with action if that comes true sheriff daniels you've been very outspoken about the problems of the border in your county in particular do you think that that had something to do with it well one could wonder truly and that was the first thing that came to my mind my letter on march 26 when i received the letter stated from the secretary it was an honor to address you second paragraph it terminated me from my my appointment in washington dc so i thought the application of dismissal was poor i i didn't believe that we're there to help and help this country not on a political base but on a public safety base so yeah it was uh one could think that and uh and conclude that thanks very much for your service don't let the door hit you in the you-know-what on your way out uh you know we talked with brandon judd who's the president of the national border patrol council earlier today he sees a real uh disparity between the outrage from the left during the trump administration to what was going on in the border compared to what we see now listen to what he told us earlier today they're deplorable conditions and it makes me sick that under the trump administration there were politicians that were yelling and screaming about kids in cages yet we're putting these kids in the same exact facilities and you and it's mom they don't say anything that lets you know that this is politics it doesn't it doesn't matter how these kids are what the condition these kids are under it's politics and that's disgusting sheriff daniel's just a few seconds left here is there a double standard do you think here in terms of voicing outrage about what we're seeing on the border exactly i agree with mr judy's good friend of mine uh this is the theater i've said that before and i'll say it again on the backs of humanitarian and public safety all right sheriff daniels good to talk to you again we'll catch up with you again soon

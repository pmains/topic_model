good evening thank you for joining us for our community conversation on flood mitigation and recovery my name is shirley martinez and i'm the district director for congresswoman lizzie fletcher the congresswoman and our panelists will give opening remarks and then we will move to questions and answers on the bottom of the screen is a q a which you can click to add your question to the queue again thank you for joining us and i will now hand it over to our host congresswoman fletcher thank you so much shirley thanks to everyone who is with us tonight especially our panelists and hello to everyone in texas seven who is joining us tonight virtually for our community conversation um if you can't tell already um i sound a little different tonight because i have lost my voice this week um and this is the first thing i've really said since monday which is a real challenge in this job um so i'm gonna keep my remarks very brief um and then turn it over to ben jackson who is our district's uh deputy chief of staff and legislative director he's been on our team since day one and he's actually been working in congress longer than i have so we're really lucky to have him um helping lead the efforts for our office and he's worked extensively on so many of the issues on flood mitigation um projects and all the things we're going to talk about tonight so he's going to give a brief congressional update that i would ordinarily give before my voice goes out but i want to thank you all for being here and i really want to thank our panelists who joined us again um this was the very first community conversation that we did first town hall in my first year in office many of you who are with us tonight were there and have been every year since um at what has become an annual event to talk about one of the most important issues in our district um and we're lucky to be joined again tonight by several of the people who have worked so well so collaboratively with our texas and congressional team since day one so i'm really excited tonight to be joined by colonel tim vale the galveston district commander for the u.s army corps of engineers um and with him tonight lieutenant colonel rhett blackman who is the incoming galveston district commander for the corps he will take over command from colonel vale this summer we will be very sad to see colonel vale go um but we know he's going to stick around here in houston so looking forward to seeing how we can work with him next and very excited to work with colonel blackman on these projects moving forward uh he's not here in houston yet so it is a real um testament to the um the importance of the work for our district that he's joining us tonight in advance of taking command um and i'm just really excited for him to hear from people in our district about our concerns and about how we work together to solve the problems that we face here we also have a familiar face to many alan black who is the director of engineering and construction for harris county flood control who's been a terrific partner and of course uh steve costello the chief recovery officer for city of houston who's been with us since the beginning as well um and who was really uh the source of a lot of the good ideas that we have had in congress and the work that we've done and been able to do for our district so um each of the each of the leaders that are assembled here tonight on our panel have an important perspective to bring to our discussion um and a lot of updates so we will get right right to it i'm so grateful to all of you for being here with us um and for your ongoing collaboration um since since we got here um so i'm looking forward to hearing your updates for uh the seventh congressional district and also i'm excited to turn it over to ben um and and have him share some of the the great news that we have um for our district uh especially in this first quarter of the year so ben i will hand it over to you and thanks so much for for doing the update and thanks again to everybody for being here thank you congresswoman whether introducing legislation to increase the speed of disaster mitigation or recovery projects or delivering federal funding for water infrastructure projects flood mitigation efforts are always top of mind for everyone in our office there are many ways we have worked to do this over the years and i'm glad to give you an update from our team last month at the congresswoman's request congress appropriated nearly 10 million dollars for the meyer grove detention basin which will be constructed just inside the 610 loop at north braisewood this project will provide significant protection for the meyerland area this is what's called a community-funded project a new process this last year for members of congress to apply for funding for projects in their districts i'm glad to report to you that every project we requested was funded and meyer grove is a great example of the program it's a great example of our partnership with the city of houston and harris county to identify and support projects together another water infrastructure project the congresswoman requested that congress funded this year for 782 000 was federal funding to improve water distribution and wastewater collection in bel air the funding will be used to continue the progress already made in addressing the deficient water line infrastructure along street blocks in the belayer community in keeping with the prioritization of water infrastructure projects the congresswoman also requested and secured six hundred and twenty four thousand and eight hundred and thirty five dollars to replace water lines for approximately 55 homes on seattle street in jersey village the entire street will receive new storm sewer lines that will help remove rain from streets and hold it in larger storm water pipes to help prevent street flooding and reduce the chance of home flooding to succeed we need to work together to strengthen existing systems while implementing new projects and smart policies another area of constant work for us in the ongoing recovery and mitigation projects in the buffalo bio watershed our community has shown overwhelming support for the study of underground tunnels to alleviate the potential for flooding along buffalo bayou our office has worked to facilitate the extension of the buffalo bayou tributaries and resiliency study to make sure our community community's needs and priorities are heard the army corps of engineers worked with our office and approved additional funds last year to allow an extension of the study which will enable the core to continue studying underground tunnels as a potential water conveyance solution i'll let the core discuss more of the work relating to the study and also the coastal texas study project to protect our region and our country from catastrophic catastrophic damage from storm surge on the texas coast the congresswoman testified before congress this year on the importance of authorizing the coastal texas study in this year's water resources development act and has also testified about the importance of funding for the coastal resiliency projects we have been working on these issues since day one our entire team is grateful for the input of the community members on these matters including all of you who have joined our conversation tonight and for the work and the partnership of our panelists with that in mind i will turn it over to the panelists for an update on their work and then we'll turn to questions submitted through the q a feature and starting with colonel vale now thanks ben and thanks congresswoman it's it's a pleasure to be here with your constituents and with this esteemed uh what i consider a group of collaborators um yet again i just said to everybody there's just no there's no greater sense of reward and accomplishment than collaborating with the individuals that are going to be speaking with tonight between the federal the state the county and the city i just think this is just a wonderful team trying to find a way to yes of just about every potential solution to all these challenges that we face and particularly in harris county where we deal with largely what i consider some of the most challenging flood risk reduction kind of problem sets that we face anywhere in the nation let's speak from experience of somebody who's worked largely everywhere in the nation the these are the toughest challenges of the before the court of engineers and the state the county and the city and we're just proud that we're working seamlessly together to try and find the right solutions with that i think i'll talk specific to buffalo bayou first and foremost as it stands last week we're supposed to conduct a an agency milestone called the attendance plan we gonna we were gonna release what our kind of plan was and at that point in time based on the extension of analysis that you would ask the community to ask for the congresswoman supported that we received from from the administration we were able to continue to evaluate the study and at this point in time right before the tentatively selected plan we had determined and we have determined that from a cost benefit perspective tunnels are indeed a better solution set than the channel expansion um so that is a direct i would consider it victory to open the core opening itself up to receive really the valuable valuable feedback throughout this process so for the first time largely in the history of buffalo bayou we're recognizing the solution set that is not um potentially channel expansion and that should be news news and somewhat from our feedback something that should be celebrated from a large swath of the constituents um at the same time though the cost-benefit situation even with the tunnels leads us to a new a new way of looking at things that we're trying to do for the core of engineers we want to participate in the solution very much but to do so we have to the cost of a tunnel system uh particularly from addison barker reservoir all the way to the ocean is largely going to be in the magnitude in excess of 6 billion so largely what our challenges is to find quantify in a measurable way benefits that kind of meet that cost of 6 billion dollars now the framework that the court traditionally uses to say hey the citizens of iowa want to be part of this solution the federal interest for all 50 states in terms of delivering this solution set traditionally comes from a very direct analysis of of of what this solution set would actually prevent in terms of damage to infrastructure what we recognize is when we evaluate damage to infrastructure we leave the most probably the most critical component of infrastructure out of the equation and that's people we evaluate the structures that are going to be inundated and we put a general valuation in terms of what the impact of those homes are in the flood but we don't really evaluate the people that live in those homes and how they contribute to broader society um into a larger economy so we're trying to expand the way we quantify benefits so that we can come up with what i consider the term parity at least a one-to-one ratio in terms of benefits to cost and to do so harris county flood control district has really helped us along the way so what we've asked to do is stop the clock you know we're underneath this congressional timeline um in administration timeline to complete the study but we want to get those benefits right that really consider the expanded economic opportunities and costs associated with flooding and the other societal effects of flooding and really chart new territory for the corps of engineers in terms of how we propose recommendations to our policymakers in congress to really evaluate you know federal participation in a solution set so as a result we've gotten approval from the administration for the federal government to put a pause on where we're at from the engineering solution set so that harris county flood control district can continue to to do its comprehensive what we call a comprehensive benefits analysis largely to get us as close to parity as possible so that policy makers can see the whole suite of benefits that are typically uh that would be associated with delivering a tunnel solution set now how long that pause lasts really comes down to how much time it's going to take to get for harris county flood control district to do the analysis and make the right arguments to policymakers at such time that that analysis is done and we've convinced policymakers that we're as close we're close enough to parity to to move the project to completion we'll move the project to completion and provide that final the first the draft the draft solution and environmental impact statement and then a final solution environmental impact statement um so largely i'll i'll use alan to talk about comprehensive benefits a little bit further and give you an idea of where we're going um but there's all sorts of opportunity for continued constituents participation to help broaden the horizon how we traditionally measure the benefits of flood risk reduction projects along the way so i open that up to everyone um you can engage me you can engage allen black um it's it's a worthwhile effort and i'm really excited about it because we just brought the assistant secretary of the army down to attucks and barca reservoir he said specifically this is what the court should be doing so with that alan and alan black in the harris county foot control district for myself are very excited to have his his level of support for for being the first in the nation to try and really present comprehensive benefits in a different manner um and i think it's largely what people have been asking for for the army for quite some time so it's good to be kind of the first to show in that that regard even though it's taking us longer to kind of chart new territory than we had hoped um we are charting in territory with an eye towards getting a yes at the end of the day secondly i bring up coastal texas so coastal texas largely the single largest engineering recommendation ever proposed from the army corps of engineers to the united states congress under the army civil works program is we're waiting on congressional authorization we believe that we've got wide support for congressional authorization i can't speak to what the ultimate vulcan congress is going to be ahead of this year's water resource development act but the reason is there's reason to be optimistic based on just the amount of support we received from members of congress to include congresswoman fletcher at the same time our goal is to move forward with the study we're able to move forward with the study into the next phase called pre-construction engineering design we're able to do that even prior to congressional authorization now that next phase of the the next phase of that project is to deliver the the first set of plans and specifications for the first contract that we award underneath that 30 billion program now that first contract that we we would award would be the ecosystem restoration project for fallouts islands um with our non-federal sponsor the texas general land office so our focus there is to complete pre-construction engineering design as soon as humanly possible either using funding that we find available within fy in this current fiscal year or funding that we we get in in next year next fiscal year but to move forward with the texas general land office and deliver that first set of plans and specs because what that'll do is it'll move us out of the investigations phase into the construction phase and once you're in the construction phase then you're going to see kind of large large pieces of money at a time to deliver coastal texas um so at the same time what we would do in the construction phase as early as 2023 is spend about a million dollars to bring the best and brightest nationally and internationally together to figure out how exactly we need to design and ultimately construct and deliver the gate structures from bolivar island to the existing galveston so that would be the largest feature of the texas project we want to spend a million dollars to get the design acquisition strategy and the approach for getting that uh right we want to do that next year um and we're prepared to do that next year um and then quite honestly it takes about five years to design that construction and the fastest anything of that size and magnitude has ever been constructed by has been about 12 years so the clock's kind of ticking for us because we want to face the next storm for sure um so we're moving with a sense of purpose um with the firm commitment from our inaugural sponsors to go you know built first protection district and the texas general land office but every we overcome every obstacle we find a way to deliver this because it's important for the nation to develop in that regard um i think there's a lot going on um i think i'll probably hold it there and make room in time for your feedback and or questions um particularly if there's questions i'm here throughout the meeting if you want to address quickly or any other of the uses projects or activities other than that i'll turn it back over to you great thank you colonel vale uh we'll now go to mr allen black with harris county flood control well good evening everyone and thank you for having me here here uh congresswoman fletcher it's my privilege really appreciate the invitation i hope you start to get your voice back soon um colonel i really couldn't have said a lot that better myself we get things done through collaboration so thanks to you all for your partnerships on getting things done uh but but and congresswoman fletcher you've already mentioned it but i have to give you another shout out for the the a big thank you for the 10 million dollars for the uh the meyer grove storm water detention basin uh using fy 22 funds we're always excited i you know me i like to say every hole in the ground's a good hole in the ground especially when it's a hole in the ground the braves bayou watershed so we're excited to be able to get our hands on those funds and start putting them to uh to work for for the residents embrace now the the flood control district bond program projects that we have ongoing in the seventh district they all continue at a rapid pace you know we look at things in the near term to start we're wrapping up the braves federal project another great partnership with the corps of engineers 480 million dollars over the last 20 years finally coming to an end and frankly we plan to celebrate that come this summer so we're looking forward to that uh we've got a number of partnerships all around the area looking at what we can do to make things better we've just wrapped up a partnership in the city of bel air looking at some some flood risk reduction efforts there we've got a study that for a little while was kind of on pause over near gesner and i-10 looking at some of the tributaries that that drain into the buffalo bayou watershed well the finally the timing is finally coming into alignment with some complementary efforts that the city of houston is working on some of which actually also is receiving some of those federal community funding projects uh that that we're all looking forward to we've got a massive undertaking in the attucks embarker reservoir watersheds to restore design capacity to all those channels flowing into the reservoirs and all this work it does more and more to reduce the risk of flooding for our residents one of the other things we're looking forward to is the opportunity to potentially expand uh excavation within the attics and barca reservoirs uh flood control district is working with the corps of engineers as is the wilford drainage district so hopefully we can see some dirt flying out of those reservoirs maybe even as soon as later this year i do have to to give my public service announcement of course if you live in harris county you are at risk for flooding year round not just during hurricane season so please we encourage you all to consider buying flood insurance now we also keep our eyes on the horizon what are the projects beyond the bond program because a five billion dollar bond program is a great start but in harris county the need is so much greater that's why as a colonel mentioned we are working closely with them on the bbtrs the buffalo bayou tributaries and resiliency study but we've also got a locally led study of large storm water diet a large diameter storm water tunnels it has tremendous potential not just in the buffalo bayou watershed which is where we're using kind of as our as our jumping as our springboard but also across the entire county we want to effectively expand that study and kind of merge it in with the bbtrs effort to to federalize that concept of a county-wide system of tunnels it won't come cheap and as the the colonel mentioned the the benefits that need to be captured to show that these are good projects goes well beyond the benefit cost ratio which is what has typically been used to justify federal investments to really start to capture those comprehensive benefits of a system of tunnels and a simple way of looking at some of those additional benefits is think about you know we would normally just capture the the avoided damages of a home that flooded but there's so much more that happens after a flood it takes a person a week or two weeks or three weeks to get back to work sometimes they can't get back to work to allow other people to get back to the work you know teachers need to be able to get back to school so the kids can go to school so their parents can go to work those are the sorts of comprehensive benefits that we're working to capture and show why truly this is a project and these are good projects that will work across the county these are the sorts of analyses that align with the priorities of congresswoman fletcher of congress and of the president of the united states we look forward to continuing that partnership with the corps with the city of houston i'm going to turn it over to steve here in a minute but again thank you for having me here tonight thanks for your time and i look forward to this conversation thank you alan uh you know so we're now going from the much larger projects to what i would call regional projects with flood control to more specific projects with the city of houston and i i want the viewers to understand the significance of what colonel vale just described in terms of the federal requirements of benefit to cost because we have all in my entire career looked at that and thought that it was not an equitable approach to justifying projects and i still have projects that i'm using federal resources for right now and i still have to comply with the current benefit to cost approach to all of our projects so i'm going to briefly just talk about three projects that impact the residents within uh the district and i think they're significant the first one which is really on the on the lower east side of the district on buffalo bayou which is our north canal project it is a hazard mitigation grant project funded by fema with partners with harris county flood control district the city of houston txdot and the local tours which is memorial heights we have finished our preliminary engineering analysis we're in the process of doing some environmental testing before we move on to final design it's an exciting project it's one of the marquee projects that the mayor is really really considering a concern and it impacts buffalo bayou from right at downtown all the way up past shepard drive and then on white oak bayou all the way up into the uh actually all the way up past i-10 up to 11th street so it's an exciting project that's going to benefit a lot of people out there the other project that is another hazard mitigation grant project funded by fema which allen was to early over in the memorial city area is our subterranean detention basin uh working with tours seven and it's a it's a very interesting project it's a subterranean detention base and we'll be routing drainage coming off of the memorial city mall area into a subterranean detention basin to provide protection to the people that live along the guests in a corridor and also allow flood control to then proceed on with their project that they're looking on as well so that's where we're collaborating the the one project that i think is really unique that is not really federally funded and what it is it's uh i call it the rafino landfill site and it really impacts the residents of bel air and west weshu a rufino is a landfill that's owned by the resident owned by the city of bel air and west hue and it's located in 59 in beltway 8 area in the keegan's bayou watershed and it's really unusual it's an abandoned landfill with inside the city limits of houston and so we're working with flood control district to figure out a way to convert that landfill to a regional detention basin to accommodate future expansion of keegan's bayou to provide flood protection complementary to the raised by you federal project upstream so we're really excited about that project how it helps the city of bel air and west use since they own the site rather than buying the site we're going to be working a collaborative effort with both cities to figure out ways that we can help them implement parts of their master drainage plan and we'll figure out a way to provide mitigating detention to offset those effects that they're going to be doing in their improvements in the brace value watershed so that's a real exciting project and so we hope we hope to be kicking that off relatively soon so i didn't want to spend a lot of time talking about all of our projects because i know there's everyone has a lot of concerns a lot of questions so i'm going to turn it over to the congresswoman and the team and and be happy to answer any questions that residents might have great thank you steve well with those introductions we'll move to our q a portion uh here for the evening and you can use the q a function here in the zoom chat to submit questions uh we've already had a bunch submitted and with that i will start with the first questions that we have uh i'm gonna go to it once here because they're both kind of related uh christina and zinnie wanted to know an update on the addicts barker army corps study in terms of when we might see a final study and what that timeline would look like and catherine clark asked are there where do the considerations for the tunnel system stand and i know you all talked about in your intro a little bit but if you want to go more in depth into that i think we're getting lots of questions on where those where that project is sure uh so prior to april 6 we had planned to complete the buffalo bayou tributaries and tributaries resiliency study by december of 2023 the need to do this comprehensive benefits analysis really um to to make the argument for federal participation and actually constructing tunnels is potentially going to add a year on to that schedule now we will try uh harris county flight control district is going to be doing that work for us in terms of the comprehensive benefits analysis i say a year because that gives him some gives the flood control district plenty of room to get a large swath of input to make sure we leave no benefits behind but we'll try and get it done as close to the december 23 original timeline as possible um we just already have largely the the blanket approval um to stop the federal clock um where we would have to be finished by december 23rd um in terms of some additional things related to addison barker that alan made reference to we have received our first real estate application to potentially start excavation behind addicts and barker we're looking at both harris county flood control district doing some degree of excavation operations and willow fort drainage district doing what we consider largely recreational type terrain shaping um particularly within that watershed that won't cause any uh impact to the rate of rise within the reservoir reservoir um but allows increased capacity that's going through the engineering and design of what that that landscaping it's really a landscape architecture type project that ultimately will remove more dirt that's uh you know basically the yeses are there from us we're just helping willowport trainings district figure out exactly what the activity is going to look like behind there so that they can get started on that i do know they're looking for sources of funding um to actually conduct that type of landscape architecture all right thank you colonel dale our next question that we have comes from christopher dougherty uh he wants to know what can be done to overcome the glo's failure to send harvey recovery funding to houston in particular and coastal texas where the harvey damages were the greatest um mr costello if you want to go here i think you are probably yeah i was hoping not to have that question but yes uh you know it's interesting what most residents don't realize in any type of harvard recovery fema dollars flow through the texas division of emergency management and then hud dollars flow through the glo and the city historically has had an excellent relationship with the texas division of emergency management and we've had somewhat of a strained relationship with glo and it really goes back to the cdbg dr harvard recovery on home repair and and i think the issue there is that there was a probably a lack of confidence with glo and the city relative to implementation of mitigation projects that's the first thing i think a lot of people say it could be political we're not quite sure i think what we need to do is just continue to work through the process we we've worked with hud directly and with our congressional leadership to ask for support to get additional funding and we will continue to do that um i think one of the challenges we're going to have is once we see the action plan from harris county we'll see how many funds are going to be spent with inside the city limits the city of houston and then we'll go back to rather than go back to glo we'll go back to the local cog which is heac because they have a half a billion dollars as well and we will visit with them so i think both the state agency as well as our sister agencies here locally understand the needs of our our citizens and we will continue to try to work through those this weekend so i'll pitch in here as well uh from the county perspective uh there's been a lot in the news about the proposed 750 million dollars to harris county the first thing it's important to realize is that the flood control district is a separate entity from harris county and so from a from today's perspective uh we have to wait until harris county releases what's called a draft method of distribution that helps to lay out the criteria about how that 750 million dollars will be spent we got some really good ideas and we we certainly look forward to the conversations but the public has the opportunity first to comment on how uh how that 750 is spent and the criteria used to establish those projects at which point then we'll be able to answer more specifically the sorts of questions like hey what projects are we going to build with the 750 we have to wait until that method of distribution comes out but they are working on that and we look forward to seeing the next steps great thank you alan and thank you steve um our next question comes from bruce bennett and he has concerns about how the coastal spine is going to mitigate flooding in the houston galveston area and is worried that you know the what color quickly had been referred to as the i-tech before would hold water into the region uh so colonel vale do you want to talk about you know the importance of this project and how it relates to the overall flooding strategy for the region yeah sure so um i think that let me unpack that the first the first question was largely kind of an engineering question um you know when you build a wall against the ocean you create a bathtub behind it is kind of what i think that question is alluding to so take it to the bank the corps has no authority to increase the risk to public safety from the compound flood risk associated with the coastal storm so we have to account for the most likely rainfall um that occurs um with the 600 storms that we've modeled to provide the level of protection with the design uh that will commence with building um largely the floodgates um not just on not not just across the the houston ship channel but also the floodgates that were we've recommended for clear legend dickinson as we write to that this the terminology the core uses is minimum facilities criteria we have a do not arm um type uh guidelines an engineer circular that tells us we cannot we can't transfer risk largely from protecting from storm surge and transfer that risk to increase the probability of imminent flooding we have to do a largely a do no harm type situation so as a result when we build gates uh or walls uh we have to build pump stations we have to be able to replicate the the same amount of flow that traditionally would occur without the gates as with the gates and that's a very specific design criteria that the core um is responsible to holding and we'll have to demonstrate that to the public before we actually uh get towards the final design into the construction phase of the project so those concerns are near and dear to our heart those those are requirements that we have um under our own engineering regulations so in terms of funding i can only speak to the federal side of the funding um the gulf coast protection district is still somewhat in its infancy uh but has great leaders uh on that you know representing our natural sponsor for the gate structures um and they're looking at an all-of-the-above approach and whatever i can do to help them develop an overall concept for delivering this project that allows them to maximize an all of the above approach we'll do so i mean they are partners and not just partners in maine only um we'll develop a concept of delivering this 50 50 between the federal government and the gulf coast protection district um and that's where the coastal storm features and the same applies to the texas general land office who's our 50 50 partner for for delivering the almost three billion dollars in ecosystem restoration projects along the way because um i just know the texas general land office is very very excited and is even potentially willing to develop a concept that allows them to accelerate ahead of federal funding to get those ecosystem restoration projects done so there's a lot of momentum we have to keep making gotta keep making what i consider tactical steps forward to keep the strategic momentum going to deliver something of this magnitude which really is the state of texas showing the rest of the nation how to get things done great thank you colonel dale uh next we have cheryl novak who asked where where can constituents go for more information about which proposed projects affect which areas uh within the region well i can start um the the harris county flood control district's website www.hcfcd.org on the very front page uh includes an interactive map that you can select you can expand it to fill up your entire screen there's some layers that you can turn off and on if you want to see what's in the seventh congressional district you can turn on the congressional districts and see all the projects uh that are within that area you can zoom into your with the area you live you can see all the projects that we have underway locally uh select one of them it'll tell you what that project is uh some of the the very high level statistics on it uh but also gives you the the keywords that you can then easily reach out to the flood control district uh you know tap the button on our website to ask us a question we'll get back with you usually the same day um and uh and we're always ready to answer questions about what we're up to and to hear what your concerns are we have a similar issue here with the city we have a website i always encourage everybody to get on the city's website just go to public works and then go to build houston forward but most of those projects are usually much smaller in terms of the impact to the community but you'll see not only drainage related and street related improvements but you'll see all the other utility projects as well however our website to be candid is not as nice as flood controls they've done a really good job of identifying their activities great thank you alan i guess i'll cap that out thanks to congresswoman sheila jackson lee after hurricane harvey she funded the corps of engineers to conduct the watershed assessment largely to propose recommendations to get at exactly what you're talking about is how do we see everything the federal government the state the county and the city are working on together in kind of an integrated water resource type framework um so fortunately at the same time the texas water development board was given authority by the state of texas to also participate with authority and flood risk reduction so between the partners that you hear that you see here today steve costello alan black and myself we're working either as direct members or contributing members to texas water development boards region planning group to start to get all of our information from all federal agencies state agencies to county in the city and one type interactive knowledge base for the constituents thank you colonel vale next we have kate wilson who wants to know uh if cleaning the waterways if along the city and the county will that reduce flooding and is that something that the county is working on she sees a lot of dirty waterways in her neighborhood so cleaning the waterways wouldn't necessarily help to reduce the risk of flooding but when when the water does have a lot of sediment load in it it is indicative of uh erosion upstream and that can be a sign of some of our infrastructure starting to fail um and so when we see a lot of sediment we we want to know where that's coming from and so we start to trace upstream until we see oh well if we've got a bank that's eroded or failed that needs to be fixed then we need to to jump on that and prioritize that but that's largely oriented more towards uh retaining the current capacity of our systems yeah i think also um there are a lot of ditches uh that we call orphan ditches uh in my career these 45 years and that was nobody claimed ownership either the city didn't claim ownership nor the county and so what we're trying to do now we set up a program a couple of years ago between both agencies to where we're kind of swapping maintenance requirements or maintenance i would say maintenance needs and so what we decided to do is we we went to flood control and said hey we do best maintaining closed systems and you do best maintaining open systems so we have some open systems we want to give to you we'll take your closed systems and once we get that inventory of those ditches and enclosed storm sewer systems separated out we will then approach the orphan ditches and figure out who should take those over and and what we want to do with them so at the long term that's what we'll be doing but it's it's primarily a maintenance related issue that we're focusing on well and i'll expand on that to say that uh while in the process of transferring ownerships of those open channels or transferring ownership of the enclosed systems we also make sure that it's caught up to our current standards uh because these some of these channels have been neglected for for so long just because nobody had a responsibility for them sometimes they've fallen into disrepair so one of the key elements in establishing that transfer of ownership is also getting it up to standards which will also help again restore these systems back to their original design capacity great thank you alan and steve uh next we have gerda gomez who is asking about plans uh and updates uh to develop rafino and steve i know you mentioned this briefly in your intro remarks if you wanted to talk a little bit more about where the project currently stands and what is ongoing uh with that site yeah i'd be happy to so we have been working with flood control to develop a i would say a joint application to them to access covid hazard mitigation grant funds the state was awarded to from fema a little over 670 million dollars and there's a call for projects and those project applications are due the end of this month and so we hope that we have a consultant looking at our bc analysis very similar to what colonel vale had described earlier to see if we have an application that would be qualify under the federal program so it'll be what we're looking at is partial improvements to keegan's downstream of betwa and possibly excavating out the portion of the rafino landfill site that's owned by bel air in the future we'll look at the other parcel which is owned by weshu it's an exciting time i don't think anyone has ever relocated a landfill site of this magnitude and when i envision and i'm not a visionary i'm an engineer i want to build things but what i envision happening at the end of the day assuming we relocate that entire landfill that it would look more like an art story park that's located up on beltway eight that the county has done an outstanding job of converting a regional detention facility into wetland mitigation and park amenity that's what i think will happen down here in the future one of the things i'd add to that and this is something that that we're working to do a better job at is to help it help explain to the public how certain projects while on their own are going to provide some benefits they fit in and together part of a bigger program so the flood control district is currently underway with a study of the entire keegan's value watershed uh and part of the uh the challenge that we have is we want to improve the channel conveyance but again we are not allowed we are a no adverse community so we can't transfer the risk of flooding to somewhere else so if we open up the channel and allow more water to flow through we have to hold some of it back somewhere like in the rafino hills storm water detention base and so that's how these projects all kind of interlink is that flood control would like to improve conveyance the city is interested in that detention so that way they can work together to build even more flood risk reduction for the residents okay great uh david and libby asked over four years after harvey residents of upstream barker reservoir are dealing with more upstream development and other issues are the core and harris county flood control working on some incremental solutions while the study of the tunnel options continues and can you all talk about that so i'll start and then i'll hand it over to the colonel and and i'll primarily start with we in harris county have some of the most stringent development criteria across the country if not the most um every development is required to analyze the free and post conditions of their proposed project and make sure that they incorporate into their development uh appropriate mitigation those stormwater detention basins for the communities that hold that water back and slowly release it into the uh the outfalling channel um but then also we have talked a little bit about uh our opportunities to expand some of the uh the the the volume of the reservoirs but i want to put a little perspective on that and and and perhaps the colonel can then chime in on it as well is that the each one of those reservoirs addicts and barker hold more than 200 000 acre feet of water the harris county flood control district since we were created in 1937 has executed about 62 000 acre feet of volume across the entire county so i i like to help people hear those numbers to appreciate the scale upon which those reservoirs hold water and with that awe-inspiring uh figure i'll turn it over to the colonel if he wants to add anything sure i think allen and i share concern that you know um you know upstream residents largely could benefit by increasing the rate of flow from their neighborhoods and developments upstream [Music] into the reservoir the faster you can get the water out of the neighborhoods and into the reservoir largely if you live upstream the better we just have to reconcile that with there's only so much capacity within the reservoir at a certain point in time we don't want we you know largely we have to operate the reservoir here i'll throw these numbers because they're somewhat similar the reservoirs right now can only discharge 15 000 cubic feet per second at maximum discharge that's 15 000 basketballs per second is how much water can be released from these hurricane harvey the amount of water that was coming in behind the reservoirs the inflow was over 200 000 cubic feet per second so the 200 000 basketballs were coming into the reservoirs and only 15 000 were able to be released so at a certain point in time you've got to you've got to either increase the capacity of the reservoir and that's limited um in terms of of how much capacity you can add behind the reservoirs so you run into the water tip quite obviously um and then you've got to be able to increase the number of basketballs that you're releasing from the reservoirs and that's where the tunnel solution set comes in if we have an open design tunnel system that's permanently discharging then we never shut the gates but then we can discharge 15 000 basketballs in a tunnel on a continuous basis keeping the reservoirs largely dry year-round until we have a southern rainfall event and still have the ability to open up the gates on the reservoirs and still release 15 000 so you'd have a total maximum release of of doubling what we what we had prior to hurricane harvey it's largely what we're doing from an analytical perspective in terms of trying to develop a solution set um where the tunnels largely don't increase the downstream flood risk but combined between the tunnels and their ability to discharge we're greatly reducing the frequency of those storm events that would have water leaving government held in behind the reservoirs and that's largely you know the focus of our objectives with harris county flood control district at the same time if you want to increase capacity of those reservoirs because because if you're close to the the federal property line i get it every every bucket of dirt is potentially a bucket of water out of your home now it would require a massive expansion to make sure you of the reservoir and the tunnels to make sure that water doesn't leave government on land in a hurricane harvey type situation but on storm storm events shorter that you know if you want to be part of the solution set and help us move dirt behind those reservoirs we have all the authority we need we just have to you have to come to us with an idea process a a what's considered a permission letter which is a real estate out grant and we'll make sure it's not going to do any damage to the the structures of the reservoirs or increase the rate of rise to the reservoirs and we can make that happen at the same time you know some of the capacity that that you increase in the reservoirs allows us to improve you know give harris county the authority to increase the amount of flow into the reservoirs so it's a it's a combined complex situation um and and we're working together at ferris county and anybody else has got an idea to move forward with the authorities we already have and ben um i just want to butt in here for a second because i i think i heard something in the question um that i would love just colonel vale and alan if you all can speak to a little bit more which is i think there is a frustration and i see it as i'm scanning some of these questions um you know that that doing the study um and working on the long-term solution people want to see the short-term solution or some some immediate response and i and i definitely heard you talking about that colonel bell but what maybe wasn't as clear to me but i think is true is that some of that is already happening some of it has happened there are projects that you have done um in terms of the dredging in terms of cleaning up some of the channels and that go into alex and barker i know claudia on our team um has worked with the flood control district over the last couple of years a lot of people who are on here probably know claudia um from going to all the community meetings and other things i know that there have been some specific projects and some efforts that you've done so i don't want that to get lost in the conversation that it isn't like everybody's waiting to pick up a shovel until you know we can do the big final project you are doing some of that work some of that dredging work has happened and is ongoing and i think that at least it's my sense there's a little frustration people want to see both things happening um and and my sense is that some of that is happening so i just wanted to to put that out there and make sure that my understanding is clear um alan colonel vale that that some of that work is already happening it's not an either or um but obviously we do have to make some big choices about what the long-term plan is going to be but i just want to clarify that i think that was part of the question i just want to make sure that um that we cover that sure yeah i mean well i can speak to the specifics but we're we're very proud that all the funding received from from hurricane harvey between the core and harris county flight control district we've fully committed all that funding and improved most of the watersheds across harris county allen has you want to talk to specifics sure so the the bond program alone uh commits almost 200 million dollars for projects in the attucks and barca reservoir watersheds um a large majority of that is in the massive undertaking that i alluded to earlier uh where we're restoring all the tributaries that flow into the reservoirs back to their original design capacity um getting the channels to function the way they're supposed to um you know that's the first piece of the puzzle and the that's what we can do in the short term is to make sure that the the infrastructure that the flood control district maintains are functioning properly so far we've done a little bit of work in cooperation with the corps inside the uh the attics for example um but right prior to the uh the start of last year's hurricane season uh we did undertook some selective clearing of south mady creek downstream of greenhouse to try and help facilitate that water getting into the reservoir without impacting the rate of rise at the uh at the dam so we're doing what we can uh we do have like i said close to 200 million dollars dedicated just to those two watersheds um and we're uh we're committed to executing every single one of those projects thanks so much for clarifying that and uh you know we sometimes we know so much in the details of these projects and i think it's just important for people to know that you hear them this is something we've certainly heard from folks in our district and i know it's what i hear back from you all that we're trying to do everything we can you're trying to do everything you can at once so thanks for clarifying that and i'll turn it back to ben thanks for letting me butt in there thank you congresswoman and time has really flown on this so we do have time for one last question here uh cynthia neely would like to request an update on the tur 17 detention basis project and where that stands and what the timeline for that looks like yeah thank you ben i'm going to talk real quick so we get another question and and previously i mentioned it was tourist 7 it's actually chair 17. we have selected the consultant we're currently in the process of negotiating the scope and hopefully we'll get that resolved pretty quickly and then we'll have we'll move forward with the design effort hey thank you steve and uh since you were so concise there i think we can get one more in um we have a audience member asking to if we can get an update on recommendations coming out of the core study that was initiated in 2018 for the uh houston regional watershed assessment uh where that stands and how that is overall going yeah largely so that watershed assessment's largely complete and i think um the the biggest components of that is the recommendations from the core that we create a regional forum to conduct integrated water resource management across the federal government's authorities the texas water development boards authorities the county's authorities and the city's authorities also branch out to the other federal agencies to be part of that we've got the framework of that within the texas water development boards region planning group six um so we're moving forward with the tesla water development board to try and implement kind of a holistic uh you know approach to planning and programming and selecting the the the best water flood risk mitigation projects we can across the 22 watersheds yeah just uh man just as a follow-up to what the colonel was saying i'm on that regional board and actually we met today for our monthly meeting our report our comprehensive report which does integrate a lot of the recommendations that the corps is as recommended here locally into our regional plan we anticipate that we'll have a regional planned draft submitted to the state in op in august and so it should be it should be available for public consumption we're going to have several public meetings between now and then to brief the public on what we're doing in terms of the regional effort i'll add one little part is that say that there's one person or one representative missing in this organ in this group here tonight and we've just now talked about them and it really highlights the collaboration across the board for bringing flood resilience to harris county it's the state the state is in the flood planning game as well not just in planning for the future flood resiliency but also investing funding in projects in this area the flood control district's been successful in securing some grant funding from the state as has the city of houston and many other agencies so you know it just highlights again the importance of those partnerships and the collaboration at the local state and federal level so again my thanks go out to everybody who's helping to uh to do our job to to make things better here great well thank you all so much for participating uh with us tonight on the panel and i'd like to thank all of our listeners and watchers this evening for taking part in this very important conversation uh hearing about all the work that's going on throughout the region and through the community is so important to making sure that all the communities needs are met as there are a variety of needs across the county and city uh and with that i will pass it to the congresswoman uh for her final remarks for the evening and thank you again for participating great ben thank you so much for um for moderating the discussion and giving my voice a rest um i i obviously pushed it a little bit a minute ago so i will be very brief in just thanking our panelists again for spending an hour with us tonight to update everyone in the 7th congressional district about the work that you're doing and also the way that you're working together i think it's something that i talk about a lot in washington um about how we work in this community i think it's something that we've seen since day one people want to see flooding flood mitigation water conveyance continue to be top of mind for everyone um and as we know going into hurricane season over the summer as we know um with all the challenges we face this just has to be a priority for our community and has to be something we're always working on and i think that the conversation tonight um hopefully demonstrated to everyone that we are but that their input is really important too i tried to summarize a bunch of those questions because i think it it is important um to recognize how much you all have listened to the constituents who who i know are talking to you or talking to me we're all talking to each other and so to see that reflected in the harris county bond program in 2018 to see that reflected in the coursework and going back and taking another look at the tunnels this really is a collaborative effort that isn't just about the agencies and the representatives it's about the people who are participating tonight and figuring out how we're going to solve this problem and the best way we can do it is solving it together um so hopefully we got to all of the questions um if you didn't get your question answered obviously my office is here my team is here ben is here claudia's here who i mentioned earlier um is here in houston working on flooding issues and um and has been a part of so many of these conversations and i think it's um it's just important for you all to know that we're here for you and that we can be your voice in washington and working on these issues with the core working here at home and then bringing these issues and doing things like coming up with the funding to complete the myergrove detention base and alan you didn't mention it but i think it's it's important to note that harris county flood control said that they are going to break ground this fall and hopefully it's going to be ready next spring so that is a really quick project moving um and i'm so glad to be able to bring the money to do it and a little bit more to the flood control district almost 10 million dollars to make sure that that project can move forward uh but it's the kind of thing where everybody worked together immediately after harvey to identify um a problem and a solution and and we've we've come together to do that and that's what our community is going to have to continue to do the bigger picture discussions about regional um flood planning and mitigation the long-term study um you know this affects our entire region and i think that some of the the points that i heard tonight are really important for me to take with me um and think about how all these little projects that we can do can add up and how these big projects uh that we are looking at have the power to be so transformative for our region but it's going to take all of us working together to make them happen so i just really appreciate the conversation tonight i want to remind everybody who's participating that you can call my office anytime to share your thoughts on this ask questions we're here to help my phone number 713-353-8680 here in houston um again thank you all so much for being here tonight um as i've said i haven't been able to say a word for about three days but it seems fitting that the first words that i can say after that um are about flooding and what we're doing together as a community to respond so thank you all so much for being here for your time tonight and for participating in and being part of the solution and again um to colonel blackman who's going to be joining us this summer we're delighted to welcome you um into our community and excited for you to get here to colonel vale who has been just such an incredible visionary leader and a real partner um in helping us rethink how we do things um you know we will miss you in this role but um i know i am excited and i think everybody here is excited to see what you do next to continue working with you on these issues for our community so thank you thanks to alan and steve and thanks to everybody participating so glad to be with you all tonight take good care and we'll see you again soon

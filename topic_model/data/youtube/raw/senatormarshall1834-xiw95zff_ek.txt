from kansas thank you mr president i want to talk today about one of the most disturbing human catastrophes in the world now i recently visited the ukraine border i've done medical mission work around the world from haiti to honduras to africa i've seen maltriation and starvation i've seen trauma i've seen the consequences of lack of potable water and sewage i describe this when i say our southern border yes our own southern border is a humanitarian crisis you know i'm not speaking in ignorance or hyperbole and this crisis this humanitarian nightmare has been created by our own president's policies you see when he was elected he sent a loud invitation to the whole world and more recently when he said he was ending title 42 it was like turning on a stronger magnet it was like sending a flare a signal it was like a giant time square billboard telling all the world come now come to the united states amnesty is waiting for everyone as for the cartels the people traveling they paid no mind to the court ruling instead they kept coming and as we speak the largest caravan today it is on its way with more than 15 000 people bigger than my hometown of great bend this imitation this magnet has made an already treacherous inhumane situation worse our president is indeed inviting people to their own peril to their own harrowing life-threatening journey let me share with you what i saw just 16 days ago on my fourth visit to the border upon our arrival in a short drive to the river we found the border patrol and our national guard hard at work with some 30 migrants in line waiting to be processed they had turned themselves in and within moments within minutes that line was over a hundred people and at the front of the line were two beautiful young sisters ages seven and nine they were unaccompanied no parents and no families i can only imagine what it would have been like traveling over a thousand miles from central america to the rio grande river without your parents or without a family member i can only imagine what might have happened to them on that trek from the river we traveled to a detention center where the migrants were held for two to three days and i have to again complement our border patrol they're doing an incredible job in just a humanitarian crisis by providing shower shelter clothing health care and meals but the challenge is 80 of our border patrol officers are having to function there like running a restaurant like running a hotel functioning as social workers while our borders are left unguarded and they get a getaways we haven't talked about the getaways let me tell you the story of one young lady i met let's say she was probably about 17 years of age from central america she or her family paid the cartel some three thousand dollars to get from central america through mexico across the river and into the united states now i don't know if she was raped or violated but this certainly is a very common situation all too common during this trek we do know that some people in her group are asked to smuggle drugs across the borders as part of their thoroughfare now after crossing this treacherous river she was abandoned by her coyote she was already dehydrated she'd had dysentery she'd had mis malnourished she hadn't slept for days and was no doubt frightened eventually she found a refuge at a cartel stash house on the texas side of the border yes now the cartel has gang members cartel members living in america along the river and as i later found out all across america next the cartel arranged of course for a price for her to be smuggled via car from a border city to a checkpoint some 60 miles away now these journeys too are treacherous as migrants are often placed in the containers in the backs of trucks or the trunks of cars and when they're chased by sheriffs the drivers recklessly pace their own human cargill in paris in peril but this person wasn't done yet about five miles short of the checkpoint the human smugglers let her out of the car then she had to walk around the checkpoint probably a journey of 15 to 20 miles through the texas heat scrub brush and rattlesnakes in fact many days now texas ranchers find dead decayed bodies of migrant workers or migrant folks who had not made the trek successfully so this journey around the check point would take three to four days she was given two days worth of water a jug of water a milk jug full of water a couple miles beyond the checkpoint a new human smuggler hired and coordinated by the cartel to pick her up and this is where i met our young lady we watched as she and four others packed into a small car and a fifth hopped in the trunk after a short high-speed chase the car finally pulled over and the riders fled on foot now most were apprehended very shortly including the young lady in this photo this is when i met the woman in the story for the first time again she hadn't had water for two days her left knee was swollen and painful she had multiple cuts that were infected multiple bruises and she was semi-coast semi-comatose fading in and out she had certainly heat exhaustion with bordering on a heat stroke now we were fortunate with some minor first aid giving her hydration cooling her down she's going to make it and she's going to be fine but for many making this treacherous journey across the southern border this story ends much more differently and much more tragically i'm asking i'm begging our president to turn off the magnet to turn off the billboards that advertise for these people to risk their lives to stop inviting them to their peril and perhaps their death thank you mr president i yield back

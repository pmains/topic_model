provisions I would like to focus on chiefly are those involving taking away the deductions the itemized deductions that so many Americans take to reduce their tax liability now these deductions are eliminated on the theory that oh they just go to the wealthy and for those purposes they define the wealthy as the wealthiest 30% or so of the American people say a family with an income of a hundred or 150 thousand dollars and we're told that that's the same thing as increasing taxes on the top one-tenth of 1% say a family with an income of one or two million dollars a year there is a difference in the ability to pay of those two typical families typifying their income brackets and the fact is that taxing hardworking families with incomes of a hundred or $150,000 in order to provide reduced tax rates for those with incomes of one or two million dollars makes our tax system more regressive and you cannot put the entire top 30 percent in one category for these income calculations that is why and that is only one reason why I oppose the elimination of the home mortgage deduction another reason for that I oppose it is that elimination of the home mortgage deduction in the deduction for local property taxes will probably decrease the value of homes by 20% is the best estimate I've seen well if you lose 20% of the value of your home you may very well lose all of the equity in your home how is that going to affect the economy how is that going to affect the ability of homeowners to go spend money in their communities and support the economy of their communities what does it do to the federal budget when we are responsible through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mack for underwriting home mortgages we know that if you wipe out the equity of many homeowners in their homes this can lead to defaults and cost the federal government perhaps more then as being that then we give up by having a home mortgage deduction another element to keep in mind is that the entire idea of an income tax is that we tax people based on their ability to pay if you're in a state with high income taxes high property taxes that diminishes your ability to pay if you make a certain salary and money is taken out by your state government before you ever see it your ability to pay is only on that net paycheck and so it is simply wrong to take away the deduction for state and local taxes but make no mistake about it the purpose of removing that deduction is not just to hurt the top thirty or forty percent or fifty percent of the American people who itemize their deductions it is designed to punish those who are dependent on state and local government for all the conservative theorists say if we can just eliminate the deduction for state and local taxes we will cut the size of state and local governments we will create a political atmosphere in which they slash money for local schools slash money for local health programs for the poor slash money for police and who will be hurt from those cuts not just the top thirty percent or fifty percent but everyone in America most particularly the poor but finally I want to focus on the medical deduction they take away the medical deduction in this program this proposal of the Trump administration now keep in mind that we already have severe limits on deducting medical expenses you can deduct medical expenses only if they exceed 10 percent of your family's income so medical expenses are itemized and deducted only by those families including someone with very significant health costs now we have worked hard in this house to make sure that people have health insurance but even with health insurance there are co-pays there are deductibles these can be absorbed in a family budget where no one has a particular strong medical need but what if there is some a member of the family who needs experimental treatments that are not covered therapies that are not covered under the present system at least they get to deduct these extraordinary not the first 10% of AGI of adjusted gross income but when they start spending out-of-pocket costs in excess of 10% income they can take a tax deduction a tax deduction taken away in the Trump tax proposal I speak not just as someone who spent a lot of time as a tax expert headed the second largest tax agency in the country but as a father of a child with special needs what does this tax proposal mean for such a family well first there's a cut in federal revenue under this proposal of between 150 and 200 billion dollars a year deficit hawks will demand that these revenue cuts be matched by cuts to federal spending what does that do to the 13 billion dollars the federal government dedicates the implementation of the individuals with Disabilities Education Act IDE a also known as special education and what do these revenues cuts in our federal expenditures mean to the two hundred and ninety three million dollars that are spent by the National Institutes of Health on research designed to prevent and treat autism and attention deficit hyperactivity ADHD so the first impact on a family with special needs is a slashing of the money the federal government spends for special education and medical research but second I talked about those out-of-pocket medical expenses parents with special needs children know that health insurance pays only a portion of what is needed or perhaps none of what is needed for behavioral therapy speech therapy occupational therapy therapy physical therapy developmental pediatricians psycho neuropsychological services etc medical insurance will pay nothing toward anything branded an experimental treatment and of course medical insurance does not cover special schools required to meet the needs of some special needs children under current law a special school designed to meet those with a physical or mental handicap are considered medical expenses all these tax deductions are taken away from a family whose ability to pay is diminished by the costs of providing these therapies to a special needs child in addition right now the tax law provides a personal exemption of 4050 dollars for each dependent child the Trump administration proposal takes that away it does say in some vague language that there'll be a child tax credit to compensate parents or losing the personal exemption but this credit will be limited to children 16 years of age and younger so what about parents with teenage supporting children in their teenage years and older and remember some special needs children will need parental support for a lifetime those parents lose the exemption and are ineligible for this credit available only to parents of younger children but perhaps parents of children with special needs should support the Trump tax program while it will tremendously increase their taxes while it will cut federal expenditures on special education and on health research and medical research parents of children with special needs can take solace in knowing that this plan will reduce taxes for the Trump family by over 1 billion dollars in estate taxes and by tens of million dollars of dollars in income taxes perhaps we should tell parents of special needs children that they should stop worrying so much about their children and start worrying about Donald Trump's children if they did they would support the Trump tax proposal

and thank you mr speaker i rise today during national police week when america joins our law enforcement community to honor our fallen officers sadly our police force faces unprecedented attack last year 264 enforcement officers were killed in the line of duty nearly double the amount from 2019 and in only one year in all of american history 1930 were there more law enforcement deaths despite these staggering losses some in this body are seeking to defund the police diminishing their ability to protect and defend our communities and themselves while we must be ever vigilant to root out the bad apples we cannot forget the overwhelming majority who put themselves in harm's way every day and serve with honor and integrity i'm grateful for the efforts of the excellent law enforcement officials in my district i stand with these incredible sheriffs and chiefs and the officers they lead and i thank them for their service on behalf of the citizens of florida thank you and i yield back

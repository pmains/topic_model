the purpose of the superfund program is to clean up some of the most hazardous and contaminated sites in our nation that remain a threat to the public's health many of these sites both directly and indirectly affect native american tribes or their land according to the epa over 300 000 american indians roughly 12 percent of the native population live within three miles of a superfund site let that sink in 12 of native americans in our country live within three miles of some of the most hazardous and contaminated sites in our nation this proximity to super funds can affect tribes in a variety of ways for example in upstate new york the saint regis mohawk tribe has been dealing with the effects of chemical pollution from an aluminum plant since 1954. this pollution has poisoned the saint lawrence river where the tribe has fishing rights in arizona the navajo nation has seen their lands contaminated by uranium mining that was used to support our nation's nuclear ambitions in 2019 the gao completed a study at the request of chairman pallone myself and other members to review superfund sites that affect tribes and tribal interests specifically the report looked at tribal consultation practices and whether epa was fulfilling the us government's trust responsibility and considering the unique needs of tribes in superfund programs my first question goes to mr gomez can you briefly describe epa's findings and recommendations from this report sure thank you congressman reece um so as you noted we did a report looking specifically at superfund sites that were on or near tribal lands and there were basic questions you know how many superfund sites are there epa didn't really have good accurate information so we had to work with them to figure out how many sites there were and what we found with epa there were 88 superfund sites that were on or near tribal lands also epa had difficulty documenting when they were doing consultation with tribes so we made a recommendation that they should do a better job documenting that and so those were the kinds of findings that we found now since the report we issued epa has been has taken action on a lot of those areas and as you noted the superfund sites in particular you know uh affect tribal communities in different ways because they may be uh requiring to fish at a stream or a lake that may be potentially contaminated and that's their subsistence right yes uh the epa implemented uh some of these recommendations have they implemented all of the recommendations and do you feel that the epa consultation and data collection process has improved yes so they have made a improvement in all grounds and all of the recommendations that we made they've improved the data they collected they've issued memos and guidance to all of the regional offices to be clear about what what what is a consultation make sure you record it but also to gather data on these superfund sites thank you so now moving towards the climate change uh effects on the superfund sites uh mr gomez of superfund sites that are vulnerable to climate change do you have a sense of how many affect tribal land or have native american interests yes so what we did is we we took the 88 superfund sites that we did for you in that report and we then looked at the ones that we have from climate change effects and we did find that about 70 percent of the native america of the superfund sites on or near tribal lands have impacts from climate change as you've also noted should they be prioritized for cleanup so this is the you know the purpose of our work was to do the screening so that epa we'll we'll discuss that later but i want to get to this one your testimony focused on a gao report they looked at a number of non-federal sites that are vulnerable to climate change do you know how many federal sites are vulnerable to climate change so we know at least uh from your work for you that there are 11 federal sites that that are on or near tribal lands and so that is a good question to see for the federal facilities which of those in general in general as well the federal lands uh it seems like your analysis that sixty percent of non-federal superfund sites will likely be affected by floods storm surges or wildfires it doesn't seem there's to be a general analysis for federal land should a similar analysis be conducted for federal sites yes if that's something that congress wants us to do we're happy to do that great and section 636 of the clean future act accomplishes this goal and i yield back my time you

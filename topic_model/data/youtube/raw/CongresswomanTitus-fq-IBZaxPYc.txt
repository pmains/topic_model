hello i'm dina Titus your representative from district 1 lo siento Peter no hablo espa√±ol muy bien un poquito nada mas para ojala que mejor de please join me in recognizing September is National Hispanic Heritage Month the neighborhoods of district 1 are the most diverse in the state and exemplifies why Hispanic traditions language and arts are among the touchstones of American culture in Las Vegas nearly one-third of the total population and over 40% of those under 18 identified themselves as Hispanic residents hailed from all the Latin American countries and many island nations threading their folkways in history into the fabric of everyday life in Southern Nevada Hispanic culture in dows our city from corner to corner in fact it's hard to imagine Las Vegas without mainstays like Mexican folkloric dance groups the newspaper El Mundo the Venezuelan restaurant la Sur APIs the Puerto Rican Association the Peruvian Chamber of Commerce the Las Vegas Heritage Museum or the annual Dia de los Muertos celebration at Winchester Park and I could go on while there is much to celebrate though we still have work to do I want to thank Las Vegas immigration advocates including dreamers like Astrid Silva who have fought for common-sense reform instead of building walls passing comprehensive legislation is a moral imperative and an economic necessity for the 210 thousand undocumented immigrants in our state so this Hispanic Heritage Month we must renew our effort to bring people out of the shadows and give them a shot at the American dream please know that I am and always will be an advocate for fixing our broken immigration system and providing families with the opportunity to prosper in the United States together we will celebrate the culture achievements and heritage of the Hispanic community together we will work to bring justice to those who deserve a voice and remember adelante siempre adelante thank you

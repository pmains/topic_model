south carolina congresswoman nancy mace congresswoman the language we heard from president g you can only describe it as violent your reaction to him saying that on that stage at this moment well it's incredible really and our response from the state department that we're going to take notes and not action reminds me of president biden's appearance at the g7 summit just a few weeks ago a verbal slap on the wrist as well no less and just a few weeks ago i'll add into that into your reporter's story general ming chinese general ming threatened the united states and japan just a few weeks ago over taiwan and look what's happening right now in the halls of congress you've got nancy pelosi playing defense attorney the china over the origins of kobat 19 barring republican leadership from even having a hearing this week prohibiting government officials like dr fauci from showing up at that hearing like what are we doing congresswoman that's exactly my point i look at congress nothing's happening is president g making these statements but because he can see all too well that nothing is happening in congress and nothing is going to happen in congress are we enabling this i believe i believe it's all of the above i believe that the united states looks weaker by the day right now and when we're weak the world is weak we've got to show strength one of the reasons too that i supported the repeal of the aumf just a few weeks ago is if we are stranded around the world and not ending some of these wars we won't be prepared for the fight that china looks you know willing to pursue in the next few years or sooner i mean we've got real challenges abroad and overseas and we've got to show strength not just in our not just legislatively and take for instance you know there there are republicans and there's a growing number of democrats we've got congresswoman de jada out of colorado who wants to hold china accountable investigate covid19 but republicans too were trying to take legislative matters um to to make a difference over there china has a mandate and you know monopoly on batteries for electric vehicles and republicans want to bring that business back to the united states there are ways that we can start to hold china accountable we can't do that when democrats are blocking every path forward including nancy pelosi leading the charge you know you talk about needing to show strength i think congress could start by just showing responsibility we are getting as far as i can tell absolutely nowhere with china on the origins of covet 19 republicans holding hearings right now but that really doesn't mean anything unless you've got the party in power running those meetings talk about what you can do to get some bipartisanship on this very clear issue of the origins of covet 19. well we need to get democrats who are willing to stand up to nancy pelosi when the minority party holds a hearing and the speaker is blocking it nancy pelosi we can't call dr fauci we cannot compel him to come testify or any other elected official and i it was great that the media foia dr fauci's emails several weeks ago but much of the information that that is that was connected to the origins of covid was actually redacted redacted in emails that were not confidential or top secret in any way shape or form and so we've got to find democrats who are willing to stand up to their leadership in order to do this in a bipartisan way so i'm encouraged that there are a handful including congresswoman to get out of colorado who are willing to start to speak up and i hope and i cross my fingers we can find more of those in the weeks ahead well you you hope you can find more than a handful of people who want to get to the truth of the origins of a global pandemic but i guess you start with what you can start with let me get your take on this students and teachers fighting back they're filing lawsuits that say that critical race theory in schools violates the constitution you're watching this happen across the country congresswoman what's your take on what's happening with parents pushing back on public school districts do you think this has more legs and what can congress do if anything to be supportive of parents trying to push back against what they're very concerned about in these schools well thank goodness for those families and those parents who are speaking up i have two kids that are in middle school right now and i praise any parent willing to speak up and speak out at these very public school board hearings around the country this is a major major problem when when the government the federal government wants to teach our students that they're racist that they were born racist in an ideology based in marxism ideology that's not okay and we've got to support those families and these schools across the country and it really starts at the local level local school boards are and should be accountable to these parents that are sitting in the school and then of course the governors and the superintendents of education across the country as well but the federal government shouldn't be determining this that how our kids are taught period i have sponsored legislation that would not allow funding of critical race theory taught in public schools the same thing goes for our military i've again sponsored legislation that would defund that from from being taught in our military and president biden has reversed so many executive orders that were put in by president trump this is one of them one of many that is destroying our country right now and further dividing us rather than uniting us congressman really quickly what about support for alternatives to public schools what about support for the homeschool movement what about support for private schools is there something that congress can be doing there if if you can't change the public school system maybe you need to work around it at this point absolutely and i think there are many families and i see it in my own community with covid19 and and kids being stuck at home doing virtual school there are some families that may never go back to public school here in south carolina and the first congressional district we have alternative public schools called in the public charter school system there's a growing there are a growing number of families that want to home school or have virtual school opportunities so any opportunity and choices educational opportunities or school choice we've got a support and the these kinds of educational programs can bring children out of poverty it shouldn't matter your zip code or the color of your skin every kid deserves an equal education and you make a great point you know it takes a lot of courage to stand up to this you're not going to score any points in social media you're not going to score any points with the media in general if you stand up against some of these politically favored movements like crt are you concerned at all that the folks showing courage right now are going to come back for retribution later on down the road and what can we do if anything to protect people who are speaking out on this i think retribution any time especially given how divisive our country is which is why it's more important than ever to have dissenting voices to have people who are willing to speak up and speak out at these public hearings without fear of retribution i've been through it myself just last year i had my car keyed in the middle of my campaign because someone disagreed with me politically about a month ago my house was pepper sprayed or spray painted and i don't care how many times somebody shows up at my door spray painting my house i'm going to continue being a strong voice on many of these issues because we should be able to the american experiment decides that we should be able to agree to disagree and not be attacked but we need strong strong voices same voices out there um talking about these things in a peaceful way but in a strong way to let them know this is not okay congresswoman really appreciate your thoughts on these many subjects today thanks for being with us

in 2014 I began coming to the Senate floor almost every month and I came here to highlight some of the great work done each and every day by the men and women who serve us in the Department of Homeland Security I continued that effort throughout much of last year and plan to continue coming to the center floor every month in 2016 with a new story to share there is simply so much good that's being done across the department by the employees our servants who work there that I'm don't think I'm going to run out of material anytime soon as you know mr. president the Department of Homeland Security is made up of some 22 component agencies and employs over 200,000 Americans these men and women work around the clock to protect all of us our families and our country one part of the department my department is called Federal Emergency Management Agency we called FEMA has the unique and challenging task of keeping Americans safe on every thing around them has been thrown into chaos in times of crisis the men and women of FEMA coordinate rescue operations they provide emergency medical care they give shelter to those who have lost their homes simply put they bring hope back to Americans whose towns and cities have been swept away by flood destroyed by a fire or torn apart by or tornado 10 years ago mr. president in the days after Hurricane Katrina Congress passed the post-katrina emergency management reform act that law completely overhauled FEMA from top to bottom it increased its authority and stature within the Department of Homeland Security and provide it with added new resources this legislation also requires FEMA to bolster its regional office office and to build stronger relationships with state local and tribal governments taken together mr. president these reforms have improved our capability all levels of government to respond to disasters and while also improving Themis capacity to support state local and tribal governments as they seek to rebuild over the past 10 years the men and women at FEMA have worked countless hours to improve our preparedness for response to and recovery from disaster bad things still happen in the aftermath of a tornado a wildfire or even a snowstorm like the one we saw on the East Coast and nor'easter like we saw in east coast this week we still see the images of destruction and lives turned upside down on our television screen but most of the work that the men and women at FEMA do some 365 days a year to prepare for these events and make them less damage I've rarely ever get discussed every day the men and women at FEMA create evacuation plans they stock emergency shelters with food and medical supplies and they partner with local law enforcement and first responders in every state every state to improve preparedness through exercise and through drills in addition to training first responders one of the femurs top priorities is to educate and train all of us on what to do in case of a disaster the more that you and I do and our families know the more likely it is that we'll be safe we'll stay together during a disaster one FEMA employee charged with helping some of our most vulnerable communities prefer her disaster the fellow named Milo booth who serves as FEMA's tribal affairs officer Milo is an Alaskan native from and I'll probably botch this mystery mr. mr. president met Luke katka there we go met Lou katka cat kotla era government metlakatla any community it's on the southern tip of Alaska and after graduating from Oregon State University the other OSU one of the other OSU's with a bachelor of science in forestry and a minor in economics Milo returned home to serve as that communities Indian community director of forestry and land resources working to protect his hometown for the next 16 years then after tears with the u.s.

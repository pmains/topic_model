have you ever given a tour with someone who knows the ship just as well as you if not better i don't think so now this is the airplane i used to fly right here my brother says it looks like a flying chicken leg going in the wrong direction my brother was a tomcat guy but as i would tell him fighter pilots make movies attack pilots make history but i i have about 1500 hours in this in this airplane yes yeah i think that guy was on the ship what i was it's really hard to do this to move these airplanes around to launch them to land them because we started out flying airplanes off of ships not too far after there were the first airplanes so we worked up from like you know one airplane then world war ii and then you know the jet age so we've become pretty good at it and it's really an art like the guy that sits in the seat is the aircraft handler and he's he's moving these things around and i bet you today it's still done like in an hour this we'll we would do like like the you know it could be like 20 25 maybe yeah and then like an hour and a half later you got to recover them all and then but you launch the next go so you launch another 25 and then you land the ones that are airborne look at that we gotta like access like a passageway maybe oh my eyes gotta adjust we need all the flashlights no there's no access there's one more you can go is there one more way down let me let's take a look ooh this is a possibility now no you ever hear the term can't get there from here hello thank you where you guys from oh cool phoenix we spent the night i saw the stuff down there was that fun did any ghosts come out of the midway i lived on this ship for two and a half years i have 299 landings on this on this aircraft carrier i also had one of the last landings ever on this ship you guys know what the midway is named after there you go some people say the island thank you nice to meet you the wires and this ship only had three arresting wires they sometimes they break and they'll cut you in half i remember sitting here with admiral bull when i was applying to test pilot school and he wanted to talk to me i wanted him to endorse my application but it was the only time i'd ever been in here this is the admiral's war room this is where they developed the operational plans for desert storm so we came in at 200 feet middle of the night right through here we're getting shot at triple a both sides both coasts so from the island and here and bullets skipping off the water in front of us i get a pop-up like remember them in the movie the top gun movie you know how they're doing that so i did a pop-up on this ship i had two sa-6s shot at me that night one blew up next to the airplane that was three of my 39. so we at the beginning of desert storm we went to general quarters and the ship did a brake turn and we're sitting in the ready room watching the flight deck and there's flares popping we just thought we had an inbound missile and we didn't but uh they the ship just lays over and is trying to avoid this missile that didn't exist this is the air traffic control tower we would have to stand up here as our squadron rep to basically get yelled at by the air boss this guy is a he's an a he's an aviator the air boss and the mini boss oh probably call him the mini boss because he'll be the boss one day right he's a guy like i was i was overhead the ship once and i'm over there getting ready to land and you know you're just waiting for them to launch all the airplanes f18 goes off the front of the ship eject eject eject and i look and you see the flash and the parachute air splash the airplane goes in the water these handrails are really slick so you don't really walk down the steps you actually slide down i mean you actually would pick you pick your feet up off the steps and you would just use your arms and you could slide down this is where you're getting your brief yeah this is this was this was our ready room this is the greeny board with your grades your landing grades but i used to be an lso so i'd be the guy who have to stand at the back of the ship and the lso is the one who gives a grave it's a one-way conversation yeah which usually isn't fun i mean i remember the skipper of 195 the hornet squadrons i gave i gave him like like a no grade one night and he threw his freaking knee board after so i brought this this midway patch into space with me and the uh and the intruder patch but scott altman is well known because he was in the first top gun movie he did a bunch of the flying and he was the guy who did the flying instead of tom cruise because tom cruise is in the simulator in the beginning they used to pitch a lot up and down and it was such a problem that they had to send it back to the to the shipyard to try to get it stopped doing that but when it started doing this the other problem with it is the angled deck was 13.9 13 degrees where something like the vinson is like 9 or 10 maybe i think it's 9. so but but so it's like 40 more of an angle the complication is when you line up behind the ship the ship is moving that way so you're you're landing where you're trying to land and you have to be really accurate and laying in the wires but it's all constantly moving to your right which is rather annoying okay i'll get your picture okay here we go thank you very much

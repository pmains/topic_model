pricipal I think you've hit on a key question Churchill once said the only thing worse than fighting with allies is trying to fight without allies and in my visits to Asia what I found is China has clients and customers we have allies and we don't take sufficient advantage of that and one of our recommendations is a new position of Assistant Secretary of State for international norms in cyberspace we've got a we've got to involve the rest of the world in setting what the guardrails are so if China violates them just as you said they're not just going to be facing some kind of sanctions from us but from the entire world and they're above all else sensitive to economic responses if it's a international economic response it's going to be a lot more powerful than it's just if it's unilateral from from our side so I think you're asking a key question I think part of the answer has to be what we've talked about in the report is the importance of elevating a norm setting and and talking about how we can provide some international guardrails to this kind of malicious activity

uh madam president i'm delighted to rise uh today in full support of catherine thai president biden's nominee to be our next u.s trade representative as my colleagues are well aware trade is an issue that impacts every corner of our country and indeed every corner of our globe my president roughly 75 percent listen to 75 percent of the world's purchasing power and over 95 percent of world's consumers lie outside of our borders lie outside of our country's borders if the united states is going to be continue to be successful we need to be able to tap into those markets and expand trading opportunities while ensuring a level playing field for american businesses and i might say for american consumers as well in delaware the first state and throughout our nation trade policies affect how american businesses both large and small be they financial services tech companies workers farmers manufacturers can compete in the global economy but thanks to tr president trump's haphazard trade wars over the last four years american farmers manufacturers producers and consumers too often have been left hanging in the balance a situation that has been exacerbated by this pandemic now more than ever all of them are in need of greater certainty and of predictability for the last 30 40 years that i've served as delaware's treasurer congressman governor and senator when i asked businesses what they want to need more often than not they see certainty and predictability and for the last four years we've had too little of both instead of the chaotic approach of the last four years we need strategic and thoughtful trade policies that's why president biden has nominated catherine ty an experienced public servant and trade expert to serve as our nation's top trade official catherine will be a steady hand at the u.s trade rep's office and as a key member of the biden administration she will make sure that our trade policies benefit all americans and leave no one behind she will work hard to help jump start our economy and ensure that american goods and services can reach international markets and that we can compete on a level playing field madam president catherine comes to this role with an exceptional breadth and depth of relevant trade expertise she's earned a remarkable reputation as an expert in her field and is a leader who is respected by democrats and republicans alike in this chamber and in the house of representatives in her previous role catherine was chief trade counsel for the house ways and means committee there she was the lead negotiator on the usmca u.s mexico canada america trade agreement which notably passed congress with an overwhelming bipartisan support in no small part because of her efforts members of my own staff were grateful grateful for the opportunity to work with catherine to secure historically strong environmental provisions including new monitoring enforcement tools in the usmca which will help make sure alleged environmental violations will be investigated and remedied investigated and limited in a timely manner these new tools and resources will help ensure that environmental protections are not just words on a piece of paper but policies will actually be put in to practice and consistently maintain well into the future as chairman of both the environment and public works committee and the finance subcommittee on international trade i look forward to working with my colleagues with catherine tai and her team to build on the progress that was made in us mca madam president another immense charity trade challenge that we face now is to effectively counter china's unfair trade practices and its expanding influence in international trade since joining the world trade organization the wto in 2001 china has proven to be a bad actor time and again i believe that working with our allies in the pacific rim and a spirit similar to the trans-pacific partnership we can more effectively ensure that china adheres to its trade commitments with us and with the rest of the world catherine has the expertise to help make that happen her prior experience as the u.s trade rep chief counsel for china trade and enforcement where she led efforts to hold china accountable at the wto for its unfair trade practices that's going to prove to be a tremendous asset for our nation madam president we'd be lucky to have catherine ty a committed public servant represent our nation on the world stage as the daughter of immigrants and the first woman of color to be nominated to serve as a u.s trade rep catherine often cites her parents also both public servants as her inspiration in her testimony the finance committee that i serve on mountain president catherine said and i want to quote her here's what she said she said i am proud speaking of our parents i'm proud of their service to our nation a nation that welcomed them and i'm proud to live in a country where in just one generation one generation their daughter could grow up to represent the united states in our interest around the globe close quote those are her words i too am proud to serve in a country where this is possible mad president simply put catherine has decades of experience and trade years of experience working in a trade in a bipartisan fashion and a keen understanding of the role congress can play alongside the administration to implement successful trade policies as the world grapples with the greatest economic downturn since the great depression it's more important now than ever to have a leader at the u s trade rep's office who will work with congress to advance a trade agenda that uplifts american workers in every corner of our country spurs domestic manufacturing and improves environmental and labor standards throughout the world given catherine's track record and many years of experience working across the aisle in congress madame president i'm confident that she has the broad support necessary to be a highly skilled and effective u.s trade representative she takes on the many trade challenges that we face i invite my colleagues to join me in voting to confirm catherine ty to serve as our next trade representative

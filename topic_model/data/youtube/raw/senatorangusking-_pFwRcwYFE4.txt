Thank You mr. chairman while in no way denigrating all the discussion that we've had today about staffing and training and adequacy and hours of work I think all those are contributors but I'm surprised I want to turn to an entirely different subject every boat in the Gulf of Maine has the radar on it that tells us when there's another boat within a mile or two miles or five miles an alarm goes off it shows up on your GPS how in the world does a billion-dollar destroyer not know that there's a freighter closing in on it I don't understand how this could possibly happen and I've talked to Maine lobster man they're scratching their heads they can tell when there's a flock of seagulls off their bow sir got the same questions it's very hard to understand what the sophisticated systems on board these warships that we let a ship get in that close and to the point of collision and so that is a a ship three ships three of these were collision with with urgent vessels yes sir I mean aren't there do you mean can you give me an answer specifically aren't there radar systems on these ships that would rather anything within the range there's a primary to backup radar that should detect those ships there are systems that can alert you at a particular range and so we have to find out what happened is there a black box on these ships like there is on an aircraft so we can determine what the sequence of events was we'll get to the sequence of events yes sir and the second question is don't we have sailors on the bridge with binoculars anymore required event to have lookouts and we have lookouts on the watch team on the bridge is there and the other question is about the radar of these ships that ran into us is there some technology that they couldn't see us are these are we using a stealth technology they do anything you can answer in an open setting sir I mean it wouldn't surprise anybody I think that we design our warships to have a lower radar cross-section I mean it's it's um designed to be very low right so that degree of stealth makes us more effective from a warfighting standpoint but that also imposes a burden if you will crew of that ship to understand that they are low-observable and that they may not be as easily seen as something that is as large as a destroyer it'll have a radar cross-section of a ship that's much smaller or if they're not in a conflict situation to emit some kind of signal to a that's been an immediate action is that there is this automatic identification system a I asked that the secretary mentioned and we had I think a distorted perception of operational security that we kept that system secure off in our on our warships one of the immediate actions following these incidents is that particularly in heavily trafficked in trafficked areas like we just can't turn it on like you can man right you can look outside and see the ship and so it's not an operational security station so you can't report to us today any results of the investigation into what happened with the non performance of the radar system so specific SAR forthcoming forthcoming soon as soon as the investigations are complete yes sir all right let me turn from this subject for for a moment to maintenance I think the testimony from our friend from the GAO was that the maintenance capacity is not adequate and that therefore we have ships that are in port too long and that puts a strain on the ships that are left at sea is that is that accurate I think mr. Pendleton painted that exact picture the the words he used were vicious cycle and I would agree that's a good characteristic of that because these ships are expensive as you know and and anytime you have a capital object that's that's expensive secretary Spencer you know from your business experience you want it you wanted to operate and it's do we need to be talking about increasing the capacity of the maintenance yards to to cut down on that time off the ocean if you will I'll go first I think that there's no doubt that we could use the increased maintenance capacity right now we are leveraging every ounce of capacity I think across the nation both public and private to execute the maintenance that we but if we're doing if we're if we're executing on every ounce of capacity and it's not adequate it sounds to me like we need marketing lor yes sir and is that in plans anywhere is that in any submissions of budgetary priorities and in the future well one of the other reports that mr. Pendleton just recently reviewed was a report on our shipyards and so how to increase the capacity through modernizing our shipyards we work closely with the private sector to have these discussions all the time in terms of how do we increase that capacity so it's something that has our attention yes sir one final question on the technology I would urge that a standard practice ought to be for these location or radar that keep an eye on what's in the vicinity that if they're there a there should be an alarm it's I'm sure there is and be it should ring in the captains quarters if anything comes within whatever the set distance is it's it's really unacceptable in this day and age with the technology that we have to have something like this happen regardless of the of the wider issues now this is just unacceptable from a from of just a modern seamanship point of view it seems to me sorry I agree with you 100% and that's why I'm fighting the tendency to characterize this and certainly there are tearing down forces that are broader we've discussed many of those today but this will go to you know proper operation of your equipment fundamentals of watch standing those are the things that we have to look at thank you Thank You mr. chairman

kentucky senator rand paul is here exclusively senator good to have you with us uh today you uh tweeted i have been targeted multiple times now it is reprehensible that twitter allows sealess celebrities referring to marx to advocate for violence against me and my family but let's start with where this investigation is now any information on who may have sent you this letter with the white powder no they will investigate it it's hard to find people to send those the mail but they do sometimes and they will continue to look but for you know people like this uh you know songwriter from a long time ago that no one's ever heard of you know the thing is is that hundreds of people on twitter every day are wishing me violence wishing my family violence twitter claims that they have a policy but they don't take it down they leave it up twitter's now announced today this guy doesn't violate their policy so he's allowed to offer to buy drinks to somebody you know i almost died at one time from the infections and from the lung surgery that i had and they're allowed to go on twitter every day this company allows them to go and it's a private company so they can do it if they want but this is a private company that basically hates conservatives hates republicans they don't want us on there and ultimately the answer maybe is republicans need to just quit we just need to leave it because every day they allow hundreds if not thousands of people to wish me and my family violence and frankly i'm tired of it you know i'm just i'm just tired of them allowing this and i'm tired of them blaming it on the right i was at the ball field when a bernie sanders shooter almost killed steve scalise wounded five other people so i'm i'm sick and tired of the violence coming from the left then i'm sick and tired of the left-wing press then blaming it all on donald trump or on me or others so i'm tired of it you know you make an excellent point and you know when i think about people who i've heard of and known who you know retweeted an article or something and then suddenly they get shut down and you look at this stuff that has been coming at you and i think you you it's understandable that you feel that there should be some ramifications for this the problem is there's no standard it's so arbitrary they just sort of decide whether or not they like something or someone and they're okay with it so somebody um you know tweeted about uh about what mr marx wrote and then he you know says back to this guy john dennis you see johnny bob you know and he goes after him he says i never incited i never incited or even suggested that anyone be violent he talks about trump and mar loco um you know what do you say to his claim that he never suggested anybody do any violence towards you well you know i had six ribs broken three of them uh dislocated where they rubbed on each other for weeks and weeks till they healed they damaged my lung i had pneumonia twice a year later i was coughing up blood then had to have a portion of my lung removed then got an infection in the space between the lung and the chest wall and almost died from that and have permanent scarring of my lung and he's offering a guy to buy drinks if somebody will do it again and finish the job that sounds to me like he's advocating violence sounds like he's a despicable human but think also about what he's angry about he's an irrational idiot he's angry because i'm not getting vaccinated well guess what in india there's not enough vaccines do you think we should be debating whether people in india should be getting the vaccine who have already had the disease or whether we should save the vaccine for those who have not gotten the disease this is a discussion that is a public health discussion that could save millions of lives in israel they discovered that those who had gotten the disease survived equally well to those who had gotten the vaccine it's about the same so when there's not enough vaccine for the world the advice to the countries who don't have enough vaccine is incredibly important millions of lives depend on it and that's the idea that i have that you should vaccinate first those who have not had the disease and let the people have had the disease count on their natural immunity nobody wants to get infected but if you've been infected you have some natural immunity this should not be a political issue they should not want to kill me and send and i hear you i don't understand the anger over this and i also don't understand why we're doing so much national testing why aren't we testing people for antibodies so that they can decide you know well that i guess i can wait a little while i have some natural immunity perhaps it should go to someone in india as you well point out who maybe needs the vaccine more than i do the fact that this has this drives people to such anger is i i think i don't know i just said something uh about our society last thought no thinking everything's one size fits all we're all lemmings pound the round peg in a square hole nobody's allowed to have the freedom to make their choices and it's a sad day for america if we let this group thing take over senator paul thank you very much good to see you as always thanks for coming back on thanks

hello i'm deb fischer united states senator from Nebraska although I'm only in my second year I've already figured out the secret to ending Washington gridlock a republican-led Senate to change direction our country needs a change in leadership it's time to say so long to Harry Reid and hello to a new Republican Senate Majority Leader Louisiana is the key to making that happen the Democrats are using the same old tired playbook to keep the status quo they've pulled out all the stops from scaring seniors to waging a phony war on women that's why women voters are so important in this election especially here in Louisiana too often the Democrats tell us what women's issues are well guess what women don't need to be told what's our issue and what's not we care about jobs we care about our kids education we care about a strong military and we care about economic growth at the end of the day women and men just want good paying jobs to support their families the democrat-led Senate has failed them bill Cassidy understands these priorities and he's committed to working hard on behalf of middle-class families he has a record to prove it bill is lucky to have his wife dr. Laura Cassidy by his side and Laura's expertise as a health care provider will no doubt shape bills efforts to repeal and replace President Obama's failed healthcare experiment thank you for all of your support of Louisiana Republicans and I ask for your help in taking back the Senate thank you

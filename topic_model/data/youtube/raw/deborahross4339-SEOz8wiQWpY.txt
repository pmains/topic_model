I'M PROUD TO OVER AN AMENDMENT   TO THIS BILL WHICH WOULD   PROHIBIT THE USE OF FUNDS THAT   WOULD IMPLEMENT THE OFFSHORE   COMPONENT OF THIS MORATORIUM   WHILE LEAVING IT ON OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS LEASING IN PLACE.  THIS IS ESSENTIAL TO MEET OUR  STATE AND NATIONAL CLIMATE   GOALS. MY SECOND AMENDMENT HIGHLIGHTS   THE OBSTACLES FACED BY PREGNANT  AND PARENTING STUDENTS.  TODAY NEARLY 22% OF  UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS ARE   PARENTS. PREGNANT AND PARENTING STUDENTS  FACE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS IN   EDUCATION FROM DIFFICULTY  ACCESSING COLLEGE, TO  INSUFFICIENT CHILDCARE, TO LACK  OF HOLISTIC SUPPORTS.  AS A RESULT, PREGNANT AND  PARENTING STUDENTS EXPERIENCE  DISPROPORTIONATELY LOW   GRADUATION RATES, AS WELL AS A   MEDIAN DEBT THAT'S NEARLY 2 1/2  TIMES HIGHER THAN THAT OF  STUDENTS WITHOUT CHILDREN. PREGNANT AND PARENTING HIGH  SCHOOL STUDENTS TOO FREQUENTLY   FIND THEMSELVES PUSHED OUT OF  SCHOOL ENTIRELY. MY AMENDMENT INSTRUCTS THE   INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION SCIENCES  TO CONDUCT A STUDY ON THE  OBSTACLES PREGNANT AND PARENTING STUDENTS FACE IN THE PURSUIT OF  EDUCATION. AND PROVIDES RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING --   THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLELADY IS RECOGNIZED FOR 30  SECONDS. MS. ROSS: THANK YOU, MR.   CHAIRMAN.

now i want to talk about what we're doing uh focusing right now because on page 125 uh the cbo talks about uh the impact on the labor market on labor demand today uh and it says and i quote on balance the cbo estimates that the aca will boost overall demand for goods and services over the next few years and then you go on to say the net increase in demand for goods and services will in turn boost demand for labor over the next few years that's a conclusion you make right yes that's right so when you boost demand for labor in this kind of economy you actually reduce the unemployment rate because those people who are looking for work can find more work right yes that's right so i just for for all the media who uh you know shot across the headlines this idea that somehow the affordable care act uh was going to hurt jobs i just want it to be very clear that the director of the congressional budget office says for this year and the next couple years actually it will help reduce unemployment more people who are looking for work will find work as a result of the affordable care act so in fact dr elmendorf if you were to repeal the affordable care act your projected unemployment rate for this year would go up right well uh so so mr constantly be clear that so we've not broken down the sizes of the various pieces that we talk about in this act so i don't have any estimates of the effects of of the particular channel you point to but that channel you point to is in fact something that we think spurs employment and would reduce unemployment over the next few years right okay so you know it is it is a factor and as a result if you reduce if you reveal the affordable care act you will at least in the near term increase the unemployment rate because there will be less demand for jobs and over the longer term because the affordable care act uh reduces the deficit you will actually spur economic growth uh as the economy continues uh to recover uh now uh i think it's really important that that information gets out there because uh as as the media themselves have confessed um they bought hook line and sinker some of the talking points from our republican colleagues uh and unfortunately misrepresentations go around the world three times before the truth begins to catch up but maybe it will begin to catch up at this point

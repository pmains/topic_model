morning everyone is Sunday February 12th Congressman Jay coffee Claus is here with us this morning let's go on the record now in his second term on Capitol Hill he has been named to a select committee on China and at a critical time he's also talking AI to the house floor what more can we expect the congressants and the Charities here this morning let's go on the record from WCVB Channel 5 the inside word from Washington to Beacon Hill today's newsmakers are going on the record welcome to OTR everyone I'm Ed Harding along with News Enterprise great to have you with us this morning and we're pleased to have Congressman Jay coffee class with us at the table as you can see Democrat from Newton represented the state's fourth congressional district elected to a second term last November he is the Marine commanding infantry in Afghanistan in 2012 also holds degrees from Harvard and MIT it's great to see you sir thanks for your time good to be with you as always happy is it too late to say happy new year or no you can say it all because it's the first time I've seen it so happy New Year to you as well welcome so let's start with China you've been named to a select committee on China and this comes at a critical moment we're still unpacking the information that came from the China spy balloon shooting it down was one thing finding out how much Intel China had gathered is another now this is obviously no small incursion how hard do you think the U.S should hit back on this I think the president has responded appropriately as a Statesman should he had three objectives when that balloon violated American airspace number one uphold the sovereignty of U.S airspace he did that by shooting it down number two maximize counterintelligence opportunities by jamming it and then recovering the sensitive assets and then number three of course protect protect property and lives on the ground nobody was injured this was a strong show by the commander-in-chief do you think that he waited too long to take that steps that's been the criticism from the other side no I don't and that goes into number two which was maximize counterintelligence opportunities it actually is valuable to be able to see how it operates and to be able to jam it and see it in action and then be able to recover it over water where we have a higher likelihood of actually getting the sensitive surveillance assets themselves what does this say about China's president she that he would do something so in your face like this it underscores that the CCP is increasingly aggressive and the urgency of this select committee which I'm really excited to be a part of it's a generally generational opportunity for us to chart sound strategy that rises above day-to-day partisan politics and really looks at how do we out compete what is going to be the biggest geopolitical adversary for the United States in the 21st century so so to be clear you feel that he that the United States shot it down appropriately waiting to look it off the coast of Carolina rather than taking it out in Alaska or Montana or anywhere along the way I do with the information we have right now I do think the commander-in-chief handled it effectively now listen I was a lieutenant a captain a major you learn that every Mission has an after action after the mission and this should have an after action review as well where everyone takes their ranks off and you look at the information you have and if things need to be improved then we should improve them and that shouldn't be partisan that should be about National Security we're talking about and and Putin of Russia the circle closed captioning not available right now the United States needs to continue to stand with ukrainians as they fight on the front lines of the Free World this is about sending a stark message to the authoritarian regime in the Kremlin and in Beijing and in Tehran and elsewhere that the United States stands on the side of freedom and democracy our investment in ukrainians has paid dividends for the rules-based order that we helped architect after World War II it has helped strengthen NATO and our alliances with East Asia and it has cratered a third to a half of conventional Russian military capacity while increasing the domestic defense spending of our allies this has been a positive for Global Security for the Free World and yet and yet we do need to find a way to bring this to a peaceful conclusion but the facts on the ground need to drive the negotiations at the bargaining table and right now the ukrainians are still trying to change the facts on the ground all right well let's get your thoughts on the State of the Union President Biden went heavy on domestic issues the economy notched a major win by turning the tables on Republicans looking to cut Social Security and Medicare is the president's focus on issues at home the right strategy right now yes it was a positive optimistic speech and his focus on issues at home I think is appropriate because let's wind back the clock two years remember where we were he took office with the worst crisis in our democracy since the Civil War I mean we're talking about China XI jinping's best day was January 6 2021. he took office with of course a public health catastrophe he took office with a very challenging economic situation these were fundamentally problems domestically with the United States and we have made such progress in those last two years we've invested in infrastructure science manufacturing we have passed electoral count act reform to prevent a repeat of January 6th we have gotten tough on Russia and other authoritarian actors the president had a lot to talk about in this state of the union do you think do you think it's resonating with the American public a recent poll showed most people don't think he's done enough I think the contrast is resonating with the American public what we saw was a president who said here's what we've done let's finish the job who extended his hand to bipartisan collaboration and he got booed and jeered in return well let's talk about that the Republicans who heckled him during the State of the Union um you know that was sort of a contentious start to this uh to this year what are you seeing on the ground in in the house what I'm seeing on the ground in the house is that the House GOP says we care about the deficit and we're going to get serious about spending so what do they do the very first bill that they pass increases the deficit by 100 billion dollars while allowing the wealthy and well-connected to evade taxes they then take hostage the full faith and credit of the United States by saying they're not going to raise the debt limit ceiling which they did multiple times for Donald Trump but they don't present a coherent plan for it Kevin McCarthy says well listen I'm not cutting this this this this or this I'm not going to raise taxes I mean math is a is a cruel thing it actually you have to be able to present a plan forward hasn't done it so President Biden has said yeah come to me with a budget and we'll and will negotiate and instead all they know how to do is Boo and jeer and so I think it was well distressing for someone who cares about the decorum of the house actually important for Americans to see live themselves what the president as a Statesman has to work with now I want to be clear I'm not saying that we can't get bipartisan wins I look at uh gun safety Last Congress electoral count act reform infrastructure but you think those those interactions were important for the American public to see absolutely because it demonstrates where the GOP is heading if they don't fix themselves they have an authoritarian Wing that is not interested in governing they're interested in performing for their base and we have Joe Biden who has gotten real wins who wants to finish the job and is willing to work in good faith in in many ways those years the president almost used it as fuel he didn't seem to be frightened shaken it it at all at first to it he confronted it and he got consensus on the floor well that was the amazing thing is it's worth noting where the GOP got angriest right it wasn't over sort of the culture War stuff it was over his assertions factual I will say yeah that they want to cut Social Security and Medicare yeah and then I think it'll hit a little close to home and they got very upset and he said well good we're agreed then we're going to protect Social Security and Medicare for generations to come it was pretty good real time so let's let's talk about the world we're in high tech so you made headlines everywhere when you delivered a speech on the house floor about a bill that would create a U.S Israel Artificial Intelligence Center now here is the speech take a look at it we must collaborate with International Partners like the Israeli government to ensure that the United States maintains a leadership role in AI research and development and responsibly explores the many possibilities evolving Technologies provide now in every way shape Manner and form it's just a typical speech on the on the on the floor of the house but it was generated by the online AI chatbot chat GPT so why did you choose to take this up this way and and what's been the what's what have been the Ripple effects what's been the reaction to it I wanted to start a conversation in Congress about this technology I am the youngest parent in the Democratic caucus this technology is going to be a general purpose technology for my kids going forward I worked in the tech sector for years before coming to Congress I've been keeping a close eye on it and I saw over the last 18 months that we're hitting an inflection point where this is getting really good really fast and Congress cannot allow AI to get ahead of us the way we did social media we can all think back to 2005 2010 when these social media companies were small and Scrappy and then they grew so fast they got rich so fast they took over our discourse in a way that I think on reflection we wanted more say over AI has that same potential it's a tool can be used for good or for ill but policy makers need to be purposeful and proactive about putting the guidelines in place all right and so and we have another tech question that takes us back to China do you think Tick Tock which is hugely popular here in the US should be banned I'm concerned about Tick Tock we need to do a full investigation the Chinese Communist Party absolutely has a uh a vein of data coming from Tick Tock that is potentially scraping Americans personal networks so it should be banned I think we need an investigation I'm not willing to slap the table yet but I'm deeply skeptical and on the other point too I may even be more concerned which is its effect on kids emotional and cognitive development are we all sure that we want 12 13 14 year olds swiping videos for hours on an end I don't think so Congressman Jake Austin's with us were on the record stay with us

another job we need to be focused on right now that seems to be slipping away from us is the opportunity to have another package on how to get people back to school how to get people back to work how to get people back to child care and better health i've thought and told several of you over the last several weeks i really thought the first of october was sort of the deadline where we could make that package happen i hope we can really get focused here and not assume that somehow the economy can struggle along the schools can do whatever they need to do that hospitals will continue to do their work and other health care providers if we just simply decide not to act if you take the targeted package that we voted on in the senate the problem solvers package put together in the house of democrats and republicans and even the house republican proposal there is clearly a deal there to be had we don't need to let this limp along as we finish out this election year and see then what we can do after the election we need to deal with that now i hope we can still figure out a way to take all of those elements that there's broad agreement on and come up with whatever that agreement is

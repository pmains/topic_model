yields back ms bonamici thank you mr chairman congratulations dr king on your nomination i wish you an expeditious path through that process i know today is budget and tomorrow is every student succeeds act but i want to for a moment follow up on ms wilson's comments about the student support and academic enrichment grant program you know we authorized 1.65 billion for these formula block grants but the department budget requests only about a third of that amount and also proposes making the grants competitive the distribution formula was designed to protect against some of the concerns of consolidating programs so i'm concerned about that so i have a two-part question first can you talk about the disruption that could be caused by making these grants competitive there's a lot of potential from these formula grants to sustain meaningful changes and and second i appreciate the challenges of designing a budget that adequately funds programs but i i must tell you i'm currently circulating a letter to my colleagues urging their support in an attempt to fully fund this program at its authorized level so uh are you confident that these additional dollars if we are successful in that request will be put to good use in our local school districts so the the concern about the disruption and will these dollars be put to good use and i do want to save time for a higher ed question quickly thanks for the question i you know i i believe very strongly in the programs that title iv is intended to support uh whether it's school counseling or the work to ensure that school environments are safe and supportive or the work to ensure that students have access to a well-rounded education that includes the arts and physical education or access to advanced coursework like ap classes so that that's hugely important and we think states and districts have the opportunity to make good use of those title four dollars as i mentioned earlier you know our proposal is an increase over the funding that was in the four uh prior grant programs in 16 and so it is a significant increase we think 500 million dollars is good start again we were working as you referenced within the within the budget agreement caps certainly look forward to working with you on this question and with this committee as the budget process moves forward uh the priorities behind title four are ones that we share i think one of the challenges in administration will be ensuring that the grants are of sufficient size that districts can make good use of them to support exactly the intended programs i appreciate that we we've seen i've seen over my years though that the competitive grant process oftentimes puts you know smaller rural districts uh and underfunded districts at a disadvantage moving on to higher education first in response to mr salmon's uh comments on student loans i want to remind him that congress we set the interest rate so i know my side of the i'll certainly willing to work with him and all of you on that side of the aisle to lower those rates so that the federal government isn't profiting off of repayment so um i also uh like you had student loans i worked my way through college and last congress i introduced the opportunities for success act i'll be reintroducing to provide resources for low-income college students to participate in meaningful internships so i'm really interested in the president's budget proposal for directing work study aid to students most in need so if you could address that and also i wanted to mention a bipartisan effort i'm leading to give student loan borrowers the option to have their income information automatically certified for income based repayment plans and my hope is that the department will work with my office and the irs to make it easier for borrowers to choose to have their loan payments automatically based on their income so can you talk about your commitment to this effort please as well as that work-study aid issue sure so let me say that the the challenge that we have as a country is for sure helping one of the major challenges we have is helping students think through how to manage their student debt it's one of the reasons we've been focused on the income-based repayment plans for direct loans so that we can cap uh the amount of money that students need to pay at uh 10 of their discretionary income so that so that students can manage their debt it's one of the reasons we think it's so important to have good information for students at the outset about their options about the cost of their degree about their likely income when they leave a particular program we are very interested in working with you on issues around work study work study can be transformative for students both in terms of the ways that it helps them to make their way through college but also work study is supporting students doing very important public service activities on many campuses allowing students to really engage with with community outside of their university many students can trace why they became a teacher why they went into public service to experiences they had through work study so hugely important program eager to work with you on that and certainly eager to work with you on how we make the income based repayment program as efficient as possible and increase participation in that program as much as possible look forward to working with you thank you yield back thank you mr

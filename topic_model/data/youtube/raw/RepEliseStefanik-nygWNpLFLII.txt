Thank You mr. chairman I have three questions and I'm hoping to get through all three so I'll start with you general Alexander you helped build Cyber Command what steps do we need to take in this year's NDAA process to mature Cyber Command and then look forward five years what does Cyber Command need to look like five years from now I think first the unified command is the right next step get them to a unified command I think the rules of engagement discussion that we have is the second thing that I would push it the third is with government as a whole including Cyber Command how do we defend the country how do we as a government work together to defend this nation and bring it out and have a public discourse on how we're going to do that don't go into the tools and all that but talk about why the information that's being shared is necessary to defend this country thank you for that my second question has to do with emerging technologies when we consider what the world of cyber looks like quite soon I think of threats like AI and quantum computing what how do these technologies play into future of cyber warfare and what we need to be thinking about as policymakers I'll start with you mr. Chertoff well I think on on AI as with most technologies there's an upside in the downside there's no question from a threat standpoint the ability of an adversary to automate the ability to test and try to break into a network or even to use that for kinetic purposes increases the threat but the good news is I think particularly if you use behavioral analytics AI can be a good way of defending the network in depth which is what we need to do quantum computing I think it raises some issues about encryption and encryption is a major security tool there's a view however that quantum computing could eventually make it very easy to penetrate encryption it may also be the case though that it may be a tool to actually enhance encryption so in both of these cases I think we have to watch carefully to make sure that to the extent the threat is increasing we are using these technologies to increase our resistance general Alexander I'll go to next but I want to also add an additional question relate are we under investing in these spaces yeah I was gonna hit just on that Mississippi I think first we have to lead globally in quantum computing an AI the the country that is the leader in those two technologies will be the future superpower that needs to be us and so we aren't investing enough and this is a huge area and there are some great experts in government at classified levels in both and I would encourage you to to get with those I think in quantum computing what secretary Chertoff said is exactly right both good and bad AI the same thing and you've seen Elon Musk and gates go at this both pro and con I think the good part of it it will help us South cancer and other things and I think there's a tremendous good the bad parts it means your decision cycle is going to be extremely fast in cyber and the attacks are going to grow so we have to be ready for that mr. Johnson I agree with what Keith just said I think that we need to invest in cyber talent in the federal workforce all of our best talent at DHS the people that I can actually explain this to me get stolen into the private sector because they're able to pay multiples of what we pay in the federal government Congress has done some things to enhance our ability to hire cyber talent but I think that's definitely a work in progress thank you and my last question I'll try to get through quickly each of you have testified the importance of improving interagency coordination and information sharing I want to drill down into the specifics what specific actions can we take from the hasp perspective to improve this interagency collaboration and ensure that we are improving our readiness so one suggestion and actually back in 2008 general Alexander and I talked about this would actually really create to co-locate representatives of the three major government agencies in a setting that would allow them to have a common operating picture in real time about what's going on we actually built a integrated cyber center up the court need where you would see the center of some of that and so I would encourage that and build that common operating picture so that you can see the attacks and each part of government could coordinate what their response would be right DHS is actually built in integrated cyber center - called the N kick the national cyber communications integration Center and it's an intern agency operation and I think we need to bolster that and improve upon that thank you my time is about to expire I appreciate the answers

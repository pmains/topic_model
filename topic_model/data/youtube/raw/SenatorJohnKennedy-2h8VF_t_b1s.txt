madam president i uh i want to just spend a few minutes today saying goodbye to a friend um louisiana weeps right now governor charles e romer iii passed away last week he went by buddy he served for uh our state from 1988 to 1992. before that he served a number of terms in congress i guess i guess madam president i'm biased because buddy buddy brought me to the dance if you will i was sitting in my office in new orleans practicing law earning a good living you know thinking about happy hour on a friday afternoon and governor romer had just been elected and he asked me to come up to baton rouge and work as his legal counsel and i did and i stayed for four years and i like government service and i've been in it off and on since then but he was one of the but he was extremely i say was i want to say is because he lives with us but he was one of the most and he is one of the most complex interesting people i've ever met he he was immeasurably talented he was raised on a on a cotton farm it wasn't really a farm because his parents and his family they were they were all so accomplished they they put together a cotton farm with their own sweat and and blood and some free enterprise capital of about 10 000 acres in north louisiana that's a lot of that's a big farm in louisiana but the kids all worked including buddy they didn't have a television mr budgie his dad miss adeline his mom would require the kids in their in their free time to read books and boy it stuck with buddy i never saw him without a book i'd ride with him to go to a speech he'd have a book in the car and he'd read it driving over there um he went to harvard when he was 16. he would have gone sooner harvard offered him a position but his mom and dad said you're too young you gotta you gotta stick around and he stayed at harvard for graduate school buddy was how can i put this buddy was was one of the first real intellectual governors we ever had in louisiana i'm not putting down our other governors i'm not because all of our governors have been intelligent just like in your state you don't rise to that position without being intelligent but buddy truly believed in the power of ideas and uh he he truly believed in the worth of education i've used his words often he used to say kennedy future in louisiana is education it's not the price of oil it's not the unemployment rate it's not who the governor is it's education and he'd say that time and time again during his four years when he became governor we had we had a seven billion dollar budget we had a one billion dollar deficit that's what he was left with roamer balanced budget wasn't easy but he did and then he implemented fiscal reforms that dramatically totally changed our way of budgeting louisiana for generations to come because of buddy's efforts he announced in louisiana and this was heresy at the time i'm going to find out which of our teachers can teach and by god i'm going to pay him and he said but i'm also going to find out which of our teachers can't teach and i'm going to either teach them how or tell them to find a new line of work boy was that revolutionary and he did it um he totally rewrote our campaign finance laws when buddy became governor there was no reporting of campaign money somebody if you're running for office somebody could bring you a suitcase full of cash two hundred thousand dollars and it was perfectly legal you didn't have to report it and if you if you got the money on a thursday if you decided on a friday you weren't going to run you would do it from the race you could keep it you could keep it but it completely rewrote all of that now you have to report every penny in every penny out there's a cap on contributions no cash and we enforce it it changed our politics dramatically um i'll tell you one quick story that epitomizes the buddy i knew there was there was a central piece of his education program i won't bore you with the details it had to do with higher education and it was key to our future and we really need the pat needed to pass it and i i had i was handling lobbying it for the governor and we we needed one more vote in the senate one more vote to pass this this landmark bill and this one senator he said kennedy i'll vote for it if you if you'll have the governor give me this project so i was all excited i went back to see the governor i said governor i think i got put together it was a road project i said call over to our department of transportation and see what they think and the folks at the department of transportation said yes we can do it but if we do it we'll all go to jail so i saw man so i go back and i tell governor romer and i was young but i was passionate and i said governor we can't do it and he said i agree we're not going to do that i said but listen this is so important this particular senator lies to us all the time let me just lie to him let me just go to him and tell him we'll do it we'll get his vote and then i'll go back to him later and say we changed our mind the end does justify the means i'll never forget but he says no we're not doing that and i argued with him but he found he just looked kennedy i made my decision we're not doing it that way um i'm gonna really miss buddy he wasn't a perfect guy i told him one time i said governor if i were back in law practice in the private sector and you came to me as a private client i'd represent you but i would quadruple my hourly rate he could be he was he was so smart but but he could be very opinionated tip o'neill gave buddy his uh his uh sort of his slogan phrase tip o'neill described then congressman roman one time he said congressman romer often wrong never in doubt um but i'm gonna really miss buddy all he ever wanted to do was change louisiana and he did he wasn't re-elected but he did but buddy always understood this was his barometer of success he used to tell me say kennedy here's how you know when you're doing a good job if you're making the right people mad so you say if you if nobody's mad at you and if the right people like what you the wrong people like what you're doing you're not doing your job so he did make people mad and it cost him his reelection but he changed louisiana and louisiana weeps and when i count my blessings i count buddy romer twice thank you madam chair

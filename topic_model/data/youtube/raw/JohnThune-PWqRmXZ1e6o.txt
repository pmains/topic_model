in the last two years Democrats used their total control of Washington to pursue a partisan agenda that sharply increased costs on families weakened our energy Independence and undermined our national security at the southern border and abroad thankfully with a new Republican majority in the House of Representatives Congress can now block the worst impulses of the Biden Administration and its far left allies the reality of a divided government means that compromise will be required in order to address the many challenges facing our country I'm optimistic the members of both parties can come together to bolster our energy security create new opportunities for farmers and ranchers increase transparency and accountability in big Tech and prioritize our most important responsibility the Safety and Security of the American people to achieve these goals Congressional Republicans are ready to roll up our sleeves and get to work we hope President Biden will join us

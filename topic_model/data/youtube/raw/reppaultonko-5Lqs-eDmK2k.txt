representative pokan it's uh great to join you in this hour of uh discussion about the fast track method uh that's been associated with uh trade negotiations and uh with fair trade free trade concepts alike i represent a district in upstate new york the 20th congressional district which is primarily the the confluence of the hudson and mohawk river valleys and it was there that we became the donor area to the erie canal they gave birth to a westward movement for this nation and sparked an industrial revolution and it was there that we saw the development of a necklace of communities dubbed mill towns that then rose as the epicenters of invention and innovation that saw manufacturing uh booming as we went forward as a nation and many an immigrant called that their new home that region their new home and they tethered their american dream to the prosperity that was continuing to grow in the region and i think back of the manufacturing sector in all that it meant to my ancestors all it meant to me and the opportunities that came into my life and it was that empowerment that came through the availability of work the dignity of work the opportunity to earn a paycheck that really made a difference and i think of those same towns today having really lost millions of jobs across america were reflective of all of those towns that became those manufacturing centers that enabled people again to age uh meaningful employment and to be able to have those dreams those american dreams fully fully strengthened by the opportunity for work when i see the reduction of standards of environmental standards where we're willing to have our children exploited by the ugly sins of the past with concerns for child labor laws that might erode when we think about some of the inequities that are brought to bear with the denial of collective bargaining all of these items have snuck into trade negotiations and that the importance here for congress to be able to provide the oversight and the assessment of these of these various negotiations where we can look at these these trade deals and uh suggest amendments or have sound debate you know we not only have a right as members of congress i think the public that we represent has a need for congress to review these documents and to suggest improvements so i look forward to this hour of discussion where you and i and our several colleagues will join together in speaking to the wisdom or lack thereof of some of the processes that have followed this entire trade discussion and we're talking about a trade deficit now that has ballooned beyond belief be into record proportions and where we're putting our economy and that american dream at risk and where we're denying meaningful employment to those whom we represent here in washington so i thank you for leading us in this hour of discussion and i know that the information that we will exchange will be very critical and important to people who will be airing in to this discussion and allowing them to trade those exchange those ideas with their given elected representatives so with that i yield back and thank you for leading us in this important discussion sure well and thank

last week congressman you had you went actually attended a hearing because you didn't need to see what was going on you only needed to hear what's going on but and that and that day you said you know when you go to war sometimes this is what happens that is what he takes from this experience he hopes to be on the road the end of may but his office never shut down they continue to do the people's business he says we raised our right hand and then we asked to go to war and sometimes this is what happens but for now even a blind knuckle dragger can uh can do a hearing so here i am uh and let's get to work i've been back to doing hearings again for a while now um you know didn't didn't miss a beat when it comes to official duties after a full week spit lying face down to allow a gas bubble to press his tattered but surgically repaired retina in place congressman dan crenshaw is slowly steadily returning to duty i think i'll be back to some sense of normalcy in a few weeks as this as this bubble goes down and i can see a little bit better get around a little bit better and um you know we'll be back to normal in no time back to traveling in a in three to four weeks i think and uh you know back to planning that fourth of july party that i promised everybody i'm lucky it's a true miracle and maybe part of that is the good positive vibes and prayers around me i don't think anyone i know including us would ever change anything i don't think we'd change anything for the world wouldn't change any of our experiences they make you stronger they give you perspective and this is just yet another obstacle that uh reminds you of that perspective

Jersey is recognized thank you Mr chairman as a country we need to consider I believe how we regulate outbound Investments of critical sectors as part of our broader economic resiliency strategy the coveted pandemic revealed structural weaknesses in the United States supply chain and we're still feeling the pain of those vulnerabilities today so Professor dansman what were some of the consequences of having so much of our critical production abroad particularly in countries like China foreign thank you for the question um I think that when we think specifically about the supply chain shocks that we experience because of covid we should separate out what were demand shocks plus Supply shocks of um of zero covet policy versus National Security concerns for extended periods of time right so the chips act in particular has been working to you know the idea behind that is to Inc to bring back some Supply and to diversify the supply chain so that we're not over reliant on just a few nodes in the chip supply chain but I think that kind of we want to be careful to not over learn the example of the covid pandemic which was very much about shocks to the system that are now working themselves out yeah but it's interesting shock to the system that we're working out but at the same time we had doctors and nurses who had to improvise in the creation of personal protective gear as we struggled to get it from other parts of the world uh I don't know what the next virus will be there'll be one at some point hopefully not but at some point there will be one and we have to think about that let me ask you would a lack of a comprehensive outbound investment strategy for certain critical sectors mitigate the benefits of recent efforts to strengthen our supply chains well I think when we consider the reasons why firms move overseas it's normally because of commercial commercial viability in the U.S and so if the goal of the Congress is to ensure that we retain some amount of domestic capabilities there are other measures that we should use Beyond prohibiting outbound investment to actually help on the side of making those types of investments in the U.S commercially viable okay well I believe our lock a lack of outbound investment oversight in the sensitive Industries has the potential to uh hamper the competitiveness of our firms practices such as intellectual property theft are all too common in parts of the world especially China which harm the ability of U.S firms that are playing by the rules to compete so Mr Fato Mr ashush how has the stolen intellectual property in countries like China degraded our economic competitiveness and National Security thank you for the question Senator it's an incredibly important issue it's it it it's hard to measure how it's degraded because regrettably it's not limited only to China uh intellectual property theft is a global issue quite frankly uh which makes it all the harder to to deal with and it and during my time at bis um we were often confronted with the question that in the presence of Ip an IP violation should we then take an export action and that was a reasonable request uh uh because the ability to deal with IP theft in the courts is insufficient um the the bomb's already gone off the information's already been proloned and even if you pursue legal action how do you how do you undo that you can't really discourage the IP export controls as a solution to that are not ideal so it is worth us contemplating how how else to get at it because the legal system it's it's important it's necessary it needs to be used but it doesn't necessarily solve the problem [Music] uh sir thank you for the question I'll just add um recently FBI director Ray commented that every 12 hours the FBI is opening a new investigation related to espionage or hacking or something that relates to to theft of intellectual property um the FBI actually has a on its website a wheel of Doom I'll call it that that lists all the the different ways that the CCP steals our technology uh everything from Espionage to hacking to uh um research Partnerships to academic institutions uh inbound investment the sypheus problem and so all of that is part of the calculus and and his his estimate was that uh his comment was that over 2 000 active investigations by the FBI at the time he made the comment and so I I'm not sure how to quantify that but I think that the the damage to um to our intellectual property and our know-how is profound um what I would say is it it to me it brings home the point that we need more information I think many who have testified today have commented we don't we don't fully understand the problem and so we need to gather more data the problem that is with risk from outbound investment and how it Compares for example to hacking an Espionage and the other risks that we face and whether the cost benefit is there with respect to how much resources we dedicate to one versus another yeah I'll just close by saying I think that um maybe one of the things that outbound investment would help us with it seems to me that we we want American companies obviously to continue to compete in the global economy by the same token it seems to me that we need to preserve the Apex the tip of the iceberg of the most sophisticated sensitive uh elements that we need to preserve to have a Competitive Edge and a security Edge and that the rest of uh what's underneath of that tip that might be generally commercially available is a way to look at how we can continue to be competitive but I think there are some sectors it seems to me that we have to be concerned about not only the economic equation but the security equation as well thank you very much

senator tom carper of delaware for more on the economy and also the prospects of a government shutdown could be just days away senator carper is a former governor of delaware and also has has a seat on the senate finance committee since january 2009 senator carper thank you very much for stopping by it's great to be here i'm in the loop i came here i had breakfast breakfast here these are early hours really healthy food and i look for the cashier there's no cashier that's right it's complimentary it is wonderful can i come here and do a show every morning with you hey the the carpet is open for you anytime parker is open for carper senator let me ask you first about um the government shutdown because these economic numbers are sort of you know are in the background of what we're seeing going on in dc with the budget what are the prospects of a shutdown i i hope we're going to act like adults and the prospects of a shutdown will go away we had one in 1995 that didn't turn out too well for republicans turn out better for we're democrats and i hope the republicans will kind of remember that and say maybe we should try to work things out and the key is not just to work things out for a week or two or three the key is to put together a a long-term deficit reduction plan not unlike what the uh the bulls simpson commission has has recommended four trillion dollar reduction over ten years and it's not so it's nice before what we do in one week or one month actually what we need is a long-term plan that says we're going to rein in spending not only uh just domestic discretionary but defense spending the entitlement programs are on the table revenues are on the table and i think what the really the key is there's a i think a lot of people think we have a culture of spendthrift in federal government we need a culture of thrift everything i do i know i can do better the same is true for federal programs and we look to need to look at every nook and cranny of the federal government what can we do to get better results for less money right but the republicans complain of course that the democrats are not cutting the spending enough so what's going to break the impasse do you think to avoid a shutdown i think the folks who worked on the the deficit reduction commission democrats and republicans there are three of each in the senate who democrats and three republicans who actually voted for a 4 trillion reduction over 10 years that is the probably close to where we need to end up the we only eliminate a lot of tax loopholes we also lower the tax rates that's that's the key but that's even a budget that the president has written the simpson bowls is even a budget that that the president has not agreed with completely that's okay what he's doing is i think a negotiation here he doesn't if he goes right there immediately then the republicans are way over here we're not going to end up i think in a smart place and a smart place is close to that 4 trillion reduction over 10 years and to do so in a way that not only calls for an equal strength of sacrifice works on discretionary spending defense and non-defense works on uh and entitlement spending does some uh on revenues two dollars very deficit cut in spending we do a dollar of revenue and we do it in a way that actually promotes economic growth promotes uh investments in people promotes investments in our infrastructure and promotes investment in research and development that's a smart plan that's what we need to do and we can get all hysterical hair on fire we're going to shut down the government that's not all that productive in the end the thing that's going to be productive is to say we've got two feet on the accelerator for to get the economy moving let's start tapping and break with one of those feet and eventually start putting down the brakes with both feet in about a year you wish although you know the the din is getting louder and louder about about a shutdown but let me move on from that though senator carpenter because i want to get your take on oil a lot of concerns here in the u.s that the rising rising price of oil and gas is going to hit the consumer pocketbook what should congress do in response to the rising price of oil well actually we've done some smart things uh this president and this administration and the latin as well we have raised the fuel efficiency standards for cars trucks and vans so that by 2016 the overall fleet average has to be 36 miles per gallon we provided incentives for people to buy far more energy efficient vehicles the private sector is stepping up today right now the private this is happening today people going out to buy new cars trucks and vans today they can get a 7 500 tax credit for buying an energy efficient chevrolet volt fisker is launching the karma they'll get about 80 miles per gallon we have the nissan leaf there's a lot of cars and trucks and vans come to the market we simply have to buy them and incentivize people to do that but to keep price the price stable though you know would you consider the price of oil the price of oil stable should there be for instance a consideration of releasing the strategic petroleum reserves at all that's uh i don't think i'd go there first the saudis have announced today through opec the opec secretary general said look we have plenty of capacity here the saudis are not pumping they're not processing as much as they can they can they can easily offset what if let's say a libyan production goes away completely the saudis can ramp up production and take care of that saudis it's not in their interest or in opec interest for us to have a calamity here and they have sent a very strong signal that there's uh enough capacity and uh so i talked earlier about hair on fire on the budget the the government shutdown uh here on fire on the oil sand we don't have to do that long term long term we've got to figure out how to get people to use less fossil fuels and moves to move to clean energy and move to conservation that's the key thank you very much thank you senator carper i'll be back for breakfast tomorrow for joining us and we would welcome you thank you delaware senator tom carper joining us

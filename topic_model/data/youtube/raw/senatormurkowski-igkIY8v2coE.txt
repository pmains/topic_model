Mr President I was in Utica Alaska formerly known as Barrow Alaska it is the northernmost community in in the United States I was there for what some describe as a messenger Feast the anupiak word is kivik and it really was a reunion a glorious Family Reunion where the communities of the North Slope region all eight communities and actually Neighbors from Canada gather together during the winter to to celebrate family to celebrate Community it's an extraordinary sharing it is very similar to the sharing that they have during the summer months when the communities come together to celebrate the whale harvest the luckytuck yet another extraordinary family type reunion but one of sharing in in a region that is built on a culture of of sharing sharing of subsistence Foods sharing of resources and and that's what I want to focus my comments on today are the resources within the North Slope region as I Was preparing to leave Utica on Sunday morning um to go back to Anchorage I was at at the hotel and visiting with people who were gathered there for coffee and as one gentleman was leaving he said Lisa he says I think there's just two things that we need you to do we need you to make sure that you protect our our whale quota so we can continue to provide for the sustenance of the people in this region and we need for you to ensure that Willow is opened up for oil production so that we can continue our lifestyle some might suggest that there's some inconsistency between this this culture of of traditional subsistence lifestyle and a harvest of a whale to feed to feed entire communities and and production of of oil in the Arctic region and I would I would suggest that it is not only absolutely not inconsistent but absolutely compatible because it is with the sharing of these resources that the people of the north are able to have much of what we enjoy in other parts of America today the opportunity to see our kids educated the opportunity for Health Care the opportunity to be to be safe in our communities the opportunity to to have economies so I am here today Mr President to speak in strongest possible terms of the willow Master development project within the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska we just referred to it as the npra and what I hope to do along with my colleague Senator Sullivan is is to further educate members of the Senate and really people around the country about this project by explaining how it will help to benefit the nearly 11 000 Alaska native people and residents who call the North Slope home how it will support good paying union jobs how it will will reduce our energy imports from quite honestly some of the worst regimes in the world and why its approval is both no both necessary and prudent and I want to start with a little bit of background just to put Willow in context our npra is a federal petroleum Reserve Federal petroleum Reserve its lands were explicitly designated back in 1923 so a hundred years ago designated under the Harding Administration it's an area that encompasses 23.4 million Acres it's roughly the size of Indiana up in the northwest corner of Alaska it's home to the Alaska native communities of Wainwright Utica and new exit these people from these communities have been living in this region since time immemorial they still practice a traditional lifestyle but they live in this region and they they care what happens in their region so I mentioned that the npra is is a hundred years old this year and yet it's only seen just a few projects and and those have been in the very recent years and in part ironically that's because the Obama Biden Administration pushed for the oil companies to turn their focus there they they explicitly encouraged they said go develop in the npra explicitly designated for for oil and resource development they said don't go in the offshore don't go in the non-wilderness part of Anwar go over here to npra well that's exactly what Conoco Phillips decided to do the company first acquired its leases for the willow project back in 1999 this was during the Clinton Administration they started developing them shortly thereafter but they really accelerated that work during the Obama Biden Administration and then moved into Federal permitting in in 2018. so they've been seeking Federal approval for five years now and then last Monday the department of interior published its final supplemental environmental impact statement this is their seis for the willow project to address they wanted to address two issues that had been identified by the federal court so now where we are is roughly roughly 30 days from now in this time period the department of interior will be able to issue a final record of decision announcing its decision on where whether and how this critical project should be allowed to proceed so you've you've got this final seis this is a document that has been worked with career BLM officials these are these are scientists these are Engineers they've got Decades of experience evaluating environmental impacts of proposed projects and they together with all of this analysis over this five-year project selected a new preferred alternative for the willow project they call it alternative e but keep in mind that these scientists these Engineers these these career agencies officials they it took years of analysis and very rigorous review they had significant significant input and support support from the Alaska native communities within the mpra and the North Slope Borough so in other words the people who live up there the people whose home region it is gave that input there was back and forth there was give and take they listened to the native people and they worked to develop this alternative Aid now again keep in mind the willow project was already quite small when it was first advanced in line with all modern development on the North Slope but what blm's preferred alternative this alternative e does is it reduces its footprint even further so from what Conoco originally wanted to do to now this alternative e they've gone from five drill pads to now three with a fourth deferred to later permitting the project will have 19 percent fewer road miles cover 11 percent fewer Acres avoid further avoid ecologically important areas these were all considerations that were taken into place and and placed into this alternative e so at this point the total project will cover just over 400 Acres so I've already shared with you the size of the npra what we're talking about here with the willow project is .002 percent of the npra will be impacted it will be in full compliance with all of the restrictions that are included in the Land Management plan that the Obama Biden Administration issued back in 2013. So under that plan they effectively took 50 percent 50 percent of the npra's surface area some 11.8 million Acres they took that off the table to Resource development so that's already off we're not talking about that we're talking about the area that is available now for development the willow project is just .002 percent of the npra Willow the project itself is not going to cover all of its leased lands not like not by a long shot there are areas that will have no development no development will take place there will be areas where development is only allowed with a waiver that would be required and areas where additional considerations will apply before any development takes place so I can't think about this you've got you've got 11.8 million Acres of the npra that's been taken off the table this project is 429 Acres what what we're trying to develop here the project that we're talking about developing is literally 27 500 times times smaller than what's already been taken off the table and I impress this upon folks because I think it's important to recognize this is an extraordinarily significant project for the state of Alaska for the resources that it will bring to my state the economic development that it will spur it is significant to the people of the North Slope Borough who call this region home and who rely on the revenue and resources but as significant as it is the footprint for willow is minuscule it has been meticulously planned to coexist with the wildlife with the Tundra with the subsistence Lifestyle on the North Slope think about it you would not have the two whaling captains that were wandering the Halls here just this week two wailing captains from the North Slope who are advocating for development if of Willow if they felt that this was going to be harmful to their subsistence activity or to the subsistence Caribou Hunter who was also being interviewed by reporters and meeting members of the Senate here just Tuesday to talk about why he believes that this coexistence with development as proposed in the willow project can proceed and is compatible with their life and their lifestyle Conoco Phillips in moving and moving forward with this will have to abide by hundreds of lease stipulations and best practices and best practices keep in mind when you are exploring and developing in the state of Alaska in the North Slope it's not like Louisiana it's not like New Mexico it is we're operating in an Arctic environment which means you have to work within The Contours of the area around you so best practices mean that exploration is effectively limited to about 90 days 90 days out of 365. if you're in New Mexico you've got a lot more time to be looking around you've got a lot more time that you can be building we have to use ice roads to help facilitate the the uh the exploration rigs that might go out when you cannot be you cannot be on the tundra when the tundra is not sufficiently frozen but then that also means that you've got to get off the tundra as soon as the spring comes so this these conditions this scenario is so different than anywhere else that we produce in the United States of America and even with these least stipulations even with all that has to go on Conoco believes that they can make this extraordinary environmental commitment they believe that this project this alternative e is viable for them to proceed you know if you if you're following the news about Willow you will you would probably get the sense that um you'd probably get the sense that the support from most alaskans is not there because there are a few there are a few voices who uh we we see in objection I get that but I will tell you that one of the reasons probably the biggest reason that has helped the willow project um uh Garner's support throughout the state is because is because the people of the North Slope who live there have come forward and have said We Believe that this will be helpful to us and it's not just those who are living on the North Slope the broader Alaska Federation of natives have come forward in in support bipartisan non-partisan entities from around the state uh one of the leaders in the region the North Slope Borough mayor I had dinner with he and his wife on Saturday night mayor Brower is not only the mayor pretty extraordinary man but he's also a whaling Captain himself and strongly strongly in support of the willow project and he wrote in a letter to secretary Holland that quote responsible oil and gas development is essential to the economic survival of the borough and its residents oil and gas activities are the primary economic generator for our region and by far the most significant source of funding for the boroughs community services and infrastructure to put that into context when he says significant source of funding over 95 percent of the boroughs revenues come from oil in the region so when we think about our our communities and our counties and where they may gain sources of revenue pretty pretty extraordinary to find any area where 95 of your revenues come from one single source and what do these revenues provide they enable the borough to provide for basic basic Services basic infrastructure like clean drinking water like education like Health Care Emergency Services the borough does it all the borough is is funding their own government and their own government to include search and rescue I just mentioned Emergency Services so when you are in an area I mentioned that the npra is the size of of Indiana but the North Slope Borough pretty significant in its size and scope eight communities spread out over hundreds and hundreds of miles no roads in the winter time the way that you move around is by snow machine in the winter it might be boat but the reality is that weather is very very harsh and snow machiners get lost people are trying to travel from one Village to the next who is there to be there on a search and rescue it is the local it's a local community funded by the North Slope Borough these are these are activities that I think most most don't think that a Borough would be providing but they're able to do so they're able to care for their people because of the revenues that they receive from oil as one former mayor put it he's at oil and gas activities are responsible for 200 years of development on the North Slope in the span of 30 years I was in the energy and natural resources committee when he made that statement on the record it's extraordinary how how the quality of life has advanced since the days of of Revenue coming from our oil a recent study really really kind of brings it home it's not just about about infrastructure that brings clean water or or heat to your home but it's it's it's what happens to the health and well-being when you have improved infrastructure when you have sanitation systems when you have medical care that these revenues have helped to facilitate people are healthier people live long longer The increased life expectancy among Alaska natives who live on the North Slope get this if you were born in 1985 if you're born in 1985 your life is your life expectancy was about age 65. pretty young for those born in 2014 average expected life expectancy 77 years think about that think about the dramatic leap in life expectancy and the only thing that has changed because they're still living a subsistence lifestyle we're still living in a really harsh environment the only thing that's changed is they've had access to resources that allow them to to be better cared for to allow them to have a quality of life that we would just accept as basic I think clean running water is basic I think a flush toilet is basic I can't tell you how many communities in my state I go to where they are waiting for the day waiting for the day that they will get running water and a flush toilet pretty basic and Mr President I think it's important I've been talking a lot about the benefits to the people of the North Slope region but when I mentioned that the the the kiviuk uh the nalakatak these are celebrations of sharing sharing of gifts at kivic sharing of the whale at nalakatak it's not just in in the subsistence lifestyle that our native people share it's it's in the structure of of of how angsa really came to be such an amazing uh benefit to Alaska native people the angsta is Alaska uh Native Claims Settlement Act but there is a provision within angsa section 7i that requires and this was this was agreed to by the the native uh the the 12 Regional native corporations 70 of all revenues received by each Regional Corporation from Timber or subsurface Estates they're divided they're divided annually according to the number of natives that are enrolled in that region so what what I'm sharing with you is that the resource wealth that comes from the North Slope the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation is not the only Native Corporation and beneficiaries to that all all Native shareholders throughout the state through the 12 Regional corporations are entitled to that sharing of those benefits think about what that means then if you are from a region where you where you have you don't have the resources think about what that means to then have sharing coming to you from the north when adjusted for inflation between 1982 and 2015 a total of 3.1 billion was shared between the regional corporations for the benefit of their shareholders 56 percent of that or 1.794 billion came from oil and gas operations so when people you know what's the benefit that you receive from from the oil sector in Alaska it's certainly jobs absolutely it certainly benefits our state absolutely in terms of our Revenue you've all heard of our Permanent Fund dividend but the the immediate benefit the real tangible benefit that is shared with Alaska native people is is an extraordinary it's an extraordinary model something that I think those of us here in the lower 48 where corporations are all sharp elbows you know wanting to get as much as they possibly can for themselves that's not that's not who the Alaskan native people are the values the values that they bring is truly one of sharing I I the North Slope is an amazing place and whether it's it's it's summer um whether it is the heart of Winter as it was just this weekend uh 30 below I know the sun was up for a brief moment in time there for a period of time everyone's very excited that the sun is coming back but you know it's it is it's dark it's cold but for those for those who would suggest that responsible resource development and a subsistence way of life are incompatible I I invite you go up to ikejavik go to these communities and and hear for yourself see for yourself how that is just simply wrong because you'll be able to see the benefits of responsible resource extraction and what it can mean to the lives of people in their communities I was in Reykjavik again yes this past weekend but I was there uh the the first week in in January for a memorial service for a friend of mine and a great great native leader Oliver Levitt um Oliver was not only the the head of asrc as a as a extraordinary corporate leader he helped really with the formation of the North Slope Borough but he was a whaling captain and uh he would he spent a lot of time here in Washington DC trying to educate people and he would always get grumpy with me when I say Oliver I'm so happy you're back he's I should be I should be at hunting camp the Caribou are coming through you know he was a man who lived in Two Two Worlds but you listen I listened I I shared it I went to the school of Oliver Levitt and I heard his stories about how hard it was for him as a as a young boy as a Young Man his job was to go out before school and collect driftwood so that their family home could have some form of fuel keep in mind there's no trees on the North Slope it's hard it's hard he said I went to school not because I wanted to learn but because there was heat in this school he saw a transformation of what it meant for the people when they were finally able to get Natural Gas into his community and how how now an elder can turn on the heat by just turning on the thermostat what a concept well for us we kind of expect that but it is it's just a reminder again that the benefits that come to those who live there who have lived there for Generation generations and thousands of years how it is compatible with Alaska's future here the willow project will allow development Health outcomes life expectancy all to improve all to improve on the North Slope you know when you think about when you think about the the resources that the people need and what will happen if they no longer have access to those resources what will happen they're telling me Lisa we can't go back in time we don't want to be left out in the cold we will not be left out in the cold this is not social justice and so I asked I ask us as we're looking at at this particular project keep in mind keep in your heart the people for whom it will most benefit but don't forget the rest of Alaska the country as a whole they're also going to benefit it's projected to create an estimated 2500 construction jobs 75 percent of them will be filled by union labor so Union's pretty supportive of this once complete it will support 300 permanent jobs which then in turn spins off thousands more across the state across the country so I mentioned the unions use sport unions you should be supporting Willow Alaska AFL-CIO the Alaska District Council of laborers the North American Building Trades Union Labor's International Union of North America the international Union of operating engineers the United the plumbers pipefitters they're all on board they're all on board and strongly supported supportive and so are countless others who recognize the importance of creating good jobs in Alaska and around the country to help reverse our our GDP decline we're in a tough place in Alaska right now I think we're I think we're number 47 if I'm not mistaken out of 50 states we're seeing a net migration out of Alaska that is is is greatly concerning greatly concerning we have a higher than average unemployment rate so we're looking at this and saying Alaska Alaska needs this project now I know there's there's criticism out there um you have folks that are saying yup can't move Willow forward uh we all have to address climate we have to address the issue of climate change and let's talk about that for just a second because you know Mr President you've heard me talk about it you've heard me stand up and and say we need to be actively working to reduce emissions increase our use of clean energy I've been pushing policies to do just that but I think we also recognize you just can't flip a switch you just can't get there from here overnight there's a transition and and so I think what we need to focus on the true choice that we have to face is how painful how chaotic do we want the transition to be for the people that we serve so uh on Tuesday night when the president spoke at the state of the union he acknowledged he said we're going to need oil for at least another decade and beyond that I would argue Mr President it's going to be longer than a decade regardless of what we do at the policy level so the question is question is is what are we going to do to take care of our own needs with our own resources or are we going to empower OPEC at our own expense and are we willingly going to return to the days of being highly dependent on foreign oil with all of the economic all of the environmental all of the geostrategic consequences that that entails we we have seen Mr President what happens if if we make poor choices and we don't plan for what a a rational energy transition is going to look like Europe is a certainly one example there but I would suggest let's bring it a little closer to home California is another example Alaska's oil production has declined we send a lot of our stuff to California so as our oil production has declined what's happened in California their Imports have risen and they've risen dramatically they've turned where they've turned to countries like Saudi Arabia and Russia for their supply so now that Russian Supply is outlawed we saw a recent New York Times article that noted quote one in every nine tanks of gas diesel or jet fuel pumped in California comes from the Amazon so really are we okay with this are we really okay with this I don't think Californians are going to be happy knowing that their gas came from Russia um but now that we're not taking it from Russia now it's going to come from the Amazon rather than from a petroleum Reserve in Alaska so the the choice here is not whether we need to continue to develop our oil resources we do we clearly do choice is where the source is going to come from we're going to need it for decades to come and I will tell you I'm going to choose Alaska anytime over foreign sources I'll choose Alaska because we have a better environmental track record because development there benefits our people there and It ultimately makes it a little easier to address climate so you you can you can oppose production on the North Slope you can impoverish Alaska Natives and blame them for changes in the climate that they did not cause but can you really feel good about that given the autocrats that you're going to empower around the world and the harm and the devastation that comes we got a better answer and the better answer here is Willow it's going to provide up to a hundred and eighty thousand barrels per day at Peak production this is going to help us refill our trans-alaska pipeline it's going to keep the lower 48 from having to import from some of the worst regimes in the world so instead of importing from places with no environmental standards to speak of we should be confident that the energy that we need is coming from a project with a tiny footprint that is safely operated with as little impact as humanly possible and we can ensure that the benefits of production go to the Alaska natives of the North Slope and the communities around the state and around the country rather than petrocrats like Vladimir Putin all we need all we need is the approval of the willow project which will allow us to continue to tackle climate change while maintaining our energy security it's not going to be a violation of the president's pledges which were I'll remind you they were to allow responsible development on existing leases to occur well Willow valid existing leases was approved when he came into office its reapproval next month would simply signal to Alaska natives to alaskans to Americans and the world that we're serious not only about our climate policies but also our energy policies I urge the Biden Administration in the strongest possible terms to listen to all who support this important project and I urge them to reject the false and misguided claims about impacts coming from some I would urge them to issue a record of decision early next month selecting alternative e without new limits or extraneous conditions we need to get to work Mr President that I yield the floor

thank you madam chairwoman mr. Sloane I want to follow up on an exchange you had with mr. Tipton with regards to the New York Times story is it your position that nothing in that story is accurate oh it may be that some of the the individual team members said those things and and I can't say that every one of our 260,000 Thank You members but I think internally I think searchings we disagree with every one of those okay well so let's follow up then in more specifics Melissa Canard she worked for for Wells Fargo and she quit in January she may have I'm not familiar with with that former team member the the story states and it's been reporting reported that Wells Fargo would steer clients toward investments that would generate recurring fees for the bank including in the case where it was in the clients best interest after she quit Wells Fargo sent a letter to her clients and her name announcing that she would be teaming with another Wells Fargo employee to handle their accounts the letter stated that Miss Canard was still at Wells Fargo and that she endorsed the other employee is that true I'm not familiar with that situation okay it's been reported that Wells Fargo spokesmen have confirmed that does in fact happened are you aware of this being a larger problem no I'm not and we've looked at that we've we've looked at that issue as part and separate from that situation very closely you can assure us that this is a unique occurrence of a former employee having a letter like this sent on behalf of Wells Fargo I can assure you that that our team that that works with our clients and Wells Fargo Advisors and any of our wealth management or retail banking business that provides investment products works very hard to follow the rules and regulations that they're supposed to follow but you can feedback that we have from our risk teams that oversee that unit okay but you can't assure us that there haven't been other letters like this that have been sent out there may have I'm not aware of any okay do you mr. Tipton also ask you do you have a fiduciary duty to your clients you did not answer yes you gave a different answer do you of a fiduciary duty to your clients well in certain businesses that the fiduciary is is a legal term in certain businesses there is a fiduciary requirement for example in some of our wealth businesses and our wealth Fargo's financial adviser business in other businesses they're not there's not a fiduciary standard and in those businesses we use standard of doing the right thing for our customers and making sure we're providing them with the right services and products now thank you for adding additional context to mr. Tipton's question I wanted to get specifically though into the situation with veterans I was actually deployed myself to Iraq during this window I am a Wells Fargo customer myself and can you just briefly sum up not generally but briefly sum up specifically what a Wells Fargo did to wrong our veterans sure we we had a system in place that we've changed since I become CEO in which each one of our business lines was responsible for complying with the SCRA responsibilities which we take very seriously but unfortunately we didn't have a standard set of rules in an oversight in place the changes that we've made is that we've centralized I'm not asking about the changes what what did you do to wrong the veterans specifically in circumstances and real quick where we're short on circumstances where we did not know they've been deployed we may have we had not given them their full rights under the FCRA Act okay and the OCC then I'll just sum up that you're charging service members higher rates on certain loans that then were allowed you weren't disclosing the service members were on active duty status to to courts when they were facing eviction proceedings repossessing service members vehicles without first obtaining a court order these are some of those specifics I would assume well you would say that Wells Fargo knew that it was doing these things as it was doing them correct I don't think we what we always knew that big and part of the reason was we didn't necessarily have updated information from the Department of Defense well I mean you were repossessing a servicemembers vehicle without a court order you didn't you you didn't know that he didn't have a court order may not have known at that time that they were deployed and so that's why we've created this scra Center of Excellence so that we get up to date multiple times a day updates from the Department of Defense we then have that group take a look at it before any sort of action and it's done on a very frequent basis as in that in our defect rate today is zero and I appreciate you doing what you can to to address this it's very important but I'm concerned that your regret was that you were doing it that it never got caught and not not that you were doing it in the first place there should be better systems in place as our veterans were deployed I yield back I

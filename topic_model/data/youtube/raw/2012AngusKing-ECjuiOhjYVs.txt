right now we're going to talk about government efficiency and openness and how technology affects affects this well tonight is a kind of uh test of some of that uh we're all here but there are also people anywhere in the world who are watching listening commenting sending questions uh and and and that's you know that was never possible before we're just scratching the surface of this it enables a connectivity between people and between people and their government that was just never possible before i mean people now are frustrated and feel they feel disconnected from their government and and it seems to me that the the technology allows us a way to be connected i think we're going to talk about facebook at some point but it's a tremendous opportunity to connect with people time is one of our most valuable commodities and to the extent you don't have to drive someplace park sit in line that's a tremendous improvement in the way people can interact uh interact with their government question is how would you use technology to reduce the cost of government and make it more open and participatory to the extent you can you can automate some of these functions it saves personnel costs and it makes government both faster more efficient and less expensive and and uh you know industry has revolutionized its processes in terms of use of technology and government and education is one of the uh and health care i have to say are one of the last areas to really fully integrate it into their processes to make them more efficient

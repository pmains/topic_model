director ass you know it's it's you on the hot spot now here's a map that was released last week by the service announcing that the agency is pursuing a draft compatibility determination to impose new voting restrictions within the Havasu National Wildlife Refuge essentially the surface is seeking to prohibit water skiing wakeboarding and other recreational towed devices in all the purple and teal areas with the dots is that correct or is that correct director ash I'm not familiar with the substance I'll assume that it is so in total how many miles or acres would be close to these activities under this compatibility determination I have no idea would that include all the purple dots within the 4,000 acre topic Marsh where you're all seeking to implement in the no-wake speeds I do not know you do realize this is a man-made impoundment do you not I do realize that okay so less may I mean I've heard all these wonderful things about your your your service but this is going to kind of be a black eye last may the service established new voting restrictions and closed motorized voting in a half mile backwater area that have been utilized by recreational enthusiasts for decades this order was effective immediately and implemented by the acting refuge director without public comment shamefully this arbitrary closure became effective two days before the Memorial Day weekend a very important tourist weekend for Lake Havasu could staff bring up slide two you know this is mr. mr. ash I do not this is ten year old rider Bliss Rider is a special-needs child who learned to wakeboard in the back waters of Lake Havasu that your agency shut down last May Rider no longer has a safe place to wakeboard in Lake Havasu as you expect him to go out into the open waters where boats are traveling at 70 miles per hour slide three this light contains an email from acting refuge manager stating that a paddle boat is request to immediately extend the half mile no wake zone wasn't feasible and would require public comment slide number four this slide contains another email from the acting refuge manager on November 26 2014 stating she will be putting out a proposal for a 30 to 60 day public comment period slide 5 this slide contains another email from the acting refuge manager from January 9 2015 stating she is still working on a proposal for public comment slide 6 this slide contains an email from acting refuge manager boss stating that this half mile closure would likely meet resistance and require NEPA compliance did your an agency follow NEPA before implementing the may 2015 closure the answer's no I don't want you to misrepresent it so the answer's no your agency did not comply with NEPA prior to implementing the may 2015 restriction shamefully and the draft compatibly did compatibility determination released last week your agency stated due to the absence of controversy the service utilized a NEPA categorical exclusion and it did not solicit public comment prior to the May 2015 closure there was considerable controversy and your agency knew it there should have been a public comment period furthermore this closure was arbitrary and not warranted in fact on March 2 on March 31st conference call your staff indicated that there had been about 12 sent about 12 citations since 2012 in the area you closed last May that's around three per year your staff also indicated the number could be higher but that you all don't know because your agency and local law enforcement doesn't document the actual locations of boding citations if you don't know how many incidents actually occurred in these areas how are you going around arbitrarily closing these boating errors and citing safety concerns your staff also admitted on March 31st that you all had no data or environmental studies which documented any washouts of threatened or endangered species nests prior to making this arbitrary decision in fact when asked if waiks had harmed wildlife in this area staff stated I assume the answer is yes hmm that's really scientific no evidence actually existed prior to implementing this arbitrary closure your staff also indicated that your agency was holding a 30-day public comment period in public meeting on a new compatibility determination because you heard my concerns I don't think you heard my concern so let's be clear stop arbitrarily trying to close motorized voting areas in Lake Havasu your shameful proposals are not based on science or merit further holding a public meeting on a Tuesday when people working from Arizona can attend just doesn't cut it I'm will continue to keep this this open and I've got one more last question director asks last year you testified during a joint subcommittee hearing that the warm water discharges from the Big Bend power plant in Florida are quote having a direct and substantial impact on the manatee that power plant is actually a warm water refuge for manatees that help them survive cold water temperatures during the winter in January of this year the Fish and Wildlife Service proposed to down list the manatee from Dane and danger to threatened status under the ESA meanwhile the EPA is defending its clean power regulations which will most likely shut down Big Bend and other power plants that manatees rely on director Ashe will you assure the committee today that the Fish and Wildlife Service will not issue any 4d rules that allow the take of manatees at warm water refugees directly or indirectly affected by the EPA's regulations I I'm not going to make any statement about what the Fish and Wildlife Service might do under Section 4d without without you know more context to that we have no intention of publishing a 4d rule at this point in time with regard to manatee to my knowledge well given the circumstances we would like a full synopsis based on that question for the record so

crisis let's bring in democratic congresswoman of virginia abigail spanberger congresswoman thanks so much for taking time this morning on this really important issue um let's take a quick step back and your assessment of why we're here this crisis sneaked up on a lot of people but it's been coming in the pipeline i guess for some time what happened well so we know that there are a couple issues in play one there's been supply chain issues because of the pandemic ebbing and flowing uh certainly in the early days of the pandemic as so many people were stockpiling toilet paper parents were stockpiling uh formula we know that then there was a shift and there's been ebbs and flows in actual production uh but then in in recent months there was a shutdown of an abbott plant where there had been a bacteria that ultimately resulted in the death of two babies um but when we have such such uh centralized processing within a within a market there's only major four major producers and abbott uh represents 43 of the baby formula in in the united states that consolidation quickly becomes a major issue and so between the supply chain issues between uh the shutting down of this particular factory uh we we are where we are right now and there were no ringing alarms along the way um which is a major issue and one that legislatively i intend to work on uh with uh with a republican colleague across the aisle so i know you spoke to the white house uh just yesterday about this issue you've got legislation that you're working a lot of this stuff feels like long-term solutions to a problem that's clearly there but for a mother going into walgreens or cvs today what do they do what's the recourse here well i have three school-aged children all three of them i relied on formula to feed my babies so my heart is breaking for the parents who are worried about what comes next worried about even if they can buy formula today because they're being limited in the stores as to how much they can buy that they'll be able to buy it a couple days later when they when they need more and so my attention to this issue is complete i have talked to the white house uh yesterday the day before spoken to the president's chief of staff the important steps in the immediacy of right now cutting through red tape ensuring that we can get formula imported from overseas uh quality formula that typically isn't coming into the united states because we do have our own domestic market but making sure that we're bringing in that supply i am not going to be satisfied with the results or the plans until there's formula on the shelves across the united states and parents have that peace of mind uh and then long term we have to look at what happened to get us to this point where there are not enough alarm bells along the way is there not a strategic stockpile of baby formula could the white house leverage the defense production act right now or can we meet the needs of parents through removal of red tape and and tariffs and bringing in a foreign supply these are all of the things that i'm continuing to work on on today and until this situation is solved and planning for the future to make sure we never have this type of supply chain disruption again congresswoman elise jordan here thank you so much for taking on this issue because i cannot imagine anything more petrifying than not having enough formula for your child that's under the age of one so this is critical and my question for you as you mentioned that some of the restrictions on imports of foreign but safe baby formula might be lifted how quickly can that happen so that this immediate need is resolved so these are the this is the conversations that i was having with the white house ideally through fda that should be done quickly we know that various types of formula produced throughout europe meet or exceed standards sometimes different formulation but still meeting the basic health needs of babies and certainly meeting uh the standards that we put on the baby formula that that is marketed here in the united states uh as a former cia officer i had one of my children overseas and and relied on on a foreign european made baby formula to keep her healthy and safe uh so it's a it's an issue of how fast can the federal government move on this uh and and my my hope and expectation is quickly and i think elise as as your viewers are thinking about what this means you know we're talking about parents who endured a pregnancy through covid the shutdowns the lockdowns the fear that went along with that and finally as we are in this place where we're starting to really return to some future of of of a post-pandemic normalcy that we all hope for to see the supply chain issue be so deeply focused and frightening for parents is just another hurdle that people are facing and and one that uh i want to see resolved as quickly as possible because i i i know what that fear must be like for those parents and and we are working on this issue so congresswoman spangler it's been quite a while since i've been to the store to buy similac late at night quite a while but my question to you is and you mentioned that there have been no ringing alarms along the way to this crisis that we're involved in this is the united states of america how is it that we get to the point where there is a scarcity of baby formula if you were going to make a list of essential items baby formula would certainly be on that list what has happened well so first and foremost i'm following up directly with uh abbott the formula producer that accounts for 43 of us market share uh they're coming before congress in two weeks but i want answers from them sooner about how it is that we got to a point uh where where they were clearly on a path towards not producing what was necessary on the shelves but didn't ring alarm bells there is no structure in place that when uh and and for other products there is but there is no structure in place that when it comes to baby formula if uh if producers manufacturers recognize that they're we are on a path towards potentially having a shortage of supply there's no requirement that they ring alarm bells secondly another issue that exists is there's just consolidation in the market and i know you had senator tester on earlier talking about consolidation within the meat processing plants and meat processing industry and i i work with him on that issue and carry the house companion of his special investigator bill because we have seen the problems that exist when there are supply chain disruptions and closures within a consolidated meat processing industry and the same is the circumstance that we are witnessing in the baby formula manufacturing industry it is so consolidated that when there is a disruption uh in the supply market and when there is a closure of one factory that months later we find ourselves in a circumstance where parents are desperately trying to feed their children uh and cannot obtain um obtain the formula they need and this is i think to your point this should not occur in the united states of america so you know looking at the consolidation in the 90s uh there was uh lawsuits brought forth against the baby formula industry against certain manufacturers about anti-competitive practices ultimately that was unsuccessful but clearly uh ftc needs to look at uh some of the the the policies that exist whether there are uh kind of monopolistic behaviors uh or or anti-competitive efforts within this market that have contributed to the reality of where we are today

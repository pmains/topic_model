we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw all right welcome back everybody special episode um we're doing this very timely because of a recent twitter spat with msnbc's stephanie rule roulet who cares what her name is she's mean and so we're uh i brought on uh my friend um uh chef andrew grull to talk about it okay so why is the chef first of all uh andrew thank you so much for being on thank you for having me i appreciate it so uh actually i'll do a quick bio on you first um you're obviously a chef uh restaurant owner prominent in the restaurant business you're on tv a lot you're talking about these issues been very outspoken about how the pandemic not this necessarily just the pandemic but the government's response to the pandemic as has really hurt our restaurant industry and so you know thank you for being for being that voice um but okay so here was a tweet that came out two days ago by stephanie rule uh from msnbc the uh the pinnacle of of fair thought and and nuanced discussion she said to every restaurant owner who quote can't find workers because people are getting paid too much to stay at home and quote please join me on msnbc to discuss how you spent both rounds of forgivable ppp loans and the 28 billion dollars being distributed from the american rescue plan you course treated back at her said i've tried 17 times to contact them they won't have me on ice i responded to her dear american small business owners this is what the liberal media thinks of you they've never run a restaurant themselves and they feel nothing but contempt for those who do here's the part a lot of people missed she said okay dan crancha because that's how she talks i'd be happy to discuss small biz big biz global markets tax policy or any just spell out business just spell out business you have enough characters it's so annoying i'd be happy to discuss small biz big biz global markets tax policy or any other elements of economic recovery destroyed me on msnbc monday through friday 9am and all her twitter followers are like oh owned right owned oh she's never going to do it because i'm never on msnbc right because i never go and just fight them on their own programs of course i do so i say sure i'll come on with chef gruel since you initially claimed you wanted to talk to restaurant owners but you refused to have them on does that work she never responded so that's where we're at now and so i said hey dude why don't you come on my podcast and look what would you respond if she was gonna have you on if i'm stephanie god knows i am not but if i were and i said what do you know about running a restaurant andrew uh what are all the why are all these small business owners complaining so much when the government is is spending money on their behalf we appropriated funds with a ppp program and then recently what is wrong with you people why don't you just why don't you just use that money and pay people more than like they should be getting anyway why don't you pay them livable wages yeah and i can't and look there's even another that went before your tweet where when she originally posted that people started tagging me and i wrote back to her immediately right this was probably 12 hours before you engaged with her and i said hey i'm happy to go on the show right and frankly i didn't know much about her background um i don't watch the 9am show on msnbc although the name of the network says a lot but happy to have that conversation and i think frankly she'd be pleasantly surprised to find that there's more nuance to this that i would suggest than a lot of people who are uh tribalized on twitter would suggest you would think she has a background working in banking credit swiss dutch like she's she she is their primary correspondent for business news so this is very detached and very it's her tweet was so full of contempt that's what really struck me by it well contempt and ver it was very condescending right the and and by the way yeah to add more granularity to that her background is in derivatives trading which we all know had nothing to do with the previous uh crisis in 2008 but uh that would have been good prep if we'd been on their show god it would have been great oh why didn't you have this on hey who knows maybe she will but look the fact of the matter is is that let me let you know in this let me say one thing here so i started slotfish in 2011 as a food truck right i've been in a restaurant industry my whole life after dropping out of the liberal arts uh college circuit i realized that food and and cooking was what i wanted to do and then trained around the united states and the world to get involved in the food and restaurant industry and then ultimately took all my savings bootstrapped myself took all my credit cards maxed them out in 2011 right at still at the peak of a recession and i started i got one food truck to launch the brand i went from one food truck to four and then ultimately rolled all that over into a brick and mortar i raised ninety thousand dollars in uh you know eighteen tranches five thousand dollars each from friends and family and anybody else i could get whether it was through kickstarter to open up our first brick and mortar fast forward today we've got 28 locations i have three other concepts of 31 restaurants nationwide all independently owned or franchised never brought on private equity investment never got involved with wall street her cronies all of this has been done completely organically so the point being is that i understand the gauntlet of operating and running restaurants or businesses small businesses specifically not just in california which is effectively behind enemy lines when it comes to being a small business owner but nationwide by virtue of our franchise system and me working with independent independent i emphasize that franchisees so my experience in all of this has been the fact that the government centralized from a state perspective and a federal perspective has constantly been behind the ball on this right and both sides of the aisle i'm not trying to target necessarily her cronies but we're behind the ball now what we've seen of course is that republicans have been a lot quicker to deregulate and to open up the free market where democrats have tried to use this as a predicate by which they can control the economy even more which is what we're dealing with here in california but what i would tell stephanie is is that look first of all you want to trace out all of these programs that the government has put forth in order to help small businesses specifically the american rescue plan which is the more recent restaurant program 28 billion dollars was was was subscribed to within hours all to minority and female owned businesses so there was applications upwards of a hundred billion dollars um the majority of which are either going to be rejected or nobody knows what's going to happen and then furthermore the second round and the first round of the ppp funding was based on a very simple mathematic formula which is 2020 sales minus 2019 sales which gives you the metric by which you then are approved for certain loans her cronies her buddies in silicon valley the same people that were taking 30 cents on every dollar of every delivery sale through doordash ubereats etc are the ones that are now going to create a situation where the businesses that quote pivoted which of course every twitter twitter expert told you to do are not whose sales remain the same because they kept their sales steady by virtue of these third-party deliveries but then lost 30 cents on every dollar further exacerbating their losses now can't get the ppp funds there's no stipulation in the program to fix or or remedy that situation or furthermore here in california one in every three restaurants is shut down permanently what are those 30 percent of restaurant owners gonna do and she doesn't necessarily have answers to that instead it's just about being snarky and gaining some sort of a slam dunk by virtue of who knows what well what she would say is well i would be in favor of appropriating that hundred billion you know because that's what they'd say and and and my response to that is well okay there's no limiting principle to that and if you actually talk to small business owners they don't want more handouts they just want to be open they just want to be open because even even if you are even if you do get the loan it's difficult it's a process there's strings attached uh it's an imperfect system like you said and that's about the i think the the best it could be constructed in a short amount of time look it was it was a better rescue package than say the 2008 rescue package which was you know really just for big banks so you know it was it was certainly better i mean the pvp program photo mentally was designed by marco rubio and republicans not perfect um but but we're getting ahead of ourselves the point is let people open safely restaurants have you know we've been having this debate for a year restaurants are some of the safest places you already have so many standards in place for cleanliness uh it was once once the data was out that transmissions weren't happening in restaurants and bars primarily it should have been it should have been end game by that point it should have just opened and by the time we're even having this debate in january of this year about another 28 billion dollars it's like look we got i got a lot of pushback for even voting for that december uh boondoggle um because i was like look we haven't we haven't refilled the ppp program in a while we have to do it um and we did it but i actually got a ton of like a wild amount of backlash for that because people are like we don't want handouts we just want to be open that's that's it well yeah and i think that the piece that was missed there was that the handout should have gone to retroactively retroactively to the businesses that were shut down these businesses have been completely forgotten about and here in california it's once again it's more than one out of every five right it's not 20 it's 30 30 plus because of the inability to open and operate within the free market framework you're right right and i've said this from the very beginning restaurants are inherently trained in order to maintain safe and sanitary conditions we should have been at the forefront of modeling the right behavior from a small business or a business perspective to prove that you can be both open and safe and that works right and now you're right 18 months down the road we look back at the numbers and we say okay well maybe causation and correlation were not connected to the degree that the scientists implied that they were from a restaurant perspective we were vilified and to her point more specifically because the point she's making is that it let's say let's say you did get a piece of that 28 billion dollar pie or the ppp program and a lot of restaurants did um let's say you get a piece of that i'm not even sure her argument makes sense that you could then hire now like like as if it's your fault that people aren't coming to work i know for a fact that small businesses continue to raise wages she doesn't seem to understand that there is a limit to how much you can raise wages you can raise menu prices you already are raising menu prices because of inflation so how much more can you really raise venue prices before you you decrease demand i know these are big words for for for but she they shouldn't be right she she might have a degree in business or economics she's obviously worked in the space she under should understand the the the the the the things that play here you decrease demand and then you can't make a profit either way so there is a limit of course to how much you can raise prices right yeah and even just say and let's we'll let's see her side through right so hypothetically she's saying okay all this money that came in should have been used now to increase wages to the level that you can bring you know supply and demand can meet right so it's an indictment on restaurant workers saying that they're not paying their workers enough and that's really been the overarching conversation all of this which frankly i think are two totally separate issues and they're conflating the two of them to make it more complicated to increase minimum wage around the horn but let me say this we have always prided ourselves on paying 30 to 40 above minimum wage i'm a firm believer just for my business alone right this isn't for everybody and i mean this not from a not from a federally mandated perspective but i believe that if i can keep wages higher than my competition i'm going to have lower turnover and therefore i'm going to have a long run a lower labor cost right well so what we did was we have increased wages and i'm paying entry level workers right now 20 to 25 an hour i'm talking dishwashers wait staff now wait staff in a tipped state right we don't have tip wage so my servers at twenty dollars an hour with an extra hundred dollars over uh you know across a five hour shift that's forty dollars an hour and even at those wages 20 25 in my pizza joints i'm paying 30 bucks an hour i'm not getting the the demand hasn't gone up in terms of people applying for jobs so that's the missing piece of this yeah go ahead go ahead well msnbc and washington post came out with a story this week and they interviewed me on the story now guess what they didn't use my any of my content because it didn't match their narrative but msnbc posted prints this story that says when you increase wages suddenly those businesses can find workers that's not true they're finding select narratives where perhaps you can kind of connect the dots i've got 30 restaurants around the united states we've increased wages significantly and in the southern california example we've increased to 30 an hour for entry level positions and we can we cannot find workers so i've gone out there i've asked everybody i've spoken to some of the people that we're trying to hire are people who previously worked for us and i've said what is it that is preventing you from coming back we're a great employer we're paying 30 bucks an hour or 25 right what is it and they've given me their real life anecdotal data to explain to me why that's the case and every time i try and put that up on twitter or i post it out there i get completely taken out by kami antifa twitter for not paying a living wage okay but what is there what is their real life anecdotal story is is it the is it the unemployment insurance problem so it's combo right it is nuanced so it's not specific it's not always the unemployment right yes in certain circumstances people are saying i am making enough on unemployment right now that i want to see this thing through but hear me out right that's not laziness and i'm not i'm not implying people are lazy here in california it's a bad decision but it's a financial it's a it's a rational decision i think it's a bad one but it's a rational one it's a cost benefit analysis but what's interesting is here in california when they shut down outdoor dining in december and the entire restaurant industry went virtually under right people then lost their jobs and they applied for unemployment benefits newsome was like oh shoot whoops we we misappropriated 40 billion dollars in unemployment benefits so the system's in gridlock right now you guys can't get your unemployment benefits so for months people were in it unable to get unemployment benefits now they're finally starting to get them retroactively so it's actually not current because they've been refreshed by virtue of the biden administration so these people are saying well i waited so long and i got screwed from the open close open close open close here in california i'm going to see this through to really really understand and believe that we're actually open and what's which yeah that's a fair that's a very fair position to take so but again it's government's fault that's my point yes exactly that's my point so if you just remove the government hand from this pod and you just remove all this and allow the free market to open and operate then you won't run into those situations and this is why when newsome came out a couple days ago and said we're going to remain on emergency order which is merely just so that he can have these powers the pr message that that sends to our workforce is there's more lockdowns coming because they hear this oh and then you got fouchy out there talking about you know the you know whatever you know the kalamazoo variant and people are like oh well these are all the elements that i heard about last year that led to the 17th lock down who knows if in california it's not going to happen again the second piece to this which once again involves government intervention is child care right schools are closed so parents have to decide i'm going to put my kid in school or i'm going to pay for child care and i would pay for the child i would stay home right i'm not i'm not going to put my kid in a public school system to learn about critical race theory when i can be at home watching them i'll take the unemployment benefits to avoid them getting into that boondoggle right yeah and then thirdly a lot of uh this is a real real true story within our world is that a lot of these young entry-level workers that are getting their first jobs in the restaurant industry are getting treated like such by these customers we had a girl the other day right she's 18 years old works for us two little old ladies come in without masks on they must been vaccinated they saw the cdc guidance etc some guy comes up behind them flips a chair guy's like 45 years old starts screaming at these two little old ladies this poor 18 year old girl doesn't know what to do eventually my kitchen crew comes out and removes the guy this girl calls me she's like it's not you it's not how much you're paying me i just can't work in this environment anymore people have lost their damn minds where is that where did that happen it was huntington beach california right in one of my restaurants this is why you're moving in texas yeah well it's these nut cases yeah yeah i mean it's already hard enough being an 18 year old server it's already that's already hard enough and then you add the crazies on like what why is this man even inside this place if you're that scared if you're that crazy just don't go out in public and frankly you know stay in your home forever uh yeah he was eating his food outside he left his food came inside to cause a scene because these 75 80 year old ladies didn't have masks on this is this is uh that gets to a whole new uh conversation about the psychological pathology that has overtaken much of america um with with respect to this disease i mean um we still can't do in person committee hearings not not all committees but our committee the democrats are just like no we just and i'm like i i don't know at this point when like cases are so low people are vaccinated like what are you honestly that now i don't know what standard you're trying to meet um if if now isn't the time it's um it really has become this sort of obsession with with fear and obsession with living with the pandemic it's it's a very odd thing and it's even it's even more odd that it fell so perfectly along political lines i think it's i think it's one of the more fascinating and and under talked about understudied phenomena of this entire pandemic is how it became a left-right issue and how we basically assess risk and deal with it really strange to me um deeper conversation okay tell us about maybe maybe the last thing um that we've sort of uh we've sort of shadow boxed stephanie who didn't want to have this on um look i mean she was smart not to right she looks tough to her twitter followers and uh i respond and she just like ignores me and her twitter followers have no idea that i even responded so look i i get the game stephanie i get it it's fun we all we're all having fun um but but wouldn't you think though that it just the jet like content right yeah i mean you would try to actually yeah you're on the government side i'm on the i'm on the side of experiencing this you know day in and day out you would think that a general conversation of differing viewpoints right would be productive and she's gonna make me answer she's gonna make me answer why i didn't vote for that for that last um for that last stimulus bill you know and i'm fine with that like like you know it's not like you know have me in some kind of difficult question it's no i think it's an easy question to answer maybe she realizes that i have an easy answer for it i don't know i mean the easy answer is of course look just because you put one thing i agree with in a bill doesn't mean i can vote for the rest of it uh that was like two trillion dollars and most of it was going to state bailout funds when places like california are actually operating at a surplus anyway also as it turns out just reports today that there's well over six assume now there's well over 60 billion dollars that might an analysis show that that might be fraudulent payouts for unemployment insurance so look right the majority of which is in line share out of california sounds like it based on what you just told me about what they already admitted to be true um one of the other problems facing the restaurant industry these days is certainly inflation um what's your perspective on that i don't think there's been enough analysis done on why inflation is really happening we kind of just blame biden for it and it's fun but we we need to understand why it's happening and look my take on it is is effectively pent up demand and a complete destruction of supply and then when demand skyrocketed the supply couldn't keep up that's my theory that what are you how do you guys see that in the restaurant industry yeah and i mean you know keep in mind i'm just a dishwasher cook um so you know i don't have the economic acumen as somebody like yourself i don't know i saw you use big words before uh i just i memorized them so what was i think inflation this year was projected to be what 2.2 2.3 right now we're at four point six percent overall um the fed which is obviously you know the uh inflationary watchdog is indicating that we shouldn't be worried at all this is merely temporary and that of course is meant to calm the nerves but yes they're simultaneously putting trillions of dollars out there which we know the definition of inflation is too many dollars chasing too few goods well if we're exacerbating those issues right we're adding the dollars and we're decreasing the goods whether it's supply chain hiccups as a result of the labor issues the result is going to be what i'm seeing right now on the streets is that 30 of every single one of my restaurants is being shorted supplies day in and day out i've seen my prices increase but i'm also you know in a seafood world right so we are a lot more sensitive to a commodity index increasing because of the labor that's necessary to process the seafood a lot of which used to come internationally as you know um and now there's not as much of that but we've seen 50 to 60 price increases around the board and we are already distilling all of that through to the end user now the question is and i talked to a lot of my other contemporaries in this industry the restaurant industry specifically they've already pushed those prices down onto their consumer do you think that giving me an example where somebody has decreased their prices after increasing their prices you know i joke on twitter i say it's permanent it's temporary if i printed and spent four thousand dollars for new menu boards new menus etc even on it from a digital perspective the labor that goes into changing things across an enterprise i'm not going to now go back after the consumer has gotten used to that even if it means now my margins are stronger right um and that's an argument that maybe stephanie could make is restaurants margins are better but they're not paying their employees enough and the employee wages aren't keeping up with with um you know the price index increases but that's another conversation for another time those prices are set and the same is gonna happen to me right my lobster price went from nineteen dollars a pound twenty dollars a pound a year ago processed lobster right now it's going to approach forty dollars a pound if we don't get more boats on the on the water we're at about thirty those lobster processors are not going to come back to 19. even if all of the elements come back together they'll drop to 25 right like the the floor will be higher than what it theoretically should be because everything else is going up you know we hear yesterday about like blackrock capital partners buying out all these homes and everybody's mad at them but it's like don't be mad at them be mad at the policy that creates this low price debt which gives them the opportunity to go in and take on these new assets that are better you know it's not it's not it's not them it's not just like it's not us the restaurant owners we're merely you know operating within this economy that's being you know in my opinion manipulated to some degree by the fed yeah well yeah and that makes a lot of sense and i've heard the same about lumber too it's like once once they realize people are willing to pay certain prices you know yeah the lumber's not going back down and that's that's kind of terrifying to those of us who maybe want to build a home someday um okay last last uh topic for you because i saw you uh tweet about this is um is basically sustainable fishing um was it aqua phonics is that aquaponics yeah yeah tell us about that that was kind of an interesting uh thing that you mentioned yeah so so aquaponics which effectively is integrated aquaculture right growing vegetables alongside seafood which can be done in in urban area in a closed contained system because when it's closed loop right basically to get into the raw literally the fish poop is the fertilizer that feeds the vegetables and then the vegetable scraps are what feeds the fish and it's this closed-loop system no effluent doesn't need to be done in an open ocean now what's really fascinating about aquaculture and aquaponics is that we don't have a framework here in the united states to actually farm seafood either in the open ocean or from a federal perspective or using the armor core of engineer to mandate and regulate it on a city level so we don't have that because sierra club and all these special interest groups are lobbying against it because they feel like it's in their environmental interest to do so but yet the alternative is we import all of that import with that seafood from china we're over fishing our oceans horribly yeah yeah and this ah these these aquaculture systems are actually relieving pressure off the wild stock species which are going to give fishermen a better quota if you can now take even five or ten percent of the demand and utilize land-based aquaculture systems but there needs to be some sort of a federal or even a state framework to do so and it's incredibly inexpensive so what i've said is is that you know we we have the issue of these food deserts in inner city areas where those have been talked about for decades right you know um high obesity uh in conjunction with malnutrition right it's this crazy paradox and of course all of the all the nutritionists say well what are their options for food right fast food liquor stores it's all the package stuff there's really no no high quality grocers i've said take a lot of this dead real estate and introduce vertical aquaponics in old warehouses old real estate situations you can even use retired fishermen who otherwise can't go out because of some of the stocks that have been overfished to manage these systems because they're actually very similar to just the general biodynamic nature of the way in which an ocean works you're you're mechanically reproducing that system um it's interesting and it's it's economical you could you could if you if you were allowed like if the government just let you do it right now you could build it and make a profit you could definitely make a profit you would need some sort of subsidy because i think at first on the front side of it the energy cost would be relatively high but if you look at that and you offset that against some of the other externalities that might exist i think that you'd have a net gain right you would actually have a net gain um and i'm not necessarily saying government subsidies from the sense of the government giving money i'm saying subsidize or create situations whereby the investors are incentivized to invest in the early stage startup of it right um you know tax benefits oh well there's opportunity zones i mean those are huge tax benefits um it just seems like there's nobody really thinking about this a lot i have heard of the the skyscraper farms people talking about that um you know it just yeah i don't have time to deep dive into it too much but it is interesting ideas um when we talk about those are sexy but the output is minimal right you need to do you need to vertically you need to vertically integrate protein right if you're just doing vegetables that's incredibly inefficient because it requires processing and cleaning um but but the the seafood element because we have a deficiency of omega-3 fatty acids in our diet and we actually have an over abundance of omega-6 fatty acids which leads to hypertension diabetes a lot of the ailments that are causing all these health care costs to increase the omega-3 fatty acids fight against the omega-6s the omega-6s in our body are a lot stronger so if i eat a piece of salmon and then i follow it up with like six burgers because they were corn-fed it was corn-fed beef the omega-6s are basically wiping out the healthy brain food that i got from the omega-3s um and that and the omega-6s are what leads to inflammation at the root of all of our issues it's all inflammation so if we can eat this higher quality healthier protein in the long run we're theoretically decreasing health care costs yeah i mean that that goes without saying lots of people should should buy their omega-3 supplements and vitamin d everybody's deficient in vitamin d i mean like it's it is frustrating how easy it would be to actually uh solve healthcare i mean so many people in this country that wanted to that wanted to infringe on people's freedoms and privacy uh to save them uh during this past year well fine if we're going to go along that same bank can we just make everybody exercise and and take their vitamins um no that's fascinating idea uh and i'd love to see where it goes it's something we should certainly look into um and uh i don't think it's probably not going to go anywhere as i always joke i say when does uh when does an environmentalist uh or when when does a developer become an environmentalist well but but that's kind of the fad these days i think if it could ever gain traction it seems like now um i'm trying to think why the environmentalists activists would be against it but they're they're often against things that are good for the environment they're they have a very strange incentive structure exactly my point yeah and i could get into that um but you you read my point there yeah well hey andrew thank you so much for being on and uh hey maybe uh maybe stephanie will we'll reach out and then we can have an honest discussion on her show to her audience well hey bro you giving me the platform and allowing me to kind of babble about this type of stuff so you know stephanie never gave it to me yeah no they like their narratives all right hey thanks man keep up the fight and um and uh to all restaurant owners out there we're praying for you we got your back so thank you so much appreciate it

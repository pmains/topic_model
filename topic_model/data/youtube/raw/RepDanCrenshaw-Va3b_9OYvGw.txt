let's just notice a trend here they let our southern border be completely open they buy people plane tickets even though they don't have any ids they buy them plane tickets wherever they want the u.s these are economic migrants not asylum seekers and yet they they close off our borders to cuban refugees fleeing a marxist dictator and they close us off to afghan interpreters who have been serving our country for two decades now this is a personal issue to me like the guy who was blown up right in front of me was an afghan interpreter named rachman who loved this country was fighting for our country fighting for his country i think that's the case with a lot of these guys and they were just an afterthought for this administration it's taken weeks and weeks of bipartisan pressure for them to to even lift a finger on this uh they finally come up with some plan but it might be too late i mean the end of july well i mean they're talking about withdrawing just within a few weeks of that you know we've already left bagram air force base uh we left it to looters by the way they didn't even turn it over properly to afghan government so look this is a very hasty and irresponsible process and i will say one more thing they said that these interpreters can't be physically in the u.s of course legally that's not true they can be here on parole it's really appalling the priorities of this administration

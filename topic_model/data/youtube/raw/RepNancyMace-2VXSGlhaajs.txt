well i would never bet against nancy pelosi but twice now she's tried to bring both bills or at least one of the bills or both bills to the floor two different times now and has failed because the progressives and socialists cannot strike a deal with moderate democrats meanwhile republicans are totally out in the cold on all of the above so seeing what senator manchin's comments were today i don't see how it happens and he's right i mean this is a shell game when you start digging in the kind of spinning that they're talking about there are limitations and dates on the spending that end but there would be need to be additional spending maybe two or three times as much to fulfill the programs that they're talking about so it really is a shell game it really is a gimmick and finally i'm really grateful that senator manchin is calling it what it is inflation will rise taxes will go up on the middle class jobs will leave the united states and now they want they want illegal immigrants to have mass amnesty spending billions of dollars on that i just i just it's not going to happen

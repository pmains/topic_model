support of chairman keating's resolution expressing support for the sovereign decision of finland and sweden to apply for the north atlantic treaty organization also known as nato and calling on all members of nato to swiftly ratify the protocols of ascension since russia's invasion in february of this year on ukraine the world has changed the attack on the ukraine has been watched as valamir putin's ordered his military to march through ukraine brutally attacking civilians and civilian infrastructure it's exceptionally clear that his senseless aspirations imperial aspirations go far beyond the don boss and even the ukraine in its entirety as a matter of fact he has stated such in response to our transatlantic allies and partners have had completely to rethink as is clear the security postures and tighten our ranks to counter global challenges in response to the russia's federation's unthinkable unthinkable aggression in ukraine sweden and finland both long-term security partners of the united states and nato as a whole have made a sovereign decision throughout their country their countries a decision to apply for nato membership this did not come about easily or are automatic finland and sweden's ascension to the nato though i think represents and chairman keating believes a strong unified message and gets putin's aggression in the ukraine and this would support peace and the values that we all adhere to in the nato alliance additionally nato's land border with russia will now allow significantly more territory thereby acting as a greater deterrence to russian threats and aggression their ascension will also bolster nato's capabilities in the baltic sea region building on the capabilities already of our baltic partners as well as poland who have each been steadfast steadfast in their commitments to countering russian aggression and responding to this grave humanitarian crisis that is russia's responsibility and russia's responsibility solely on their part for this decision finnish president ninisto has rightly said valamir putin looks in the mirror and he has only himself to blame putin's entire warfighting efforts the bombings the air strikes the ground movements have been counterproductive instead putin and the military of the russian federation as i have said and many others have committed war crimes forced ukrainians from their homes into filtration camps deported far away russian terrorists and single-handedly instigated the largest humanitarian crisis in europe since world war ii and despite despite his goals of dividing the transatlantic alliance putin is instead united us more resolutely than ever before against his attempt to spread hate and violence across the globe and to create more division clearly that's been his goal and it's been his goal for years in addition individuals from around europe most notably central europe have welcomed those fleeing violence in ukraine in their own homes in poland and romania and many other european countries it's really a incredible humanitarian effort that these central european countries have engaged in and it's been heartening it's been heartening for the entire world to see bearing the events of the last few months in mind this resolution expresses not only the support for finland and for sweden's monumental decision to apply for nato membership furthermore this resolution echoes that the leadership role that congress that this congress and this administration have taken in uniting the transatlantic alliance in the world in support of ukraine this did not happen overnight president biden last year began working closely with our nato allies sharing intelligence working together to build on that alliance including more recently we in congress providing over 50 billion dollars in support for ukraine's war fighting effort and the immense humanitarian crisis that has resulted these funds have been crucial and ensuring that ukraine can continue their fight and it has provided leadership for other european allies to do the same a fight for democracy a fight for freedom is a fight that the ukrainians must win this is the test of our time and president zielinski has stood up reminding all of us that the price of freedom is not free and those brave ukrainian people how much they have done to show the entire world that they stand for their sovereignty however this resolution would not have been possible without the bipartisan support of many of my colleagues who have long supported the nato allies like congressman turner and so many others this includes the lead on this resolution chairman keating as well as the lead original co-sponsors on this resolution house foreign affairs subcommittee and the european ranking member brian fitzpatrick as well as representatives eric salwall and representative ann wagner as well as representatives conley and turner and the parliamentary assembly in addition i'd like to thank all of the chairs of the house finland and sweden caucuses for signing on as original co-sponsors of this legislation and finally i'd also like to thank specifically chairman minks and ranking member mccall uh of the house foreign affairs committee who have been united in these efforts over the recent months i also want to express my gratitude to leader hoyer and chairman meeks for allowing this resolution to move so swiftly into the floor expeditiously through this resolution the house will loudly and clearly welcome finland and sweden into the nato alliance a clear sign of transatlantic unity in response to vladimir putin's brutal ambition i was there in february in brussels two days before the invasion and i've never seen nato as united perhaps since the cold war the fact is is that we have a strong history and we have an opportunity to bolster the strength of this military alliance as well as the democratic resolve of their governments so in the spirit of unity and recognition of finland and sweden as long-term friends of the united states i strongly i strongly urge my colleagues to support this resolution and i reserve the balance of my time

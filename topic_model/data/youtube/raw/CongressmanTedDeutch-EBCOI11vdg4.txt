thank you madam chairman I want to thank you for holding this hearing today you've been a champion for these families and the families of so many others who have been wrongfully held or imprisoned by rogue regimes you've been a steadfast partner in advocating for the release of my constituent Bob Levinson and I am most grateful for your unwavering support to Doug bobak and Omar thank you for being here today to share the stories of your father's and brother none of us can imagine what your families go through every single day your testimony today will give this Congress and the American people a small window into the unimaginable reality that you face each day just last week we learned that Iran has taken another American citizen convicted in some undisclosed sham trial and sentenced him to 10 years in prison hostage taking is not a game that responsible nations play Iran's outrageous disregard for international law should give every country every company especially every American company pause as to whether this is a country they should welcome back into the community of nations C amok namazi has been detained since November 2015 his father Bakker has been detained since February 2016 Bakker was detained at 80 years old a mere six weeks after the deal that saw five Americans previously being held by Iran released in January of last year his health unfortunately is poor neither were afforded due process and this family has still not been made aware of the exact charges against them this is not rule of law this is hostage taking nazar czaka is an Internet freedom activist he was invited to Iran to participate in a conference and was subsequently named can you imagine invited to a country and then arrested with no cause Iran first acknowledged holding nazar in November 3rd 2015 like SIA McCann the recently sentenced cor Wang nazar has been sentenced to 10 years in prison Bob Levinson has been missing for ten years Bob went missing from Kish Islander on March 9 2007 Bob and his wife Christine live in my district in Coral Springs Florida bob is a patriot in every sense of the word he devoted 28 years of his life to government service first at the DEA and then 22 years at the FBI I've come to known to come to know the Levinson family well over the past seven years Bob's wife of over 40 years Christine is here today as well as Bob's eldest son Dan not here today our Bob's five other children Susan Stephanie Sarah Samantha and David Sarah recently gave birth to Bob's newest grandchild he was born on July 4th a date that certainly makes Bob proud last year Bob's been namesake three-year-old Bobby underwent treatment for cancer and just a few months ago Bob's son David had his first child the baptism is next week bob has missed all of these milestones imagine 10 years without your husband your father your grandfather we will hear what that has been like from Doug who was only 13th at the time Bob disappeared no family should have to endure ten years of unanswered questions ten years of watching others come home and 10 years of being left behind I've sat in this room countless times over the years and talked about Bob I've talked about him on the House floor and I won't stop talking about Bob I won't stop calling in Iran to once and for all send Bob home Iran may claim they don't know where Bob is but they know how to find him and they know how to get him home we need action Bob can no longer be left behind and today I'd like you to hear directly from Bob in 2010 the Levinson's received the video you're about to see in it you'll see Bob under duress pleading for his country to help him if we could play it long first of all my children and my grandson and also for the United States government I have been held here for three and a half years I am not in very good health and running very clearly on the diabetes medicine I haven't treated well I need Sal the United States government to answer the requests of the group that has held me for three and a half years and please help me at home 33 years of service to the United States deserves something please help me Bob I will continue to do everything I can to bring you home alive all I want is for our family to be whole again we love you we miss you everyday we will not abandon you my name it's it's hard to watch but it is important that the world see Bob that they see more than a name in a newspaper article that they see the husband father the grandfather the American public servant I implore this administration to make bringing Bob home a priority despite our policy disagreements with Iran bringing home Bob Simic backer and desire and the other Americans detained in Iran must always be at the top of the agenda Doug Bhavik Omar I can only hope that by providing each of you a chance to tell your family's story today we can to send a message that the release of these Americans is a priority for this Congress it's a priority for the American people and we will not stop until they are home and I yield back

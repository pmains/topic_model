dodging out of the way of horses as well joining us now to discuss is republican congressman tony gonzalez of texas his district includes the town of del rio sir thank you so much for being with us first i just want to address what we're seeing here in these images what is your reaction to this yeah my reaction is when you have tens of thousands of people under a bridge in a very chaotic situation of course it's going to create chaos you know the men and women in green uh the border patrol agents and their families have been working around the clock throughout this crisis for months on end it's a very desperate situation and they're they're doing god's work fighting everything they can uh you know i spoke with with border patrol leadership this morning and they assured me that that this is under investigation that they have oversight on on site in del rio to ensure things like this do not happen the last thing any of us want to see is the mistreatment of anyone to include migrants but when you have tens of thousands of people and only a hundred uh hundreds of border patrol agents it creates a very desperate situation so it sounds like you're saying this isn't okay but it's understandable because of the conditions that border patrol agents are facing it's an impossible situation it's exactly the reason which which none of us want to see right which absolutely has to get corrected with a policy change border patrol or the border patrol agents do not control policy let me let me ask you a question because i don't know that you can see it but the image that we just saw was of a horse charging in such a way that a little girl is running to get out of the way yeah no it's it's horrible the the families that are there the young children that are running around the conditions what should the agents be doing sir yeah the agents should be guarding our border the agents should be protecting us and none of the agents want to be pro uh want to be uh dealing with this migrant situation they want to be you know uh stopping bad guys from entering our country they want to be stopping drugs from entering the united states this is an impossible situation i've also heard reports that some of the migrants have been physically attacking agents i mean all of it is a chaotic situation all the way around the bottom line though america is a a nation a warm nation and we don't want to harm anyone to include migrants in any form or fashion especially uh families and children okay but the the kids are not attacking agents to be clear history no i heard a single adult males which is the bulk of the of the the migrants there in del rio our single adult males are beginning to uh be unruly and and they've attacked several agents uh so as this situation continues as folks are are repatriatized to haiti you're going to see this continue to unfold this is just the beginning this chaotic situation in del rio is only going to get worse and it has to stop with a policy change by the administration so you know we just asked the dhs secretary about the situation there it's it's something quite frankly we haven't really seen before right this uh essentially a refugee camp inside of the u.s now over 10 000 migrants there is a reticence on the part of the administration to call this a crisis what do you say to that oh it's absolutely a humanitarian crisis on steroids but we got to look beyond that you know over over ten 000 migrants living under a bridge in a in a third world type environment in the united states it's the last thing any of us want to see i go back to it is this gets solved with a policy shift by the administration short term long term congress has to come together and and push legal immigration reform that's the long-term solution to this all but until that happens you're going to see more images like this you're going to see more you know desperate situations where families are making the trek across this dangerous terrain in order to come to the united states it's all a horrible situation but i want to be clear you know we have to support the men and women in green that are doing everything they possibly can to keep our borders safe the secretary just said that there will be a dramatic change here in the next 48 to 96 hours he said that there will be four flights going out today under title 42 to haiti uh do you welcome that i think that i think that's a good start there needs to be more uh more enforcement of our current laws but it also needs to happen at a much quicker rate the city of del rio is just completely overwhelmed it's as if a category five hurricane has hit this small town everyone's trying to deal with it at this point we shouldn't be republicans or democrats we need to come together and we need to get through this crisis together all right congressman tony gonzalez thank you so much for being with us this morning thank you next up

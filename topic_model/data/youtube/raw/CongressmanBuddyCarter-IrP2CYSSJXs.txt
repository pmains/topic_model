MR. SPEAKER, I RISE TODAY TO  RECOGNIZE MARSHA'S OF GLEN  LIBRARY FOR BEING RECOGNIZED AS  GEORGIA PUBLIC LIBRARY OF THE  YEAR. THE SINGLE COUNTY LIBRARY SYSTEM SERVES A POPULATION OF 85,000 IN GLEN COUNTY, GEORGIA, THROUGH  TWO BRANCHES, THE BRUNSWICK AND  ST. SIMON ISLAND'S PUBLIC  LIBRARY. THIS HONOR WAS GIVEN FOR THE  LIBRARY'S EFFORT TO STRENGTHEN  COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS,  DIVERSIFY ITS FUNDING PORTFOLIO, AND EXPAND SERVICES TO MEET THE  INFORMATIONAL, EDUCATIONAL,  CULTURAL, AND RECREATIONAL NEEDS OF GLEN COUNTY RESIDENTS. MARSHA'S OF GLEN LIBRARIES  RECEIVED NOMINATION LETTERS FROM LOCAL PARTNERS, BUSINESS  LEADERS, AND PATRONS WHO EACH  HIGHLIGHTED THE IMPACT THE  LIBRARY HAS MADE IN THE  COMMUNITY. ONE OF THE LIBRARY'S MANY  INITIATIVES INCLUDE THE TAKE  FIVE PROGRAM, WHICH IS HELPING  RE-ESTABLISH EARLY LITERACY  OUTREACH FOLLOWING THE IMPACTS  OF COVID-19 ON FAMILY ENGAGEMENT WITH SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC  LIBRARIES. I WOULD LIKE TO CONGRATULATE AND THANK EVERYONE AT MARSHA'S OF  GLEN LIBRARY FOR THEIR  INCREDIBLE WORK TO PROVIDE SUCH  A VITAL RESOURC

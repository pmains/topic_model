thank you very much mr. speaker I thank the gentleman for yielding and I thank he and the ranking mr. Thompson and the ranking member mr. Levin and members of the committee for bringing clarity to this debate today mr. speaker Democrats have always believed that innovation is what keeps America number one I think that that is view that is shared by all of us in the Congress our commitment on our side of the aisle I know is to science to research and development that creates jobs launches entire new industries and gives the miraculous power to cure for Americans to continue to lead in the 21st century for us to meet the challenges of our time for us to secure a strong and sustainable future for America's families and the next generation we must commit to fueling the engines of innovation when President Kennedy challenged Americans to reach for the moon he reminded us that America must lead in innovation the bowels of this nation he said can only be fulfilled if we are first and therefore we intend to be first our leadership in science and industry our hopes for peace and security our ablations to ourselves as well as others all require us to make this effort however according to the american academy of arts and sciences in these days the united states has dropped to 10th place and national rd investment as a percentage of gdp as their report makes clear unless basic research becomes a higher government priority than it has been in recent decades the potential for fundamental scientists scientific breakthroughs and future technological advances will be severely constrained instead of meeting this urgent need and challenge Republicans are coming to this floor two of this house today with not one but two bills that do violence do violence to that aspiration first of all we have the republican rd so-called R&D bill a completely unpacked and deficit exploding tax extension democratic support respect R&D tax credit fact 1 i'll talk about it when i get to the second bill we we support it and we will be offering a motion to recommit for a two-year extension to give Congress Democrats and Republicans time to work together to pass comprehensive tax reform that closes loopholes and pays for making this tax credit permanent but this bill alone republic with this bill along republicans will explode the deficit 182 by 182 billion dollars this is just a part of a larger package of permanent completely unpaid for republican tax measures this year that will add almost six hundred billion dollars to the deficit over a half a trillion dollars added to the deficit including this bill they're built to had two hundred and sixty nine billion dollars to the 5400 richest families in America 5,400 families and their estate tax bill would be getting a benefit of 269 billion dollars paid for by the middle class in our country depriving us of investments in our children's future the fact is that House Republicans have spent this entire Congress blowing up the deficit with unpaid-for tax giveaways overwhelmingly tilted toward wealthy special interest it's worth noting that this bill my colleagues here this this bill on the floor has nothing to do with enterprising startups that are unable to claim the R&D tax credit so some of you have said to me have all these startups in my by and large they cannot benefit from this bill the way it is written we would like to have written our motion to recommit to go further to do that the parliamentarians say because you prevented in your base bill we can't go further on this same day and this is what's really stunning and the look of it all on the same day as you are saying we're going to do a gotcha bill on rd and challenge you all who support rd not to vote for our approach on the very same day lest anybody think that this is an overwhelming interest in our d on the Republican side of the aisle Republicans are bringing to the floor a compete act that completely undermines everything to do with science and innovation in our country it completely under upsets our innovation agenda in the hundreds in 10th congress we put forth the innovation agenda a totally non partisan ly developed the NSU xolo from George Miller took the lead going across the country getting input nonpartisan input academic input venture capital employed technological input into of innovation agenda and that innovation agenda really calls for making permanent and modernizing the R&D tax credit we see the relationship between science technology innovation and progress to keep America number one with R&D taxes but not done this way as we do on the floor this is a trap in order to keep us from investing in innovation agenda and that was something that Bart Gordon as chair of the Science and Technology Committee fought for and achieved arpa-e you know that to name one thing but instead today the Republicans are bringing a bill that totally does violence to all of this I hope members will listen to and support the alternative presented by congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson our ranking member on the committee but anyway and the original competes act by the Democratic Congress supported by overwhelming number of Republicans a majority of the Republicans defied their leadership and voted for the competes act in the 110th Congress and that original bill passed by the in a bipartisan way we laid the foundation for new industries that provide jobs for our workers that open new markets for American products that ensure that we continue to rise above the Gathering Storm Norma gustan and others led the way to show what the gathering storm was unless we made those investments in science and technology and as I said we created arpa-e so important this Republican bill betrays everything that the competes act did the Republican bill betrays everything that the competes act is it is an assault on science and they plan to surrender American leadership on innovation instead of investing in research and development their bill slashes funding for session essential initiatives at the National Science Foundation the National Institutes of Standards and Technology the Office of Science and Technology Policy the Department of Energy Research it cuts energy efficiency and renewable energy rd by four hundred and ninety six million dollars it's a huge a half a billion dollar cut nearly thirty percent below what was appropriated last year cuts are PE by a hundred and forty million dollars fifty percent below the level and the energy and water appropriations bill passed last week most insidiously Republicans are attacking science they don't even want to hear just because you don't want to hear it doesn't mean it isn't true in this competes bill that they are presenting they're trying to silence the climate environmental and social science they have consistently tried to ignore the Republican bill goes so far as to forbid federal agencies such as EPA and FERC from using any research funded or developed by BOE a brazen attempt to divorce their decisions from scientific inquiry so again the very idea that on this floor today that come out of this masquerade of R&D tax credits 182 billion dollars add it to the deficit with the impression that they care about our rd into what aren't to be into nothing that is about innovation to keep America number one these Republican bills remember it represent this is a perfect manifestation of Republican trickle-down economics the choice that our country has to make in the economy as we go for it is trickle-down economics versus middle-class economics trickle-down theories have not worked there what got us in trouble in 2008 and it's exactly what the Republicans are trying to take us back to today is one manifestation of that they're seeking Republicans are seeking to ransack our nation's investments in the future our commitment to science our commitment to our children's education our commitment to bigger paychecks and better infrastructure for every American family we need to come together in a bipartisan way and that is very possible we did it with the competes act before to pay for our d credit extension we need to reject this Republican assault on science that will happen later today we need to invest in the future of innovation of our country of hard-working American families we need to reject failed trickle-down economic theories and accept that the success of our nation depends on bigger paychecks for America's working families R&D tax credits made permanent and modernized are a significant part of that but they are not a part of it if they take us deeper into debt preventing us for making the invest in the future I urge my colleagues to vote no on the fiscally irresponsible rd bill and no on their destructive competes act and yes on the proposal made by congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson and I thank her for her great leadership for keeping America number one I yield back the balance of my time

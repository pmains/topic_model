let's move on as quickly as possible i'm just going to introduce you by name and then ask that you tend in your opening statement for the record so we can move forward the questions and hopefully get done before the votes the first way of a rear admiral william leaves the deputy for operations policy and capabilities for the US Coast Guard a second we have miss Janice hiya who is the assistant director for domestic operations Homeland Security Investigations for the department's immigration Customs Enforcement we have mr. kevin mccauley none who is the acting assistant commissioner office of field operations custom and Border Protection and finally we have a general Costel kostelnik who is the assistant commissioner US Customs and Border Protection office of air and marine and with that I now recognize myself for five minutes for questions as we heard from the governor and perhaps we'll start with you at general that we heard from the governor of the the lack of a strategy or plan for the Caribbean and in the closing of the era marine office in Puerto Rico can you enlighten us on this well I'd mention an area of a strategy I think you're all are aware that the Caribbean border interagency group has been formed by only the representatives of the colleagues here at the table but others in the host nation and that has provided i think a fairly substantial improvement in local strategy associated with the combined assets of the federal government and the state of Puerto Rico you know there in the Western Caribbean in the broader area in the deep transit zone and the approaches from South America and Central America into the US and also into the Caribbean east and west jet of South has a substantial approach to strategy in the broader area and combining all of those into one area that's probably a focus area that would need some work in regards to the closure of our facility I think the committee is well aware that some of the added infrastructure in terms of the marine capabilities of US Customs and Border Protection was enhanced in years past and at that time it was handsome using funds out of the Puerto Rican trust fund and as a result of the way that it was done at that time by law it limits investments in our marine capability to the trust fund so in 2011 as a result of a fairly widespread you know financial issue not only in Puerto Rico obviously and his government and governments across the world stage there's very difficult Financial Times and the trust fund did not deliver in ways that it had in the past and so there he support from the trust fund for various agencies were reduced at that time period and resulted in a shortfall in our marine operations that we couldn't cover we couldn't cover by other appropriated funds and we didn't have the resources so as a result of that we looked at the four operational marine branches we had on the island itself would looked at the least productive of the four branches retained the most important branches of fajardo ponse and mayag√ºez protecting the east and west and southern approaches to the island and we did close just the marine branch in san juan harbor that resulted in the removal of about five agents but the air that the marine craft that were associated with that branch were redistributed to other branches within the island complex and we're not removed what can we do to help restore those funds to the poor rican trust fund well i think i'm not an expert on the Puerto Rican trust fund of fund not only error marine equity but also the larger office of field operation equities them and perhaps mice as well it's a fairly substantial boost and as a partnership with the territory for many years it has been invested in federal entities to bring capabilities to the island that would not be indigenous to the state I think it's been a very successful partnership I believe the trust fund equities are delivered by fees associated with trade and travel in the island so part of that is driven by the economy of the day as the economy and trade improves and I think those things are increasing as we speak the foot the trust fund will recover I think the Resident Commissioner policia has introduced some legislation to give us the flexibility perhaps a funding other federal in addition to the fortune to the trust fund that would certainly give us more flexibility to augment with other appropriations but at the end of the day there are reductions across the board and most of our infrastructures and we are in times of reduced operation with the moon have left if I just asked the governor talked about a memorandum of understanding with the federal government and that that was not being fully complied with it can any of the witnesses I speak to that issue I think he was referring to the forfeiture fund as well so the Puerto Rican trust fund i think is delivering consistent with the memorandums there are other memorandums that deal with material goods boats aircraft narcotics weapons cache at are going to cease by a combination of fet state and federal law enforcement agencies in the territory those go into a federal forfeiture fund I'm not personally familiar with that MOU but I'm sure there is a document it specifies what the arrangements will be about 25 seconds anybody have any comment on that yes sir if I could comment we've almost shared approximately 12 million dollars where we've either recommended or actually asset shared with Puerto Rico government and that's in funds equipment and so forth and those are based on local agreements with different departments of police some of those funds have to go through obviously the Treasury asset forfeiture fund in order for them to be fully forfeited and that takes some time so there is some money pending but we constantly live up to ensuring that they have all the assets sharing opportunities they have and that's why we have nearly 80 task force officers assigned to four task forces in the Puerto Rico area and sandwich

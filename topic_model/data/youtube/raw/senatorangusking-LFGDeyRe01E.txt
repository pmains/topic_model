Thank You mr. chairman gentlemen you've done a good job this morning I must say though I'm disappointed that you're here and not your CEOs because we're talking about policy and the policies of the companies and it's fine to send general counsel but I think if you could take a message back from this committee if we go through this exercise again we would appreciate seeing that top people who are actually making making the decision I want to begin by by two two quotes and I generally don't read quotes but these are are so apt the first one says this nothing was more to be desired than that every practicable obstacle should be opposed to cabal intrigue and corruption these most deadly adversaries of republican government might naturally have been expected to make their approaches for more from more than one quarter but chiefly from the desire of foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our counsels that's Alexander Hamilton in the 68th Federalist he saw this coming the other is a more recent quote from a fellow named Vladimir cough cough who's a former GRU officer and he said a new type of war has emerged in which armed warfare has given up its decisive place in the achievement of the military and political objectives of war - another kind of warfare information warfare and that is exactly what we're talking about here today and I think it's I appreciate the chair and the vice chair giving us the context of what we're doing there they're visual demonstrations I think were very vivid and the warfare is the division of our society and it's not only us it's the entire West we know that the Russians were involved in the French election we know that they were involved in the German elections we are now learning that they're involved in the separation of Spain and my understanding is they've set up shop in Scotland which is talking about an independence vote from the from Great Britain so this is ace kated worldwide strategy that applied here in 2016 there's one other piece I'd like to add to what the chair and the vice chair did and that is that it's still happening this is a service of the German Marshall Fund called interestingly Hamilton 68 that follows hashtags on a daily basis and I just picked the day in September to show these are the hashtags that are being propagated not they didn't weren't created by Russians but these are 600 Russian websites that are that are using these are the hashtags that they did on these particular days the interesting thing syria's up there clearly Russia has an interest there but then we have the NFL and then we have boycott the NFL then we have stand for our anthem we have make America great again Russia take a knee in other words they were tweeting on both sides of the NFL dispute in order to exacerbate the divisions one witness's committee had said that their strategy is to take a crack in our society and turn it into a chasm and that's exactly what we've seen we saw in 2016 and that my point here is it hasn't stopped and it won't stop so we have to figure out what to do about and it seems to me that there are three possibilities one of which you can make a significant contribution to the the other two frankly are up to us the first is the technical defense the kind of thing you've already been talking about today checking identities identifying the source of this kind of information and I want to pursue that in a minute the second is we as a society have to be we have to understand when we're being conned I spent some time a year ago in Eastern Europe before the our election and the Eastern European politicians all they wanted to talk about was Russia and meddling in their elections and I said how do you defend yourself you can't undo the internet you can't turn on the TV they said all of our people now get it that this is what the Russians are doing and when they see one of these postings they say oh it's just the Russians again we have to develop that level of sophistication so that we know when we're being misled and to me the mentality is we the same one we all apply at the checkout counter of the supermarket and we see a tabloid that says a movie star had a two-headed baby we say oh that's just a tabloid we need to apply that same kind of sensibilities to these kinds of fake news misleading and purposeful distortions the third thing that we have to determine I think is that this country has to have some kind of cyber warfare deterrent capacity right now there's no price to be paid for meddling in our democracy and our adversaries have to understand that if they're gonna undertake a campaign like this there will be a price to be paid there will be results and if they do X we are going to do Y to them right now that doesn't exist and all of what the Russians did last year has basically been a free pass and I think that's a very difficult problem now let me ask the technical question mr. stretch can you guys could you for example put a date require a date line on a posting that said where it comes from just like a news story says Moscow September 23rd is there some way to identify the source of information as it comes across your news feeds senator it's it's a great it's a great question we do permit users to identify the geographic location of the post we don't require it there are oftentimes privacy considerations that would prevent a user from you could require it by country could you that's do not defend there are many uses of our services senator we're we're requiring people to designate their physical location could be problematic I would make two other points one is the because of the way the Internet is architected your geographic location is is can be disguised that's something we need to work on in order to make sure we're not being fooled because I think your larger point is an excellent one the geography of the location of the user paired with the content they're serving part of the information is part of the information and we need to do a better job tuning our systems to be more sensitive to that mr. Walker you said something someone who said they they being the people should know what they're getting when we get information we know it's in a new it's in a newspaper we see the name of the author we see the dateline and this is we're in a new information distribution world here and we need to think about how to apply some of the principles that have helped us to assess that information and I hope that you all will continue to develop policies just as the as the newspaper business did a hundred years ago that helped your your customers to analyze and assess the validity of the of the data the problem now is we're just taking what comes as it comes I have a I'll lend with this I have a quote on my kitchen wall that my wife found and it said the great problem with quotes on the Internet is determining whether they're authentic Abraham Lincoln Thank You mr. chairman

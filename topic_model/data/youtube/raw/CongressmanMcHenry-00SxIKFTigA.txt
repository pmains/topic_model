from mchenry vice chair of the committee uh thank you chair Yellen thank you for being here I just want to go back to the Chairman's original question the the Fed is currently not seeking any changes to dodd-frank is that correct yes okay you previously did seek changes to dodd-frank though did you not well we indicated it did it would be very helpful to see a change in the Collins amendment on so no longer us with no longer do you need any help with dodd-frank is that the case now well we we are certainly finding it possible to use flexibility that we have to implement regulations in a way we think is appropriate you aren't currently in your seat you're holding now and when dodd-frank was implemented but it was not the Federal Reserve is the largest regulator in Washington the largest regulator in the financial marketplace broadly and perhaps the largest regulator in the world so when we have these discussions about Fed oversight a significant function of the Federal Reserve is on this regulatory aspect that was greatly enhanced through dodd-frank is that right I mean a significant amount of your time is on the regulatory front not simply the monetary policy front yes Oh correct so you know with these enhanced regulations and enhanced regulatory powers that we've been given the Federal Reserve's been given through dodd-frank in do you have concerns that that erodes your independence largely because your role is so much greater now in terms of financial regulation than it was prior to dodd-frank does that a road in many respects it does it provide concern to you that it will erode your independence going forward well I think we're independence is very important is in the day-to-day conduct of monetary policy we operate supervision and regulation jointly with other regulators under the oversight of Congress but you're not you're not concerned about the independence of the Fed when it comes to the regulatory piece we have regulators in here regularly many of them are on budget we have the appropriate money the Fed is very different in that respect so do you have any concerns about these enhanced powers you've been given and and congressional oversight of those powers I think congressional oversight is appropriate in all those areas that only is okay so you're very fine with the Congress having intense oversight of your regulatory agenda and powers well we testify regularly on our conduct of supervision and regulation we put all regulations out for public comment and that in any rate they run counter to the independence on setting monetary policy well I think monetary policy is different no but I'm asking a different question than your answering actually it does that run counter to the feds independence broadly when we have intense oversight of what the majority the day-to-day operations the Federal Reserve is I don't think it runs counter token depend thank you i appreciate along those lines the Fed hasn't processed additional regs when it comes to capital and liquidity requirements for community banks and large banks are we are we done with the rulemaking when it comes to capital liquidity um I think we are largely done however we have recently proposed a rule for so-called sifi surcharges which would be additional capital requirements for the most systemic banks that we think should operate in the safer and sounder fashion given the likely spillover of distress but in those institutions but in the short and medium term are the feds proposals when it comes to capital and liquidity sort of through largely through but there is a net stable funding ratio that we will propose probably later this year as a rule with could be thought of as a liquidity requirement as well and a supplement the liquidity coverage ratio okay so along those lines this capital buffer that you that you've proposed the dodd-frank requirements that have been imposed on lending and community banks in particular at and the cumulative effect of Basel dodd-frank and these capital surcharges has a Fed undertaken a cost-benefit analysis on these rags and the cumulative effect on lending economic growth job growth um at the outset of this regulatory process there was a detailed cost benefit analysis that was done by global regulators working through the Basel Committee and the finding was that these regulations would enhance the the benefits exceed the costs sure sure was that has less I had no great as the Fed undertaken that analysis that we were part of that project undertaking that analysis Oh time of the gentleman has expired the chair now recognizes gentlelady

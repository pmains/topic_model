most interesting i think is arlen spector the renegade square the the democrat who became a republican who's now a democrat he's in pennsylvania right exactly he's trailing pat toomey by about 10 points and remember one of the reasons spector became a democrat is he was afraid if he ran the republican primary against the tumor he'd get to beaten the problem is he'll losing a general election against him because independents have swung away from the democrats uh as we saw in in the elections in new jersey are you saying flat out charles that specter is done are you saying he's going to lose i i think specter's got about an 80 percent chance of losing i would say about the same for harry reid but you know between now and november it could change but yeah sure i mean events can overtake it if they were held today he'd lose he'd lose 100 if they were held today and barack obama

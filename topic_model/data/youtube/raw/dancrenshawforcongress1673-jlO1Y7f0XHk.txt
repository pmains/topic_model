I call the congressman Hank Johnson had this to say recently much like Hitler took over the Nazi Party Trump has taken over the Republican Party it's now known as the Trump Republican Party Donald Trump supporters are older less educated less prosperous and they are dying early their lifespans are decreasing and many are dying from alcoholism drug overdoses liver disease or simply a broken heart caused by economic despair okay mr. Johnson president Trump is it a lot of things but he's not Hitler he didn't kill millions of people he didn't start a World War his any concentration camps and to accuse him of being Hitler's intellectually dishonest and frankly it's a huge insult to the millions of Jews who died under Nazi Germany but if you want to insult President Trump at least you're picking on somebody your own size at least you're picking on somebody who can fight back but you went on to insult degrade and to mean tens of millions of Americans who voted for him it's called a drug-addicted uneducated unhappy alcoholics this is a cowardly form of politics no matter how much I would disagree with you in Congress I will never ever insult the good Americans who voted for you I will never paint an entire half of the country as deplorable Zoar fools or the dregs of society I'll never do it and if I ever do you better call me out on it because I can't imagine a worse form of leadership these people are exercising their right than their voice the only way they can which is through their vote they don't have a TV show there have a radio show and I'm a weekly column or a big social media following they have a vote and you use your public platform to insult and demean them this is not the behavior we expect from a member of Congress so I'll leave you with this pick on somebody your own size pick on me if you like my office we'll be right down the hall from yours I'll see you in Washington

it is my honor to introduce this afternoon's plenary session for policy makers Middle East policy in the era of Trump the discussions we are about to hear could not be more urgent none of you need a reminder that we are living through an extremely difficult and dangerous time President Trump not known for his thoughtfulness or caution in setting foreign policy has jettisoned many of the relatively for relative vote voices of reason in the White House in the cabinet and he is now surrounded himself with individuals who have trafficked in extreme and sometimes bigoted ideology and who have a track record of relying on military force to respond to complex international challenges when it comes to Iran the president has threatened to withdraw from a successful nuclear agreement that it has made that has made the United States Israel and our other allies safer in doing so they risk shattering American credibility empowering Iran and pushing our nation toward war with regard to Israel and Palestine the president's refusal to commit to a two-state solution along with his provocative decision on the status of Jerusalem have helped exacerbate crisis and undermine diplomacy all of this comes amidst the backdrop of humanitarian disorder and violence at the Gaza border of growing Russian involvement in Syria and ongoing confrontation between Saudi Arabia and Iran it is time of many complex challenges with few easy answers to discuss these issues and to offer some insight we will hear from one of our nation's leading former foreign policy makers we will hear from three United States senators who have a critical constitutional role to play in responding to and seeking to restrain the policy foreign policy actions of the Trump administration the three senators who will be with us all Jewish have of course multiple opinions many of us remember and appreciate the courageous speech of senator Bernie Sanders during his campaign on israel-palestine issues and senator ben cardin as the then top Democratic senator of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee led the opposition to the nomination of David Freeman Friedman as ambassador at Israel and though senator Cardin had deep reservations about the Iran nuclear agreement he is now one of its most articulate proponents of abiding by our commitments to it [Applause] senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii is one of J streets most effective supporters and allies he is also one of the youngest members of the Senate and he holds a safe democratic seat for a great many years to come he will be leading the fight and vindicating the Jewish values that bring us here today and we will also hear from a senior Palestinian diplomat a prominent member of the Israeli Knesset and other leaders all of whom continue to advocate for the two-state solution we are deeply honored to be joined by such a distinguished group of speakers so without further ado let's welcome to the stage the participants in our first discussion tomorrow Kaufmann witters senior fellow at the Brooklyn Brooking Institute's Center for Middle East policy and our nation's former national security adviser Ambassador Susan Rice [Music] thank you hi everybody great to see you it is great to be here at J Street I feel a lot of energy in the room today and yes and I want to thank you ambassador rice she's in first sitting down Thank You Tammy really you know we've known one another for 15 years I think this is the first time we're on a stage together that's right so thanks J Street okay I think we have to start by talking about Syria and the strikes that the US Britain and France carried out on Friday evening president Trump's statement Friday night seemed to put some pretty clear boundaries around that US military response to Bashar al Assad's use of chemical weapons this is a challenge and a dilemma that you also struggled with repeatedly in office and I think one of the things I found striking listening to President Trump Friday is that he made clear that he wants to enforce the norm against the use of chemical weapons that he and Britain and France are prepared to sustain effort to to uphold that norm but at the same time over the weekend we heard that he wants American troops out again he's focused on fighting Isis he doesn't want to use the American military presence as any kind of leverage over Iran over the outcome of the Civil War you know I know you were up at Hamilton College last week speaking with another dr. Rice who is another former national security adviser had a lively discussion and you noted there that last year when President Trump carried out strikes he had leverage we had the opportunity to employ leverage which I can explain okay so here we are a year later he's gone and carried out another round of strikes do you think that we have more or less leverage today than we a year ago less but let me explain why and when we start with the chemical weapons thing and then maybe talk a little bit more broadly about Syrian policy in general after Syria committed in 2013 to declare and eliminate its entire chemical weapons stockpile and shipped out 1,300 metric tons we and others in the international community thought we had eliminated at least its declared weapon stockpile it was evident and by the way when I talk about the declared weapons stockpile we're talking primarily about nerve agents and their precursors chlorine is a separate challenge but was not included in that 2013 agreement because it's an industrial chemical that's readily available and necessary everywhere that the problem with chlorine is when it is employed as a weapon of war then it is a violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention but it became evident last year that in fact either Syria had not destroyed its entire stockpile or had reconstituted it to some extent and I think President Trump was correct to Act last year but he did so in a very limited way and he telegraphed immediately after the strike that he was one and done that this was going to be very short and limited and I think that's was a missed opportunity because for all of our hand wringing and justified concern about President Trump's temperament and how he may respond in a crisis situation he could have played those concerns to our advantage he could have been had he wanted to be demonstrably unpredictable and use and deliberately unpredictable and used that to try to wrest a diplomatic opening with the Russians the Russians and the world at that time didn't necessarily know whether this was an initial salvo or one-and-done and had we left that ambiguous and tried to go immediately to leverage a diplomatic opening I think we had an opportunity there this time when the Syrians used chemicals again I den I think we were right to act I think we were right to act both in a more forceful way than we did last time but also importantly in a calibrated way because it is not in our interest to see a wider conflict and we needed to send the message about the necessity of upholding the norm against the use of chemical weapons but we very clearly telegraphed and very clearly now twice have demonstrated that we are not prepared to use regime threatening force to deal with the chemical weapons challenge and therefore I think our leverage is even less than it might have been on chemical weapons before the other thing we did which I think is going to prove an interesting challenge is to be deliberately ambiguous you heard this from secretary mattis on Friday night and others as to whether the redline is now the use of chlorine gas which has happened many many times over the course of this war and in the last few years in which case we'll be striking frequently if we keep our word or is it still the use of nerve agent which has implicitly been the redline up until now and we still don't have clarity on whether the attack that we were responding to in Douma was chlorine or chlorine plus right so we've now left it to the Russians and the Syrians to guess where that red line is and we may have put ourselves as a consequence in a bit of a difficult situation because we've essentially said that if this use continues we're gonna do more and we have not clear what we mean by this use right is it use of nerve agent or use of chlorine or both you know and so so you don't think that this limited use of force is going to have much impact and Turing I think it will have limited impact I think it was the right thing to do and I think taking out in particular that R&D facility in Damascus is significant because there was a place where the equipment and the the precursors and the knowledge was resident but I don't think and in fact the Pentagon has been forthright enough to admit that they don't think that this necessarily precludes their ability to act in the future and so I think it's a setback I think it's hopefully a deterrent I don't think it is necessarily a permanent deterrent and I think it leaves ambiguous the question of how we will respond to the I'm what I expect to be the continued use of chlorine gas so let me ask you about the Russian role here specifically in Syria enabling maybe even encouraging use of not just carpet bombing but chemical weapons you tangled a lot at the UN with Vitaly Churkin the legendary Russian ambassador especially in the early stages of the Syrian civil war and we were not able to get the Russians to play ball at that time with a real diplomatic process to end the war what do you think it would take to shift the Russian position in Syria to a place where we could make progress toward ending the war well I think it's a lot more difficult now even and it was plenty difficult back in 2011 2012 2013 to try to make what we called the Geneva process and you still will hear reference to that from administration spokespeople yields a real negotiating process the Syrians never took it seriously the opposition when it was at the table was deeply divided and Russia's never seen committed to putting sufficient pressure on Assad to to make Geneva yield something the formula out of Geneva was that there would be a transitional national government that would replace Assad agreed mutually by the opposition and the government and Assad never really accepted that and the Russians never forced him to now we're in a even more difficult situation to the extent that the Russians and the Iranians and Hezbollah have gone all-in in support of Assad the United States focus has been i believe rightly not on regime change but on the effort to defeat Isis inside of Syria and of course in Iraq but that has made the dynamic at the negotiating table that much more difficult because through the use of force the Syrian regime and its backers have largely suppressed what was very divided and fraught opposition and the Russians now have set up their own diplomatic process in Astana where that's a joke so there's there's no Syrian opposition there right there are no Arab states there yeah yeah yeah yeah that's sort of Lavrov PR so I don't put a lot of stock in that but at some stage there's either there gonna be one of two scenarios either Assad will remain in power the US and our coalition partners along with the Syrian democratic forces the Kurd LED opposition elements that have helped us take Raqqa and other areas back from Isis will still control a substantial swath of Syrian territory in the east and the north including some of the major oil fields and Assad and the Russians and Iranians will have a portion of the state a lot of the majority portion under their control and no help whatsoever from the outside world to rebuild Syria and enable the return of refugees that's the scenario that we're headed towards under the status quo because there's no negotiated outcome the alternative and here is where I think the United States still has some leverage is that we say 1 this portion of Syria that that is de facto under the control of our allies and partners is going to remain separate and apart with the oil resources unless and until there's a negotiated outcome that meets the needs and the aspirations of the Syrian people as a whole and by the way you don't get the resources in the meantime and by the way we're staying here which is very important piece of this working not only to help rebuild local governance and local institutions in these areas but also frankly to prevent the Iranians from establishing a land bridge from you know Tehran all the way to the Mediterranean so we have that leverage the other leverage we have potentially is the promise that we and our European partners and our Gulf partners will not contribute a dime to the reconstruction of Syria and lessen until there is a negotiated political dispensation that results in a government that's chosen freely by the Syrian people and so again at the negotiating table we could potentially play those two cards which then you know leaves Assad and the Russians with the stark choice between the rump state with no money and a viable state with international support that doesn't include Assad and Trump in saying that he wants to bring American troops home he wants to do it within six months or as soon as possible is he then pulling the rug out from under that opportunity yes okay and we'll see if that happens we'll wait we will see as he says we'll see so with that let's turn to an issue that has our partners and friends in the region very very exercised and that of course is the challenge posed by Iran now when the jcpoa the nuclear deal signed by the US and its and its partners with the Iranians when that came out there was pretty universal concern on the Israeli side but now that the deal is in place I think it's fair to say that there's a lot of debate inside Israel about the merits of keeping it versus walking away and yet it looks like President Trump is getting ready to walk away we have a deadline in mid-may for the latest renewal of sanctions relief and we're expecting him not to waive those sanctions and in essence put the u.s. out of compliance with the deal so if President Trump goes ahead and pulls a trigger here pulls the United States out of the jcpoa that doesn't mean the deal as a whole is collapsed necessarily but can you walk us through what you think the consequences would be for the United States for Iran's nuclear program and for our friends in the region well let's begin with the facts the fact is that the deal is working all of Iran's potential pathways to a nuclear weapon whether uranium plutonium covert otherwise have been eliminated verifiably so and that is not disputed by the IAEA nor by the US intelligence community nor by the US Defense Department and as you suggested even the Israeli elements of the Israeli military and security services are well aware that this deal is functioning as intended so we've gone from a situation before the deal where Iran had no intrusive inspections and verification it was two to three months away from having the material to develop a nuclear weapon to today when all those pathways have been verifiably cut off and where Iran has committed in perpetuity not to develop a nuclear weapon and where we will have the ability for many many years going forward to verify what Iran is up to if we were to blow that up and I do think that a US withdrawal would in all likelihood if not immediately then event blow the deal up because that means the re-imposition of our sanctions that were lifted with respect to its nuclear program it means that we will be completely isolated from our European partners with whom we work to get this deal and with whom president Trump engaged in a flirtation over the last several months to try to so modify or as he would say improve the deal and you know that has not come to pass we have not really invested very seriously in that and we've now got at Trump's side in mr. Bolton and mr. Pompeo extremely harsh critics of the deal who have sworn to its destruction so I believe that what's going to happen is we will in all likelihood reimpose sanctions hence violating our obligations we will be at odds with our closest allies Iran will be in a position to say quite truthfully that they upheld their obligations and the United States did not and therefore they are not constrained by the commitments they made under the deal that would leave them free if they chose to resume their nuclear program and to pursue it without constraint we will have lost the very robust sanctions regime that we all worked very very hard to put into place that was global in its application whatever sanctions the US may reimpose does not mean that our European partners and the Rams other trading partners will go along in fact one can be certain that they won't because they were a means to an end which was diplomacy and then finally we will have done this on the eve of the president's presumed discussion with Kim jong-un where allegedly the objective is denuclearization of North Korea which really does have already a lot of nuclear weapons it would it sends a message that the United States is in constant when we sign a deal and it's ratified even by the United Nations Security Council unanimously we're prepared to walk away on a whim even when it's being fully implemented so I think it's a disaster from virtually every dimension and all it does is strengthen the hardliners in Iran who didn't like this in the first place and it means that the other activities that in Iran is involved in that we find so reprehensible and support for extremists its meddling in neighboring countries its ballistic missile program etc are now potentially able to be augmented by a threat and a potentially credible threat of an Iran returning to nuclear weapons research and potentially production so oh no I want to focus in on that point for just a minute because you hear a lot of critics of the jcpoa say that the sanctions relief empowered Iran in these other activities in its regional subversion and its sponsorship of terrorism and support for proxies but you're saying that the danger of the jcpoa blowing up is that Iran would be able to continue those activities with the prospect of nuclear force behind him quite simply yes and without the prospect of global sanctions being reapplied but I mean I would I don't want to take a lot of time on the history but I would dispute the the the proposition that the problem with the deal is that it didn't address these other aspects of Iran's problematic behavior it did not it was not intended to nor could it have done so and accomplished the objective on the nuclear weapons our primary interest and concern at that time and Israel stated primary interest in concern at the time was to deal with the nuclear weapons threat we accomplished that that didn't mean that it was all said and done and we could walk away we still have to confront and push back on Iran's very destabilizing behavior in other realms but I would much rather be doing that against an Iran that had potential to obtain a nuclear weapon rather than one that did okay so you tangled a lot with the Russians you also got some things done with the Russians including the jcpoa including the Security Council resolutions on Libya but since then we've seen Russia go beyond some of its aggressive activities in Ukraine and Crimea we've seen its intervention in Syria of course and we've also seen this effort to intervene in democratic politics here in the United States across Europe and become a kind of global leader championing the subversion of democratic politics and the reassertion of autocracy I I wonder you know as somebody at some renton - it's a brutal picture but as National Security Advisor your job was to look across all of these activities and figure out what's the priority so as you look at Russian behavior today what really worries you the most what do you think needs to be our top priority well when you're dealing with an adversary like Russia you've got to deal with it on multiple dimensions you don't have the luxury of saying we're gonna worry about Syria but not about Ukraine and we're gonna worry about interference in the democratic process but not about its you know provocative activity in NATO airspace we're gonna we have to deal with all of these simultaneously and that's what we endeavored to do in the Obama administration we dealt with the the risk that Russia might try to undermine the territorial integrity of our NATO partners by establishing something called the European response initiative which was a very robust multi-billion dollar investment on behalf of the United States in conjunction with NATO to put NATO forces and augmented equipment stocks on the front lines in Eastern Europe to deter and and and prevent a Russian aggression of the sort that we saw in the early stages in Crimea a little green etc we've stepped up our efforts with NATO to deal collectively as well as unilaterally with the Russian cyber threat we impose very substantial sanctions on Russia with our European partners in response to Russia's behavior in Ukraine and Crimea and we worked hard obviously without sufficient success still to deal with Russia in the Syrian context not only on the chemical weapons but also in terms of trying to deconflict our efforts going against Isis as well as to try to revive a diplomatic resolution we got to do all of these things simultaneously but I think now the particular challenge is that we are a government and a leader of the West that is at best speaking with mixed messages and not leading with the constancy and robustness that our NATO partners rightly should expect when you have a president who on the one hand as of the last few days tweets critical things about Putin but on the other hand we learned today was very upset the the scope of the sanctions that he approved against Russia for the poisoning of the spy former spy in Britain when you have President Trump pick up the phone to congratulate Vladimir Putin on his bogus election victory and then invite him to the Oval Office and fail to mention the poisoning in Britain if we were kind of not being consistent in our message and as a result you know as it was somebody said I think Apple II and it was quoted in the paper today we've got three policies on Russia one from Congress one from the president and one from the rest of the administration and that's a challenge we need one policy that is clear-eyed about the very real threat that Russia poses we need to be sistent and coordinated with our allies in the application of sanctions and I think if Russia continues as appears to be with its interference in democratic processes in Europe and in the United States then it really is time for sanctions that go beyond targeted individuals or targeted entities to more broad-based sectoral sanctions that cover areas that were not covered in the initial Ukraine sanctions so there's more we could do and there's more it's not it's it's it increases the risk and the cost there's no question there are reasons why at the end of the Obama administration and throughout the Trump administration those were not the sanctions of first resort and they're good reasons but I think at a certain stage we have to raise the cost sufficiently on Putin such that it affects his behavior and we've had our intelligence chiefs testified that thus far they don't believe that's been the case so we're meeting at a moment here in Washington when hopes for diplomatic progress between the Israeli government and the Palestinian leadership seem really stymied your administration took several bites at this Apple really tried to move the ball forward and the obstacles seem to have a lot to do with domestic politics both for Israelis and and for Palestinians and these are issues over which the United States has less leverage you told me at one point earlier that after the failure of the Kerry talks in 2014 that the best the United States could really try to do at that moment was to kind of mitigate the damage of a breakdown and preserve the possibilities for diplomacy and for the two-state solution going forward you know we we had president Trump trumpeting at the beginning of his administration how is it will be to get Middle East peace yeah we'll see we'll see but and think that there is a new initiative coming but we haven't seen so far buying from the region that he needs to launch something new and we don't even know exactly what he's got in mind well we actually have no idea right I don't think anybody else does either he may not even know it's possible but we have seen him recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital which of course it is we will shortly see the u.s. embassy open in Jerusalem we've seen him question whether the two-state solution is in fact the goal yeah what's the impact of these kinds of steps where do you think the United States stands now in its role as mediator of this conflict we're going to end on the optimistic news yes for you it we're gonna try well I think like many administration's before it the Trump administration inherited an intractable problem that seems increasingly far from potential resolution the facts that are being created on the ground make the viability of a two-state solution more and more remote the politics as you said on both sides are hostile to a two-state solution particularly I think on the Israeli side at this point and on the Palestinian side do you have had repeatedly leadership that is unable to take yes for an answer so this is as problematic a setup as ever and I think frankly the Trump administration has made a bad situation even more complicated by promising any day now a proposal that as far as I can tell hasn't been amply socialized with either side but certainly not the Palestinian side but I gather both actually and is highly unlikely to be the sort of balanced bridging proposal that can yield progress I think the reaction to the Jerusalem decision obviously on the Palestinian the Arab side only complicates our credibility as an honest broker particularly when President Trump has added that now we have taken this issue off the negotiating table so I think where we are like we still be the mediator in the current circumstance I think it's very hard I think you know under normal circumstances we should continue to try and if I thought that our ambassador and Jared Kushner and all these Middle East experts had you have the wherewithal to craft a balanced plan they you know could bridge the gaps and you know I'd say we should still try but I'm skeptical that that's likely to be the case and in any event I think the US alone is going to be compromised without bringing to a greater extent than we are accustomed to and we like to Europeans and others from the region so yes I promised you we would end on an optimistic note and I you know as I think back on the range of the work you've done in a life of public service you've dealt with a lot of intractable conflicts a lot of devastating humanitarian crises devastating wars you worked through the Rwanda massacre you worked at the UN when the the permanent members were often at loggerheads you worked through seeing Muammar Qaddafi and Bashar al-assad turned guns on their own citizens and yet one of the things I think I've come away with from watching you and working alongside you is that you never give up try not to yeah and one of the kind of key essential qualities of effective diplomacy is persistence and creativity right so I'm I'm curious what keeps you going in those tough situations when you're just knocking heads what is it that gives you a reason to think there is a way through you can find a door and walk through it well I'm essentially an optimist and I think I couldn't be I couldn't do the work that I've done and not fundamentally believe that the course of human history is is forward and that we're making progress and I mean there are all kinds of reasons for that you know maybe it's my experience being born and raised as an african-american woman in 1964 and this and seeing you know through my parents who were raised in you know my dad and the heart of segregation be able to rise to the highest levels of our government and see where we have come from 1964 to the present in this country when you look at the progress has been made globally in reducing poverty and hunger and suffering and girls education and the spread of democracy even though it's obviously under threat today the trajectory is positive and I think you know I was a student of history as an undergraduate and I think you have to have the long view or and and I believe as has often quoted dr. Martin Luther King's statement that the arc of the moral universe bends towards justice I do believe that over time we are perfecting our imperfect cells not just here in the United States but mankind in general it doesn't bend on its own though we have to pull it may after buddy have to we have to keep working and that's why I think the good work you all are here to do to lend your voice to to justice and peace and American leadership is vitally important I think we all individually have roles to play with our voice with our vote with our resources to stand up firmly and together for what we believe in and what gives me the greatest hope now beyond my own children and the folks of their generation who truly see the world in the different and I think better way than we do and certainly then our parents and grandparents did just look at the kids from parkland Florida and look what they have done [Music] I was like many of you I suspect at the March for our lives here in Washington maybe you were here maybe you were elsewhere and I was there with my 15 year old daughter and my husband and friends and the power and the vision and the determination that they have demonstrated and they have galvanized across the country their determination to not rest until are completely insane gun laws or revived revised I think is incredibly important and it gives us all a light to follow and a model for what consistent serious thoughtful collective action can begin to achieve then they're not done we're not done supporting them but they are the next generation and they are among the many reasons that that I remain an optimist I believe in the American people [Applause] [Music] well but [Music] thank you so much Susan folks please join me in thanking Ambassador Susan Rice overtaking [Applause] [Music] [Applause] good afternoon I believe we have some Marylanders in the house I want to first as I told Susan Rice as she was leaving we miss her on Capitol Hill but I think her comments about the strengths of the students that we saw here in Washington we've seen around the nation really gives us hope because despite what the Congress might think what the president might think the power in this country are with the people and our students will not be silenced and they want adults to act as adults I want to thank J Street and congratulate you on your 10th anniversary ten years 70 years for Israel when Harry Truman made that courageous decision in 1948 against the advice of his own State Department to recognize the State of Israel he did that because he understood the our two nations shared common values and that special relationship has been strong ever since because of the fundamental principles of democracy embedded in our country and in Israel shared values recognizing that is the strength of America and the strength of Israel it has been mutually beneficial to both Israel and the United States we both benefit from that relationship clearly on the sharing of intelligence information John F Kennedy said Israel was not created in order to disappear Israel will endure and flourish it is the child of hope in the home of the brave it can neither be broken by adversaries nord demoralized by success it carries the shield of democracy and it honors the sword of freedom President Kennedy was talking about the State of Israel but in reality he was also talking about the United States of America that special bond between two Democratic countries that relationship that relationship goes beyond any individual leader or policy the founding principles of J Street ten years ago support for the people in the State of Israel respectful debate a responsibility to speak out against the policies of Israel or the United States that are not consistent with our Jewish and democratic values you have stayed true to that mission when the Prime Minister of Israel accepts an invitation to address the joint session of Congress creating a partisan division in our own country we speak out against that decision [Applause] when President Trump reacts to the tragedy in charlottesville he quitting those that were there to preach hate white supremists neo-nazis with those that were there to protest that message we speak out [Applause] when the Prime Minister of Israel takes steps that compromises refugees that aren't dere risk of their own lives or crosses the line on how he handles protests in his own country we speak el [Applause] and when President Trump immigration policies that tries to tell the world that we have certain religion that we don't want here in America or people from certain countries because of their demographics that we don't want here in America or that dreamers are not welcome here in America we speak out [Applause] the special bond between the United States and Israel goes beyond any one individual when the leader of Israel or the United States does things that do not represent the founding principles of their country we need to be prepared to continue to speak out this is part of the responsibility of true allies but we must be strategic in our actions to maintain the broad understanding and support within our political system for the people and State of Israel and we have been successful in doing that just take a look at recent action in Congress 3.1 billion dollars in foreign military financing provided by the Congress the United States 700 million dollars in missile defense for Iron Dome and David sling and other technologies in tight tunnel technology that we share between the United States and Israel because we both have problems on tunnels and the support for Israel within the international community Israel needs the United States to speak out when it is being discriminated against in the international forum it was Abba Eban one of the great diplomats statesman's of Israel who observed that if the United Nations General Assembly had a resolution declaring that the earth was flat and that Israel had flattened it it would pay us by a vote of 164 to 13 with 26 abstentions with all the challenges that Israel is facing today it's more important than ever that we work to strengthen the partnership between our two countries the rise of nationalism fueled by anti-migrant sentiment is on the rise throughout the world Pollan hungry turkey NATO allies all now have within their government those are espousing nationalist sentiments and anti-immigrant sentiments we saw in Poland just recently the passage of a law that tries to criminalize the ability to comment on what happened in Poland during World War two I just want to emphasize there was a poll that came out yesterday that the millenniums in the United States two out of three don't know what Auschwitz is about we need to remember our history and we can't let those who want to reinvent what happened before get away with their lives [Applause] make no mistake about it in democratic countries in Europe we're seeing the rise of attacks against their own democratic institutions from within we have not seen that since before World War two we all need to be concerned about it and in Germany which has been pretty strong in dealing with its past the alternative party the extreme party now has seats in their Parliament and quite frankly the International rise of nationalism has been given oxygen by the actions of President Trump his comments in charlottesville allow those who espouse hate to think they have a friend and his anti-immigrant language has made the comments which we see in Europe seem like it's legitimate by the world's greatest democratic power as a result we see the rise of anti-semitism the rise of anti-semitism in the United States and around the world I'm proud to be the special representative of the Organization for Security and Cooperation and Europe's Parliamentary Assembly for any sentenced ism racism and intolerance and also the ranking Senate member of the Helsinki Commission in that pasady I have urged a concrete policy to fight any Semitism by actions giving action to our words so that we can show what is needed it starts with leadership it starts with world leaders speaking out against any form of hate it also involves education and making sure our young people understand the best programs are those jurisdictions that have included strong education on tolerance and interfaith connections are critically important particularly between the Muslim and Jewish communities we need to underscore those relationships Steven Steven Spielberg said as a Jew I am aware of how important the existence of Israel is for all survival of all of us and because I am proud of being a Jew I worry about the growing anti-semitism and anti-zionism in the world we need to pay attention never again we need to pay attention the isolation of Israel is real throughout history there have been governments and communities that have always found a reason to be anti-semitic or anti Zionist they want to deny the legitimacy of the sovereignty of the State of Israel questioning its legitimacy in a part of the world dominated by people of other religions forty years ago the United States Congress recognized that threat as Arab boycotts started to appear by other countries that tried to use their economic power to Israel's economic survival and the United States Congress acted 40 years ago so protecting Israel sovereignty with the strength of the US economy recognizing that we could use our economy to prevent Israel from being isolated efforts in the United Nations to circumvent that 40 year old boycott law they are now under way protecting US companies from being coerced to comply with a foreign countries decision to boycott US allies I authored legislation to try to correct that through actions being taken by international organizations primarily the United Nations Human Rights Council you may have heard about it it's at some controversy I understand that but I want to address what that legislation is aimed at doing it's aimed at preventing the economic pressure on Israel to affect its sovereignty by pressuring us companies to do what they don't want to do two points have come up during that debate one will we protect the freedom of speech and opinion I can tell you I have spent my entire political career defending the First Amendment rights I strongly believe that anyone who wants to criticize Israel or wants to boycott Israel or wants to encourage others to point out Israel I think you're wrong but you have your constitutional right to do that and we're going to make sure that that is protected the other issue which is equally passion for me is that I believe that we should not take sides fact we have taken sides against how settlements have been unhelpful for Israel's long-term survival I want to make sure that we don't do anything in this bill that would compromise the traditional view of this country in regards to Israel's settlements so we have tried to modify the bill and we're still working with it but I tell you it's becoming more and more timely because American companies are receiving letters from the United Nations Human Rights Council questioning whether they are doing business in Israel for the purposes of advertising a boycott against those countries companies that do not respond let us work together to figure out a way to protect the freedom of speech protect the legitimate concerns of all parties but to protect American businesses from being bullied into boycotting Israel we can do this together I believe I believe in our international organizations I'm a strong supporter of the United Nations I think is an extremely important organization and have always supported it I am very concerned about president Trump's policies of America first because to me it's America alone and that's not what this country needs to do so let me give you one concrete example and that is the threat of Iran I listened to Susan Royce's presentation and I agree almost with everything she said Iran is a very dangerous country we know that Israel knows that America knows that and that's why we negotiated Iran nuclear agreement I agree with Secretary Rice that was the deal with the nuclear aspects now in dealing with that many of you are aware that it was a close call for me whether to support that agreement or not it was I came down on the side that it should have dealt stronger on a length of time but once it was signed and put into effect and with Iran complying with that agreement I think it would be so much against the United Nations the United States national security interests if the president were to reimpose sanctions against Iran while Iran is in compliance of that agreement and I will continue doing everything my power to make sure that doesn't happen this is a dangerous strategy that isolates the United States you heard Susan Rice tell you all the reasons let me add one more that is pretty current general dump Ford our joint chief said unless there is a material breach would have an impact on any other countries willingness to sign agreements with America if we walk away from this agreement besides giving Iran of an ability to go back to its nuclear program besides all the isolation of America from our European allies and all that why does the president think we could enter into diplomacy with North Korea who would trust America's agreements moving forward particularly when it has been embodied in the Security Council resolution it is counterproductive to u.s. national security and now when this national security team has replaced general McMaster with John Bolton and is in the process of getting director Pompeo as Secretary of State there won't be any backup in the national security team for America to join the international community in dealing with major diplomatic challenges we have to speak out [Applause] the theme of your conference is a voice for today a vision for tomorrow the greatest challenge is peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians I understand Susan Rice's analysis we all understand that but there's only one course for peace in Israel only one option two states a Jewish state of Israel a Palestinian state living side by side in peace that's the only option [Applause] the United States is beyond any one person the United States must be a facilitator of those talks we're the only country that has the capacity to bring this about one of the great opportunities I've had in life is to be with Simone Perez on several occasions first in the 1970s and listened to his vision for Israel and its neighbors he understood the two-state solution he understood the aspirations of Palestinians and the Israelis and he recognized that by having peace and opening up the Middle East to prosperity that it would be a lasting peace because what people want is an economic future for their children and grandchildren and opening a peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians will lead to that Sherman Perez said Israel welcomes the wind of change and sees a window of opportunity democratic and science-based economics by an by a nation desires peace Israel does not want to be an island of affluence in an ocean of poverty improvements in our neighbours lies means improvement in our neighborhoods in which we live Ramon Perez understood that Israel's future is in - strictly linked to the Palestinians living in peace and prosperity we can make that happen we must we must make that happen so that vision for tomorrow includes the us-israel special relationship remaining one of the most important friendships in the world anchored by shared values common goals and appreciation for history and learning from history towards a brighter future I thank J Street and I thank each one of you for devoting your energies to accomplishing that cause thank you [Applause] [Applause] ladies [Applause] hello everyone [Applause] my name is Ricky Baker coy and I am a fifth year at the University of Chicago for him completing a master's in Middle East Studies I have been involved with J Street u since my second year of college basically since I first learned of the organization last year I served as vice president for the Midwest to the J Street u student board and this year I am an organizing fellow I wanted to share a little bit of why I'm involved with all of you in 1995 there was a giant peace demonstration planned in Tel Aviv in support of the Oslo Accords my parents brought me their six month old infant to the rally they believed it would be a momentous occasion for the history books a major milestone in the peace process the two-state solution was right around the corner characteristically my dad didn't want to stay for the song at the end of the rally but also characteristically my mom really wanted to so they negotiated and we left as the song began as we walked to meet my grandparents at a cafe closeby shots rang out like many young Israelis Palestinians and pro-peace Americans I grew up in the echo of those shots that killed Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin my generation doesn't remember successful peace processes we've seen too many wars and bouts of violence we agonize over the current situation Gaza and more often than not a two-state solution seems impossibly far away so my family left Israel in the fall of 2000 and immediately I was thrust into American politics with mock Bush vs. gore elections in kindergarten my parents would bring me and my sister to the election booths each Election Day we would be told which levers to pull which boxes to fill my parents would describe the candidates and their parties politics don't seem as bleak when you have a firm belief in the democratic process [Applause] in 2015 I attended the J Street conference as a young progressive israeli-american college student J Street was my clear choice for a better future I was mostly looking forward to hearing from Israeli Palestinian and US politicians and decided to stay for advocacy day intoxicated by the mere idea of spending time on the hill and meeting with politicians who in my mind had the power to change everything that Tuesday one of my meetings was with senator dick durbin I was blown away not only were there over a thousand college students and 3,000 total attendees at the conference who shared my values and my vision for tomorrow but there were true political leaders aligned with J Street's mission J Street is the place where the two chapters of my political upbringing came together in addition to reflecting my values J Street has allowed me to grow as a political person through my work with J Street u and most recently with the stop demolitions build peace campaign I have gained concrete skills and sharpened my political thinking this fall J Street you participated in advocating for a Senate letter led by senators Dianne Feinstein and Bernie Sanders the letter spoke out against demolitions in sucia and kana lakum are echoing our stop demolitions build peace campaign Illinois schools were ready J Street you leaders from Northwestern new Chicago and DePaul sent letters to our senators upon learning that Senator Dick Durbin signed the letter we've rallied to thank him in the midst of a pretty hectic finals week this action engaged our College Democrats of University of Chicago chapter even more deeply in support of our work after months a progressive coalition building on campuses across the country the College Democrats of Illinois became the first state chapter to publicly endorse our stop demolitions build peace campaign [Applause] they were soon followed by state chapters of California Washington and we expect many more to come [Applause] tomorrow students will join other J Street activists and advocating for a letter spearheaded by representatives jan Schakowsky and John Yarmuth that calls on Prime Minister Netanyahu to halt the demolition of sucia Canal alkmaar and other villages in Area C [Applause] representative Schakowsky is yet another Illinois political leader with a fierce dedication to progressive politics and the two-state solution J Street used students in Illinois and throughout the country have been lucky enough to engage with the representative on our work through J Street and J Street U students have met with President Barack Obama we've lobbied our members of Congress many of us have interned on the hill and I personally once fist-bumped keith Ellison on a J Street delegation to Israel in the West Bank as students we know that we have much to offer current representatives and candidates and we remain committed to the work of supporting our American political leaders who put diplomacy first who fight against anti-semitism Islamophobia and all forms of bigotry and who fight to preserve the viability of the two-state solution through J Street and it's empowering political work I have been able to come out of the shadows of those three bullets on November 4th 1995 I have found a political home that allows me to participate in the politics I admire in order to realize a world I want thank you [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] thank you very much hello everybody good afternoon dear Jeremy ben-ami that was the voice of God just before I I mean and the leadership and the members of J Street thank you for giving me this opportunity to be with you at such an inspiring conference to be among the thousands of brave women and men of all ages and they see money many young young I can see many young faces around every year to defend your values and principles to give a voice for the mainstream American Jewish community I was one of the first Palestinian officials to speak at J Street in its early stage of establishment [Applause] it feels like yesterday then I said that nothing nothing is more missing than a motivated and principled organization that gives a voice and a call of action to the silent majority of the American Jewish community to the many who believe in peace and who keep the hope for a better tomorrow I am inspired to see your conference today to follow the evolution of your organization becoming the mainstream American Jewish organization defending peace to witness your growth your growth both in numbers and impact your voice has become loud and clear and your contribution to the u.s. political landscape is widely recognized my friends you were river outnumbered and that's why I said what I said this you were never outnumbered all those who believe in a different tomorrow all those who carry hope all those who believe in the goodness of the humankind are always never outnumbered but you were out organized and today and today as I said then many years ago you give us hope and confidence about the future [Applause] because the future is not shaped by those who merely witness it the future is shaped by those who author it and I I see many of you here who have taken a decision not to only witness the future but to author the future for all of us thank you very much and it is an opportunity to commend you to commend J Street to commend the relentless work your dedication your investment your boating our board all that came your way it is an occasion to commend you and I repeat what I said many years ago you have partners in us the people of Palestine and the leadership of Palestine so my friends we Palestinians remain steadfast in our vision of peace and self-determination two states on the 1967 borders the state of Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital an open City for all the three Abrahamic faiths [Applause] and the just solution to the issue of refugees and the State of Israel yes refugees do deserve an applaud they have rights they have rights they have dreams they are not a burden they are an asset there are human being they deserve your applause refugees deserve your award for years they have been bedevil Palestinian refugees including myself have been a force of God everywhere they go look at them in the in the Gulf states look at them wherever they go they are an asset and their rights can always be respected but here I would also say that that vision would have to include a State of Israel with final and secured internationally recognized borders and with neighborly relations with us and reef my friends we still firmly believe that this is the best way forward and let me say this the two-state solution was never a palestinian demand was never about absolute justice the two-state solution was a palestinian concession painful but essential for investing in the cause of peace and investing in the cause of fees is not by words but by deeds and we have done our share we have recorded we have done our share and we will continue doing our share this is - crushers - Noble - long waited for we have done our dues and we will continue doing audience number one we have recognized the State of Israel on 78% of historic Palestine that recognition came from the legitimate leadership of the Palestinian people from Yasser Arafat and the PNC voting in the most national democratic way for peace and for recognizing the State of Israel and we take no shame and recognizing the two-state solution we take no shame and recognizing our neighbors we may take a bit of this a bit of shame on not achieving the end game but investing in peace is something that we always and will always do we signed the Oslo Accords in 1993 because we believe that we have to engage in a process that would see the end of Israel's occupation that would see the establishment of a sovereign state of Palestine and we did not wait for that to come we engaged in building the state bottom up from the ground building our institutions that the international community have said that already it's at the level of sovereign independent middle-income countries we are so proud of our institutions of our policemen of our ability to provide for our people in the spheres of health education despite the most adverse circumstances and we work during this years with the Arab world to offer Israel the Arab Peace Initiative 22 Arab countries 22 Arab countries and with them the rest of the Islamic world 57 countries to offer Israel normalization as an outcome of peace we worked with our brothers in the Arab world and sisters because we want to provide an incentive for peace but we will not allow this to be a substitute for peace normalization is an outcome of peace not a substitute for peace and my friends we have no time to men's our words it has become bluntly clear that Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is only interested in a win all lose old formula and despite all this for all these years we did not let go of our vision of our commitment of our investments for peace our response during all these difficult years was to face up the challenges by adopting non-violence including popular peaceful struggle on the ground and reverting to internationalism internationalism the international law the international system the United Nations since 1988 when that declaration energies of declaring an independent state of Palestine abso facto recognising the State of Israel and since then we have been unwavering rock-solid in our commitments we did not change a bet we do not allow difficult times to change our commitments our vision our sense of destination no we defended we solidify it we protected since then our asses have been absolutely known to the world but this is an occasion in front of you my friends to reaffirm our yeses the first yes yes to a dignified and just peace the second yes yes to a two-state solution on the 1967 borders [Applause] yes to internationalism and to international resolutions yes to non-violence yes to non-violence we will not allow we will not allow the curse of blood to stand between us no matter what our political differences is no matter how much the operation is no matter how many snipers there is around Gaza now we shall believe in the power of the people the masses the power of the non-violence number five yes to a to democratic and egalitarian States [Applause] it is not just any two states we are after these two sovereign states must give their citizens full equal rights no other consideration no other consideration but the rule of law not decreed not the color not the religion not how tall or how short not the language you speak or you the God you pray for but the fact that you are a citizen of that state yes to that yes to that no to racism no to discrimination and finally yes to a meaningful genuine credible peace process [Applause] but friends hear me out here and it is important that I say on behalf of the people and leadership of Palestine what I am about to say now the leadership that has been struggling for over half a century bringing their people and bringing the international community to the consensus that peace can never prevail without justice we may have issues back home my friends and I take note of any voice here we may have issues but don't waste our time or lose sight of the fact that Palestinians can only themselves bring about the representation don't meddle and don't intervene and I'll go on on this because it's an important subject nothing we pride ourselves more in Palestine than our democratic process it has been interrupted for 10 years painfully so it has interrupted because no one wants to convene elections without these elections being national we will not convene elections without East Jerusalem and we will not convene elections without Gaza we will only convene elections when elections are national and we are working towards that to be national now I want to say and ask ask the people of Palestine they will never ever accept any leader or leadership if they are not elected even when they are elected there are a lot of opposition so leave us alone our domestic situation is not easy but I tell you we cherish our ability to renew our democratic process now about how much our yeses are unwavering solid like a rock have always survived the test of time moments of despair like this one but so are our nose so are our nose so here is the first no here is the first no no to redefining what the two-state solution means no to that no to that big fat no no state - no state - no antrum arrangements we've done that no lasting process we've done that we want lasting peace no state with provisional borders no state without East Jerusalem its capital and no state at the expense of two-thirds of the Palestinian people no state without resolving the issue of refugees and no state without Gaza and no state in Gaza and let me say the last no in this area no state no state with one Israeli soldier on its soil not one the second big known we have is no to the US administration decision on Jerusalem no to that no to that no beg no we rejected that announcement and decision then and we reject it now because that decision does not help the cause of peace because Jerusalem is the key to peace and because Jerusalem is the very heart of what you must believe in the two-state solution without Jerusalem there can never be a two-state solution that decision was not only counterproductive to peace but it did not do justice to the identity to the history to the reality of Jerusalem Jerusalem for millennia has been inclusive inclusive open tolerant diverse people of all faiths Jews Christians and Muslims left together coexisted the keys of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre is hauled for hundreds of years with a Muslim family and Muslim families in the old days with candle the Jewish candle this Shabbat candle for the Jewish neighbors throughout the history of that city but today is an anomaly Jerusalem will always reject claims of exclusivity no one can have exclusive claims of Jerusalem and no one shall we we promise you we vow in front of you that once peace prevails once the state of Palestine is established once that state has East Jerusalem its capital that city will not only recognize the Jewish connection to Jerusalem but we will celebrate the Jewish connection to the all these unilateral decisions by the Israeli Prime Minister and by the US administration but particularly by the administration do not change the status of Jerusalem I assure you or the status of refugees after cutting aid to honor rule or change the status of the historic and legitimate rights of the Palestinian people they don't it doesn't the only status that changed since the announcement in Jerusalem the only status that changed is the status of the US as a mediator since 1988 we kept our promises our commitments and our relentless investments and efforts to achieve the two-state solution we stayed the course we stayed on the negotiating table for 26 years non-stop so those who say we walk away from negotiation come on grow up we have been over negotiating if you want the truth and during these 26 years my friends America could not bring itself to the level of an honest neutral mediator but we kept on we kept on you know why we kept on for 26 years because the US during all that time did not change its promises did not change its policy it remained committed to the two-state solution on the 1967 borders unfortunately no more by the 6th of December 2017 the US has reneged on its own promises has reneged on its long-held US policy and has violated international law but let us set the record clear very clear there will be no deal there will be no deal no agreement short of fulfilling the international resolutions that we have long accepted there will be no deal that does not fulfill the very right righteous legitimate historic rights of people in all Divine's what happened was not taking Jerusalem of the table my friends but removing the table altogether removing the table all together since the start of the peace process in 1991 we have never and will never negotiate the principles please hear me out here not once from the Madrid to the Oslo to the roadmap to name it however we accepted to negotiate the principles the principles would be listed on page 1 of all these agreements we were there for 26 years to find ways with our Israeli neighbors and with the international community led by the u.s. to implement these principles no one no one has the right to undo these principles but however yet we will not succumb we will not succumb to the current reality and we will work with you and with the million of peace-loving people worldwide to protect our vision to maintain our commitments and to keep working towards a two-state solution our alternative to this unilateral acts is not unilateralism our alternative is multilateralism multilateralism we are calling for the ending of the exclusion of the international community our President Mahmoud Abbas expres nted in the Security Council only in February the Palestinian peace plan the PPP I hope you all going to also revisit that plan it's crucial in that plan he called for the convening of an international peace conference by mid of this year that international conference by the international community should provide a way forward for the two-state solution should provide a mechanism for implementing international resolutions my friends it is not only the absence of a state of Palestine that is keeping the grave injustice it's not just the absence of the state that is keeping the injustice but it is the presence of Israel's military occupation that sustains and deepens the morally the morally corrupted system of hegemony subjugation and segregation for those who believe in the two-state solution the goal must be one ending the military occupation ending the military occupation and then the military occupation for peace can no longer my friends afford ambiguity and there are few who are very ambiguous on purpose for justice can no longer be left to spend doctors and self-centered politicians and we have many of them these days peace is too noble too precious long waited for and the one thing that will make it nearer is the clarity of the undivided undivided values and principles and the clarity of our joint purpose and action what will produce peace my friends is us all of us standing united to read the Israelis the Palestinians the region and the rest of the world of the Blake named military occupation [Applause] our people and I must go faster I'm about to finish but our people are being humiliated incarcerated terrorized and killed every day we cannot afford processing the peace process another hundred years as maybe the Israeli current government wants to we want it now it's urgent very urgent and we see that it's not all about the despair surround all of us but it's also about the hope and I'll give you a few examples of the hope that fills our hearts the first is that we also see the responsibility to us towards many Israelis that they see their children and grandchildren and they think of their future we see we see that despite there's uncertainty and the vicious attacks by the anti peace camp we still have the hope because of our people the Palestinian people the Palestinian people in Buddhist in vain in a lean in Nabi Saleh in kavorka Dome in Jerusalem in July in Gaza the last two weeks adopting mass nonviolent means coming up with creative ways we see that power coming out when people are using prayer mattresses to declare their rights and to defend their rights as happened in Jerusalem we take absolute note and we are heart warming of Palestinians Palestinians and by the way unfortunately accidents road accidents happen regularly in the West Bank and it does warm our hearts when Palestinian ordinary citizens rush to save the lives of Israelis who are involved in these traffic accidents because in the end it's our humanity that comes first before anything else [Applause] Bob Hope is the young American Jews like the brave souls in F not now F not now hope is the Israeli human rights group bait Salem [Applause] hope is the Israeli peace activists that immediately went to Gaza last week look these Rayleigh soldiers face-to-face to hold them accountable for their lethal actions and targeted killing of Palestinian civilians that is hope for us hope is Tamar Sandberg is she here the Mohr's am bring calling on her government to investigate fully what happened in Gaza hope is rabbi Eric a Sherman who stood up to subtler extremists beating him before continuing their job of beating the Palestinian farmers hope is the many many Israeli activists who stand shoulder to shoulder with us as we struggle to end the occupation it warms my heart to know we have allies like you and like them back their allies with such courage and conviction to stand up for what is right you are not dreamers but realists you are not dreamers but realists you understand too well that the best future is a future that shines just as bright for Palestinians as it does for Israelis that's what I see in this room the hope for all sides to live together we also take hope from American leaders principled leaders representatives and I'm humbled that the man who will take this stage be after me as senator Bernie Sanders we noted his courageous brave defense not of Palestinians but of the American values he represents we know that his defense Sanders senator Sanders of the rights of people in Gaza and all over to protect the right for peaceful protest it is their right to protest peacefully and we take hope from the many many many American youth all over all over who are doing one thing they are no longer considering the American values to be undivided the values of freedom of justice of liberty of potential and prosperity we see them everywhere they are growing the public opinions are showing that the American public particularly youth give us hope and certainty I'd like to end here by saying this you in this room give us then give the cause of peace real real hope the hope that keeps us going despite all the above that hope will get us through these difficult times we promise you and towards a better future remember my friends the road is long and tiring it is it is us however that are winning it is us that are winning because we are on the right side of history [Applause] we stay strong together and uphold our shared values for equality human rights and justice across all divides do not let the current circumstances discourage you you know better than anybody else that the best antidote to discouragement is action through action we create the future that we want my friends and I believe that we are much nearer to the future we want than those who are pulling us away from the future we want we are striving for a just peace and our striving for just peace starts with ending occupation together my friends let's keep the March thank you very much [Applause] [Applause] good afternoon I am NOT Bernie Sanders I [Applause] want to thank Jeremy ben-ami I want to thank the Jace Tree Board of Directors and all the volunteers for inviting me to this incredible gathering I want to thank all of you for advocating for democracy and for diplomacy especially in these trying times I'm here today because I'm a progressive I'm here today because I'm a Jew and I'm here today because I believe in Israel and I believe that the United States must continue to safeguard Israel's right to exist in its right to flourish as a nation as a nation we should protect Israel from daily threats and make sure that the Israeli military is the strongest in the region so that our allies never face a fair fight I also believe that the best answer to any challenge to Israel's long-term security is to States one for the Israelis and one for the Palestinians and I'm here especially because I worry that people are starting to abandon this idea leaders here in Washington and in Israel have started to play coy about their support for the two-state solution even redefining it increasingly they have taken action that erodes the path forward but there is only one let excuse me there is only one path to a lasting peace there is only one path that maintains Israel's status as both a democracy and a nation-state of the Jewish people and that path is to States and that is why that is why this conference is so important and that's why J Street is so important you are one of the clearest voices calling for the two-state solution at a time when Israel supporters stand between a rock and a hard place on the one side you have the most right-wing government in Israel's history on the other you have a growing number of people in the United States who confuse disagreement with disloyalty 55 years ago dr. Martin Luther King jr. was sitting in a prison reading the newspaper when he came across an open letter from a group of clergymen the letter was to him it criticized dr. King for coming to Birmingham to protest and so he wrote them back he said I'm here because injustice is here and he went on to compare himself to the Jewish prophets who left their villages to travel far and wide to tell people this is what the Lord says like them dr. King felt compelled to carry the gospel of freedom beyond his home town dr. King finished that letter from the Birmingham jail 55 years ago today and his words are just as important now as they were in 1963 they remind us not to stay home and stay silent when we see injustice and they also remind us that the American instinct will always be to confront injustice wherever it may be and that's why President Truman supported the creation of Israel there were lots of reasons for him to simply stay out of it to leave it to the British or to the United Nations but he could not stand to see Jews languish in the concentration camps he knew that the only way forward was for the United States to support the creation of the State of Israel but today u.s. support for Israel is in danger and the threat comes from two places first it comes from anti-semitism here in the United States which has become a flood tide in one year anti-semitic incidents have increased by nearly 60 percent and frankly it's coming from all sides Philip Spencer an emeritus professor of Holocaust and genocide studies at Kingston University has documented how the Nazis were able to build a movement based on anti-semitism it's because the political parties never pushed back not the Social Democrats or the Communists in Germany and not the resistance across the continent we've got to remember this because the obscene call of anti-semitism must be condemned every time it is heard and it's easy for us to look at another country or another political party and say enough do better it is a tougher conversation when the problem is in our own tent but we know that we cannot look the other way when people who would otherwise be our progressive allies speak out of ignorance or fear or convenience and they cross a moral line and so we need to engage in dialogue with people who don't understand who have questions about Israel's founding and Israel's current actions we have to engage but we have to show people where the moral lines are which brings me to the second threat of American support for Israel and that is the smothering of debate and dialogue here in the United States the the parameters around our debate have gotten dangerously out of control it's to the point where if you're not willing to see the United States pick any fight on behalf of the Israeli government then you're not a friend of Israel but we should not be afraid of debates or disagreements these are the marks of democracy not to mention the essence of what it means to be Jewish growing up in Honolulu my dad argued about Israel with the head of my religious school who argued with my rabbi who argued with me when I traveled to Israel with the National Federation of Temple youth I argued with my friends about Israel and while you're here this week I expect that you will argue amongst yourselves it's what we do we are not a monolith on these issues that's the antithesis of our tradition as Americans and as Jews instead of fearing debate we should fear belligerents and blind devotion Scot Pirlo a rabbi and the sixth and I congregation has talked about the beauty and ethical understanding that Jewish homelessness has given us throughout history that remains true today we can still bring great clarity to the Jewish moral vision and it's in the Jewish interest for others in Israel and around the world to be able to listen to different perspectives so here's my view we should not go back on a two-state solution we should not move the u.s. embassy to Jerusalem and accept as a condition of a peace process [Applause] we should not pull out of the Iran deal which is the only thing keeping nuclear weapons out of the hands of our enemy and we should take in as many refugees from Syria as we are capable of taking and if you don't agree with every single one of my views on Israel or American foreign policy that's okay we can carve out some space in the American political sphere for a difference of opinion but at the moment that space is far too small and far too private if you look at my positions and put them in the 80s or 90s they would be mainstream if you compare my views on Israel to the views of the American public right now I'd probably be right in the middle but in Congress I am on the left edge and that cannot hold in 2016 less than half of Jewish Americans felt that the Israeli government was sincere in its pursuit of peace and younger Jews in the United States are even more doubtful they are likely to say that the United States gives too much support for Israel and we know that Israel faces the danger of anti-semitism and the danger of foreign and domestic threats but it also faces a more foundational danger if American political support for Israel is undermined if we don't allow robust debate if we don't allow people to feel comfortable to support the existence of Israel while questioning its government periodically then over time the American Israeli relationship itself will frame [Applause] and so I'm committed to making the Democratic Party a big tent pro-israel party where there's room for everyone from Bernie Sanders to me to Chuck Schumer and I am committed to growing the number of progressives who care about Israel but we do have a lot of work to do as dr. King wrote in his letter from Birmingham human progress does not roll in on wheels of inevitability progress for Israel progress for democracy and progress for peace will only come if we do the hard work and we do it ourselves we are in a moment when the work is daunting at times it feels like a worst-case scenario but if there's one thing that I've learned from the past 15 months it is this the voices of the American people make a difference they can keep our country on track and as long as you continue to raise your voices we will make progress together thank you for all you do ladies and gentlemen please welcome our panel Daniel Levy and member of knesset merav Miha le [Applause] hello Jay streets so uh you would think that they've been sitting here a while according to the response yeah so uh I know you like short plenaries and short planners here we've been told to talk about setting the table for peace but I would be amiss if I didn't first just say how great it feels to be here on the 10th anniversary of J Street [Applause] Marathas been with us many times for me looking back when we were still thinking what the name would be drafting the first papers with Jeremy the first pitches and J streets grown from strength to think and a decade of amazing leadership by Jeremy ben-ami and if you'd have told me if you'd have told me ten years ago this is where we'd be I don't think I'd have imagined it could have been this much of an achievement but if you'd have told me ten years ago some other things that might also have given me a reason to pause to consider what the future holds and maybe it's my lack of imagination but if you'd have told me that Gaza would still be under siege Gaza and the West Bank divided the Palestinian leadership despite what we heard still bereft of a strategy if you'd have told me that the cast of characters in the Israeli government would look as it does that the narrative would so often be one that is offensive and racist if you'd have told me that a leader of the new Israel fund would be held for questioning at ben-gurion airport for her political views and affiliations or than another Jewish group jvp would be banned from entering Israel I look I also couldn't have imagined an American president who calls his former FBI director a slimeball or that the priestly duties of the Kohanim would include paying hush money to porn but in setting the table for this conversation what you know what worries me and where I think the challenge lies is it's gotten worse but the pendulum hasn't swung back nearly enough and what I really wouldn't have imagined is that there had been insufficient pushback and blowback and counter reaction across many fronts of course inside Israel and mihrabs here merabh can speak for herself I wish we had more memorable and I wish we had a more effective opposition if I may say including the leader of your own party but you don't have to respond to that I will good on the Palestinian side I heard a lot but I'm not seeing a lot and what I what I heard one of the things I heard that was fascinating is that I heard listed all the villages in Area C where there's nonviolent resistance I heard about Gaza and Jerusalem that's all the areas where you don't have the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian security forces that's a real challenge on the regional side I'm we've seen a collective shrug not a collective roar and an attempt to do normalization without the Palestinians or even against the Palestinians the international community has again shown its robust fecklessness and in America it's perhaps the source of hope and also of course greater frustration because you see an administration so aligned with the most egregious policies of the current Israeli government but you also see what Jay Street has achieved I was moved by we heard from Ricky of Jay Street you and the end of demolitions campaign I was a little older than six months at that rally and in Robin Square and the emergence of a group like if not now so let me just share with you more after to get us going the three things that have been on my mind in terms of what one might do in this current situation because I do not believe that right now in this precarious moment is the time for grand initiatives actually I don't think there's a silver bullet I do not want to do the injustice to the English language of coining the phrase Trump peace plan I have no expectations from this administration where that leads me to focus is three things number one hold the line hold the line on 67 on international law on opposing what's gone on with Jerusalem hold the line also of the logical sequence of the Arab Peace Initiative the future of Israel will be determined by how Israel interacts with the Palestinians those under direct occupation in the West Bank indirect occupation in Gaza in the Twilight Zone of East Jerusalem those were second-class citizens in Israel and the Palestinian diaspora it will not be determined by where the flights to and from Israel happened to cross Saudi airspace or weather on whether there are meetings official unofficial between Israelis and Gulf officials that's not going to determine our future so number one how do we hold the line number two for me this is so much about the incentive and disincentive structure how do you change and this is difficult I know and it's difficult for an Israeli patriot and for yourself how do you change the cost-benefit calculation it's great to have incentives for peace but what are the disincentives for continuing with the status quo how do we create accountability and I wonder how one and when one more effectively revisits the question of sanctioning and whether we should make common cause with some of the most regressive elements in the community and beyond we may disagree with fellow progressives on an endgame or some may but surely we have more in common and surely the instrumentalizing of anti-semitism and the miss defining of anti-semitism is undermining the struggle against anti-semitism Israel Israel should not be held to a lower standard and Israel should not be should not be used as the vehicle for launching attacks on civil rights and freedom of speech an eye I disagree with something I heard earlier I think there should be a UN database on companies involved in the settlements and it should be published and it's the right thing to do and my third thing is Gaza is a humanitarian crisis but it's born of a political situation we have to address the politics Gaza can't be a mini state Gaza can't be a perpetual prison Gaza can't be a protectorate of Egypt now here you know I think there is much common ground inside the Israeli security establishment that thinks people are doing the wrong thing there and maybe even some possibility for movement within the government but um that has to be linked back into something political so those are the three initial thoughts I wanted to share with you but initial and and perhaps final as well merav I'm I don't know how you see the way out of the impasse that we're clearly in okay [Applause] well Danielle who became 10 years older during this time no not now not now I mean I mean since the first J Street convention seriously that's what I meant doesn't remember that he's responsible to bringing me to the first J Street convention a long before I was in politics or at least in formal politics I had the privilege of being in Washington in the first J Street Convention and to remember if you think that you are excited and energized about what's happening now you have no idea those of you who weren't here ten years ago because you were far too young to be allowed to go out of the house alone and and this energy that was then and he's here now is part of the ability of this camp that believes in peace and believes in the two-state solution as a way for peace sustainable real peace and as a way for Israel to be sustainable and secure and the homeland of the Jewish people mind you all of the Jewish people without distinctions this is a place for us to voice our beliefs and what we're all working for so hard but in those ten years not only did we get a little bit older but and and the things that Daniel mentioned have happened but also in these ten years we all of us are now in a much more unfortunately in a much more I would say defensive almost corner a lot has become much more difficult the situation in many in many angles has become much more dire and it has become more difficult for us to fight for what we believe in so when I said I will comment on your saying about the opposition in Israel I do want to make you think about Democrats in America in the last year okay and keep in mind that the opposition in Israel has been living under this kind of regime for 25 years already ever since the incitement is against its haka beam ever since the incitement against the also Accord that was supposed to bring the two-state solution with peace to Israel and Palestine and the people who did not want this to happen are still working to make sure that this doesn't happen and unfortunately ever since then most of the time they've been in power now the opposition in Israel which consists of the Zionist union which is labor and the movement of Tzipi Livni and labor with a big abayas chair right now and minutes and other partners have not strayed from its hoc Rabin's way of working towards two states and peace and democracy and Israel as the Jewish Democratic home of the Jewish people not straight I want to assure you that because I know how trendy it is to speak about how the opposition is not good enough not loud enough not successful in our well sometimes we ourselves yes we wish that we had been able to throw away the government that we think is doing Israel wrong but you know what no opposition in the world ever managed to throw down a government it's always the government that brings down itself and I have news for you this government will bring itself down as well now keeping the line what you refer to Daniel is not as easy as well keeping not on either frontier because we have a government that works actively and formally they're not hiding it as they used to in the past they're working towards annexation they're working towards killing the mirror option of the two-state solution we are fighting that as best we can we are voting against whatever legislation proposal that they're bringing we are filibustering everything every initiative that they bring we are shouting as loud as we possibly can but we are facing the same incitement and dealy legitimization that it's hawk robin had to deal with this is the same dynamic these are the same forces and there are even more self-confident today and we have to fight it even stronger than we had to in the past your partnership is super important for us to be able to do this so thank you now I've been listening to you I was I'm here for today's I had the pleasure of speaking on some sessions and listening to you more than I mean I listen to the speakers but I listened to you and I heard you applauding so strong and so enthusiastically when people talk about the victims or the people that you consider to be the victims but I didn't it hurt me actually to hear you not applauding when the last speaker said that he believes in the State of Israel and its right to exist and its right to security and the importance of it it's easy to get confused I'm saying this because this is something that we have to deal with constantly but I think it was it's always attributed to him for your British author who said patriotism means to support your country at any time and it's your government only when it deserves it but don't mix between the two I said in my inaugural speech to the Knesset which took place five years ago Israel is in a strong and secure place maybe more than ever before thankfully it is in this position I strongly believe that from this place Israel must take initiative to find a solution for the conflict with the Palestinians specifically and with the Arab world and certainly there is a big part of the Arab world that wants it today more than ever and find a solution and work towards the possible peace [Applause] we should do that in partnership with our current enemies but we should not relieve them from their responsibilities to doing everything they they can on their part to contribute to an effort of peace I'll conclude for now by saying that sometimes I feel we are in the midst of a tragedy Israelis and Palestinians are too often like up marriage there is so much potential there we just need good counseling unfortunately there isn't one right now around but I'm sure and certain and I know that there will be and one last thing this session is called setting the table for what was it set each table whose piece I believe yes yes you know when I was in eighth grade they split the classroom in school and the boys were sent to study electronics whereas the girls were sent to study household management now now don't boo don't boo for four civilizations it has been girls and women who have specialized in setting tables this is one other thing that will contribute a lot to not only setting the table for peace but also getting one when we have more women [Applause] all I can follow that with is to promise you that when murabba myself normally sit down for a conversation it does not consist of two ten minute speeches at each other and then we leave and part ways unfortunately that's what today's conversation between Mara I invite you to come to a cafe in Tel Aviv to witness the other kind of conversation that we have I'll say one short thing in response to what you said there are at the risk no I I I do want to say this because merav made an important point about imagine what you're going through now carrying on for 15 years and my comment on that is do not let the abnormal become normal and one of the things that I think happened in Israel is that we didn't know how to pull back the conversation and people kept thinking okay we'll just move a little more here a little more here a little and you never know when to stop and that is a mistake I believe politically strategically that we have to pull ourselves back from so endeth the conversation between Daniel and there are [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] like [Applause] thank you [Applause] thank you I think we're in friendly territory thank you very much and let me and let me provide greetings to all of you from around the United States from Europe and especially those who have come from Israel and Palestine welcome and it is an honor to be with you today I also want to give a special greeting to many of the students who and as I travel around the country I have to say that when we talk about the future of the United States I am very confident given the young people that I have seen their energy and their idealism is going to make this country become what it must become thank you young people and I want to thank Jerry for inviting me to address your conference today and for the courage that you have shown in tackling some enormous ly contentious issues now more than ever we need organizations like J Street who are prepared to break with failed policies of the past which have led us into a world of increased militarism hatred and never-ending Wars too often our foreign policy debate here in Washington is dominated by those whose answer is to drop more bombs as we saw in Syria a few days ago rather than engage in the hard work of diplomacy and negotiation and I want you to think about this but after 17 years of war in Afghanistan after 15 years of war in Iraq after years of growing hostility and armed conflict between Israel and the Palestinians after growing tensions between Sunni and Shia forces throughout the entire region after the expenditure of trillions of dollars and massive loss of life and displacement it is clear that we need a new direction in attempting to bring priests stability and justice to the Middle East and I applaud applaud J Street for the important role that they are playing in that process my friends the issues that we are dealing with are enormous ly complicated nobody I know has any simple or magical answers to them and real solutions will require a great deal of hard work but what I do know is that the United States of America our great country should lead the world with a foreign policy which emphasizes the need to bring nations together which focuses on diplomacy and international cooperation rather than a foreign policy that is committed to the use of military force [Applause] and let me also say this as someone who believes absolutely and unequivocally in Israel's right to exist and to exist in peace and security as someone who as a young man lived in Israel for a number of months and is very proud of his Jewish heritage as someone who is deeply concerned about the global rise of anti-semitism and all forms of racism we must say loudly and clearly that to oppose the reactionary policies of Prime Minister Netanyahu does not make us anti Israel [Applause] I would like to stress today that one of the places where a new turn toward diplomacy and cooperation is desperately needed is Gaza after being blockaded for over a decade the situation in Gaza is now a humanitarian disaster a 2012 UN report predicted that if current trends continued Gaza would become unlivable a follow-up report last year said that day might have already come according to the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem quote the coastal aquifer which Gaza relies on as its primary salt water source has been polluted by over pumping and wastewater contamination as a result 96 percent of the water pumped from the aquifer and supplied for domestic use in Gaza is unsafe to drink end of quote according to Oxfam this water pollution is among the factors causing a dramatic increase in kidney problems among causes residents according to the World Bank nearly 80 percent of Gaza residents received some form of humanitarian aid unemployment is over 40 percent among the young people it is even higher nearly 60 percent and let me repeat that youth unemployment in Gaza today is nearly 60 percent it is hard for me to imagine how peace and stability will come to an area where so many young people have given up hope for a decent future this is an issue we must address [Applause] earlier this year Israeli security officials warned that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza increases the chance of incidents at the border fence turning deadly Israeli security officials also believe conditions in Gaza could worsen to the point of a total collapse of order in that territory leading to all-out confrontation between and among various factions within Gaza and with Israel that is what happens when people are desperate and have no options there is much blame to go around for the horrific conditions in Gaza Hamas due to its ongoing repression corruption and insistence on pursuing a violent struggle against Israel bears significant responsibility for the deteriorating situation Israel is to blame as well [Applause] while Israel withdrew its forces from within Gaza in 2005 its continuing control of Gaza air sea and northern southern and eastern borders and its restrictions on the freedom of movement of people and legitimate goods and equipment in and out of Gaza have made the humanitarian crisis there even worse Egypt and the Palestinian Authority have also contributed to this problem as has the United States now as all of us know over the past weeks there have been a series of large demonstrations by the Palestinian people in Gaza tens of thousands of people have demonstrated near the fence dividing Gaza from Israel to protest against the blockade against the occupation and for the right to return to their former homes inside Israel Israeli forces were commanded to respond by opening fire on the crowd with a combination of live ammunition and rubber-coated bullets over the past several weeks over 30 Palestinians have been killed including a journalist who was clearly identified and well over a thousand demonstrators have been injured though the overwhelming majority of these protesters were nonviolent we know that some of them were not and when Israeli soldiers are in danger we can all agree that they have a right to defend themselves [Applause] but I don't think that any objective person can disagree that Israel has massively overreacted to these demonstrations as a New York Times editorial put it last week and I quote the right of Palestinians to demonstrate peacefully should not be controversial journalists have a right to work and people have a right to demonstrate peacefully and to assume and this is the New York Times and to assume that responsible authorities will ensure that they can do so without being shot end of quote I support the statement last week from several of my colleagues in the House of Representatives calling on Palestinians to protest peacefully and on Israel to fully comply with international law and exercise the utmost restraint in their use of deadly force [Applause] I understand that the Netanyahu government is trying to make this all about Hamas in order to deal ejido my's any opposition to the blockade and the occupation the presence of Hamas members among a crowd of tens of thousands does not justify the level of violence we saw and frankly it is amazing to me than anyone would find that point of view controversial I have condemned Hamas as use of terrorist violence and will continue to do so but that violence cannot excuse shooting of unarmed protesters and it cannot excuse trapping almost two million people inside of Gaza [Applause] in my view the United States must play a more aggressive and even-handed role in ending the Gaza blockade and helping Palestinians and Israelis build a future that works for all and if the white house is unable to do that Congress must take the lead and let me make a point now that is much too rarely made because what we're talking about is something that is extremely complicated and the blame goes all over this world but what we should also be focusing on is that while we rightfully criticize the Netanyahu government for its obstructionism and for its unwillingness to seriously negotiate with Palestinians we must also demand that the incredibly wealthy regional States and kingdoms in the area play a new and much more positive role in helping to rebuild Gaza and bring stability to the region [Applause] now we don't talk we don't talk about this a lot but I read a story the other day about the crown prince of Saudi Arabia he was as you know just in the United States for visit and you might have seen one of the 50 different TV and newspaper interviews that he did well in any case as I understand it the Crown Prince recently purchased a $500 million yacht 500 million-dollar yacht because he thought it it looked nice well I'm sure that it did look nice and I am sure that the 300 million dollar mansion that he owns the wealthiest most expensive mansion in the world that also looks nice but what I say to the crown prince and the other multi billionaire leaders in the region stop just talking about the poverty and misery in Gaza do something about it [Applause] I read I read the other day that the Saudi King pledged 50 million dollars to Unruh which is the UN agency that works with Palestinian refugees and 50 million dollars is not a small sum of money but let us not forget that that is 10% of what the crowd parents paid for his yacht [Applause] the problem of Gaza clearly is only one part of the broader conflict between Israel and the Palestinians and here I am very concerned about the policy of the Trump administration regarding the two-state solution I know that this week my friends in Israel will observe your Memorial Day the remembrance of those who have fallen in defense of the State of Israel and we honor those who have flown my friends I believe that the best way to honor the memories of those who have died in defense of our countries is to strive for a future of peace [Applause] when I look at the Middle East I see our ally Israel making enormous technological advances with the capacity to serve as an engine of innovation and prosperity for the entire region that is what the future must be yet they are unable to achieve this today because of the unresolved conflict with the Palestinians and I see a Palestinian people crushed underneath a military occupation now in its fiftieth year creating a daily reality of pain humiliation and resentment ending that occupation and enabling the Palestinians to have independence and self-determination in a sovereign economically viable state of their own is in the interest of the United States Israel the Palestinians and the entire region [Applause] unfortunately Prime Minister Netanyahu and his allies seemed to be preparing for a very different future a future in which Israel controls the entire territory between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River in perpetuity and the Palestinians are best provided limited autonomy within a disconnected series of Canton's the settlements continue to grow slowly diminishing the chances for any peaceful resolution but building more settlements will not bring peace demolishing Palestinians homes and villages will not bring peace [Applause] well last year is some of you may know I wrote a letter to Prime Minister Netanyahu a lot a long with nine of my Senate colleagues protesting the deeply inhumane policy of demolishing Palestinian villages and I want to take this opportunity to thank J Street for your support on this issue frankly I wish Donald Trump was as committed as you are to the cause of peace and stability in the Middle East but to say the least that does not appear to be the case and that is an understatement even though he claims to want to make the ultimate deal that deal is now further away than it has ever been and trust in the United States as an honest and even-handed broker is almost non-existent and one of the main reasons for that is president Trump's extremely unwise decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel [Applause] everybody knew that at some point the United States was going to make this recognition but the idea was that we would do it at the end of a process in a way that recognized the importance of Jerusalem to all people to Jews to Christians Muslims and the Palestinian people instead by recognizing only its importance to Israel president Trump has severely undermined the peace process friends let me also say that I am very concerned that the Trump administration still has not stated its support for this two state solution as a goal because if we do not have a two-state solution what will we have if Palestinians and the occupied territories ought to be denied self-determination in a state of their own will they receive full citizenship and equal rights in a single state these are very serious questions with significant implications for the United States broader regional partnerships and goals for our interests in our values we should not ever downplay the political challenges of reaching a solution they are very very difficult but if we have faith in the future if we are prepared to work hard if we are prepared to go to the negotiating table they are doable we can accomplish that goal [Applause] the truth is that the parameters of a solution are well known they are based in international law they are based in multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions and they are supported by an overwhelming international consensus to States negotiated based on the 1967 lines with Russa ylim as the capital of both states my friends before I end I'd like to take a moment to touch upon some new and emerging challenges our societies are now facing not just in Israel or the United States but all over the world as I think we are all aware the last several years have seen very troubling political developments and that is the rise of intolerant authoritarian political movements and governments which are attacking the very foundations of democratic rule these movements have drawn strength from the fact that at a time of increased globalization climate change exploding technology growth in ala gawky kleptocracy and corruption massive levels of income and wealth inequality and millions of immigrants fleeing war-torn regions more and more people all over the world have come to see their governments as ineffective and not delivering for them or their children and in the midst of all of that we have leaders like President Trump and many others who are willing to exploit these frustrations for their own political and economic ends instead of bringing us together to resolve these difficult global crises these demagogues attempt to try and divide us up by the color of our skin by the country we came from by our gender or our religion or our sexual orientation and I say to President Trump and to other leaders around the world who are using that political strategy in this country we have struggled for too many years against all forms of discrimination against African Americans against Jews against Latinos against Italians against Irish against the gay community we have struggled too long and have come too far we are not going back to bigotry and discrimination [Applause] as history has reminded us time and time again the antidote to hatred division and resentment is to bring people together around a shared vision of equality and prosperity of creating governments that work for all people not just the few the brothers and sisters we have an enormous amount of work in front of us in so many areas and no area for this planet is more important in terms of trying to create peaceful resolutions than is the cauldron of the Middle East so I just want to thank J Street and I want to thank all of you for having the courage to get involved in this issue and while today we look around us with deep concern I am absolutely convinced that the future will belong to those of us who believe in peace and injustice not those who believe in bigotry and hatred thank you all very much [Applause]

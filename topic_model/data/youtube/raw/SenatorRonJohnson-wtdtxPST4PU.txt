I mean senator Johnson a mr. chairman a director Pompeyo thank you for your past service also I'll thank you your and your family for your willingness to serve in this capacity it is a sacrifice as you were walking by me I mentioned that I've read a lot of testimony if four nominees and this written testimony is probably as good as I've seen so anybody interested in this nomination should should really read it one of the reasons I liked it is I could see the concepts required for effective management in it and of course you're going to be in charge of managing relationships but the concepts I'm talking about are Oh in your conclusion of the areas of agreement that's how you accomplish things you know concentrating on the shared purposes shared goals obviously in your handling of the CIA you had a strategy and how you're going to manage that prioritization of tasks so as I ask these questions I want you keeping those concepts in mind in managing your relationship with almost all nations there's an economic relationship and there's a security relationship obviously you're not Secretary of Commerce you're not the US Trade Representative you're the Secretary of State you're concerned obviously about security but our our negotiations terms of trade are going to have a great effect we I was just a joint Steve Daines delegation to China and I was struck by what they were primarily concerned about was the Taiwan Travel Act we thought we were gonna hear all kinds of things about tariffs and they were most concerned about that core area of their interest and don't meddle with that but I just want you to comment on how are you going to deal with that conflict between the trade relationship and the security relationship and the reason I point out with China is we were there we also crossed into the DMZ we're in that we're in the blue house walked into North Korea and from my standpoint talking about priorities our number-one priority with China you know the relationship with China is to get them to continue and they are they are effectively enforcing those sanctions so that we can bring to conclusion the dismantle of Newark North Korean threat so can you speak to that conflict between trade economic relationship and security relationship senator McCarran flick ting at times they are actually additive that is they work together if you can achieve a good economic outcome with a partner country you can get assistance in other places on on a diplomatic matter that you care about deeply or on a military matter place that you want them to assist the United States there's places the good diplomacy can lead to making those not in conflict not zero-sum alternatives where you have to sacrifice an economic relationship for a security relationship how do you do that you build that team is the State Department has an enormous that undersecretary E right has an enormous economic team that in my judgment from what I can see over an extended period of time has not been able to deliver as much value some of the other parts of the economic apparatus of the United States government I am intent on finding the right people to make sure that we have the tools so that we can make a full-throated a broad effort across all elements of the diplomatic spectrum and where it comes into conflict with secure conflict with security issues and I suppose it's highly factual and contextual but the the idea and certainly we've seen this with the issues with China today we thought through the risks we identified a relative priorities and attempted to level-set them and then engaged in diplomatic activities such that the challenges that have been presented to China through the actions that have been taken by this administration of the past weeks didn't upset the applecart with the good work that the Chinese have done helping us on the North Korea challenge so do you agree with me the annihilation of China our top party is there cooperation on North Korea it currently it is today that's the number one priority for this administration and I agree with that would you agree that in terms of the best way to bring China into full compliance with all the trade agreements that working with the other our other trading partners having a good relationship with them and and having us as an alliance working with China and make sure that they actually follow the rules would that also be probably the best way of achieving that I do believe that senator what do you think yeah I want to Regina I really wanted to hear their perspective what do you think their primary goal is what is their strategy what are they trying to achieve senator and let me just say the three things they listen to us bring a billion people out of poverty improve their environment and avoid a financial crisis those are those are their three top priorities they told us said I've heard similar things I've actually in my interactions have heard the economic crisis listed first that is they have this challenge of leverage inside of China today they've got to wind their way out of and they've got to do with their economic growth that's that was their priority that has the secondary benefit that you described for bringing the next several hundred million people into middle-class China when I've spoken with them those were their two fundamental priorities so they have enormous challenges so I guess one of my points being is rather than look at our relationship China's a win-lose situation sure makes an awful lot of sense to me is try and redefine that and try and obtain a win-win situation would you agree with that senator I would agree that in most situations in the world with a handful of exceptions there are opportunities to not make the negotiation that diplomacy is zero-sum game and I and with respect to China in particular I know that's true so to quickly switch to Russia I think it's a historic tragedy the Putin has taken this path can you describe in your words what path has he taken what is what is Russia's aims I'll take Vladimir Putin it is work that the greatest value of the 20th century was the dissolution of the Soviet Union I think he believes that in his heart I think you see his actions follow from that attempts to regain power through and to maintain his power and maintain his popularity through activity taking place outside by pokken america to maintain his not only capability an enormous nuclear arsenal arsenal but also also his desire to be perceived as such as being perceived as a superpower I think all each of the actions you take are to undermine democracy in the West such that the Soviet model the now Russian model is the one that is painted to the world as the one that will lead the world to greatness we know that's not true and we can't let that happen so to prevent that from happening we need to be fully engaged particularly in Europe but anywhere Russia is is pushing and being aggressive for example get in the Balkans I've been over to Serbia Kosovo a number of times I think they're at a hinge point I want to encourage you I think assistant secretary Mitchell has done a great job of certainly encouraging all of us to pay attention so that they decide to continue to look to the west because Russia offers them nothing can just quit comment cetera I agree I would add to that when you say everywhere I would add two locations we see them being adventuresome is Latin America as well so I agree we need to push back in each place that we confront them and by every vector cyber economic each each of those each of those tools that Vladimir Putin Putin is using we need to do our best to make sure that he doesn't succeed and what we believe is ultimate goal is again thank you for your willingness to serve

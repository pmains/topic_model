one of the areas that I know my constituents are interested in are are the National Security implications of of digital trade and and maybe not getting the rules right as as we try and address uh certain challenges so um I'd like to ask Mr Faith some questions in this area um Mr Faith specifically I'm I'm interested in the the challenges some of my colleagues have have brought up uh with with China um China is it's one of the most digitally restrictive economies in the world but it's also one of the largest consumer markets in the world and in your testimony you covered many examples to show how the Chinese Communist party is accumulating and exploiting data and pushing policies that allow them to selfishly Advance their own authoritarian interests so Mr Faith I'll just ask you an open-ended question here what's at stake if we sit back and and we let China dictate standards in digital trade what's at stake if the United States fails to boldly um you know solidify some International standards especially as we look at the Asia Pacific area well thanks Senator as with many things China um taking seriously the words of the Chinese Communist Party leadership and of Xi Jinping uh can be instructive on this issue uh what he has said is at stake in the contest over data and over which countries and political systems are best able to recognize the significance of data and exploit data uh he has said it's the matter of the upper hand in future world power uh he has been saying this actually for quite a while it was 10 years ago that he compared uh data in our Century to oil in the last century as the most important component of Economic and therefore National Power and do you agree with his assessment yes not because it's his but because it's uh there's an insight there no in in fact I think each of us would be wise not to dismiss his assessment because it happens to come from a Chinese communist leader right yes yes sir thank you Mr Faith uh Mr chairman I yield back

democratic senator michael bennett of colorado joins us now he is a member of the senate intelligence committee senator grateful for your time at this important moment in that briefing give me your take is what the united states can send getting there fast enough and if not what's the hang-up and what about from the region there's a lot of russian-made equipment that nato allies have that the ukrainians are more familiar with is that getting across the border fast enough well that that's the stuff that needs to get there and i think it's moving as fast as we can move it everybody yesterday in that meeting underscored how important it is to to move quickly i think the administration is committed to moving quickly i'm sure that here and there there have been logistical hang-ups that are getting smoothed out but it is urgent for us to make sure that the ukrainian people have the benefit of both humanitarian supplies and also lethal weapons to continue to fend off uh putin's terrible aggression do you believe the lines drawn by the biden administration and john in part to keep the nato allies together are the right lines now or as this goes on day 36 and beyond do they need to be reconsidered one of our military analysts yesterday for example said what about a nato humanitarian corridor inside ukraine but that would put nato troops on the ground there i think this is something that has to be reconsidered literally every single day of this conflict we need to make sure that we are giving the maximum assistance to the ukrainian people and to the ukrainian military and at the same time we don't want to inadvertently break up the coalition that got us to this incredible point or inadvertently set off world war iii this is a delicate delicate balancing act but it things should not be etched in stone and we shouldn't leave things off the table this is a this is an evolving situation every single day you have access to information that most of us don't uh when it comes to this question that's been in the forefront in recent days the united states uh declassifying some intelligence to make the case that putin has been misled by his advisers about how bad things are going in ukraine and because of that there's some stress intention as you well know the west including the united states have misjudged and miscalculated when it comes to vladimir putin a lot over the past 20 years what is your sense of his state of play his political standing at home right now well i think his political standing at home right now is unchanged it would be dishonest of me to say anything else but that but that could change i mean as the economic sanctions bite as people begin to realize in russia what actually has happened here which is in their name in the russian people's name uh vladimir putin has invaded another a peaceful democracy that could change i wouldn't count on it changing but it could and with respect to the intelligence let me just say i can't speak to the specific specifics of it but it has been amazing to see how good the intelligence has been leading up to this invasion of putin and one of the things that was very clear was that he was making massive miscalculations because of the totalitarian nature of his society and his leadership he miscalculated massively on the quality of his own army massively on what the ukrainian resistance would look like and massively on the the way the rest of the world would come together and stand united and isolate putin and russia as a result of this one indication to me that the people who look at this most closely understand we will be at this for months and months and months and months is the legislation uh you've introduced with the republican colleague uh rob portman requiring the justice department to essentially take funds seized from russian assets and direct them uh to ukraine in a relief fund to use that money not only to support refugees but then eventual reconstruction of ukraine number one explain why that's important and number two am i right to read that as we are going to be at this for months and months if not years yeah if not years i mean this is going to take a long time uh and unfortunately the ukrainian people who who are suffering you know the the the the uh the daily nightmare of of this invasion by putin you know are going to need our support to recover and when that time comes to me and rob portman my republican colleague from ohio it seemed very appropriate that the things that were seized from putin and his billionaires the value of that ought to go to the ukrainian people for reconstruction we are going to be at this for a very long time i mean the war itself could last a very long time and the recovery is going to be a long time after that you know i'm very happy that we've seen democracies frankly the free world come together in the wake of putin's aggression and remind us what the president zelinski reminds us is at stake he says they're fighting to live their lives the way we live our lives the world should live in peace he told us and and the order should be as liberal as possible which he meant as plural they're fighting for freedom of speech the the right to self-determination freedom of the press for that matter and those are enduring values and we need to be with them through this not just through this war but on the other end senator bennett grateful for your time sir thanks thanks john

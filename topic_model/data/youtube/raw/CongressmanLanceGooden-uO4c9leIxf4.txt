look at that a big part of the discussion is how much supplemental unemployment should be given at the federal level and i noticed a tweet from representative lance gooden he's a republican from texas pointing out what he's heard from businesses in his district because democrats say it has to be 600 republicans feel like if you're being paid more to be on unemployment it may be a disincentive to go back to work here's the tweet he said with 600 extra unemployment expired business owners in my district tell me this week is the first week they've had all their employees show up do you believe that if unemployment is more than people are making it's a disincentive for people to go back to work right now well that's what the democrats want to do they wanted to do that but i have to say this what they really want is bailout money for their states that have done very poorly for years of bad manager not because of covet you can add covert to it but basically for years of bad management they want bailout money they want a trillion dollars to bail out states that and you know the states i don't have to go over them i'm not going to embarrass anybody but there are states that have done very very poorly and they want bailout they want to use covet to get them bailed out and we can't do that with all of that being said we want to get funds to people so they can live but we don't want to disincentivize people from going back to work

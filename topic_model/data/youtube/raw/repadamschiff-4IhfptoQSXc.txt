joining us now Democratic congressman Adam Schiff of California he's chairman of the house intelligence committee and he is a member of the January 6th select committee and served as the lead impeachment manager for the first impeachment trial of Donald Trump Congressman Schiff thank you very much for joining us tonight I want to start with something that the chairman of your January 6th committee has already revealed uh he said that Virginia Thomas in her testimony said that she believes that the 2020 presidential election was stolen he was very clear about that uh what else can you tell us about what she said about the stealing of the 2020 presidential election well Lawrence as you know and as you outlined a couple moments ago I'm very limited in what I can say I I did participate uh in almost the entire interview of several hours uh she didn't assert privilege uh so at least not while I was present so she did answer the questions that we had and of course we had questions that go to many of the things you pointed out in that opening statement that she released she says for example I generally don't talk about my day-to-day activities well that that leaves a lot of wiggle room uh generally means there may be exceptions and day-to-day means well maybe not day to day but maybe uh in other terms these issues may have been discussed so we asked her about that we asked her about these claims of fraud that the Attorney General appointed by Donald Trump rejected as BS that is what has Council rejected that others rejected that U.S attorneys get appointed rejected um and and whether that change changed her view of these claims of Fraud and you know at some point I'm sure either in in our hearing or at a later date when we release our report we'll be able to share uh the answers to those questions but but we did have a thorough interview and she did respond to each of the questions we asked what about a memory was I do not recall a frequent or occasional response uh you know I don't want to characterize you know to what degree she relied on that uh it wasn't it was not one of those interviews where you uh get a total failure of recollection and I've had those interviews before indeed I remember deposing Karl Rove uh over the scandal of the firing of U.S attorneys during the George W Bush Administration and he had a massive failure of recollection so it was not that kind of an interview um and uh you know people will be able to when we release transcripts of these interviews evaluate to the best they can The credibility of the witnesses and I'll leave that to their judgment uh what would you say or can you say anything about your impression of her credibility I you know I really want to refrain from trying to characterize that at this point um and and I would rather have the public uh when they have the opportunity to review the transcript make their own determination there has been uh there is the question of whether some of her testimony might be used in the next Committee hearing uh what is your sense of that at this point you know we just had the interview today we haven't had a chance to discuss whether there are elements of that that we might want to incorporate uh into the next hearing I think it's very possible but uh there there hasn't been any judgment made by the committee how would you describe the importance of her testimony to the investigation well you know I think each of these Witnesses adds value in the sense we get new insights uh or we at least get the the satisfaction of knowing we've run this lead to ground uh and and satisfied ourselves that we've learned as much as we can learn uh from a particular witness uh so uh you know I don't characterize this as you know significant insignificant um you know we thought that she had important information to share she obviously was in communication with Mark Meadows and others uh and as you read in those messages to Mark Meadows she used awfully strong language in support of uh you know this broader effort to to claim that the election was marred by Massive fraud that in reality did not exist let me turn to Russia before you go and uh if Vladimir Putin does hold this annexation ceremony uh tomorrow uh from your position uh on the intelligence committee what do you what effect do you expect that to have on the ongoing war in Ukraine well first of all I think people need to understand that what this is is a press release and basically a press for you know Russian consumption event that he's going to be hosting in Moscow this is not based on anything that actually took place it is a complete sham uh and it's as if you know we decided tomorrow in Washington that we were going to recognize Tuscany as part of the state of California because we like Tuscany it would have as much validity as that but also it is a sign of the desperate weakness of Putin and the Russian war effort that they have to resort to such a palpably false sham uh this this PR exercise because they're losing ground they're losing momentum they're losing public support they have to mobilize now Russians are leaving the country by the hundreds of thousands they don't want to be conscripted into this naked war of aggression they don't want to engage in war crimes they don't want to be around other people engaging in war crimes that's what this is a response to this PR stunt by Putin congressman Adam Schiff thank you very much for starting off our discussions and I really appreciate it thank you it was also

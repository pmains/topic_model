something that they are looking into right now congressman Malcolm okonjo and just on the phone live good morning to you we certainly appreciate you joining us from Washington DC this morning in a case like this the first thing that I heard reported was is that that we didn't have to worry about that but there I there have to still be concerns about that being a possibility right well you can't rule it out completely at this point time that's being handled as a criminal investigation not by the Joint Terrorism Task Force oh that's very instructive in terms of the evidence coming in and how they perceive this case but it's way too early and preliminary in the investigation to to ruled out completely I do think you're dealing with an individual had mental illness issues possibly PTSD which which led to this unfortunate tragic shooting this yeah i got i must say this hits a hard and it hits home for me i went to the ceremony when we have the 13 soldiers killed by major asan and it's so tragic to see for 2 struck down once again and it just demonstrates how soft our military bases still are they are still a target not only of terrace but people with possibly PTSD issues and i think we need to look at how we can harden these military bases where our military our utter lee defenseless to these types of shootings and so okay congress is gonna be taking a look at this in terms of how we can make them safer now congressman your chairman of the Homeland Security Committee so this apparently has to be something that your committee will be looking at and that is the security for military posts and or basis since 2009 have you seen an improvement that could have possibly prevented what happened yesterday no not really i think the Department of Defense came out with a report with recommendations will be examining how many of those recommendations have really been implemented part of my job is prevention to stop things like this from happening particularly on our military bases which we know are still vulnerable but the fact that this guy could could drive on the base with a 45 caliber pistol and wound 14 and kill four others just shows you that it's that we're still not where we need to be and I think that's something that we'll be looking at in terms of our oversight capability in the Congress to to harden these military bases this is just one of many many cases out there both terrorism related but also mental illness cases where we've seen shooters come on two bases and frankly in for debt we were able to stop a terrorist attack where a terrorist was going to blow up a Chinese restaurant and killed the soldiers from Fort Hood at that restaurant we were very lucky in that case unfortunately we were not so lucky you know yesterday oh no it's a tough thing especially with it being in our own backyard I feel that we feel so connected to Fort Hood in the Houston area and at this point we haven't heard a whole lot about the victims have you heard about anything about them perhaps if any of them might have been from the Houston area you know I have not we have not gotten received a list of all the victims and their names obviously the Department of Defense is protective at this point for obvious reasons but you know we know that most of them were or active-duty soldiers so they say soldier on soldier that just means that you have one active duty soldier killing other soldiers like Major Hasan dead and so it's really hard and painful and difficult to accept this kind of tragedy why one soldier active duty we kill other active duty soldiers and for to happen again at Fort Hood I again as I said hits home and hard and very difficult to accept but we need to look at this and that from a lessons learned standpoint how can we change this I think it's unacceptable so long now after what major Assad did for Fort Hood and other military bases to be that vulnerable and that soft of a target when we know the threats to our military bases are real and they've been demonstrated historically so we need to learn how to harden these military bases better than what we're doing right now congressman Michael McCaul chairman of the Homeland Security Committee thank you so very much for joining us this morning and weighing in on another so thanks for havin well we do realize it's a busy time for you and we are very appreciative good to hear from him today well 738 right now

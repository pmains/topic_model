I want to congratulate Joe Sestak on his victory tonight in the Democratic primary he deserves a lot of credit for running a great race you know Joe and I have already debated twice in this campaign long before either of us want our party's nominations we get along well with each other we respect each other I'm very hopeful that we'll give Pennsylvanians the kind of honest substantive campaign that they deserve in the general election but before we get into that campaign I have one suggestion for Joe take a vacation you worked really hard you deserve old four or five months off matter of fact I can have a dozen volunteers come over to your place in the morning to help you pack seriously I look forward to the campaign ahead Joe Sestak and I have major differences on important issues like job creation taxes spending bailouts and health care he and i will give pennsylvanians a good clear choice in November and that's a good thing for our state

thank you madam chair and for all of the americans who are watching this hearing online or on television i want to be clear-eyed about what the biden administration and my democrat friends are doing this week this week democrats are using a budget procedure originally designed to cut spending to pave the way for a massive spending spree that with interest will add over two trillion dollars to the national debt despite the immediate availability of over one trillion dollars in unspent funds from the cares act and a 900 billion dollar relief bill passed less than two months ago that stands repeating over one trillion dollars in unspent funds are immediately available for the american people i would hope that all of us on a bipartisan basis would focus on actually deploying those funds before we rushed to saddle the future generations of americans with an additional 2 trillion dollars in debt but one thing we absolutely must do is do no harm and i want to explore this minimum wage hike that's included in this bill because at a time when so many workers and especially low wage workers minority workers that ms mergia was just talking about are struggling one thing we absolutely should not do is force those workers to lose their only source of income and congress went to great lengths through the ppp to ensure small businesses to keep could keep their employees on the payroll yet this proposal from president biden and congressional democrats to raise the federal minimum wage to 15 dollars per hour without any adjustment based on regional differences in cost of living would compromise those efforts according to the cbo 1.3 million low-income workers will lose their jobs because of this misguided proposal and i have spoken i want my my friends my democrat friends who support this policy who are well intentioned who want to help low-income workers and i share their goal i want them to hear what i was told by my local restaurant tours and they're probably telling you the same thing a sector of the economy that has been devastated by this pandemic and i've talked to big restaurateurs with 1800 employees across all all of their restaurants and then in some cases a small restaurant tour owns two restaurants in a very low wage low cost of living county estill county in my district and they said it would be catastrophic those two restaurants would close as a result of this because of the low cost of living those 40 employees would lose their jobs and the large restaurant tour told me in lexington kentucky he told me that because of this policy his his business would lose 70 percent of their profits and the result would be quote unquote carnage for the for the tipped employees in his business so dr strain what would be the impact on low-income workers especially those in the distressed restaurant sector with this across-the-board height in the federal minimum wage that would destroy jobs thank you congressman uh the your characterization is correct uh i think cbo's estimate of 1.3 million is actually on the low side there are three states where the median wage is below 1650. where half of all workers earn less than 16.50 there are two dozen states where uh half of all workers earn less than 18 or 18.50 an hour uh and in 47 states over one quarter of workers uh uh earn less than 15 an hour so this would be extremely disruptive uh particularly in low-wage states but you know when you think about low wage states think about like half the states well can i just reclaim my time real quickly because i know my democrat colleagues do very much care about just like we do these low-income workers but the reality is in the restaurant sector in in the this past year nearly one in every five restaurants permanently closed their doors and over 30 of the country's largest retail and restaurant companies have filed for bankruptcy is this the time is this really the time to put greater stress on those employers in their ability to retain workers i think this is a devastating policy that will destroy jobs and and kill people's ability to stay employed and with that my time has expired i yield back

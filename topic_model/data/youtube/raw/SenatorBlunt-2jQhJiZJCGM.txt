well leader thanks for mentioning the vaccines i do think that now we're beyond the election that a lot of the skepticism that people have had about the vaccine effort will go away once people look seriously at this i think they're going to see that frankly the administration and the congress congress providing 18 billion dollars to invest in vaccines and therapeutics and about 12 and a half billion of that into vaccines rewrote the chapter of the pandemic book on how you do this we're at least a year ahead of where anybody would have thought we would have been in february or march of this year pfizer was a partner a little different part every one of these partnerships is a little bit different the pfizer deal was we're confident in our vaccine we're sure we're going to get there if you'll guarantee the federal government will distribute and you'll buy two billion dollars worth of it that's that's the deal with us astrazeneca moderna a little bit differently but all of these companies plus about three more are all making vaccines as they get near the end of the trial period so there will be several million copies of any of these vaccines available on day one and once you get that system started it begins to produce vaccines uh pretty quickly i think the the distribution effort has been well thought out the states have all submitted a plan hopefully the states will all respond to the proposal of how the vaccine would be allocated to health care workers and first responders first a people most in danger of having the worst results if they got the the virus nursing homes would be a big group in that in that and then the essential employees of the country the bus the school bus drivers the the teachers the day care center workers the grocery store clerk uh the food processing employee people who are in a lot of contact with other people if they can't get it they can't give it to you so every day as you take these groups off the the danger zone of the vaccine normally they get safer but everybody else gets safer and by the time you get to the end of those groups you've had about 50 percent of the american population would have had the ability to have the vaccine and then we'll see what happens with with everybody else and on those companies that we in that we thought had a better chance of being successful than not and they're not successful the american taxpayers are going to lose a little money on that and in fact if we didn't have a failure here we weren't trying hard enough we weren't pushing the envelope for enough remember all these vaccines will be a little bit different from any of the others and they're all being produced irrespective of what's happening anywhere else so this is really big news i again hope as we now move beyond the election discussion to a real pandemic response discussion that people are going to appreciate what's really happened both what the administration did and i'd suggest most importantly what the congress was willing to appropriate money for

lewis vote for cory bush grace and i'm an organizer with sunrise movement and one of my favorite memories from the campaign was probably our first phone make that we had with sunrisers from across the country we've been having phone banks um here with the local hub for the whole summer and even before then and it was always really great to be on there with everyone we knew but i remember logging in for the first time with with folks from across the country after we had the national sunrise endorsement and just seeing more of those zoom boxes come up and keep coming and keep coming and there were people from all over the country and even from outside the country and it was just so exciting to feel the energy and the excitement and the support that corey had from people everywhere and that they really believed in uh the movement that we're building and that they were able to help um corey across the finish line you've opened yourself up for a very controversial question that might ruin your political career flats or drums sorry but it's flats for me thank you thank you listen but i wasn't i wasn't sure before but now we definitely you know we definitely got you i put your sign on my lawn i'm someone who never thought i would ever run for congress i'm running for this seat because change has to happen i'm running because my son's life matters my daughter her life matters and it's time for saint louis to grow and to prosper and that prosperity has to be felt by all st lewis we will have an amazing st louis you deserve it i'm corey bush and i approve this [Music] be a message if you could what would you give a sermon on right now love people love people because to me that is that should be the basis that should be a primary requirement for holding any elected office any public office because if i love you then i care that you have food and that you eat if i love you i care that you have health care if i love you i care that the police don't murder you and get off with impunity if i care i care that you live in safe housing that you have clean water if i love you i care that you are not separated from your family but on the basis of where you used to live and how you look how you were born if i love you then i care that you get to love who you choose to love if i love you then i care that your body is your own and you get to make your own decisions for what you need if i love you i am so honored that i've been able to be with my sister corey bush from the beginning of this campaign i remember back when we met in 2017 it was such an incredible time period and little do we know what was ahead of for all of us on this journey when i went to her campaign office when it first opened i remember being so excited to see the enthusiasm and just the sheer number of volunteers that were ready to kick this campaign off and as we traveled over the next year and a half together i kept telling her i was like i know i am traveling with a future congresswoman of the united states i probably should have gotten an autograph but seriously though i'm really excited that cory will be in office representing not only st louis but all of us i have seen her sheer determination and true love for people and i can't think of a better example of this than when i was supporting her from afar as she was struggling just to breathe from the effects of covid but didn't give up she continued the fight she knew that people were counting on her to pull through so that she could be in congress and had effect actual change you know um i know without a doubt that corey is going to be a force to be dealt with in the halls of congress and she will be resoundingly fighting for justice on all levels i'm so excited to be able to call corey bush now congresswoman corey bush love you you know i called donald trump the big daddy of bigotry you know the current father of racism do we want to bring more into these uh into elected office that are like him no this is our moment this is our moment black brown white asian indigenous immigrant and descendants of africans who were enslaved in america and first generation refugees this is our moment gay gay straight lesbian bisexual pansexual asexual transit queer this is our moment young and elder religious atheist and spiritual this is our moment the disabled the misgendered the marginalized the counted out and pushed aside this is our moment the unhoused the incarcerated the out on parole working class students the poor and the comfortable this is our moment the undocumented and uncounted unable to vote or unwilling to hope the overlook the exploited the movers the breakers the builders the shakers and the laborers this is our moment teachers nurses farmers veterans store clerks hotel workers firefighters and servicemen members engineers and electricians those unemployed and those retired this is our moment artists activists musicians leaders innovators and organizers cooks janitors servers union workers postal workers and sex workers this is our moment all across this country from coast to coast people are standing up and fighting back not only against trump but for an agenda that works for the working families of this country and that is why today i am proud to endorse my good friend corey bush for congress in missouri's first district cory was on the front lines of the movement in ferguson following the murder of michael brown as a protester clergy member medic and victim of police assault she's living with the burden of student and medical debt and she knows what it's like to live paycheck to paycheck corey is a true progressive we can trust to stand with working people and take on the corporate elite of this country now in this unprecedented moment in american history we cannot slow down our efforts we've got to accelerate the truth is despite the opposition of powerful special interests together we are transforming american politics and if we keep fighting we are going to transform this country in november and in the years to come but first we have got to elect progressives to office and we can start right now by electing corey bush in her primary on august 4th this is an enormously important primary and your support would be much appreciated thank you all very much what's up corey just want to congratulate you on your amazing victory and making history become the first black woman to represent missouri in congress you represent everything this country needs to be your passion your love your dignity your hard work your relentlessness it's everything i want my daughter to be when she grows up so thank you for setting the example thank you for setting the pace i fell in love with you when i met you back in december and uh good to see we're gonna be colleagues in washington together peace and love you stay well we'll talk soon you know and your story is really moving i mean i was reading about the fact that you know at one point you know you had to leave your job you're working in preschool education lived in your truck in your car for a while with your young children you know you've been through those kinds of struggles as you said you're a working class woman do you think that that's what's missing in congress so many of those people are millionaires and multi-millionaires so many of them are not disconnected from the idea that six hundred dollars extra in your unemployment check could make all the difference in the world that's something they can't relate to do you think the fact that you can relate to those kinds of struggles do you think that that will make you a different kind of congresswoman and in what way would you be different yes it will make me a different congress congressperson i think that we need to have different people from different walks of life that represent our country and so this district is you know we have a lot of poverty we have um but we don't just have poverty so we need people who can represent um on different levels in congress uh for me being someone who has lived out of my car you know let me tell you that pain of the struggle that i've been through i can still feel that pain right now so that pain is walking with me into the doors of kong into the doors of congress um and uh and that's what's going to feed me that's what's going to fuel everything that i do that and then what i've seen the rest of the people in our community go through how much we have had to fight and when we're looking at at what's happening in other places it's like why are we fighting so much why do we have to struggle so hard um especially black women in this community you know we're fighting so much you know where is the relief well i'm ready to bring the relief i'm ready to be that champion because i've been fighting this thing unpaid fighting it just because we need a different type of life we need quality to our lives we have to stop surviving st louis and start thriving here our next guest life story is truly remarkable corey bush on your huge victory with all the adversity we just kept going it's like oh you're the underdog you don't have any money you don't have any names your last name is bush oh you're a black woman oh you're dark skinned oh you have braids it's like all of these things but you know we kept going when we made it back to the office dj like playing music and so i'm like okay well let's dance and then all of a sudden my team is like like come here and i'm like what they ushered me into my office and they're like so they've caught the race and i'm like it's been one it's one percent reporting like i was crushed i said okay i'm not going to look at my phone trying to watch a movie and all of a sudden there's this notification that i was in the league and it was like okay wait wait wait wait wait wait wait everything okay everybody stop and then i picked up again all i saw was corey defeats i jumped up i'm like somebody look like verify this okay it's verified and i'm like okay i gotta pee there are some very amazing people in your community doing great work but didn't feel like they had the backing to be able to run and that could be the person making a difference in your community they just need your support and they need to know that they can run because you will support them how do i know because i am her that's how i know i am her i only won this seat because people believed in me and because people you know because people decided we're not going to just go with a name or what we know we're going to go with what we need we fought for the right to vote but still we haven't won then remember we're the ones that went from being pepper sprayed and tick ass to being sworn in we could remember needing capital for office now our office is in the capital the best thing about how we did it was all natural i cannot express how proud i am of you today miss corey bush um the first nothing else even needs to follow after that you've been amazing since day one you've been a fighter since the first day i met you and before that of course but i remember back in 2014 when we met we met in the trenches and asked where we continue to be um the moment we decided to run for office we knew exactly who we were going to be as elected officials we knew who we were going to be while we were campaigning and we knew for a fact that when when it popped off we were still going to be in the streets and that's where you could find us and to this day there's nobody that can say anything different there's nobody that can can go back and be like no all day in the streets exactly where you were supposed to be and you show what what politics can look like what politics is supposed to look like where are we going where the trajectory of politics is going politics is rappers right our next our next elected officials are rappers they are entertainers they are they are nurses they are single mothers they are the folks in our communities that are seeing every single challenge in barrie and can speak to um being evicted who can speak to not knowing if he was going to pay this or pay that who can speak to um having to wonder where you're going to sleep at or have no wonder where your next meal going to come from or have to have to sacrifice your food for for your kids to make sure they doubt that's what our next elected officials look like and you are the epitome of all of that when we look at you we see strength we see courage we see the fight we see amazingness we see a black woman we see strong we see all of these qualities that encompass um you you are amazing you are a superhero and this means so much to not just st louis not just missouri but to the entire world because you showed the entire world what was possible thank you so much for being persistent thank you so much for standing in your truth thank you so much for speaking truth to power thank you so much for being cory bush if we allow november 3rd to come and we wake up on november 4th and we don't like the answer we don't like what we see will we say i should have done a little bit more this is our opportunity to course correct wherever we can and each and every one of us can course correct somewhere you're here for a reason we're all here for a reason and i'm asking you to think outside of the box get outside of the machine this is how we do it this is how it's been done this is what's effective bump that this is a new day do something different because we're trying to reach people that haven't been reached before or we're trying to reach people that have been reached that decided i don't want to be a part of this anymore right so how do we reach them but i care about who our president is i care about who the governor is the lieutenant governor i care about all of those seats and around the state so we have to we have to move outside of our little box me and my three so what are you bringing what are you bringing so bring something new add to it you are powerful you are worthy you are more than enough you have what it takes so let's put that thing together and let's make sure we bring it home thank you hi in may of 2019 corey bush took a pickaxe to 40 years of cynicism and inaction and political discouragement and woke me up to possibilities that i hadn't even considered since i was a lot younger i had the total pleasure of working with dozens of other young people who just took me on and took me for what i you know who who um worked with me in a way that you know where we were we were colleagues and conference and equals and it was so stimulating to be around young people who were that committed and that bright and that kind and um that stew of people was created by corey by corey's energy and corey's commitment and corey's passion and um i just i just am so grateful for that day in may and every day since where i've been involved in this campaign and corey now that you're our representative um i guess you get to be a national treasure so you're not my treasure anymore here you get to be everyone's treasure so i love you and godspeed hi cory i'm so excited to be sending you to dc um there's no one who could better represent missouri's first district i know how much this district and the people here mean to you and i know that you're going to fight for us every day that you're in d.c and i'm so thankful that you got back up and you ran again because now we've unseated a political dynasty and missouri's first district has a real champion in congress and i know i've told you this before but you're a huge part of the reason i work in politics when i think about all of the moments that inspired me to get involved in politics and campaigns they're all moments or experiences i had with you or things that you inspired me to do you were one of the first people who not only told me but showed me that we have to do more than just be in the streets we have to also be working within the political system as well and the only way we bring about real change is by doing both um and so thank you for always believing in me and for always uplifting me and for always giving me a shout and if you could i love you so much i'm so proud of you and i know you're going to do great work in dc there is this thing about being an activist and it's become like this badge of honor but just a few years ago back in 2014 it wasn't a badge of honor we just stood up because we knew it was right because somebody died like an 18 year old baby was murdered somebody took his life unjustly brianna taylor was murdered all right she was murdered i don't care about seeing my name in lights or my name in an article or being on anybody's television i don't care that people know my name you shouldn't care that people know yours our work is in saving lives so i just want to remind you as we move into this next phase remember we're in the movement black power movement civil rights movement was 10 years strong we've been fighting since 2014 so we're only six years in this thing has to morph and move again and again so are you ready for this next phase we don't have time to waste it's no more time it's no more playing y'all it's no more time don't play activists because people's lives are on the line don't play with this thing somebody could be missing tomorrow can you say that you did everything you could do to save black lives so today is your day today is the day and so i mean this movement from today until we win until we win i believe i believe that we will win let me hear you say i i know i know that we will win all right we win with you have a great one you all thank you so much corey for representing us and standing up for us and standing in the trenches throughout all of the adversities that you may have faced you have prevailed and as a representative of afge we thank you for representing us and

we actually have somebody who's gonna be in a seat that's gonna fight for us when i say us i mean all of us not just a select few not just people that have money not just people that have influence but you're gonna fight just as hard for the underserved communities the ones that feel like they don't even have a voice and gave up on the process and i know this because i've been able to see this in you over the last couple years if it's been in ferguson when we're getting tear gas together getting arrested out there protesting for change and justice in the death of mike brown or if it's been you running for office in 2016 with myself and bruce moving from protest to politics as we understood how important it was to be at a table even when they didn't invite us to the table you know me you and bruce would bring our own table thing let us in but it was so important for us to be at the table and making sure that we moved in these positions from protest to politics i'm excited to see what you're going to do as you move from politics to policy because our city needs it our country needs it our state needs it there's no other better fighter that could be in that position right now than you like all the stars have came together and aligned at the perfect moment so much at stake in our communities is so much at stake in our state so much at stake at our country there's no other better person to be able to advocate be able to fight they could be able to be unapologetic and talk about the issues that our district need like you i am so glad that you're gonna be our next congresswoman you know i got your back 110 whatever you need i'm always here what what you about to embark on in this next journey isn't something you're going to be doing by yourself i want you to know you got a whole army full of people that got your back they gonna criticize you talk bad say all things about you but at the end of the day the people that elected you know that you have the power that you have the will you have the resistance to fight through all that and make the change needing our community i am ecstatic for this you know it is so great that what's about to happen with that i also want to provide you with a gift i want to provide you something that i hopefully will see in your office when i come up to dc i want to give you the missouri house of representative resolution resolution from my office that i want to provide to you and i just want to read a little bit it says whereas the members of the missouri house of representatives welcome with pleasure the opportunity to recognize a remarkable missouri citizen whose efforts and accomplishments have made her a source of inspiration to all those around her and whereas cory bush a lifelong resident of st louis missouri is to be commended for her services as a politician a nurse a single mother a pastor and an activist who is missouri's first black woman elected to run for the shelby state's first congressional district and

politician nurse single mother pastor activist and and further wishing her continued success for future endeavors corey this is from you from everybody in the state of missouri from the 78th district

Carlos thank you very much mr. chairman I too want to echo the praise of you and our ranking member and putting together a thoughtful responsible bill during a time of tough budget constraints and I want to salute you mr chairman for your leadership over the years as our chairwoman of the folk committee has done you have done an extraordinary job you've always been very fair and bipartisan and I appreciate that I do want to draw my colleagues attention to one very important provision in this bill we're all aware of the current problems at the VA where access has not been granted as quickly as possible and so I was especially pleased to note the inclusion of funding to continue what's known as the arch program or the access received close to home program this helps to ensure that rural veterans who have a difficult time accessing the regular VA health care system can have their care closer to home and I want to give you a real life example of this last winter a veteran in northern Maine shattered his hip instead of having to endure what would be a bumpy dangerous 250 mile trip in an ambulance over hazardous winter roads to get to the one VA hospital that we have in Maine the togas hospital in Augusta under the arch program he was able to see be seen by a local doctor almost immediately there have been many other cases some of which have shown that this programs actually saved lives and I'm very happy that this pilot program which has been so successful in my state and elsewhere is going to be extended so I thank you very much for that I think it's consistent with our desire to make sure that our veterans get the health care that they need when they need it Thank You mr. chairman hey Co said

hi everyone I'm congresswoman Katie Porter and I have some exciting news I've been appointed to the Joint economic committee or jec this is a group of Representatives and Senators meaning it's bicameral who work closely together to monitor our economy and make recommendations to strengthen it the jec isn't like most other committees instead of writing legislation or conducting oversight on isolated issues my colleagues and I will be responsible for studying the entire economy from top to bottom and bottom to top we'll look at inflation and how big corporations drive up prices to pad their executor's pockets we'll look at the labor force and how we can get Workers the help and wages they need and we'll look at how inequality hurts communities of color and allows the ultra Rich to get even richer at our expense my goal will be to keep you updated along the way I'll take the data see and break it down into simple terms cutting through the noise to let you know what's really going on the work we do on the joint economic committee is so important to me because it's about your livelihood it's about reversing the imbalances in our economy it's about having a strong stable globally competitive economy that helps strengthen our country as a single mom of three school-aged kids I know how tough it can be to food on the table stay on top of bills and save for the future especially when the scales of our economy are tipped in favor of Executives not families in favor of huge corporations not communities Congress should be standing up for consumers and fighting for workers too often this body falls short I help my work on the joint economic committee helps change that and I'm so excited to hit the ground running stay tuned for updates in our fight for a stronger and healthier economy thank you

thank you chair and thank you thank you member for holding such a really important hearing one of the things i as i've watched this hearing all all morning frankly i keep hearing is who should be to blame for what didn't happen and the one thing i think americans are really not very interested in is to watch each side point fingers at the other side some say it's a private sector some say it's government the fact of the matter is that the average person in this country is not as interested as we are is figuring out how to make a republican responsible for what happened or the democrat to be responsible for what happens or the private sector to be responsible for happens this frankly seems to be all hands on debt kind of problem everybody did something that they ought not have been doing or didn't do enough of what they should have been doing so from my perspective i'm not sure your opinion on that but the truth of matters it's pretty frustrating for the average person in our country who's sitting at home watching a crime wave that they haven't seen in decades looking at the price of gas at the pump and they're scratching their heads and they're digging into their pockets and they're coming up a little too short a little too often month in and month out and then they see the absolute crisis of inflation that is weighing on their shoulders and their inability to meet the needs that they were able to meet just 18 months ago and then finally from others fathers new kids they see this shortage of formula that seems to exasperate their situation in such a way that they simply can't imagine it happening here at home in america and dr calif i hope that we spend less time pointing fingers at who's to blame and take responsibility for where we can make things better you're a south carolinian born in anderson south carolina and as senator lujan was talking about the rural aspects of his state i will speak to the rural aspects of our state you went to ac flora high school i went to stahl high school and the fact of the matter is we played ball against each other different decades but same schools the truth is that too many americans in too many places and specifically at home are looking at the crisis that befall them and they want solutions not really the blame game so i hope that we spend a few minutes on how do we make sure this doesn't happen again but before we get there i just want to highlight the fact that in your home state as i just suggested in my hometown of charleston south carolina we have four babies in hospitals due to the shortage because they've had an allergic reaction to the generic forms of the native specialized formula what can we do to accelerate the path to those families having what they need and how can we ensure that this doesn't happen again well to your first question what can we do [Music] for the specialty formulas as i've reported we have groups of uh fda people pediatricians specialists in critical care who meet every day and talk about each case and try to get the right formula to the baby in the case of abbot which was the major manufacturer of these for the hyper-specialized formulas that had no substitutes we actually have allowed on a case-by-case basis the formula to be sent out after careful weighing of the risk and benefit since they were made in an unsanitary plant for the next tranche that you're describing it's right to try a different brand which is considered to be interchangeable but we all know that when it comes to particular drugs for example sometimes what looks like the same thing doesn't sit well and then what has to happen is trial and error but there are specialists involved every day in helping to navigate these you have great ones at mus so yeah i know yes the institution well and you know i'm sorry that people uh infants have to be in the hospital but for that kind of critically um dependent infant it's probably the best place for them to be until we get everything back and running and transitioning to the the the latter question as it relates to how do we ensure that this doesn't happen again the safeguards the whistles the bells that should be going off when we are 11 shortage 20 shortage 30 shortage 40 shorter how do we look back and learn lessons that we use for the future well you know there's an old statement there lies to analyze in statistics so senator cassidy and i have very different data he showed the most extreme estimate our estimates are nowhere near what he showed but having said that we have a very specific list some of which are in consideration in upcoming legislation that we're glad to share with you the big question that i think is going to have to be addressed is do we create a stockpile as a backup in case uh something doesn't work in the future i i do worry what happens is that we're getting the advent plan back up there are positive cultures would be one example i think we're going to have to have a surplus we're certainly planning on a surplus within a couple of months as i've already told you question is should we maintain that surplus as a government activity [Music] for the foreseeable future and that's a question we're all going to have to discuss together and make a decision about

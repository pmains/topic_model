organizes gentleman from California mr. Sherman mr. Chairman I feel like I'm at a ballroom dance on the deck of the Titanic the faith of the American people in our government and institutions is at an all-time low I've been sitting in this room for 20 years and the room has the feel that it had 20 years ago except we don't have Alan Greenspan in front of US government institutions work better if they listen to the American people first because the American people will then accept the decisions and second because we get better decisions yesterday in a small state that is doing better than most of the country two-thirds of the people went out in the at a very I think a record-setting turn out with inclement weather to say that they're mad as hell particularly at the financial institutions that this committee deals with and two-thirds of them voted for the most angry candidate they could find too big to fail should be too big to exist uh madam chairman in response the lady from Wisconsin you said it was basically the Department of Justice's failure to have a single criminal prosecution of those who had robbed the banks and more importantly robbed the American people feet of the Department of Justice because we've learned institutions can get so big that they are too big to fail your predecessor was in this room demanding that we bailed them out and God forbid you will be again if you allow these too big to fail institutions to continue to exist and as they're too big to jail and as you point out you may borrow somebody from the banking world gee whiz in a country with more people incarcerated than any other country in the world is it really adequate to those who steal hundreds of millions and billions to say well you can't go back into the banking world so I'll ask you as a member of F sock we need moral hazard to make sure that major economic decisions made by the giant banks are made correctly they don't have a moral hazard in the sense of not being able to get capital people are flooding them with capital at rates that are said to be up to 80 basis points less than they would pay if there wasn't a belief that we would bail them out so they're the too-big-to-fail won't be allowed to fail as you point out the oj won't put anybody in jail the solution is use your power under F sock to break them up are you going to break up the too-big-to-fail institutions I've asked you that before I'll ask you it again I think I know the answer well the answer I'll give you is that we are using our powers to make sure that a systemically important institution could fail and it would not be have systemic consequences for the country we're doing that in a whole variety of ways first of all we've done many things to diminish the odds that they would fail we're trying to make them and I think I can enumerate all that are you willing on all the Attorney General and say we've got this thing handled so well that you can start criminal prosecutions because they're not too big to jail anymore so I I said that I am in favor of going after individuals who are guilty of wrongdoing with such penalties as barring them from the banking I dunno I I want to move on also the sanctions that the Federal Reserve can I need to move on to another question your governmental entity but it's what in some parts of the entity it's one bank one vote it's a nun it's the only part of our constitutional system that puts governmental power in the hands a 1 bank one vote um would are you going to use your considerable power to oppose legislative efforts to try to make the regional bank governors appointed exclusively by the President and to try to make the regional banks subject to the Freedom of Information Act garnishment I think its current structure of the Fed is something that Congress decided after a long debate and weighing of a whole variety of considerations i would say i think it's worked pretty well but it certainly excuse me i'm sure are you saying that are that the fed in the having just lived through 2008 with people not getting raises that this whole system has worked well i'm sure i thought you were asking a better governance our governance has led to the decisions that have nearly brought this country to its knees that you've been timing a gentleman has expired the chair now recognizes gentleman from Missouri mr.

this is a very important moment for us to remember to celebrate and to understand how much more needs to be done but it's not so much a cause for celebration as it is a call to action and we want to make sure that people understand that 50 years is too long to wait and women are tired of waiting for women means less pay for the entire family i think girls should get the same amount of money as boys and if i get 20 cents and tim gets one dollar it wouldn't be fair to me because there is a toy that cost one dollar and i couldn't buy it the paycheck fairness and equal pay are issues that affect not only women but families i know that firsthand because when i was eight years old my parents split up and i lived in a household with two strong women my grandmother victoria and my mom rosie i'm particularly happy to have field with all of you because i'm probably the only one in the room maybe a couple others i won't identify them who were alive when president kennedy signed the equal pay act he took what he called presciently a first step he knew it was a first i want to make sure all my both my children are treated equally in the workplace in every aspect of their life so that's why i'm here today and my grandmother had never made it past the fourth grade she worked her whole life as a maid a babysitter in a cook to get by for herself but to also give my mom her only child and her two grandkids a better chance in life than she had and my mom made good on that promise but it was never easy for her this issue is so fundamental and it affects all of us whatever our politics whatever opposition the excitement at the time when he signed the bill was so thrilling but never could we suspect at that time that it would take so 50 years later we would still be fighting the fight it is still a matter of simple justice today women are still making only 77 cents on the dollar as compared to men for the same work at the rate we're going my daughter will be 49 before we've closed it and that's too long for us to wait women cannot afford literally cannot afford to wait another 40 years for the disparity to be eliminated with both a daughter and a son i don't want my daughter to spend the majority of her working life getting paid less than her male colleagues women and families cannot afford to lose almost a quarter out of every dollar earned it is time for us to pass paycheck fairness women have fought in the courts in public opinion forms and on the floor of the u.s congress to receive equal pay for equal work 21st century and we really should be a model for other like developing countries so that's why i think we should pass this act representative rosa dolores paycheck fairness bill is essential to allow women to earn equal pay for equal work and we just can't wait uh with most women making the 77 cents on the dollar we just can't wait for equal pay we're going to do it we are going to do this i promise you here you

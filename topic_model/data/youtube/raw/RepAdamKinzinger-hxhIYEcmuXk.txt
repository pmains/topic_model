congressman thanks for taking the time this morning yeah you bet thanks for having me so you have been forward leaning on the support that the us and nato have to offer including keeping up with the possibility of a no-fly zone they have now are and have sent in a host of air defense systems including the s 300 which is high altitude i spoke with your colleague mike mccall yesterday who said that that combination of things could allow ukraine to in effect establish something close to its own no-fly zone and i wonder if you agree with that yeah i do i mean look i i think the you know there we can always find things and i do that i disagree with the administration on in areas where i think they should do something different or speak differently about it but um there is no doubt this is very forward-leaning and you know short of a no-fly zone giving ukraine all the tools they can to defend i think the key is to remember this a lot of the times people think about like the airspace in ukraine contested as a given thing russia has no right to close ukraine's airspace ukraine has every right to defend their airspace even to invite an allies which is why i'm supportive of a no-fly zone but that said i think we're doing the next best thing you know i think the idea to being able to fly in humanitarian aid and it's not going to war with the russians it's simply saying ukraine has a right as the owner of this airspace to receive aid so look i i there's more of course i think we should do but yesterday's aid package was a significant step i think you raised a subtle point there about the difference between a humanitarian no-fly zone where in effect the u.s nato would put the onus on russia attacking right fly the aid in say this is ukrainian air space as opposed to in effect pick a fl fight as it were between nato and russian jets in the air and say we're going to shoot you down if you're in the air that's a difference and i and i wonder if you think that is a risk worth taking and and the us nato can take in effect call russia's bluff so look i'm a believer that russia will continue to advance until we present a brick wall you know one of my criticisms of the divided administration has been repeatedly saying what we're unwilling to do and you know as you know very well jim how how foreign policy works to be able to use diplomacy against an adversary in many cases that takes a military backstop and so i think if you said look ukraine has a right to its airspace we're going to deliver not even just humanitarian supplies even if we were going to deliver military supplies the point is they have every right to protect the skies and we could say simply here's the path we're flying and it's on russia if they challenge us and i'm just a believer that russia is going to escalate whether it's chemical weapons god forbid tactical nukes which is not strategic nukes they're going to escalate anyway if ukraine beats them uh versus you know somehow there's only only they'll fight nato i guess if by the way we should note that some of the weapons they're already using can kill arguably just as many people as say a chemical weapons attack and that they're using them deliberately on civilian targets but do you believe if russia were to take that qualitative step of say using phosphorus uh bombs as they've used in syria before that the the the us and nato should directly under those circumstances engage moscow 100 it's the only way to stop it from happening i mean look if vladimir putin is failing at his objective in ukraine his backup goal is to destroy and kill everybody basically clear out the country which is what you're seeing his army is still but they have plenty of shells to use to destroy and kill humans including children including in the theater including who are buried today by the way um so if we don't put a red line down that says look it's sad that we say you know okay we're gonna tolerate you know shelling but not but you have to pick somewhere if we put a red line down and say the use of anything like white phosphorus or chemical weapons or of course a tactical nuclear weapon that is a red line and we will have to engage it directly that makes them using that stuff far far less likely right now i fear the only people we're deterring is ourselves let me ask you this as you have heard publicly the former president as well as his allies say that somehow had he still been president putin would not have dared to attack this despite the fact that as you well know and by the way you said you regret your vote now against impeaching trump for withholding military aid from ukraine in 2019. what's your reaction to that argument look he he was an awful president and he was awful on this issue i mean yeah there is something to the fact that you know nobody knew what donald trump was going to do but that was just because he didn't know what he was going to do but that was not a deterrent to putin you know vladimir putin kim jong-un she and china were getting everything they wanted with donald trump and i think as john bolton has said vladimir putin was waiting until donald trump was re-elected and then pulled us out of nato for this attack and of course with joe biden he didn't have that opportunity look if anybody tries to look back and say that somehow donald trump would have been better at this it is just utter garbage and i think anybody in their right mind can't truly believe that and i think it's time to start telling people the truth you know you can be a republican you can dislike joe biden but don't pretend like donald trump was any good final question if i can you are among the names mentioned who might challenge him for the nomination in 2024 should he decide to run and looks more and more like he will along with liz cheney perhaps mike pence do you believe there will be a competitive gop primary perry that you will get the opportunity to do so we saw steps in 2020 where the gop closed the path to challenges do you believe that'll happen again or will you get a shot well i don't know if i'm interested in it um it's not something i'm pursuing i just i want our party to be better i want this country to be better um in terms of yeah i think somebody will carry the torch of of what i call actually pro-american republicanism uh i don't know who that necessarily will be i'm focusing on the country first stuff there's a lot of desire out there for something different but look if donald trump gets the republican nomination there are many of us that will move heaven and earth to ensure he doesn't win i think that's the most important thing he cannot be president again congressman adam kinzinger thanks for joining us this morning event see ya

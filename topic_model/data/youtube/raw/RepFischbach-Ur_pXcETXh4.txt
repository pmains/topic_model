uh thank you mr chair i appreciate the opportunity and i thank all of the testifiers uh for being here today it's been a very very interesting and i just have to have a couple of questions for uh the secretary um you know just uh i i've heard a couple of the testifiers mention you know passing on the farm and several generations worth of farming and mr secretary the uh the biden administration um has been talking about potentially making some changes to the calculation of the stepped-up basis and i'm wondering if you could maybe comment on that on how that might affect some of these folks that are trying to pass on farms particularly in the socially disadvantaged communities congresswoman i have not had an opportunity to visit with anyone in the byte administration on the issue of stepped-up basis i do know that it is an important aspect of the countryside where people who pass away the appreciation of their farmland uh is essentially not taxed not subject to income tax and it opportunity it provides an opportunity for transfer uh to the next generation um i'm happy to look into that issue and find out more about it but i i'm sorry to say i'm not prepared to respond to that question today i didn't anticipate that one well and mr secretary i appreciate that um it's just as like i said as we were talking as some of the testifiers were talking a little bit about those generational farms and so i just thought that that might be something that would be of concern but mr secretary just one other thing congressman bishop was talking a little bit about some of the outreach and i was just kind of wondering if maybe you could expand a little bit on some of that and what kind of outreach is being done on some of the existing programs to make sure in particular are those that younger generation of farmers but you know it was an emphasis on the on these uh on those groups in the socially disadvantaged communities well obviously covet has made somewhat of a somewhat of a different uh situation over the last year uh but but uh historically uh the you know i think that these folks the panelists have basically put their finger on the real problem here which is that it's very very hard for farmers to initiate the conversation that leads to providing the technical assistance and outreach if you don't trust the people that you are asking for help and that is the fundamental issue here one of the fundamental issues we have got to restore trust out the countryside and frankly we can't do that in my estimation we can't do that by walking in to or walking on the farm and saying as we say hi i'm here from the government i'm here to help you we have got to walk on the farm with someone who they trust a community building organization uh a land-grant university extension whatever it might be and basically say we are here to listen we're here to learn how we can help you and then there has to be a commitment to make it a successful relationship and transaction uh it can't be just we listen and then we give you 15 reasons why it won't happen we've got to figure out ways in which we take care of each one of those reasons and ultimately get to success so that people actually recognize that there is a reason for the federal government there is a reason for the department of agriculture that we are there to help and it creates the relationship that ultimately leads to to further opportunities so i think it starts fundamentally with building trust and i think that starts with making sure that we're not alone when we go uh providing assistance and help and that we listen that we respect the folks we respect and acknowledge the reason why they are distrustful uh it's absolutely rational uh what we're dealing with here and mr secretary i appreciate that and i just because we have existing programs we just have to make sure that that you know there are there are programs within the usda and that just want to make sure that we're we're making sure that people um are aware of those and i appreciate the issue of the trust and that you will be reaching out in that way with a trusted individual with you or however you determine that's going to be working but i thank you very much mr chairman i appreciate the opportunity and i yield back my whole 45 seconds wonderful thank you

member of the house foreign affairs committee and the house infrastructure and transportation committee congresswoman thank you for joining us first off how serious is putin's threat is he bluffing well it's hard to say i mean the cia director says that they have not seen any concrete evidence that this is a imminent threat but certainly as putin becomes more desperate and he realizes that he is not going to easily take over ukraine i think unfortunately uh this may be one of his alternatives i think right now he's trying to push the western world back trying to warn nato to push to push back and stop giving weapons because he is in a situation where they've lost roughly 20 000 soldiers already they've lost multiple generals russia has also lost two warships and you're seeing them having to retreat from kiev and so things are not going well for them initially many military experts said that it would be about seven days we're into now wrapping up two months and so i think we're doing what we can do to support ukraine we need to continue doing that because certainly he's being weakened and what can you tell us to your point that he's being weakened so he's kind of like that you know cat against the wall with the back against the wall what can you tell us about the extent and magnitude of these nuclear weapons i mean where is the intended target oh we don't have that information um certainly uh look if he i think right now he is trying to again warn the united states warn nato obviously this is all classified information that our military and security experts are monitoring but what i will say is it is time for the president of the united states to draw some red lines here we've been saying this for weeks now that we have to say that he cannot move forward with any type of nuclear weapon or chemical weapons or else there will be red lines in place that nato and the us will need to respond to i think even if you know nobody wants to enter world war three and certainly nobody wants the united states in direct conflict but we need to at least make him concerned and worried that there will be a response should he proceed with nuclear type weapons and so i think that is something that many members of congress have been asking the president to do for quite some time to deter putin because he needs to be stopped here in ukraine and he needs to be stopped now he poses a great threat to the western world if we allow him to continue this offense meanwhile ukrainian president zielinski was on with jake tapper on cnn warning that the world should be prepared for putin to use nukes let's listen when they begin to speak about one or another battles or involves enemies or nuclear weapons or chemicals some chemical you know issues chemical weapons they should do they could do it we should think not not not be afraid i mean that don't be afraid be ready not be afraid be ready i mean putin's threat to use nukes isn't this why he's being treated with kid gloves on a level it's time to stop to your point you're saying and that president biden needs to to stand up more forcefully and and draw the red line and mean it um and i'm not sure or do you think that's going to happen sometime too soon what would that look like or sound like well you know i i think unfortunately everything that members of congress had urged the president to do he eventually does it it's just that he has dragged his feet and as you played a clip earlier from leader mccarthy yes had weapons been given prior to ukraine had sanctions put in place when we first called for them which was a month you know two months before the invasion uh perhaps it would have deterred uh putin from this invasion and perhaps the situation would be much better than zielinski has said that american officials have said that uh so we just continue to urge the president to show strength and be decisive we cannot show that we are fearful of putin but instead we must work with nato to show the true strength of our nations and that we're not going to tolerate these threats to the western world so i think we just continue to provide zielinski with what he needs going forward of course excuse me and president biden has gotten uh you know applause if you will for working with nato and strengthening nato uh in that uh in that vein let me ask you this it appears imminent that finland and sweden will formally apply for nato membership in may and june do you expect consensus from a 30 nato members and to accept finland and sweden um i do but this is the other reason why putin continues to make these threats in fact i think he's made these threats of chemical and nuclear weapons in response to this request from finland and sweden and we think the invasion was began because of ukraine's desire to be a part of nato he certainly sees nato as a threat which is why nato has to continue to show strength here but uh finland and sweden um obviously they are concerned as nations that are not part of nato that they could perhaps be invaded next if there's some success here by putin in ukraine um and certainly we want to make sure we protect all our allies and we work together to stop this threat at this time and that is why we continue to urge for innate for for europe the eu to continue to we want them to ban uh oil and gas importations we have to help them provide alternatives for their energy needs as well which is why we ask the president to ramp up domestic production for our own national security and for the security of our allies so they can then move forward with stopping these importations of oil that continue to fund the russian military and economy these are the steps that we need to continue to take now not tomorrow not next month not next year we should be have been doing this already from the very beginning what about saudi arabia should the u.s should president biden put pressure on them persuade them however forcefully or not however is necessary to get them to release more oil into the system well that's certainly an alternative but i think the the true alternative here is to ramp up united states domestic production you know the president put in place uh anti-energy policies on day one he stopped the production of the keystone pipeline which could bring uh oil and gas from our neighbor canada our biggest trade trading partner why or why is he continuing to look for individuals around the world including adversaries like venezuela like iran even when we can produce our own domestic energy production right here in the united states excellent point and what do you think about you know local oil producers are they on board to to help again add more oil into the system well what we do know are there are thousands of applications that are sitting on the president's desk he has stopped these new lease put a ban on new leases uh for oil production here in the united states and i think that that's where this discussion should be with our own domestic producers to see what they need how we can work together how we can ramp up domestic production the reality is is these companies are not going to invest in production and expansion if they're seeing anti-energy policies coming from this administration that is the reality and he needs to stop and retract some of these executive orders that he put in place that have that have hurt energy production in this country and dissuaded it we will leave it there congresswoman nicole malia takas thank you very much for joining us take care thank you we'll have more on the war in ukraine

the votes are not in but the congratulations was sincere and I'm going to tell you that I am extremely proud that it looks like Dan Crenshaw is going to win this primary but I must follow that up by saying that I'm even more proud of how Lieutenant Commander Crenshaw ran this game we had some conversations where I made the wrong use of the term I said Dan we're getting some incoming fire and we got to decide if we're gonna fire back and he was like no I've had incoming fire these are just people say it nasty I am a resident of the second congressional district so I talked I talked about campaigns across this country but it's not every day I get to vote for the next Congress most of the district that's going to represent me and my children in this great behavior I know Dan's gonna say this but I'm gonna say this having watched it I want to thank each and every one of you whether you're here or you're watching at home I want to thank each and every one of you because the shoe leather that's been burned the block walking the phone calling the social media posts you put your trust behind Dan Crenshaw and I'm here to tell you I've looked inside that man's soul it is not misplaced we are going to be proud to send him to Washington DC I think he is curling up literally as we speak I want to say it has been exciting over all these years to support our veterans but it's been really exciting to get to vote for a veteran so with that in mind raise your hand veterans where are you here [Applause] 36 the hand of a better raise your hand [Applause] thank you guys you know it is a selfless sacrifice to have your head shaved stripped of everything you have and be sent off to serve this country in the Bible he says here am i send me that level of service is what we need more of in our communities it's what we need more of in the United States Congress is what we need more of in every aspect of this great country and we're taking a big step today with Dan Crenshaw George Orwell said that we sleep soundly in our beds because rough men stand ready to do violence on our behalf I'm gonna tell you Ben Crenshaw bears the marks of a rough man ready to do violence on our behalf and he had to do that and he had violence done to him and he returned to this country with the same sense of fight

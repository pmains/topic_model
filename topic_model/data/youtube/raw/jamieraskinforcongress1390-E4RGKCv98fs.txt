my senator excuse me and i'm so delighted to be here just for your information many of you know i served in the house of delegates for 13 years and this is my first year in the senate so i am so so glad to see you all here today uh let me tell you this once my heart on the sunday that you're up here today to support senator jamie discounting james knowledge and love by the constitution i am sure that you are all aware of his accomplishments and reputation in annapolis last year i had the honor of getting elected as student council rep for myself my slogan was if you're asking for action you're asking for asking i realize the importance of listening leading and taking action this is exactly what my uncle is doing and will continue to do in congress i appreciate your support for his campaign and let everybody know when you're asking for action you're asking for asking i still thought to myself if i ever ever meet this guy i really might marry him the rest is history i guess um we've had a wonderful time together in the last 25 years it's been exciting living with jamie you know he doesn't sleep very much and loves loves loves people so you never know who he's going to bring home or what last minute plans he's going to be and he gives all his constituents his phone numbers so well let's just say we're different in summer so he decided you know what we should do we should get out of the high school to teach the kids their rights and teach them about the constitution and teach them about the first amendment these kids don't always know their rights and so we started a program with marshall and with mary brennan called the marshall granite program yeah so in these two experiences as a marshall britain fellow and as his dance fella i really was able to witness his sincerity in everything he does not only is he supportive of students but he really is committed to helping those who have less those who are marginalized those who are assigned voices in our society and he fights hard and we all know he's like literally always the smartest person in the room young people and loves to help them as a mentor and teacher he makes learning fun jamie is incredibly busy but took the time to speak to my girl scout troop about democracy and his role as our state senator he even took the time to help use the paper on destroying voting rights to ex-silence jamie is very supportive of our schools he speaks to the top program at blair high school every year and works with the young democrats club he's been incredibly supportive of the student-run newspaper silver chips and you just heard how he represented students and teachers in 1996 when their televised debate on same-sex marriage got sensitive they won he challenges injustice but he does it in a way that does not tear people down he tries to lift everyone up always the optimist always the glass is half full because jamie threw his firm and through his life he not only have has helped young people stand up for their rights and stand up for their voice but he's helped all of us he's helped me he's changed not only youth but he's changed my life as well so thank you as you well know is extremely bright sensitive compassionate brilliant really knows all the in the the issues inside and out substantively policy wise but he's also got the passion and i have to tell you during that period of time it was his response and his reaction that motivated me to run for the general assembly i said i want to do that i want to be like that and someone just said characteristic of a great leader they inspire others to act and i thank you for that because i love where i am today jamie has the uncanny ability to to capture the essence of what's important and when jamie testified on behalf of marriage equality in the maryland assembly he was challenged by the republicans uh you know what about the bible and jamie said and i i'm probably paraphrasing but pretty much something in the effect of when i uh i did not swear on the constitution to protect the bible i swore on the bible to protect the constitution all we need jamie in congress because he is a candidate who will make sure that when on capitol hill they talk about equal pay they talk about paid sick leaves or minimum wage that they also include a conversation about abortion and birth control and that those issues our reproductive health issues are not left out for political expediency jamie and i have been a team um it's sort of beyond the team it's a friendship family and uh we depend on each other and the nicest thing i've had since i've been in politics is to be able to be with an elected official that we don't if we look at each other he's saying you'll do it and i'll say yes and they'd say what was what did he mean i said i know i'm here to speak um as a business woman and a great supporter a friend and a neighbor of jamie raskin and i do support him all the way and he's just an amazing guy but he supports our business and not only supports us and sarah his beautiful wife she buys our coffee and gives her twice a day hey you know jamie had cancer five years ago and it was serious he did it all surgery radiation chemotherapy this was a tough time but he kept right on teaching right on writing legislating organizing but when he did his first surgery and it was about nine or ten hours at johns hopkins and i was with him before he went under he just kept saying how much he loved the kids and me and our family and how he was really proud of everything i had done with my life and career and i told him that he had made all these things possible for me when you have jobs that require senate confirmation you want a strong optimist by your side you tell jamie your dream and i swear by god he will work to make your dream come true but when he woke up and the surgery was over and it was a success he just kept saying i am so happy to be alive i am so happy to be alive and he is really happy to be alive and i'm really happy he's alive too you

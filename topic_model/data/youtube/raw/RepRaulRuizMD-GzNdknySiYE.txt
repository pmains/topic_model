he's recognized thank you HR 4150 as amended the Department of Veterans Affairs emergency medical staffing recruitment and retention act with authorized VA up on written request to modify the hours of employment for full-time positions to be more or less be more or less than 80 hours in a biweekly pay period as agreed to by the physician and hospital management earlier this year VA testified that there are nearly 4,000 physician vacancies across the VA healthcare system VA's ability to effectively recruit and retain high-quality medical professionals to care for our veterans is threatened by the nation's worsening physician shortage which the association of medical chimeric and medical colleges has stated could grow to just under 100,000 physicians by 2025 in light of this it is imperative that we provide VA with every available tool to improve physician recruitment and make efficient use of the current physician workforce currently VA's ability in both regards is hampered by rigid 80 our bi-weekly work schedule that is at odds with private sector industry standards typically emergency room ER providers in non VA hospitals across the country work flexible schedules to accommodate the irregular hours at emergency medicine demands however ER doctors in VA medical facilities are not afforded the opportunity to adopt the flexible schedules that that there are private sector colleagues and joy this bill would correct the discrepancies and improve VA's ability to recruit and retain ER physicians HR 4155 mended which has my full support originated as a v8 legislative proposal and is sponsored by by Congressman dr. Raul Ruiz of California who is an emergency medical physician I am grateful to him for his efforts to address this issue and I urge all of my colleagues to support this needed legislation with that I reserve the balance of my time the gentleman from Tennessee reserves the balance its time the gentleman from California is recognized Thank You mr. Speaker I yield as much time as I might consume gentleman from California is recognized I rise today in support of legislation HR 4150 as amended introduced by my very good friend the gentleman from California dr. Raul Ruiz this legislation will improve the recruitment and retention of medical professionals at the Department of Veterans Affairs HR 4150 as amended allows VA to arrange flexible physician work schedules to allow for the staffing and full implementation of a hospitalist physician system and to accommodate the unusual work schedule requirements for emergency medicine physicians now we all recognize the need for flexibility in working the rigorous and irregular hours that are routinely required of emergency medicine doctors giving VA the flexibly Ephixa flexa the giving VA the ability to have flexible working hours that best suit the demand for delivering health care to the veterans who rely on those doctors just make sense the current 80 our biweekly pay period limitation for these doctors creates challenges at the VA medical centers to adequately and sensibly staff the emergency rooms generally most health care providers work a traditional 40-hour workweek however for the hospitalist and emergency room physicians they may need to work more than that in a week to provide safe quality health care to veterans who seek services at the VA ensuring access to care for veterans has been a major focus of this committee and this bill will help to eliminate the access barrier and provide a more efficient and effective way to ensure that the emergency rooms across the VA health care system are ready to take care of our veterans importantly the bill also includes protections for physicians by requiring their acquired their consent before they can move to the flexible schedule Thank You mr. speaker and I reserve the balance of my time the gentleman from California reserves balance of his time gentleman from Tennessee is recognized I think thank the speaker and I would I too am strongly in favor of this bill look I don't know where dr. Reeves was about this 40-hour week but I wish she had been around when I was in training and in practice because it would have been a joy to work just 40 hours this this particular bill allows the flexibility that every other Hospital in the world has for staffing and it in this is with the consent of the physicians and the hospital it just makes sense and I am so glad that dr. Ruiz brought this up as a practicing ER physician himself he knows about this knows exactly what it is and I appreciate dr. Reeves you bringing this up and making the making the committee aware of it and and this will become a new law and now with that I will reserve the balance of my time the gentleman from Tennessee reserves the balance of his time gentleman from California is recognized mr. speaker at this time I would like to yield three minutes to my good friend an emergency room physician and a member of the Veterans Affairs Committee the gentleman from California the neighboring district that's next to mine dr. Ruiz from California is recognized for three minutes I'd like to thank the Chairman and the ranking member and yes mr. Chairman I too had 100 120 hour work weeks and months and I was the the scut of course during my internships and residency so I understand the words that you have spoken I rise in support of my bill HR 4150 the Department of Veterans Affairs emergency medical staffing recruitment and retention Act the point is this and it's very simple the VA needs to provide high-quality care that is veteran centered that is why I introduced this bill which works to address the difficulty of recruiting and retaining the best physicians to work within the VA health care system the problem is that by law the VA is beholden to the bureaucratic OPM's 80 bi-weekly requirement for full-time physicians this does not fit with current practice of physicians in many specialties including emergence see medicine and and hospital medicine these specialties typically require more flexible often irregular working hours some weeks they work less some weeks they work the triple amounts but it needs to fit their schedule in order for them to provide the best care that they can for the patient also for instance in emergency departments it has been studied that the most dangerous time for a patient is during shift changes when a patient's care is transferred to another doctor it all depends on the quality of the transfer and discussing what happened and and and the follow-up that the second doctor is going to do there for emergency physicians prefer to work 12-hour shifts in order to minimize that transfer and many emergency physicians work beyond their 12 hours in order to not transfer and just close the patient's case so this bill would give the VA the flexibility it needs to schedule physicians in a manner similar to that seen in the private sector while remaining OPM compliant this bill will provide VA Medical Center's with the ability to implement flexible physician work schedules that can accommodate hospitalists and emergency physician schedules and practices our veterans deserve the high quality care attracting the best and brightest physicians to practice that the VA is a critical step in that directions and like my other bills up for considerations today as part of other legislations on the floor the veterans access to speedy review Act the veteran survivor claims processing automation Act this bill works to ensure that the VA works for veterans to make sure that it's about serving the veteran let's pass this bill mr. speaker and take another step towards providing the highest quality care for those who have given the ultimate sacrifice to our nation I thank the chairman once again and i think the ranking member for your efforts and getting this to the floor today and i yield back the balance of my time gentleman from California yields back the balance time gentleman from California reserves gentleman who Tennessee is recognized our Ballentine have no further speakers gentleman from Tennessee reserves gentleman from California is recognized Mr Speaker I have no further speakers I want to just add before I closed completely how proud I am that we got this bill over the finish line working together with the majority working together with the stakeholders I want to give special words of gratitude to the staff in my office and the staff on the Veterans Committee for for working extra extra hours to get this bill done this makes enormous sense to do and it should have been done sooner but I'm very glad we could get it done in this Congress and doctor I look very much forward to working with you in the next Congress to do to do similar bills in the future of greater magnitude so Mr Speaker I strongly support this legislation I urge my colleagues to join me and pace and passing HR 4150 as amended and I yield back

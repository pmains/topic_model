thank you mr chairman uh appreciate you being here uh let me jump right into it because it's uh the beginning of summer and wildfire season in california keeps just growing growing it's almost a year-round concern these days just last year in 2021 california experienced more than 8 000 fire incidents with more than two and a half million acres burned and more than 3 500 structures either damaged or completely destroyed the largest fire the dixie fire burned almost a million acres and is the largest single fire now in california history with more than 4.6 million properties in california or about 40 percent of the state having at least moderate risk of burning in the next 30 years this is according to the first street foundation california is experiencing more frequent and more severe fire seasons year after year the situation is dire and it demands expanded and sustained federal support so first area of questioning is this you know the one issue that i keep hearing time and again when i'm out and about in california particularly for communities that are recovering and rebounding from recent fires is the delays in fema dollars getting out the door and into the communities that have been on the front lines of these disasters particularly regarding mitigation grants these delays i think are unacceptable you probably agree i hope you would agree and don't really reflect the realities of those on the ground that are trying to mitigate prior to an event recover after an event so my question is this what the steps uh would you suggest that we take for fema to reach a decision on grant applications on a more timely basis and you know keep the money moving and if there's anything that this committee can do to assist in that regard and welcome your ideas hey yes senator padilla we have a couple of different programs that can support the mitigation efforts especially to mitigate against this increased wildfire threat that we're seeing we did just talk about the bric program and that's pre-disaster mitigation program and that notice of funding opportunity does come out every year and we also have post-disaster hazard mitigation grant funding that comes out after a presidentially declared disaster and we recently over the last few years included hazard mitigation money for our fmags our fire management assistant grant so we have several different programs that are eligible for communities to use what i would say is that one we actually don't see a lot of grant applications for wildfire mitigation and what i could really use help with congress on is helping communities understand that these are eligible programs that can be used for wildfire mitigation i would love to see more applications come in to support those resilience building efforts but i will continue to work with my team on getting funding out the door again our brick program we've just i'm getting ready to announce our second year of awards it's a new program for us and more money than we've ever been able to give before i mean we want to work with communities to make sure that they are in a position to execute at the same time and so we will continue to work on getting that funding out sooner okay i appreciate hearing that looks like we have some follow-up already on uh getting the word out on uh grant availability so careful what you ask for because you're going to get it let me also turn to a different incident from last year the caldor fire which burned more than 220 000 acres and destroyed over a thousand structures including the entire town of grizzly flats california now grizzly increasingly flats alone 594 homes and essential community resources such as the only elementary school the grocery store the fire station the medical clinic the post office all destroyed now president biden came out to california to personally tour the devastation and the newspapers didn't skip a beat they quoted his address to the community including quote there's so much we can do i really mean it from the bottom of my heart so that left a lot of people uh feeling good about his personal commitment to assist yet despite that commitment the administration turned around and repeatedly not just once but repeatedly denied california's request for individual assistance for the devastated residents of grizzly flats my specific question is in regards to the process now i understand that fema's role is to provide a recommendation to the president regarding granting individual assistance is the president under any legal obligation or restriction to only heed that recommendation or is the president allowed to differ from that recommendation if he concludes differently fema does provide a recommendation to the president for what we think should be the decision on any of these different disaster requests that come in the president would have the ability to make a decision if he doesn't feel that it would be appropriate um but we provide our justification and our rationale to the president on why we would recommend he not um approve that declaration but it is not a binding recommendation don't believe so okay uh in my limited time left i just want to turn to a california specific concern and that's this concept of state capacity you've heard of the recent rules rule change when it comes to assistance determinations i know congress directed fema to evaluate the factors with which to recommend individual assistance in the sandy recovery improvement act of 2013. now congress did not specify what factors should be included in that review or determination the new rule finalized in 2019 established a new factor called the state fiscal capacity and resource availability to be considered when evaluating the need for individual assistance now according to my colleagues in state government in california this new state capacity criteria has resulted in significant disparities and inequities in granting individual assistance and has left survivors including those in grizzly flats but there's many others without the support that we believe they need in the interest of time i'll just ask this will you commit to working uh with the committee and my office to ensure fema's process for recommendations is in fact more equitable and fairer for all survivors regardless of what state they live in uh senator padilla i absolutely commit to working with you after i came into this position i have worked with my team that came in with me to look at the factors that we use for individual assistance they are reviewing them now and making sure that we're using all of the authorities and the ability to use the disaster reform and recovery act as it was intended to be used and so i'd be happy to continue to work with the committee and provide updates on our progress thank you look forward to our follow-up

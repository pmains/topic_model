nation is focused on the pandemic a judge is debating a request by the Justice Department to drop charges against retired General Michael Flynn the former national security adviser to President Trump fired in 2017 for lying about his foreign contacts now two Republican senators have released a list of Obama administration officials who might have known about the intelligence on Flint it's unclear from what they released the president is making some outrageous accusations against President Obama with zero evidence whatsoever but joining me now to talk about this and much more Republican senator from Wisconsin Ron Johnson senator thanks for joining us I hope you're well and healthy I want to have you take a look at these images that we're seeing out of Wisconsin with residents flooding bars after the stay at home order was overturned I think everyone agrees we need to find a way for the country to reopen and stop the economic suffering but health experts say that this must be done in a way that keeps people safe and ultimately prevents potentially more death and health issues and more economic suffering what do you think when you see these packed bars in violation of CDC guidelines in your home state well I certainly see a small subset in Wisconsin I'd sell during a little freedom we've all been pent up we've all been frustrated and so I think they took that occasion but you know what I seen Wisconsin is primarily people being very responsible wearing masks and grocery stores maintain a social distancing taking this disease as seriously as it really needs to be taken so yeah I mean I realize those are those are images the concern probably all of us but again we do need to move to keep as much of our economy open as possible but open it is open up it up safely and responsibly I want to talk about inspectors general before we get to the unmasking memo when President Obama was in office you and I would talk a lot about inspectors general president Trump has now gotten rid of four inspectors general in one capacity or another including on Friday the State Department Inspector General Senator Romney called this quote a threat to accountable democracy and said it quote chills the independence essential to their purpose what's your response I remember you being a real advocate for inspector general inspect general and independent inspectors general when President Obama was in office for I am an advocate for inspector general's and as the chairman of the the general Oversight Committee the United States Senate we rely on an awful lot of their work I think their independence needs to remain within their agencies yeah I'm very mindful the fact that the Spector generals don't work for Congress they actually work for the administration they're they're part of the executive branch that a different coicou branch of government and that they work and serve the president United States so I take a slightly different view in terms of what they should be independent from they need to retain their independence within the agency so they can do inspections and investigations and provide that to their leadership but primarily to the President and so they serve at the president's will and that is true of every Inspector General the other thing I found out Jake is that not all inspector generals are created equal in our oversight work we've already had two inspector generals resign because of some of the corruption we were uncovering they left town head of the posse so to speak and so there are inspector generals that bring a political agenda as well as those that do a phenomenal job so they're not all equal but in the end they serve the pleasure of the president and he's got the authority to to hire and terminating well no one questions whether or not he has the the authority to do so but I really have to say I find it hard to believe that if President Obama had gotten rid of four Inspector General's inspectors general in six weeks that you would have the same attitude that you seem to have right now Jake again to those inspector generals under President Obama resigned under the scrutiny of my oversight so again I'm not going to speak specifically in this case with you know quite honestly with this inspector general both senator Grassley and I have had a real problem with his responsiveness to in particularly one oversight request I spoke with senior officials both in the White House in the State Department I understand their reasoning I don't know what they're going to provide a more robust rationale for why they do it but I understand it I don't disagree with it I don't think anything this administration could say is going to satisfy some people there's still be people huffing and puffing and stomping their feet but again it is the president's decision whether or not to hire or turn eight Inspector General well what was their reasoning because all the public knows is that this acting Inspector General was investigating whether or not Secretary of State Pompeo was misusing a political appointee to do personal errands for him that's according to Democratic aides on Capitol Hill and then a senior administration official has said Pompeo asked trump to remove the inspector general investigating him and president Trump did so what are they telling you that that makes you feel like you understand I'm not gonna discuss my private conversations with senior administration officials but my guests this will all come out Congress will be able to do whatever site you choose to do I'm sure the Democrats in the house so we'll call in mr. link and he'll be able to testify and he'll be able to tell his story and my guess the administration will hopefully have an opportunity ell their side of the story as well I'm not crying big crocodile tears over this termination let's put it that way let's talk about the list of Obama administration officials that you and Senator Grassley released this week just so our viewers understand in 2016 the same time the US was investigating Russian interference in the 2016 elections several members of the Obama administration requested the name of a US citizen who appeared in various intelligence reports this person in the cases that you've cited turned out to be general Flynn it's called unmasking it's not uncommon you praise the Director of National Intelligence for his transparency in declassifying these names I'm wondering if you would be willing to also push for transparency when it comes to the transcripts of these calls especially the calls between general Flynn and Russian ambassador kis lyac who seem that seems to be part of this have you asked for those transcripts to be released as well not yet but we just really began our investigation in this particular aspect this Jake this is one piece of the puzzle I'm all for transparency I think we weigh over classified information as a result there's all kinds of wrongdoing that can occur and the American public never has a clue but what's happening when I'm very hardened by is we finally have a log jam broke in terms of Congress getting information to conduct our oversight yep I've been on this case really in some some way shape or form since March 2015 with Hillary Clinton email scandal which kind of morphed into the whole Russian collusion because the same the same cast of characters but what just got released because I had a staff member that went down into the secure area of the Senate went through the FISA report in with a fine-tooth comb found four footnotes the completely rebutted the main text of the FISA report showing that the FBI knew fo full well that the Russian disinformation was actually part of the steel dossier in the FBI knew it the FBI knew full well that there was no collusion by the end of January and yet they engineered through James Comey the the appointment of a special counsel right there is an awful lot of unanswered questions that need to be answered and it's going to require transparency yes so I am all for transparency I think the American people need to deserve and hear the full truth and that's what I'm going to try and get okay so in addition to the transcripts which hopefully you will push for to be released as well I'm wondering did you also ask the Declassified the reports that justify why these unmasking x' were requested and approved because just listing the names and the dates we don't and then the fact that it resulted in the unmasking of general Flynn we don't know what this is about obviously he was an unregistered foreign agent for Turkey at the time he later registered retroactively Lee so there are a whole bunch of questions that people might have had are you gonna ask for that to be released as well the justifications yes I want all this information to come out one thing we have found out is that the FBI was ready to close the file on General Clinton on January 4th because they had found nothing you mean you mentioned all those other possibilities but they didn't find anything wrong so they're gonna close the file until the 7th floor that's James Comey Me's office kind of called down talk to Peter struck and say hey let's keep this open and they started talking about the Logan Act and apparently President Obama was aware of this as well so they're an awful lot of unanswered questions going back to the text that I continue to highlight December 15 2016 struck text page think our sisters are leaking like man scorned worried and political they're kicking into overdrive our committee conducted a study showed 120-125 leaks in the first hundred twenty six days sixty-two had to do with national security that compares with eight under the Obama administration something is amiss here something was going wrong I don't know exactly what happened but we're getting a clearer picture of it I think the chickens are coming home to roost and hopefully myself with the hopefully other supporters I look obviously there there are questions about FBI behavior Peter struck was fired Lisa Paige resigned etc James Comey is no longer on the scene but but what exactly are you alleging by the Obama administration because I have yet to see any facts at all supporting this grand conspiracy that the Trump administration is pushing well well Jake is because a lot of members of the media haven't been asking the questions haven't been looking you know let's face it there were there were selective leaks they wrapped up this entire Russian collusion hoax and it was a hoax and who's the recipients of these leaks it was over 18 different that's what I think what I'd love to see is I'd like to see members I would like to see members of the press actually start looking into all these leaks and how this story got spun out the result in a special council and put this country through about three years so Senate races that's what I'd like to see senator it's it's not a hoax that the Russians attempted to interfere in the 2016 election disinformation into the steel dashi that was bought and paid for through cutout in the clinic and they look at the evidence look at those footnotes I'm not just I'm not - I'm not just I'm not disputing it I'm not disputing it the idea that we don't know what was in this steel dossier but but and well how it got there and whether it was disinformation but that's not what I'm talking about you're suggesting that the entire Russia interference campaign was a hoax and it was not the Senate Intelligence Committee run by a Republican has concluded it was not every single Inspector General of the intelligence community in a of all these agencies they said it was not a hoax the Russians were trying to interfere the hoax is that there was collusion between the Trump campaign in Russia the disinformation that Russia put into the 2016 campaign flowed through the steel dossier and Hillary Clinton no I'm not denying that Russia tried to intervene re-election they've been doing it price since their founding that's what they do I'm chairman of the fray but can we get back to unmasking them if we could get back to unmasking for a second so I'm asking as you know is not uncommon it happens I'm sure you also know that unmasking is actually increased under the Trump administration compared to the Obama administration against again there's nothing to farías with it people charged with national security want to see who individual Russians and others who are talking they're talking to unnamed Americans they want to know who the Americans are that's there's nothing I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it if this is something that can be abused something you're concerned about are you using any of your oversight capacity to investigate what the Trump administration is is doing as well almost 17,000 unmasking requests in 2018 right I saw that report that under Obama's last couple years is under 10,000 and now the last couple years it's been sixteen seventeen thousand and that troubles me so absolutely I'm going to be looking into that I want to know exactly what happened you know is it usual and customary for the inner circle within the White House to be requesting unmasking or is this primarily done within the intelligence agencies I want to get all that information I want the American people to hear the full and complete truth the last thing is sir you have not made the allegation that the Trump administration is making which is that President Obama committed crimes you haven't said anything along those lines but your work you're requesting of this information of the National the Director of National Intelligence Rick Cornell and again I'm I'm Pro transparency true release at all but your work is being cited as an example does that bother you again you keep calling a crack about conspiracy theory I'm just trying to find out what happened what I do know because we finally got these records on the National Archives but President Obama saw when he got those emails from Hillary Clinton was not Hillary Clinton doubt Senate or State Department classified it was Clinton email com President Obama knew she was using a private server and section 793 F the section that I think okay that I got Hillary Clinton violated also includes knowledge of misuse of intelligence so I've I thought that was one of the main reasons they covered up for Hillary Clinton in exonerate er okay all right senator I really appreciate your time okay healthy take care I thank you sir

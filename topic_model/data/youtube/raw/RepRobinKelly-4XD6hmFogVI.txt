i've got a name i've got things like that um how do i create a feeling create a style create all types of things to make this brand a real thing and this is where you start your company history um you have a name now picked out now you need to write it down the process and procedure when you do this this will help you to inform your brand it'll also help you come up with information for your social media it'll also help you come up with information for all other things about on your website things like that so this is the this is the meat and potatoes of getting everything together um you go ahead and press enter it'll get rid of that yellow block awesome so what you want to do is you want to write down your business name and its origin history or explanation that means like if you were walking down the street one day and all of a sudden you saw a candy bar and you were like i love chocolate and i think we should have peanut chocolate riddle because there's nothing like that out here today that is the greatest ex you know origin story ever it hits you on the sidewalk they love to hear things like that that's what you need to be writing down uh that's the type of stuff that needs to go on your social media that's the type of stuff that needs to be going on your website when you get one we talk about it later this is all the stuff that you get together so that you can put this stuff into action later on down the line um also when and where your business was established were you established in chicago were you established in atlanta where were you established at uh people love to know where were you originated are you another company that came from somewhere else and now you're in chicago oh wow you've like flourished and now i want to know more about your company so things like that um your company's best known products and services so you want to know what you're selling and what your best product is and uh who you're trying to give that product to that's always a good thing to know um what's your reputation what do you want your reputation with your customers to be like and do you have any company testimonials do you have anybody um that you can call up or that you can you know tell i had a friend online a couple of days ago um and she was like you know just go go online and leave me a review you know what i mean i'm i've got these great services i'm here uh use me um and please uh go look at my services and leave me a review you can do that all the time you can um email some of your friends and go you know can you check out my services and leave me a review so that your reviews can stack up and you can get testimonials from people that you could put on on social media as like little posts like my customers said this is fabulous about our company why don't you come try this and come check out this these are called breadcrumbs things that you line up we'll talk about breadcrumbs later um where is your loyal customer base located and are there any notable press releases or anything else like uh pr do you have any people that you work with that can um that can vouch for your company write those people down uh people love to know that mcdonald's work with you people love to know that uh walmart work with you you know what i mean that legitimizes your company even though your company is already legit it's nice to have uh you know big bigger companies legitimize your company as well so those are the things those are the first things that you need to write down about your company besides your name and you know the slogan and how fabulous you want it to be you need to know all of these things uh in the beginning uh so that you can put all of this stuff together and uh get it going uh to put it together for the cookie crumbs later down the route down the road okay april next slide awesome so next we need to know who your competition is you need to know who your competition is everybody needs to know who their competition is you want to know why um when you find out who your competition is um it makes you and your uh your your your products uh you find out if you're selling the same thing down the road if you're selling something if somebody's selling the same thing up the road and yours cost more and theirs cost less and that's prob maybe why you're not selling as much so you need to always uh do a competitive analysis and um when you find your competitors you look up their products you look up their sales you look up their marketing tactics and you see what's working what's not working what might work for you you don't have to reinvent the wheel you just have to make the wheel yours that's a motto that's one of my mottos um so next you would be uh con after conducting your competitive analysis um you want to find out exactly how and who your competition is so we're going to find that out go ahead april can you click enter awesome so what are their products what are their sales and marketing tools uh what are their loyalty reward situations do they have specialty loyalty rewards that make people come to and get their product that's the same thing as yours it makes them go down the street and get somebody else's you need to know that because then maybe you can make one and your stuff can go off the shelves faster than their stuff exactly what type of technology are they using are they using a new pos system that's like faster and gets the customers out the door faster do you need to upgrade your technology things like that so like you can go through all of these questions and answer them one by one and uh find out more about your competition this way this way this will save you time and a lot of money down the road of repeating business that's that's already like around you you can become different and yeah awesome uh april next slide awesome lesson three now this one is what are your business goals now i know people go i want to sell things that's my goal i want to make money that's my goal so that's great write all of that down but you want to be a little bit more specific you want to explain the purpose of your business um you want to advi and identify your next steps um any goals you have any objectives that you may have all of that type of stuff you need to write down and you have to need to get you some focus steps to get to those goals go ahead uh april press enter awesome so some examples of goals and objectives and how to get to those uh turning your goals into objectives and then turning them into actual things that happen so example i want to make more money right and be more profitable objective your goal is to make more money your objective is to increase your sales by 10 so what i want you to do is everybody has goals but your objectives narrow those goals down to focus how you're going to be more profitable see so you can say you want to be more profitable profitable but you have to have a way to get there so that when you say i want to increase it by 10 that gives you a metric to go back to and measure and see if you actually grew that much so i want you to not just have goals i want you to have objectives as well we have another one here goal have better customer service you could do you could have two objectives for one goal you can have three objectives for one goal for this goal we have two increase customer service staff by two and get all service customer calls returned in a timely manner there's two objectives for that one goal of becoming a better customers better customer service business so you can go ahead and um write down uh four main business goals and then i want you to come up with some objectives for those uh four main business goals um profitability percentage of growth uh effective operations these are the things that you can uh set your goals uh to meet you can do it about profitability and that would be like your percentage of growth or you know how much money you want to make effective operations do you want your you know rent to be lower do you want to pay less utilities do you want to have better utilities things like that employee satisfaction um effective pay rates things like that um and then you can do things around continued growth there's a lot of different ways that you can make your goals um and these are just a couple of examples but i want you to keep in mind you want to have a goal but you also want to have an objective to get to that goal it's kind of a cyclical thing awesome great let's move on next slide april thank you so lesson four this is the i think this is a almost the last lesson in brand strategy and i do believe this is the last lesson in brand strategy um what do you your financials look like i know everybody's cringing right uh i don't know i mean you know i just sell i just sell sweaters out of the back of my truck i mean i really don't have financials for that i totally understand don't don't don't get me wrong i really want us to start thinking about this because this is the only way that we actually acquire real wealth is that if we um take note of how much money we make how much money we spend and then how much money we actually like spent and brought in and then made profitable so you have to actually do the math at some point if you want to know that you're being profitable if those objectives actually you know those goals become objectives those objectives are very specific so you have to do the real work in order to you know come up with the real numbers so she can make real money exactly so um financial evaluations will help your business set habits economic plans create plans for business activity and seek uh help you see company investment that's like the biggest thing everybody always wants to know your financials in order to get loans in order to get grants that they call loans all types of things and that's what i want to prepare us to be in even if you have five widgets over here you know that each of those five which cost ten dollars you sold two of those widgets i want you to have that down on paper make it look you know an excel spreadsheet make it look official put your name up there and let people know that you actually have have financials uh april you can go ahead and push uh enter awesome so these are the different things that you need to be thinking of when you are gathering information about your financials you have your assets which include your cash and equivalence which is just you know your bank account what you have around you know in your wallet trade accounts and receivable um you can look that one up i won't explain it all the way because um yeah trade trade accounts and receivable yeah i won't explain all the way you can look that one up um inventory you know what that is current assets you can look all of these different uh assets up and know how to calculate them and know how to apply them to your business some of this some of these things will not apply to your business and some of these things will apply to some people's businesses so that's why i included all of the assets that i knew about that you can include on an asset statement and all the liabilities that you can include on a liability statement um there's probably more and what i would say about that is the last line of this is i advise having a financial advisor to conduct a full financial assessment for best uh results and ratios okay so get your friend that does taxes that loves to do taxes barter with them a widget to get your taxes done bartering is a thing you don't have to always have the money you can be like girl i i can throw you a party next week you get me these financials together you know anything like that barter try to get try to get you some financials together on paper so we can start getting these you know sba loans and things that they be really big grants yeah exactly awesome all right next slide please all right so now we are on to crap i know everybody was trying to figure out what crap means oh my goodness crap go ahead april and hit the enter button awesome branding basis crap lessons and how these things can make your brand great so now we are now that we've gotten through grand strategy and you have uh you know written down all the things that pertain to your company the story um the name all that type of stuff you got all of your objectives and your goals together and now we now we can start thinking about how our brand pertains to the the the design and how it pertains to other brands and and i'm going to explain that now go ahead april can you hit the enter button awesome hit it one more time awesome so today we're going to cover contrast as you can see on the left but i did it bigger on the right uh next you hit it you just keep hitting it repetition alignment and proximity now what does any of this stuff have to do with your brand right like contrast like what am i contrasting my brain contrasting you just told me to be different i guess that's what that means repetition you don't want me to repeat stuff true that that does that is that's the general general general but you can take these things even finer and make them uh more so about how these how your brand uh faces other brands and then how your brand uh connects with your customers and other constituents go ahead and press enter april thank you so lesson one and crap is contrast that's the sea and crap it's the state of being strikingly different from something else or an injustice juxtaposition or close association uh to something else why is this important and how is this uh going to help your design focus go ahead and uh april and press enter awesome so contrast and brand identity it begins with uh being positioned uh well in the marketplace how does your brand stand out from other brands in the marketplace uh brand identities that use contrast uh based on how they look and feel they behave differently or they behave the same than the rest of the market you go ahead and press enter one more time yeah these differences can differences can be shown in your company's graphic style operation style or arrangement of opposite visual elements in your brand so as to create a visual interest so you can run contrast all up and through your brand you can contrast your brand with graphic style you can graphic style your operation style you can um you can use it when you're you know when you're um trying to create your visual interest for your brand all these things uh include contrast you want to make sure you're con you're you're uh juxtaposing or being strikingly different than everybody else in your sector and uh go ahead and press enter one more time you can consider these words when you're considering um your brand's focus um and being contrasty is your brand bold bright you know does it have vibrant style revived refined and balanced values can you exp how do you explain your company you see the way i did that our company has bold bright colors it has a vibrant style it has revived refined and balanced values so what is what what do how do you contrast how do you explain and contrast your company to other companies go ahead and press enter one more time april awesome you can consider these logos side by side and you can see how they the companies contrast each other bp shell is green and yellow but shell is red and yellow right they contrast they didn't use yellow but one just kind of contrasts the other and used a different color you have kmart target and sears walmart and amazon you can look at all the different ways two of the same company do things differently how do they contrast themselves to be different strikingly different or juxtaposed each other so that they're not totally and entirely stepping on each other's toes so you can do a little bit more research uh on this on your own and uh see how your company is uh showing up in contrast to other countries uh other companies uh in your sector or in your field if we go ahead and press play or press enter thank you so repetition this is lesson two repetition the reusing of the same elements throughout our designs and brand um yes and why is repetition important so like i said you don't want to be selling the same item next door to somebody else that's selling the same item without knowing what they're doing and we discussed that april you can go ahead and press enter yep think of these elements below or on the next page when you are uh when you're thinking of represent repetition in your brand design go ahead and press enter for me awesome so you can see here repetition in brand design so when you're uh when you see different brands and when you see uh like the paper that comes with mcdonald's hamburgers and you see the logo on there many different times and you see it repeated and you see when you go into oh mk burger or you go in anywhere and they have their logos and they have their iconography and all that type of stuff someone has designed that and they have thought of the lines the shape the size the color the texture all of that the the spacing in between the items all of that um and what i want you to understand i want everybody to understand is that you can have a logo but do you have a brand do you have icons that go with that brand have you thought about the spacing in between those have you thought about the style of those they match your brand they match the way that you do your business and the way that your whole look whole style looks so that's what i mean by like repetition are you using the same colors are you using the same shapes are using the same lines all of these things so i want you to think about that and are you using the same information are you repurposing different information things like that um in your it helps people to grasp onto your brand and they trust it because it's repeated things have been repeated you have been cognizant of uh using the same colors using the same logos using the same tactics so that they can grasp on and feel trusting of your brand and that's what repetition will do for your brand it'll get people to trust your brand it's like you have thought of all the things to make you know make your brand come together within repetition awesome that's just one one of lessons uh april next slide thank you all right so lesson three and crap would be the a alignment um it's the way that you line up the different elements uh in your brand and also uh in your design for your brand so this could be uh within a one page it could be on the page or in relation to other brands um go ahead april and press uh enter um alignment helps uh arrange elements and to match the way that people can naturally scan the page and so why why i think alignment is so important is because i run into a lot of websites or a lot of flyers um that have center alignment only or um they just only know left justification they don't know really no spec no spacing very well so let me show you this april go ahead and press enter for me awesome so you can see the different ways in which that you can justify edge different ways in which you can justify uh words on the page um i want you to think uh oh be more open-minded with the way in which you justify things make sure that you're repeating right the way that you choose to justify or the way that you choose to uh highlight your messages on your websites on your social media make sure that you keep all of that stuff the same right so that you're uh so that your brand can be trusted so like pick pick up pick a couple of styles you know kind of put them together and that's your style and so like alignment is really really important because the way people read your information on the page they might get lost you know at some point if you have a flyer and you started with the date and then you put um you know this is what's going to be there and then you put where it's going to be at down here and then you put if you need more information like somewhere in the middle and no one can figure that out so what i i try to get people to do is try to figure out order of operations alignment align align all of your information make sure all that stuff is you know scannable readable and understandable by your the people that you're trying to reach alignment there you go um go ahead april next slide awesome so we have lesson four proximity um this just simply means like if things are close near far and this can be applied in the design two of your uh brand as well as to other brands are you close in proximity uh to uh you know the number of units that this other brand is selling are you close in proximity to the store you know that they are go ahead april can you press uh enter for me awesome these are just some examples of the way proximity works in design but you can apply this um you know on your business cards on your websites um this is go proximity goes with alignment so the way in which your brand elements line up do you have stars with circles do they overlap do they sit close next to each other do they always do that at the same time every way um you know do your post always have the title the description and then your web your web page always is that the same way you know proximity so how close how do things line up on the page it's very important once again all these things go together um alignment and proximity go together like hand in hand so um when you're designing things and when you're thinking of designing uh things just keep in mind the spacing and uh the ways in which you pair things and how um they come together on a page and these are just some examples of that awesome uh april can you hit next slide all right now i know we haven't been here long and we're already almost to the end i know i've been going pretty fast i know i'm pretty fast at this so last but not least it's your website and i know i know everybody always wants me to talk about logos and how do i pick the color and how do i do that that's i can do that any day um today i really wanted to give you like some bare bones like what you really need to be thinking about when you're designing things when you're you know needing to get money or when you're needing to um when you're really needing to think about the bare bones essential of your brand and your business it's not just about the logo it's not just about the flyers not just about the event that you're throwing it's about all the other back-end stuff so that people can actually trust what you're putting out there so that they will buy the stuff that you have on the market awesome so now we are here at the website uh five ways or five steps to put you on your way to website success awesome um go ahead april can you hit enter yep one more time sorry about that awesome so we're gonna start with website strategy i know now this is the new degree because everybody has always has questions about um where do i go to get my domain name where do i how do i how do i even start to do this like can you just design me something can you know can you just put me together a page and the answer is always no no i cannot just put you together a page that's why i told you to do what get all that information together in the beginning when i talked about brand strategy because now you have all that information already compiled see see i was a method to my madness see it was already there i had a method to the madness all right so lesson one web strategy securing your domain name um april can you hit enter awesome i'm just going to take a quick sip of water alright so securing your domain name this can be done by visiting any of the uh domain providers listed there are way more guys there's a lot more out there um these ones that i listed were the ones that i use the most when i do websites i do godaddy the most um they're not paying me to say that i just say that to say they have customer service and for businesses that do not have budgets for uh web development or for to have a person on their staff to develop their site and keep it up and you know have questions if something goes wrong godaddy is the place that has customer service and you don't have to worry about that type stuff so that's why i use them the most um shopify people use network solutions there's all types of places you can go and figure out where you where to get your domain name in you just type it in and usually they have a search box that will allow you to type in the domain name that you want if it is available you can get it if it's not you have to they'll usually give you some suggestions as to um where you can go to or what other options you have dot orgs dot lives dot shops dot other dots that you can use that biz things like that what i would say is make sure if you do not have a network admin that's somebody that you have on a payroll to process and fix errors that might come up on your website please use someone that already has customer service attached to them and that's the only reason why i use godaddy the most so um save yourself some headache and just let it be taken care of until there's a fabulous black company out there that um provides these services we will be working with godaddy for the near future um site map development that's the next um point in website strategy so now you've got your domain name you secured it yes it's available great now what do you want on your website right so do you want a home page do you want about page do you want pages with all your merch on there how much merch do you want on there you want to tell t-shirts you want to sell pens what do you want to do on your website no one can put that together but you you have to do the amount of lab work that it takes to figure out what your what your structure of your site is going to look like because i don't know if you need an about page i don't the developer never knows if you need what you need you know what i mean you only know what you need so we're here to to put that together for you but we need you to provide the information so these are some um places where you can go get a site map developed if that is what you want if you have a big company i would suggest that it's really really not that hard to do one you can kind of look it up there's uh if you need a pro you know write maps dyno mapper i've used a couple of those before for bigger websites that need like structure like huge structures um for smaller websites you kind of just need to make a list of the pages that you want on your website right and then just kind of write them out across the page home about da da da da and then write lines from them and then where do you want those pages to go to so do you want your about page to go to the about page right so about it goes to the about page and then when you click on that where does that go right so is there a a menu item that takes you back to somewhere else um there's definitely google is your friend if you want a google site map development and see if you can just write out your own sitemap i promise you it's not as hard as it sounds it's really really kind of simple um but there are some pros down there i put them in the there's many more other than that but i know right maps is like and i know mapper is really good too um where is your site being hosted and which design platform are you going to choose now this is the third part of the situation that always kind of trips people up because they don't know if they need an html site they don't know if they want an html site they don't know if they can keep up a site that's html and that's usually um wordpress wordpress has that back end that has html that you can change um and a lot of people get tripped up when they try to change stuff or if you get a developer to make your site and they have it on there on their server no you don't want that you that's why i give people godaddy you don't want anybody else having your information owning your website on their server you want it to be on a server that you can you can access and not just that they can access and that's what i get a lot of clients that i have to transfer their websites to a independent person because they have a their site is being held hostage right you don't want your site to be held hostage so these steps will keep your site from being held from being held hostage um godaddy will keep that from happening to you because you'll have effectively have the back end will be yours uh wix and moon fruit and all the other ones will keep that from happening because you'll have access on the back end there's a couple of other developers that are really good duda dude is really good but you probably will need a developer to use duda um to put your stuff together or you know to be hosted by them um they have a really great drag and drop but then they you can also do html it's really really awesome um so if you these are the places that you can go to figure that out some pointers on website development from these four just like i said if you do not want your website to be held hostage i would suggest that you go with a third party one of the secure domain name offerings and then one of the uh design host offerings that i do and there's a lot of other design host um a web developing design host these are the ones that i use the most um because i really do like wix and i'm like moon fruit i like do too but i know that you know you need a developer kind of to use duda so that's my take on the first website strategy okay don't have your websites locked in purgatory i i don't want that for any of you go with what i'm telling you here i promise you you won't go wrong um if you have any other questions i'll you know answer those i'll give you that on the back end it'll be the last slide april go ahead and press enter awesome how to layout your website so this is lesson two so now that you have you know the developer and you've secured your domain name and all that stuff you want to start developing your page layouts now people think that they need a computer and they need to like have a have a whole set up like i need like the squares and the boxes and the menus and the buttons no i just need what i need from you is pen and paper a square a menu where do you want your menu where do you want your pictures what do you think you want your stuff to go draw out a couple of rectangles and see what floats you're both how do you think you want your website go online and look up a couple of websites and see you know compare your web compare your business to other businesses websites and see what they're already doing reinvent the wheel like i said you do not have to uh make a whole new wheel you just need to put the name your name on the wheel that's all you need to do is make the wheel yours so um develop page layouts if you press enter april awesome so oh no this is the same thing let me see if i have it up online let's see and i'll put the different um layout and website so i apologize i have it on here so stop sharing and you want to share yours um i don't wanna stop the show let's see if you can put yourself yeah it wasn't working earlier that's why i was like i wouldn't even go there i'll just um what i'll do is here i'll explain it um because i know exactly and you guys can just write notes let me see somebody has raised their hand i'm not sure if you want to take a question now sure let me uh get back to my screen i don't know why i can't see you anymore [Music] you want to ask a question why are you looking yes go ahead yes yes okay i um ask you to unmute so you can ask the question yes hello hello andre hi andre how you doing i'm muted if you want to ask the question you guys are i'm hand raised yes um can you tell me like you know what you were talking about for the uh if you have a website and and your wife's website uh ceo so you know they you can get found more places yes seo yes i'm gonna talk about that yeah okay yep i'm definitely gonna talk about it what my question was about um you know if if you build a site uh do you need like when you're talking do you need more than just i know you have to have the developer and then you have to have yourself to build it like let's say i built my own website and then i have what i'm saying is is it anything else special that you need after that that's my that was my question yes to make more um like he was saying that like you could have too much on your page or you could have too much too many too many menu windows um on your website at one time and the person that's visiting the first hand will get lost so that i was just saying is it any uh any uh suggestion that you have a person that already have that what built their website yes so if you have a site that's uh are you um so if you have a site your site is already built um and are you asking do you need to do you need to fill out more on your site or is it that you uh you just want to make sure you don't have too much on your site we have well prices pretty pretty much um i want to make sure i don't have too much on my site and then how do you get once you get the let's say you get uh 1800 people to visit your website right and to look at you look at your product you know i look at my website and they're looking at what i you know the services i do i'm in ministry so let's put it up let's put it like that awesome so my ministry is andre murphy ministries but what i'm trying to say when they go there and they might be looking for employment we have employment services we have youth services we have referrals for services for churches and that kind of thing uh but people that need jobs to help them with like their you know resume right and that thing so we refer them to a lot of different resources uh but what my my biggest my biggest problem that i have is once i get them there how do i um how do i get them to instead of just having a chat chat window and now because you're not there so they're not going to use it right they might use it to send you a message or send you a letter or an invitation something like that but what about how can i get my people more interactive on the website i think that's my question something i wouldn't hear and then they would like looking around but they don't like you say the average time is maybe about they might spend one minute total right so what i would say yeah right so what i would say to that is what is the purpose of your site is your site to give information is your site to sell things is your site to provide services is your site for them to come and sign up for something what does your site do i'm in ministry i'm a minister sorry i preach the word of god and then i'm also i also have other resource ministries such as um you know being connected with city services like with robin kelly and um you know the uh difference um let's say for people that's in seniors like the senior citizens that let them know what's going on in their community keep them upgrade updated and upgraded to what's going on like so like different sites like for corporate 19 they can't get the you know the information my ministry is like about not just winning souls for christ and getting them in church that kind of thing but outreach ministry reaching out to them to help them when they need where they are then what i would say is andre what i would say is what is your metrics what are your what is what is the need so when i say what does your website do does it drive information to get people to come to an event and are you metric are you saying that your website's not working because people are not showing up at those events my my suggestion to you is find out what the real what is your what's the real reason for your website and make that happen that's what i would say so you say that it's for outreach and to you know outreach and to let people know uh what's going on in the community right and so how you would metric that is are people showing up for your congregation to these events are people showing up you know from your congregation to these different things that you're letting them know unless you are selling you know choir robes or you know anything else on your site you know what i mean there is no other metric to let you know that your site is working um other than the numbers of people that do the clicks you know click on different pages and things like that so i would say uh don't say your site's not working if you're not selling anything off of your site um what what i would say is what you need to make sure is that the information that you're providing on your website is uh is i want to say within the vein of your brand so that people can actually maybe they're not understanding so you might be putting up flyers that other people are making right and you know they're all different flyers every time i you know like a chamber or something like that you know the way that they kind of just kind of use everybody's flyers you know that's their brand though because their community brand your brand you might need to redevelop these the information that people are getting so you might not be able to use their fly you might be like okay there's a community event to their right their way of communicating to their customer base is on their flyer and you put that up on your right on on your business right you're you're doing cross pollinating right so just like you know your cross you know you're using somebody else's communication skills for your business and then you're like ah it's not working it's not gonna work because it's not yours so you might need to repurpose right repurpose that information um to make it you know information that you give to your congregation but it's information from you and not necessarily from the third party so that they trust the information right so it's coming from you not coming from the third party that you know you didn't vet that flyer you didn't make that right so yeah that might be the the disconnect there also like i said if you're not selling anything on anything on your website um don't say it's uh don't say it's a fail a fail um uh make sure that you're doing the metrics finding out like what it is your website is actually there for to do some people's websites are not to sell anything it's just to legitimize who they are you know i'm an actual pastor i do do these things in the community these are the things that i do so if it's doing that it's effective in you know doing that just make sure that you know your message is the met your message is your message that you're getting out and not anybody else's attached to your brand yeah andre so we're gonna um do you want me to share the screen or can you share it now you wanna know go ahead you can go back and i'll just uh i'll skip that slide and i'll come back to that i got you thank you so much april i apologize thank you so much so i know this is a slide that um is not is i i accidentally repeated it right so um yup click again oh you can go yep four yep awesome one more time yeah same information sorry guys so i know that that's the same information we're going to stop here because i can explain website layout from the points that i have on the left i apologize that i didn't put in the right so developing your page layouts so what you can use to do that is um just like i was saying a pen and paper write out some rectangles um i want to know where your mem thank you april i want to know where your menu is going to be i want to know where you know where do you want your pictures to maybe go do you have any links that you want to share do you have a contact me somewhere you want to go um do a couple of pages of that for every page that you want and see if you can make them look the same or you know and and that's why i say uh go google another company that's kind of like yours to see what their website looks like and see if you can reinvent the wheel and make their wheel your wheel if their stuff is looking good and they're doing it good so that's for designing your page layouts you don't need a computer you don't need anything special all you need is a pen and paper and you know some ideas google some stuff and write some stuff down and i and we appreciate that we so i promise you your designer will be doing cartwheels if you come with pieces of paper with like a like where you how you want your website to look we'll just be like oh my god are you serious we love you we love you so next will be start laying out your sitemap and we talked about sitemaps in the last um situation um this situation you want to lay them out so that they connect remember when i was telling you lay it out and then draw lines and then connect now you really want to know um you know does your your contact page where does that go does that have to go to the contact page do you have any links right you want to make sure that your links are going to where is that going to go to www.this and this you want to write all those specifics down for your uh for your uh your real sitemap that you're going to have for your page layouts because you really don't know you know you kind of know when you're first laying out your sitemap you know this is what i want but then when you really do the research after you've done the research you'll start to develop your page layout so you'll find that your site map might change a little bit all right um selecting divine design and development platform and we talked about that a little bit um over there on the other side too um the wicks the moon fruits the uh wordpresses just be careful of like i said um of who you choose some of these apps have html that they need and some of them are drag and drop some of them have um some of them have uh limitations and some of them can you know be robust and grow with you um squarespace like i can explain squarespace is one that uses squares and you can just kind of plop squares in it's nice because it's easy and you can kind of keep it formatted but it's not nice when you want to put a circle over here and like make it interact with this line over here then everything starts to just kind of fall apart so sometimes some of these platforms are easy but then they have limitations to them and you know you can't really become robust so it just depends on how big or how small your website needs to be and that's what you how you need to um choose your design platform right and last but not least like what i always say is find professional help if you don't know what you don't know find somebody that does that does know very very easy very simple and you know most times we'll get on the phone with you and just kind of explain and you'll be like oh i didn't even think about that and then you'll go and do the homework and then you'll you know be halfway there by the time we meet again awesome sorry about that that slide guys i'll i'll send you guys a real slide next thank you so much april for advancing so lesson three building your website to drag and drop or not html and css and and my favorite line is find professional help if you need it go ahead april and hit the enter button awesome so here i lay out all of the pros in the cons of drag and drop sites now we just talked about this in the last slide or the last lesson picking your uh host design host and your uh domain provider right um here are some of the pros and some of the cons to the drag and drop like i was saying in the last kind of some of the things that i was saying in the last um slide drag and drops are easier to design yes you don't need experience to design them no and the templates are always provided yes that's the easiest stuff you can do if you need a site you can throw it up and you know what you need you have the pictures you have all of your stories right we talked about that brand strategy back then right you have all your stuff together now you can plop all that stuff in you could probably get a site up in a couple of days on the drag and drop if you have everything that you need but but it will get to the cons on that later um the launch is faster like i said um you can throw a site together quicker so you can launch it a little faster that is only if you've done all of the back-end work that we'll talk about on maintenance and upkeep first and then you're not alone when i was talking to you earlier too um you have customer service providers and options and things like that that um these pro that the leading providers will give you like wix and wordpress has no customer service i've got um wix and moon fruit in these places they have places you can call and or email or chat with and to get things fixed um i always suggest working with companies that can do that until you have a dedicated person that you can have on your staff that can do that that has that knowledge and that can help you keep everything in line so you are not alone you have support when you use these drag and drop type of situations um it's awesome they work they do work um some drag and drop cons right like i said they're not as easy to personalize uh you know there are limitations to what you can do with some of these platforms like i told you squarespace only uses squares there are no circles squares only and i do mean squares only no lines no rectangle squares that's what you get squares um um it might look um it's not easy to personalize right and you it might look not as expensive and what i mean by that and i hate to say the names i like weebly and web.com those types of platforms are a little bit less shiny i guess i'd like to say shiny um they don't have all the bells and whistles with apps and all the things that you can add all the moving text and stuff that you can add you know no animated stuff that you can kind of put over your text and make it zoom in and do things like that so some things have uh you know limitations lesson four web launch go ahead and hit hit enter awesome so website launch test we have made it to the end right so you have your domain you have set up your sitemap you got all of your pages somebody came through and designed everything for you now we are uh launching our site but wait we need to check everything before you launch your site and i've had this like happen to some of my to not people that i've designed for that i'd like you know been like uh you probably need to check that button a couple more times because that's like sending you off into a fire another world region that you'll never make it back from and now no one's back on your site they're on this error page so check check check last check check your buttons your links your page links your copy all of that your copy check your copy typos our thing people be like you're an english teacher and you have a website and you have typos that's crazy so yeah check your typos i've been there with teachers haven't yet and i've been like if you're teaching hilarious um after technical checks all after all the technical checks have been made um you can move on to seo and your website and andre that's what we're talking about i told you i'll tell you all about seoing on your website and there's uh five different or four i think four different ways that you can seo your site it's performance right we're going to test the performance of the site that means the website assessment of the load times are there any broken links so i want you you to go to your live site before you even told anybody it's live make it live and you push all the buttons and you send yourself an email and you you you before you ask anybody else to do anything else you you test everything out and that's to your performance like you can test your performance that way um targeting a complete list of the top performing target brand keywords for your site so what you want to do this is the second part of your seo you want to come up with keywords really really great ones they have sites that do this for you like you can look up website keywords and google will pop up with some places where you can you know tell them what kind of sites you have and it'll have words pop up and you can copy and paste those right on into your seo um it's a top performing uh keywords help your search uh better you to be searched better you are searchable online when you have great keywords uh monitoring you're keeping track of your website rankings and weekly reports and other monthly rankings you want to make sure that you have your back end and you're letting yourself know if you're growing if you're following what what what did you do one week that you didn't do the next week that made these hundred people come 100 people come that didn't come last week so that's why you keep up with uh the information on the back end um monitoring um to let you know you know if your website is doing what it's supposed to be doing if it's not doing it what do you need change things like that and then lastly your seo search engine and that and i apologize seo means search engine optimization so what you're doing is you're optimizing all of your information you're making your information uh obtainable for the internet and searchable so they can find it and so making sure that you're you're optimized for search engines that's what that's why it's called seo and last but not least is mobile seo and you want to make sure that and this is the thing another thing that gets tripped up make sure that your web developer is uh is has taken your website and made it mobily optimized and if they haven't ask them to turn off the feature so that you don't have a mobile it just comes up as a regular website and they have to like turn their phone and scroll your regular website they can do that for some templates let me not say for all um but you want to make sure that you have a great mobile site and if you don't you know really care about that just make sure it's turned off so that your site doesn't get all jumbled when somebody tries to access it via mobile because that's what happens if they don't design it on the back end to be a mobile site it will still come up as your regular site and that's always sometimes that can be a problem search results you want to make sure that uh you can be found in search results and like i was saying the reason the way that you get that done is having great keywords and making sure that your pages are optimized so say you have a blog page and you have different blogs that correspond to pages of course because if you click on a blog page it'll go to the blog you want to make sure that the seo on the back end of that is you know blog page one log page two blog pastry or however you want to do that so that the website web or the internet can find all of the blog pages and not just that one first page and then you gotta have you know people clicking through on your website so that's all the seo uh all of the seo optimizations you do that on the back end um of your website and if you have a website developer they will show you how to do that um if you don't um ask somebody um and they'll probably can show you or you can google it too for some of these platforms they have like how to seo your site and they make it real easy wix i know makes it very very easy for you to seo your site they go through a checklist and everything and stop you until you get everything right so that's one that does it for you and uh once you've seo your site you're ready to launch yay we're launching sites we're making money we're doing great things and you're off to your great start and all of those things in the beginning helped you get all the way to this spot right here so we've made it to the end uh april press enter one more time yep made it to the end this is the last thing you need to i know you thought that launching your website i know you thought that was the last thing you needed to do right no that's not the last thing you need to do you need to upkeep this site and then you need to promote the site right so once you have you know had your friends and that was the last part of that have your friends right after you have checked your site have your friends email you contact you on your website and do things like that just to make sure you know things are working and your friends are you know leaving you things like that and you know they're giving you feedback have a little friend session about your website and once you've launched it you get to upkeep it go ahead um april and press enter awesome so website upkeep make sure you have a plan of attack for all updates edits and any changes you would like to have made on a regular basis right so once you have your website developed now what you have an event next week and you need that information changed i hope you had a plan right do you have somebody that can change that did you talk about the talk to the developer and go do you have an option for me to like send you stuff every once in a while do you have somebody you can um or can you show me how to do this so these are things that you can ask for in the beginning of the development of your website i'm going to need to be able to have an event every once a month and i need to change that information on my website can you make a site a place on my website where i can just change that information and make it easy for me to change they can do that they can definitely do that and then show you it might be a little bit extra to give you a tutorial and get you there but yes they can show you they can make that happen and you can have that information you can change that yourself but if you have an inside person either you use a developer if you have somebody in-house or if you do it yourself just make sure that you have that planned that up that upkeep that you might need uh going in the back of your head or in the back of your head so you can have it taken care of promotion so right after your launch you definitely want to promote your site once you've checked it had all your friends come through and you know contact you via your email address and things like that um you want to uh share share share on social media you want to probably develop a web newsletter and things like that um it seems like we've come to the end of our webinar thank you so much everybody i've had such a great time with you guys um if you need any other information i go ahead and click

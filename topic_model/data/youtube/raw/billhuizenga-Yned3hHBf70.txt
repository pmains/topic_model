Thank You mr. speaker and we've been hearing some of the details of the bill but here's the real message folks this is about our small communities and small banks that are the lifeblood of those communities well little earlier you heard the ranking member talked about this being about Wall Street you know what she's right this is about Wall Street Wall Street was one block away from where I lived on Sanford Street and Zeeland Michigan oh by the way we were connected by Main Street and Central Avenue that is wouid is about whether it's Wall Street and Zeeland Michigan or Sanford Street or my friends in Baldwin Michigan this is about our small communities so what what does a strong local community brank bank bring it brings local investment and what does that local investment bring stability predictability trust truck farmers among those corner pub owners among those small hotel owners that may be depending on the the straight traveler that's going to be coming through you know this has been sort of viewed as a risk to these small banks it's actually the opposite of that because either a one small community bank is going to merge with another small community bank and they are going to remain small community banks under that three billion dollar threshold or be what as we have been seeing a lot of and this is what the Chairman was talking about R or B they're going to get gobbled up by a large bank that doesn't qualify under this legislation and guess what they are far more likely to remove those ATMs far more like likely to move those local branches out of places like Tustin and Luther and Baldwin and Holland so I can tell you this that that if you went and said that this is anything other than about strengthening our small community banks it either shows one is either wildly out of touch or be playing politics and that's the sad part because I can tell you this you go talk to my friend Debbie Smith Olson who's the CEO of Lake Osceola State Bank in Baldwin Michigan located in the poorest in the state of Michigan one of the top 100 poorest counties in the nation and you told her that this was about Wall Street she'd laugh if you went and talked to my friends at Mack at our bank and tried to describe this as being about helping big banks and Wall Street and rolling back dodd-frank they they would first look at me and stunned silence and then they would ask me are you serious well unfortunately that's the kind of rhetoric that you are hearing out here today let's make sure that we understand what this is really about strengthening our small banks which strengthened our small communities and strengthened our small business owners that is what is going to continue this economic comeback that we are experiencing here in the states so I commend the gentlelady from Utah and her work on a bipartisan basis that this has been coming together with people of goodwill trying to come up with a solution to make sure that we don't see needless consolidation in a banking community that's already been so hit it's recognized for additional 30 seconds this is as I wrap up this is about making sure that we have a solid community banking system and we know that they have been under assault under these dodd-frank provisions that have come through that I don't think we're necessarily maliciously put in but they were misunderstood about what those effects were going to be the gentlelady miss love from Utah is rectified that and I want to encourage my colleagues to support that and vote YES for this very important bill and I yield back gentleman yields

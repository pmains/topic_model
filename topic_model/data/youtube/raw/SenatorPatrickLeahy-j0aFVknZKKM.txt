the reason I I want to have this it's on the occasion of our first major legislative effort together on behalf of the Senate National Guard caucus oh I'm nearby my friend colleague co-chair of the of the guard caucus of course he's also been a strong voice in the guard former member himself and in the reserve and so what we tried to do and senator bond and I had discussed this illogical sarabande I close personal friends may have some philosophical difference in some issues but never would have guarded the guard and hope that we would be able to keep that and we have there we've been concerned that prior to 911 there were a lot of bureaucratic hindrances and having the guide be able to do everything it it could do and there are some of these organizational hindrances have not been adjusted to match their new missions since 911 and you have we know those who gone to Iraq or Afghanistan seen our guard members seamlessly integrated with retro forces and once you've done this a lot more than I have you look out there going out in combat you don't know which ones guide which one's a regular forces except we know that the guard today that we would not be able to project the forces we do around the world without them young private to join the National Guard on September 10th 2001 was joining a force initially designed to participate an all-out no-holds-barred war with the Soviet Union even though the Soviet Union no longer existed and when that young private showed up or drill here she'd found facilities in disrepair guard too demoralized from intent in attention by Pentagon leaders equipment that seemed to predate the Cold War and I'm afraid that that private may be wondering what have I got self into 911 of course is a lot different and found out we're going overseas you're going to be in wars but when they got that order for an upcoming deployment they must have a sinking feeling you had unit vehicles ranging this would be in any state training was insufficient privates unit was under strain I do not have the equipment they needed and we have tried to make major changes in that we're still fixing these problems we have ever since we came in there Kat Von nice is the largest year market the either one of us ever involved in was to give upgraded equipment body armor Humvees and everything else to guide units throughout the whole country so now this bills is going to build on the garden Parliament reforms we would make the chief of the National Guard Bureau a statutory member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for the first time ever and so you can sit in the in so-called tank with the others Lindsay life Joker will pay for the chair Rowan pocket if need be we have a great respect for general Dempsey and Jonah Swartz the Chiefs of Staff the Army in the Air Force but they cannot represent the army near guard as well as the current chief for the National Guard Bureau gentle McKinley so we have to have them the garden Parma bill also authorize appropriations for guard domestic operations and a number of other areas but as we're saying even now with the Hurricanes with the tornadoes with the floods and the southern part of this country and with the flooding even in my own state of Vermont if we didn't have the guard if they couldn't be called out these states have been bad trouble so Lindsay thank you this is the boldest most far-reaching agenda legislatively I have ever seen when it comes to the National Guard and I'm proud to be part of

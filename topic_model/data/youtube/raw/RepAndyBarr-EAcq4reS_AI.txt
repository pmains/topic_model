joining me right now is kentucky congressman house financial services committee member and house veteran affairs committee member andy barr congressman it's always a pleasure to see you thanks very much for being here walk us through your letter to john kerry and have you heard a response yet well thanks for having me on the show maria no we have not heard the response yet but i think the major u.s banks the wall street banks are learning a painful lesson that their full-throated embrace of environmental social governance positions is not placating or appeasing the extreme far left in this country and in fact it's inviting the very political interference in their businesses that they shouldn't want this is the worst of politicization of access and allocation of capital and it's going to threaten jobs it's going to threaten u.s competitiveness and and bottom line is it's going to cede competitiveness to china well i want to ask you more about this because you are the ranking republican on oversight on the financial services committee you're a member of both the china task force and the foreign affairs committee and you have a real knowledge into what's happening in terms of the the china behavior as well as the business climate what's going on in terms of these corporations coming out attacking things like georgia and its voting law meanwhile under the under the umbrella of esg they are able to tell the rest of us not to invest in sin stocks don't buy oil companies don't buy tobacco companies they're sin stocks and yet they're perfectly fine investing in and and opening offices in communist china where there is human rights abuses intellectual property theft bullying of its neighbors and just all around bad behavior on the global stage well maria you've done a great job pointing out the hypocrisy of corporate america and big banks in the united states being perfectly fine investing in china and in some cases we see large u.s asset managers and large uh systemically important banks in kentuc in the united states uh financing companies with close ties to the chinese communist party obviously we know of the human rights violations the genocide in the xi jiang province against the uyghurs for sterilization the the ripping up of an international treaty in hong kong and the violation of the rights of the people of hong kong and obviously the cover-up the lies and the deception related to the origins of the pandemic this is the human rights record of the chinese communist party and yet many of these woke wall street firms are fine investing in china but when it comes to u.s companies they're perfectly willing to choke off financing to legally operating businesses that provide americans affordable reliable energy and give us a competitive edge meanwhile china is the world's largest polluter they are the uh they are the the problem with climate and if on this earth day if you really care about climate then you would hold the chinese communist party accountable you know their belt and road initiative maria is responsible for the planning of 300 new coal-fired power plants across the globe outside of mainland china in places like bangladesh and turkey and indonesia and the philippines and so this i and by the way the technology that they're using is not u.s technology it's sub-critical a low efficiency coal fire power so look at this summit uh we need to be focusing not on politicizing access to capital in the united states and choking off financing to american companies we need to be holding the chinese communist party accountable for polluting this earth that's the focus and that's right and that's that's my message to john kerry yeah this is such an important point but what are the odds we're going to hold them to account we haven't even asked them where the coronavirus originated from uh congressman i mean give me a break we were schooled in alaska not a word about the millions of people across the world that have died the half a million that have died in the united states because of chronovirus because they covered it up and they allowed it to escape its borders so are you i mean do you have any confidence that they're going to hold them to account on climate no i don't when our secretary of state is lectured by a top poet bureau official on u.s soil and they don't get up and leave the room it shows the weakness that this administration is showing towards the chinese communist party and what i'm concerned about is the over eagerness that john kerry and joe biden are exhibiting to our adversary in beijing it it leads me to believe that they're giving the chinese communists leverage over the united states it looks like we're willing to bring xi jinping to this climate conference and give up the store and not hold them accountable we're giving away leverage in in negotiations on trade on human rights on uh the the military operations in the south china sea uh they're they're increasingly belligerent activities related to taiwan and so i'm very concerned that this administration has its priorities totally wrong focused on implementing the green new deal through the back door of financial regulation as opposed to bolstering u.s competitiveness and uh standing up to the chinese communist party in beijing this is a real problem yeah well well why i mean are they conflicted why can't they stand up to the communist party and by the way they're all playing word games with us they called the green new deal and infrastructure package they call a massive spending package uh a covid package right they call they call the climate situation a climate crisis but they won't call the crisis at the border that's a challenge i mean it's absolutely outrageous and the fact that more media is not standing up and calling this out is also shameful former secretary of state mike pompeo joined house republicans yesterday to unveil a new bill that will codify into law era sanctions on iran this is another outrageous issue coming from the by the administration iran the maximum pressure act would require any new deal with tehran to be ratified by the senate congressman you're a co-sponsor of this maximum pressure act what is the body administration doing wanting to get us back into the iran nuclear deal well once again showing uh weakness on the world stage and inviting aggression from the world's number one state sponsor of terrorism iran the maximum pressure campaign is exactly what we need it worked under the trump administration military spending by the the mullahs in tehran reduced by 25 percent many of the iran-backed militias that destabilized the region uh they were were denied funding and uh iran's reserves of foreign currency dropped 95 because of the trump administration's maximum pressure we need to return to that we don't need to re-enter a flawed iran nuclear deal that's why i have proposed to make sure that senate ratification and treating this as a treaty should be required as a condition of rejoining any flawed agreement yeah and then rejoining is also jeopardizing potentially our peace in the middle east uh with those abraham accords andy barr good to see you we will keep spotlighting all of this thank you so much we'll be right back

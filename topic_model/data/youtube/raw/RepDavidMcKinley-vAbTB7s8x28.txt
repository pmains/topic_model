chairman with the gentlelady yield i'm happy to yield to you mr mckinley uh miss castor i'm just curious if they block the pipeline as they've done do you really believe they're not going to ship that oil someplace else and they'll and they'll refine it someplace else and so those emissions that you talked about the tonnage will still be released the atmosphere boy i sure hope not i i i really hope not that tar sands fuels are the dirtiest on the planet and we already know we should shut down because everything we understand they're going to ship it they're going to ship it someplace else so we may not do it in a cleaner way but they'll ship it someplace else and it may be it may be refined in china and we know what they we know how poor their their their their techniques are no i mean we we have a lot of work to do together uh and we've talked directly at each other about the you know america we're not in this alone when it comes to the climate crisis we have to put pressure on china in india um and this is going to be a robust debate that we'll have but really we've all got to work together because the costs are escalating the uh catastrophic events are adding up the planet continues to warm and unless we come up with really focus on clean energy solutions uh we're going to be in a whole world of hurt thank you

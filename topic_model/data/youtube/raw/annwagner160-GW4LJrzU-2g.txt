Thank You mr. chairman and congratulations to you chairman gold members of this committee have expressed concern that Cecil accounting standards will adversely impact the cost and availability of credit once fully implemented we have heard banks of all sizes and let me underscore all sizes of banks outlined the implications this new accounting standard will have on very popular to the sumer products especially during economic downturns chairman golden after hearing concerns from both financial institutions and Congress has faz be taken the time to study the likely economic impacts of season one I'm not talking about Treasury I'm talking about faz be we have not done an economic analysis stunning did you study how Cecil would affect lending or access to credit for consumers before issuing this new accounting standard we did a cost-benefit analysis in connection with our mission which is to provide better more decision useful information to the capital markets and other users including regulators lending and access specifically is why I asked about no we did not no you did not again stunning I'd like to submit to the record the following article by accounting today which estimates loan loss revenues our partner loan loan loss reserves under Cecil again accounting today loan loss reserves under Cecil could range from you ready for this fifty billion dollars to one hundred billion dollars according to public disclosures made by various financial institutions chairman golden would you care to comment on this estimate of 50 billion to one hundred billion we plan to closely monitor the aggression of the Seas limitation to ensure that it's been performed in with our expectations as to what is the you don't study anything I usually tell you to closely monitor something like this 50 billion to a hundred billion dollars Wow according to public disclosures and loan loss revenues we do study the the impact of our proposals on the capital markets and other users we think that the information provided to investors is consistent with how they analyze financial institutions they'll be able to make more informed decisions that will help our calculus and we think that's a good thing we also think the banking regulators will have better and more refined information and they can make changes and we think that is a good thing as well a new accounting standard that affects the economy this much should have significant studies backing it wouldn't you agree I think that's why it's important that the we we work with the Treasury in consultation with the banking regulators is the bank but you haven't studied it at all and we're talking about we have studied in connection with our mission that this will provide additional and better information to the capital goal what percentage of institutions will be able to comply with Cecil efficiently and effectively based on our discussion with our stakeholders those that are required to apply the beginning we believe are ready we recently deferred the effective date for private financial institutions not-for-profits wouldn't which includes all credit unions and smaller public financial institutions so they have larger percentage of institutions will be able to comply with seasonal efficiently and effectively it's already the dates passed it's in we believe all those that are required to apply will be able to apply chairman gold a number of commentators have suggested that Cecil could have a procyclical effect can you please describe what impact Cecil would have interest there have been many studies that have been performed most recently the Federal Reserve staff did a study that said leading up to the recession it would dampen lending and it would accelerate lending during the recession and therefore to be less procyclical than the current model I couldn't disagree more these new accounting standards will have what it does to popular consumer products especially during an economic downturn a products that matter to my constituents in Missouri 2nd congressional district mortgages credit cards again I'm just stunned I'm have some questions about LIBOR and so far but I will leave it at that you are compelled I think sir to study this more further take time about what is the impact this is going to be for real people and for the institutions and the small especially sized banks that are going to be affected amount of times Chairman go back

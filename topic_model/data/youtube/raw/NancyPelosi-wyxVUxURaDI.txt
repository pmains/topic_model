a point i want to emphasize it under this bill when the republicans vote for this bill today they will be voting to say that women can die on the floor and health care providers do not have to intervene if this bill is passed it's just appalling it falls right into there for the all it's a health issue this is a health issue and it falls right in there with a lot of other initiatives that they had coming up on the floor about clean air clean water mercury you name it america's families deserve better than this and again today is another example of a wasted opportunity instead of taking up even an aspect of the president's jobs bill that could create jobs uh that they are i don't i can't even describe to you the logic of what it is that they are doing i just know that you'll see a large number of women on the floor today fighting for women's health issues as well as to point out how savage this is about withholding care for a woman because of of this legislation

uh listen we've heard a lot about inflation of course but i want to dig a little bit into this a chair powell you recently mentioned that price increases are relatively concentrated in particular areas and yes i think most folks can understand that things like airlines and hotels etc industries uh that took a hit during covid um you know because people weren't really traveling you know this could be an issue there however i want to get into some other areas where we've seen price increases one of the biggest areas is in cars both new and used um and i wanted to touch base about this secretary yellen one of the key causes of the shortages um and the prices of the increase in our cars is because of shortages of semiconductors and production issues is that correct yes that is correct there have been significant semiconductor shortages particularly affecting cars thank you uh and i hear regularly from businesses in my district about supply chain issues uh coming off of the pandemic that are unfortunately holding back our companies one recently told me that their sales are down 120 million dollars really because they can't they're they're producing to supply chain so share powell um we see that elsewhere too with ships waiting offshore on both coasts difficulties moving goods uh back and forth etc is that correct yes it is very correct it's hard to see how long that will take but it will it will resolve itself in time and that shows us also that the prices of shipping goods from china uh to the u.s has gone up and i think that's gone up 400 percent from pre-pandemic so that's going of course add to the cost of anything we buy from china so while we've got you two here i guess what i'm wondering about are what are the solutions uh chair powell if we have issues with our ports or with the supply of semiconductors or other components does it make much sense for the economy to pull back on investments in the bottlenecks or would we do better to expand that capacity i think that's really a question for fiscal policy i will say these are uh these are tangled supply chains right now and it's it's a combination of a bunch of factors which should abate over time but in terms of obviously investment in in supply chains would make them more efficient over time thank you and so one you know i want to point out here that most of the things we produce do require workers um and i spoke to you tara powell about this in february but secretary yellen you've of course studied labor markets throughout your career so when we have constraints on our supply chain does it make sense to limit the numbers of people able to work or should we instead invest in policies like child care that help get people into the workforce well absolutely i think over the longer term we've had a problem with declining labor force participation of prime age workers and we're proposing paid leave child care support early childhood education supports that would help expand labor force participation in the short run of course dealing with the pandemic to make sure schools can operate on a normal schedule get people back to work will help as well and then there are other countries around the world that obviously have some of these pieces put in place like you know better child care early childhood education in your studies with them do you see economic growth coming as a result of putting these practices in place yes it's been an important source of growth in the united states and elsewhere once upon a time the united states just with respect to women's labor force participation had about the highest in the world and that's changed radically in recent decades um as we've failed to expand and provide the level of support for female especially for women's labor force participation we've fallen behind other developed countries absolutely and thank you so it so what i'm hearing it sounds like to me that democrats what we're proposing is actually a solution to some of these inflation concerns and that doing nothing will actually exacerbate issues and make it worse uh you know i'm for one not in the business of telling people what they can't buy what i'm hoping that we can do is find solutions like child care like paid family leave like lowering the cost of prescription drugs to keep money in people's pockets so that we can stop artificially limiting the capacity of america's economy and get people back to work to help create more products and move move products around our country so things like child care paid leave and other policies will actually help expand the workforce thank you so much

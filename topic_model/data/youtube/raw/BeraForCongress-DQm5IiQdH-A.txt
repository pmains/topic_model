it's more than an oath it's a pledge to serve others to put people first to doctor Ami Bera Congress is a place where people not politicians come first where we build not bankrupt our children's future where we protect Medicare and Social Security not tax breaks for millionaires and special interests that's why barrel won't take a pension until seniors get the retirement security they deserve and if Congress doesn't pass a responsible budget they'll make sure they don't get paid that's my pledge to you i'm dr. ami bera and i approve this message

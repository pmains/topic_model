my name is ellenborough I retired four months ago from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on grounds of principle in disagreement with the policies pursued by Netanyahu Lieberman government the national security of Israel cannot be based on a military advantage forever we need to come to terms with our neighbors that is a fundamental component of our national security israel needs to pursue a political agreement with the neighbors for the sake of its security and safety and existence therefore the years to come and this is now the time to do so if the Palestinians have a state of their own the degree of animosity towards Israel is then reduced and there is no question about that without it we are doomed to a conflict that will escalate and stagnate and it's a risk for Israel

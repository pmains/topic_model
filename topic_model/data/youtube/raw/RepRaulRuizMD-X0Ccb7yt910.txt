thank you thank you mr chairman thank you to all the witnesses for testifying here today uh you're in the home stretch uh safe and healthy water is essential for our public health i'm a doctor i'm a public health uh expert but it doesn't take a doctor of public health to really stress that safe and healthy water and clean water is is essential for our public health it is imperative during this pandemic that we make the safe drinking water act work to ensure vulnerable populations who have been devastated by coca-19 like farm workers low-income communities and native americans have access to safe and clean drinking water we must have strong standards in place to prevent situations like the one in my district where residents in a oasis mobile home park had arsenic in their water because of the epa and their guidelines they were able to identify that there was a problem and bring the water to the mobile home park to compliance without those guidelines and oversight my constituents might still be drinking contaminated arsenic in their water but protecting our communities from harmful drinking water is just the first step clean and safe drinking water must be accessible and affordable water service should not be shut off because families can't pay their water bills the coven 19 pandemic has put many families in my district and across the country under financial strain and they are struggling to pay their utility bills we should be doing more to help those families pay their water bills right now and we should do more in the safe water drinking act to ensure water affordability when the house passed the heroes act in maine we included provisions to help pay water bills for struggling families during the pandemic so my question for miss chard is do you support including water utilities assistance for low-income families in our covid response i think it's critically important that we have to consider the availability of clean safe drinking water for all of our citizens especially in this time of the pandemic it is very much appropriate in my opinion um that water utility funding the ability of citizens to pay their water bill to be a part of our national response right uh miss what are your thoughts should the next uh uh coveted response bill have assistance for water uh affordability yes i think it's absolutely critical to have the assistance for affordability um in addition to you know we've seen some moratorium around um shut-offs for water but there also needs to be assistance beyond just the end of this public health crisis so that people you know they the arrearages for the payments you know that are also adding up that they aren't suddenly shut off in the water once the public health crisis is over that we have a way that people are able to continue to afford um and get access to water frankly because this is not just about relief during the pandemic water affordability was a concern even before the pandemic even as the federal government spends hundreds of millions of dollars per year on assistance for water utilities water bills in some communities are far too high if we strengthen standards to make our water safer these affordability issues may get worse so my question for you miss wu is how do we use the federal assistance under the safe drinking water act to make sure that our drinking water is safe and affordable for all communities yeah i think it is important that assistance is provided to the communities who need it to be able to meet the standards that we would want our drinking water to meet so that they are providing affordable water to all of their customers and again i think that the polluters who are the ones who are creating all these problems ought to be footing the bill for all of this it shouldn't be on the utilities and it shouldn't be on the ratepayers so my last my last question this committee held a hearing earlier this month on issues facing travel communities including the limited access to safe and affordable water particularly in the navajo nation my last question for ms banda hai and ms chard how can we reform the safe drinking water act to increase access to safe water from tribal communities we'll start with you miss vande high okay um i think in the same way that we would we are trying to ensure safe and affordable water to everyone um tribal communities are no different although although they are sovereign states and so i'm not sure what um difficulties there may be there but i i would i would i would recommend reviewing the last hearing because uh there's unique structural barriers for them to get clean water infrastructure and safe water infrastructure that that i do believe we need to address uh miss charter if you can answer in five seconds because my time is up and i'm gonna yield back i would say we take advantage of the dwsrf program and use that with the tribal set-asides to help the tribal communities thank you very much good idea i yield back

mr president the senator from louisiana is recognized mr president thank you uh mr president i rise today to say thank you uh i rise today to say thank you to president biden and do secretary of state blinken uh they have both announced today though it's been rumored for several days that the united states of america is about to make available 500 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine to our our friends and neighbors across the world and i hope the president and the secretary are willing to offer even more if necessary uh we've learned a lot about the the virus and the disease that it caused causes i'll mention three things number one we've learned that the virus came from china number two we have learned that the best vaccines for the virus came from the united states of america and number three we have learned madam president that the pandemic is not over yes things are better in the united states and and we're so blessed in that regard and i'm so thankful that's a combination of uh of americans uh uh receiving the vaccine it's a combination of americans being being careful in their behavior uh our low coronavirus rates are a combination of people who have contracted the disease and therefore have the antibodies and that's why our numbers are going down and and we're also thankful for that but that's not the situation in other parts of the world if you go to south america if you go to central america if you ask india if you ask sub-sahara africa about how things are going in terms of the pandemic it is alive and well and raging um and and our friends and neighbors need the help and i am grateful today that president biden and secretary of state lincoln is going to make that help available for for a couple of reasons it makes sense to show the the world what you what u.s leadership really means number one it's the right thing to do it's the moral thing to do we developed a vaccine we need to share it that doesn't mean that we have to require the pharmaceutical companies to share their patented and protected information i think that's a real mistake we can accomplish everything for licensing agreements but we do need to share uh number two this makes sense in terms of uh our national security it's not the most important reason to do this but in terms of of the national security and and and the rest of our neighbors throughout the world understanding that the american people are generous and that we help other folks when they are down number three it makes sense for the president and the secretary to do this in terms of geopolitical terms um china is trying to do the same thing that we're going to do in terms of making vaccine available throughout the world and and i thank china for that um and i think the chinese people the chinese people are wonderful people their leadership not so much the chinese people say it again the people of china are wonderful the leadership in the communist party of china is a bunch of pirates but but i i i am thankful they're willing to make vaccines available the problem is they're making their own vaccine available which is inferior to the american vaccine and number two in many cases their vaccine diplomacy their meaning of course the chinese communist parties vaccine diplomacy is tied to conditions yes say the chinese communist party we'll share our vaccine with you if you'll uh if you'll help us take over taiwan uh yes we will uh share our vaccine with you say members of the communist party of china if you will uh join with us and saying that the communist party of china is doing nothing wrong in hiding the origins origin of the the coronavirus that's not what we're doing our gift as americans to the rest of the world is unconditional it is firm it's categorical it is the moral thing to do it is the smart thing to do in terms of our own national security um we can't completely completely recover until the world recovers and number three it makes perfect sense in my judgment in explaining to the rest of the world the difference between communism and the free enterprise system and and the hearts that that lie behind both of those systems it's also and i'll close on this point madam president it's necessary there are very few countries in the world we are blessed to be one of them that have the ability to manufacture to store and to distribute the vaccine um and and yes it's wonderful to talk about we're we're going to help uh other countries uh with their let's say their manufacturing needs we should do that but we don't have enough time we just don't have enough time because in the developing world they just when time is of the essence they just don't have the ability that we have to manufacture a vaccine which is only part of it to store that vaccine many of these vaccines require very careful protocol in terms of storage and number three to distribute we can do all three and uh president biden over the last several days along with secretary of state lincoln have said we're about to show the world what american leadership looks like we're going to share our innovation and our vaccines with our world's neighbors and there are no strings attached and we're doing it because it's the right thing to do and i think all members of this congress should join with the president and should join with the secretary of state in this effort if they need the resources i think we should provide them and let's let's all get back on our feet together as a world thank you madam president i suggest the absence of a core

wisconsin congressman scott fitzgerald who sits on both the house small business committee and the house judiciary committee joins me nice to see you sir good to see you greta good to be with you um first of all let's talk about that bill that just passed um it's going to go to the president's desk for signature i guess one of the key things i'm curious about it says it's called the inflation reduction act um we'll have to see what happens at midterms whether it's made a dent in inflation or not or that name could come back to haunt the president yeah they uh they typically mislabel a lot of pieces of legislation that make their way through the house but this uh this may take the cake uh because it does everything but address uh inflation itself and and if you were down on the floor like i was today listening to the arguments back and forth uh it was really disheartening which you know this started two weeks ago when we started to hear that mansion was trying to actually negotiate some type of deal with senator schumer and i think many of us were hopeful that there were some members of the house more moderate members that are up for re-election in november that might kind of just pause or pump the brakes and say this is not something we need to be voting on right now but unfortunately um just like every other piece that we've watched uh across the house of representatives uh speaker pelosi rallied the troops and came up with the votes for it but i think it's going to bite him in the end well you know normally i think well okay i would exp you're a republican so naturally i would sort of expect that reaction i have sort of expectations from democrats and things from republicans on another but the congressional budget office did a scoring of this and they're supposed to be independent and they went to the issue one of the things they looked at precisely was the issue and they said it would have a negligible i think that was the word impact on inflation so i thought to myself well that probably wasn't a very good title i mean even if the prediction under the cbo is negligible but anyway that's me all right now i want to turn to the other big topic of the day you are on the judiciary committee house judiciary committee in the event the house is won by the republicans in the midterms is to either do you think that this whole investigation of trump is going to come back to haunt the administration oh i do uh members of the judiciary committee uh headed up by uh ranking member jordan there's a couple of letters that we fired out today which i know typically kind of go out uh and and you never really hear much about it but this laid out kind of uh very specific questions about what is the ag up to and then uh director ray as well with the fbi and and some of the answers that we're seeking so even with the press conference that was held yesterday i mean i still have a lot of questions uh and and what's your main question what's your main question right now why was there a year and a half delay before any action was taken and then again it's becoming clear that there was about i think as you addressed earlier in your show about a four-day delay between when the warrant was actually served so you know until we see the full affidavit and get a handle on it it's going to be difficult to know just exactly what they were up to yeah and unless unless they moved quickly it seems like a subpoena would have been the right route to go so that you if you get a subpoena you can object to it and go into court and fight with it and talk to the judge saying that it's that the seizure order is over broad or whatever but when it when you get a search warrant you know it's usually they have to move fast because they think something's happening but i don't know right i mean the other thing for me is just i mean when you're dealing with part of the the code 793 i mean you're talking about espionage you know i'm a former army officer so i've got a secret clearance i've been in the skiff as a member of congress i mean this is very heavy stuff and you know so far it has it doesn't appear that they really have anything that rises to that level that they needed to take 30 uh agents and and uh and show up at uh the president's residency what well they've got they've got this whole long list i've gone through and taken notes some of the things you know some of things are are labeled uh miscellaneous secret documents classified but then there's some things that just like box labeled a24 i don't know what that means you know it's a box labeled a30 so we need a whole lot more information on this one so we can figure out what what happened or didn't happen anyway congressman thank you sir good to be with you thanks greta

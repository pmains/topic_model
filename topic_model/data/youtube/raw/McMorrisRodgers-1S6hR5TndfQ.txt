thank you madam chair and just thank you everyone who's been a part of this the witnesses in your testimony today I'm pleased that you are bringing this legislation forward today earlier representative Ruiz was talking about the teaching health centers and how important they are I'm proud in Spokane to represent one of the teaching health centers that is making a big difference in our region we are excited that Washington State University is has built a medical school the University of Washington and Gonzaga partnering on a rural training track I represent an area that has a lot of rural communities and these this effort in Spokane is definitely part of the solution when you when when I look at the partnership between the teaching health center the universities the local hospitals and then our local VA we need more doctors we need more doctors throughout Eastern Washington and I'm also reminded that where the doctor does their residency they're more likely to practice I doctor not too long ago who had come from California to spoke in 30 years ago to do his residency and he's still there and it underscores how important it is these residency programs so I am a strong supporter of the teaching health center graduate medical education program the legislation that is before the committee today you know it's estimated that nationwide will have more than 23,000 shortage we'll be short 23,000 doctors by 2025 and it's really unacceptable except unacceptable and you see it further in the rural communities where the physician to patient ratio is especially start only 10 percent of physicians practice in these areas even though a quarter of the population lives there compared to doctors you trained in the traditional Medicare program those trained at teaching health centers are 60% more likely to practice primary care and 30% more likely to work in a rural or underserved community I was proud to help lead this legislation in the last Congress where we doubled the funding and I am excited and encouraged that we're continuing that effort in this Congress representative Ruiz tore a small representative row and I have joined in introducing HR 28 15 what it does is continue the support for this program by extending it for another five years and increasing the funding and providing more certainty which we need across the country this legislation in this program is important in meeting the needs of rural and underserved communities through a new generation of primary care medical professionals the teaching health center has programs that are meeting important needs in psychiatry OBGYN primary care internal medicine you know the very fields that we need more of our doctors to be pursuing so I have a few questions to mr. juror on mano I wanted in your testimony you talked about the Shasta Community Health Center electing to become a teaching health center as a means of addressing the ongoing physician shortage and I just wanted you to elaborate on that decision and just comment on how positively that may have impacted your effort to meet the needs in your community it is a big decision for a health center to be a sponsoring entity you have to meet all the accrediting requirements there's resources that go into it in the beginning it's tough because your best clinicians become your teachers which means you take them out of the direct services and now you're teaching so the investment is more medium to long term when you make that decision but my job and my board's job is to look ahead and look at what's coming at us and the shortage was very real then it's even more so now so the teaching health center program is a huge investment in our future and our current and into our future and we're seeing the paybacks now would you just address how your facility compares to other teaching health centers across the country and then also I'm afraid I'm gonna run out of time the importance of the five year well each Health Center has their own sort of reality that they are there they're the resources they have available to them so we're all a little different in that respect some are urban some our rural some are frontier so you know we're very rural and hence I think we have a few more challenges and we're starting to get our hands around we're not having the same exact retention rates as some of the city programs but we're getting there so I'm really excited about that and I'm sorry the second question was well I the importance of five-year reauthorization we have to we commit three years to every class we have they have to know when we're recruiting I can't have a medical student say to me are you gonna be around in two years if this program is going away that's not a great recruitment tool into our program we need to know so we have to have certainty a two-year reauthorization for a three-year program just doesn't make sense doesn't thank you okay I appreciate the chairwoman for allowing me to wave on today

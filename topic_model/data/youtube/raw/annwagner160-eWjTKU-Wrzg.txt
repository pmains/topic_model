I think I think our chair of our conference Liz Cheney I stand before you today as a representative of Missouri second congressional district as a congressman but also as a mother of three and a grandmother of a one-year-old baby isabella murray and i'm here to speak on behalf of the babies who survived abortions and are in fact born alive our Constitution clearly states that all persons born in the country are entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and equal protection under the law our founding fathers did not put age limits on who is entitled to life but over the past month I've been astounded to watch radical legislators up and our Constitution and argue that babies who survived abortions should not be given the same level of medical care that other newborn babies are given New York legislature legislators repealed a law mandating medical care for any baby born alive during an abortion a law proposed in Virginia would allow abortions up to the very moment of full delivery Congress must act to protect the babies who cannot protect themselves and this week I have introduced the born alive abortion survivors Protection Act we're calling it the born alive act this is HR 962 which merely ensures that that babies who survived abortions receive immediate life-saving care just as any other baby would the bill would require health care providers to exercise skill care and diligence to preserve the lives and health of these children and then immediately transport and admit them to the hospital the born alive Act is not radical legislation it just makes certain that America's children receive appropriate medical care upon their birth we can we should all be able to come together and to agree that if a child is born alive then every effort should be made to protect his or her precious life this is why I'm joining forces with with our leadership team here and my good friend and colleague with Scalise who is filing a discharge petition to bring the born alive act straight to the floor I'm pleased the president defended the dignity of these babies during the State of the Union last night and we will work with the administration and the Senate and our colleagues here in the house on both sides of the aisle to ensure that no newborn baby is denied health care in the United States of America this is the simplest decision you will ever make either you support babies being denied life-saving health care after they're born or you don't simple as that I thank thank you I yield time now to my good friend the whip Steve Scalise

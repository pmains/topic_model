I do want to go to the Patriot mobile newsmaker line though a good friend of this program Great American Patriot our good friend Congressman Barry Loudermilk Congressman hope you're doing well today oh I'm doing pretty good Todd other than uh pretty heavy rain shower here in Georgia but other than that we're doing pretty good yeah we're we're building arcs here in Memphis so we haven't seen the sun in a good week so uh uh my goodness Congressman we appreciate you coming on the on the phone uh on the phone line with us today a lot happening first I would love to get your response your reaction uh to Brittany Greiner being released and really traded for a man who is a very dangerous person who could end up killing Americans yeah it's it's you know I'm happy that we were able to get an American back but I I can't help but imagine that Ronald Reagan or Donald Trump would have agreed to that level of exchange I mean you have to look at what is it the best interest of America and it's you know it's a really tough call when you have an American citizen who appears it was being imprisoned for political reasons you know but at the same time what was the offense that they were being held for and I just feel like if we have somebody who was strong in the white house um if a deal was going to be made it would have been made on different terms NBC news reporting and and this is a very bizarre thing that's happened but NBC News within the past a little while uh reported that the U.S government had sought to have both Greiner and Whelan released as part of a swap with the Kremlin so we would have swapped those two for Victor bout but a U.S official said Russia had treated Whelan differently because he is an accused spy and the Kremlin gave the White House the choice of either Griner or Whelan or none that report after it was published was amended and all of that was removed but I suspect that the original story is the truth here Congressman uh what is your reaction if in fact the White House was given a choice here if if that is true then that is another area that I think there needs to be Congressional investigation into um first of all weyland's been in there much longer on trumped-up charges uh of spying you know veteran there has to be prioritization when this happened and if if that story is true which I'm kind of with you I'm skeptical right now a story comes out and it's suppressed with what all is going on in mainstream media right now I think this is something that we definitely need to dive into we need to look into deeply and then hold the the White House accountable if this is true please you have to give us the reason why that decision was made uh I think that uh I can't express the thoughts I'm having because this is the first I've heard of that uh traveling yesterday uh that that that could have been given the option and I would have definitely made a totally different decision uh if that was given but also it also tells you is there not room for negotiation for both there because uh you're going to let someone who is definitely evil go back to Russia you better get something really big for that big time I think you could have gotten both I think you're right uh Congressman Barry Loudermilk from Georgia's 11th congressional district uh Congressman another big story happening yesterday 39 Republicans joined with Democrats in the house to pass the disrespect for Marriage Act were you surprised to see so many of your Republican colleagues turning their back on people of faith I really was surprised uh we had fewer vote for it this time than last time um but there what surprised me about it is because there's there's some I look at the list they've been uh openly that they were a pro uh gay or they have family members that are and and so some that surprised me but what did surprise me is that we didn't all hold together because of the lack of protections for religious liberty in that bill they were inadequate they were so narrowly focused that unless you are an organized Church you have no religious protections if you are a Christian business owner and you want to hold to your convictions uh the protection is not there and so uh there were there were some that have voted for this when it first passed the house that did not vote for it this time and it was because of the lack of religious liberty protection and so I was very shocked and very surprised that we had 39 uh of our folks vote for this uh with without protection for uh conscience for religious liberty and that's and that's my that was my argument we've been making this on the program uh for for quite a while now this is really not about gay marriage the Supreme Court settled that issue this is about protecting religious liberty and the fact that chip Royce Amendment and Mike Lee's amendment in the house and the Senate respect respectively were rejected that tells me that ultimately this is not about gay marriage this is about finding a way to shut down and silence the churches and the Christian Ministries in America that that's what concerned be here uh you and I both I mean I'm I'm one of these and I may be in the minority out there but I don't think government should be involved in marriage period this is totally a it's a it's a Biblical institution it should be left for the church but we are in a position to where the government has inserted itself but that should be a state issue not a federal issue and if you're going to do this then you have to protect constitutional rights which to the freedom of religion the freedom of speech uh your freedom to engage in Commerce are all constitutionally protected rights marriage does not rise to that level right so uh this is the argument I have we're sworn as members of Congress to uphold the Constitution regardless of what our personal preference is and to me this was a constitutional issue that anyone who has taken an oath of office of the Constitution should have voted against that bill Congressman uh I'm curious uh we're going to have Andy Biggs on uh in just a little while and uh the topic of speakership and leadership in the House of Representatives uh Scott Perry chairman of the House Freedom caucus says they they do not have the votes uh McCarthy does not have the votes to be speaker of the house where are you falling out on all of this well this is we're in a very interesting time right now because uh you know conservatives even the freedom caucus is split on this I've been supporting Uh Kevin as speaker and I will vote for him on the floor and uh people are looking at it from a different angle um and it may be you know personal interaction that they've had in the past um and Andy Scott Perry they're all good close friends of mine uh and uh we differ on this I mean Marjorie Taylor green she's supporting uh Tevin for speaker this is one of those that you're never going when someone who is in the same conservative Arena I am but to the level of conservatism that I hold is likely not going to get elected speaker because quite frankly the moderates within our conference they're not going to vote for them when I look at Kevin uh because I've been serving with him for eight years now he is the most conservative of any of the Republican speakers that we have but what I see in Kevin is he has opened up to the conservatives in Congress more than any of the other speakers have he has gone out and put conservatives into positions of leadership uh like Jim Jordan on Judiciary Mark Meadows before he went to the White House he was the ranking Republican on government oversight and so it isn't always to me just what are the conservative uh you know how does the person rank up on conservative values to me but are they open to give me and my voice a seat at the table to actually influence uh legislation to influence what's going forward and I feel like Kevin has done that we're never going to find the perfect candidate and we're looking at you know 86 percent of the conference in our vote has uh said would like to see Kevin but you know we'll see where it goes from here like I said uh most of those folks are they're good friends of mine and we work very closely together but this is one of those that I think we really need to work out before we get to the floor on January 3rd because the last thing we want is the scenario to wear a very moderate uh ends up as a speaker or worst case uh uh that Democrats could finagle themselves into at least it would be temporary I hope that a Democrat could slip in and become speaker with a with a slim Republican majority well we know that Scott Perry's put out a list of Demands which that look very um you know I think those are good solid demands uh and uh let's see let's see how the negotiations it's all about negotiation at this point and we'll see how that works out Congressman we got to leave it there we are late for a break but we really do appreciate your time today and hope you and the the family have a great merry Christmas and Todd I hope you have a merry Christmas as well and uh Hey folks let's just keep praying for this country and do everything we can to take

TEXAS LAW THAT BANS MOST ABORTIONS, JOINING US NOW TO TALK MORE ABOUT THIS INDIANA CONGRESSWOMAN JACKIE WILL OR SKI CONGRESSWOMAN SO NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN. GOOD MORNING. Q. GOOD MORNING. THIS BILL IT HAS A UNSURE FATE IN THE SENATE BUT IT IS EXPECTED TO PASS MOSTLY SYMBOLICALLY IN THE HOUSE TODAY. CONGRESSWOMAN WHY IS THIS BILL SO IMPORTANT? HERE'S THE THING. THIS IS AN ABORTION ON DEMAND BILL FOR ANY REASON, ANY TIME UP INTO BIRTH. THIS IS SUCH AN EXTREME BILL. AND YOU KNOW WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING IS THE LIBERALS IN THIS CONGRESS LOVE TO CALL PRO LIFE AMERICANS AND BECAUSE OF OUR CONVICTIONS, THEY CALL US EXTREME. BUT ROB, THIS IS AN EXTREME BILL FOR AN EXTREME SMALL AMOUNT OF PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. YOU KNOW, I'VE SEEN WHAT EXTREME LOOKS LIKE WHEN IT COMES TO ABORTION. IT'S CRUEL AND YOU KNOW, JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, AN INDIANA ABORTIONIST DR ORIC KLOPFER DYING, HIS FAMILY FOUND THE MEDICALLY PRESERVED REMAINS OF 2400 CHILDREN IN HIS GARAGE. THIS GUY WAS A MONSTER. IT LEFT A LEGACY OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION. HE REPRESENTS THE CULTURE OF ABORTION. AND YOU KNOW THAT MADE NATIONAL NEWS CAMERA SCANNING 2400 LITTLE BOTTLES DRAWERS ON HIS SHOWS WITH LITTLE HOLE BABIES IN THEM. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. DEMOCRATS WANT THIS IN AN EXTREME MEASURE, AND I CAN TELL YOU I'M GOING TO BE SPEAKING ON THE FLOOR AS WELL TODAY TO MAKE SURE THAT I CAST A NO TO EXTREME UNLIMITED ABORTIONS AND HOPEFULLY BRING SOME OF MY DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES ALONG. DO YOU PLAN TO SHARE THAT STORY ON THE HOUSE FLOOR TODAY? YOU BET I DO, BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT WE CHANGE. WHEN I WAS IN INDIANA HOUSE. WE CHASED THIS DOCTOR FOR 10 YEARS IN THE STATE OF INDIANA. HE LITERALLY HAD A ROUTE HE LIVED IN CHICAGO PERFORMED ABORTIONS THERE AND HE CONTINUED THROUGH IN MY DISTRICT AT THE TIME OF SOUTH BEND PERFORMED THOUSANDS OF ABORTIONS IN THE STATE OF INDIANA. AND WHEN THOSE JARS WITH THOSE BABIES WERE UNVEILED TO THE COUNTRY, TRYING TO MATCH WHO THOSE MOTHERS WERE, AND HOW DO I IDENTIFY THOSE REMAINS? IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE. BECAUSE UNLIMITED ABORTION PAID FOR BY TAXPAYERS IS EXTREME. IT'S CRUEL. IT'S NOT WHERE THE AMERICAN VOTERS ARE. AND YOU KNOW, I THINK IT WILL PASS THE HOUSE TODAY BECAUSE PELOSI LEADS US EXTREMELY LEFT AGENDA, BUT I PRAY AND I KNOW A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL STOP IN THE SENATE. IT SHOULD NEVER PASS THE HOUSE. THAT IS, UH,

Mr Speaker I rise today because the United States Senate is failing to serve the American people this week Senate Republicans announced their plan to simply ignore President Obama's nominee to the Supreme Court no hearings no votes no chance for the public to witness an open and honest debate over the future of the court this is what the world's greatest deliberative body looks like under Republican control refusing to fill the vacancy until the next election disregards the will of the American people who elected president Obama twice despite Republicans making it their primary mission to deny him a second term it also reflects a dramatic change of heart from Senator Grassley who once said a nominee should be considered regardless of election politics this is hypocrisy plain and simple I accept that Senate Republicans have the constitutional authority to reject the president's nominee but I do not accept the refusal to even consider that nominee and the American people shouldn't accept it either I yield back mr.

i had hoped to move to strike the last word to comment on the manager's amendment is recognized for five minutes i i wanted to talk about the amendment uh in its entirety because i think it's important to have an overview of the manager's amendment itself we will discuss various elements through the amendment process but i think from cyber security to technical experts the bill's impact on the security of the internet and the integrity of the basic infrastructure of the internet is very much at risk we've heard from civil libertarians about the bill's inconsistencies with the constitutional rights to free speech and due process and we're mindful that today is the birthday of the first amendment uh we've heard from entrepreneurs and venture capitalists about how the bill could stymie online innovation from human rights and religious freedom advocates about how the bill could make it impossible for the united states to stem the tide of internet censorship around the world i think it's important to think and contemplate what is at stake here and what we are doing here because i do think it's historic some have said that the internet is lawless the internet is not lawless conduct on the internet can break the law and can be punished just as in the physical world but up to this point our government has always gone after the criminality on the internet at each end of the in the network it shut down the illegal conduct at its source it's punished internet users for what they use the internet for but it's never tried to use the communication network itself to make illegal conduct impossible if this bill passes with the mandate for domain name and other internet filtering intact i think it will be historic and not in a good way i don't think they'll be going back i think once the government has a taste of this power the temptation to exert an ever greater amount of control over the internet through filtering technology will be irresistible the u s government has never tried to monitor mail sent through office to prevent some category of illegal content from ever being sent we've never tried to filter the telephone networks to block illegal content on the uh on the telephone network and yet that is precisely what this legislation would do relative to the internet there's nothing wrong with shutting down illegal conduct at its source or investigating and punishing illegal conduct when it happens online but i think there is something fundamentally wrong with the checkpoints and communications networks in an attempt to prevent illegal communications from every ever being transmitted in the first place right now there's a struggle going on foreign technology that this bill encourages to censor the internet these same governments are striving to gain control of the internet's basic infrastructure through authority asserted by the united nations and the international telecommunications union if this bill passes i believe it will aid this push for more direct government control and i think it's going to be even harder for the united states to resist it as secretary of state hillary clinton put it just last month and i quote barriers around national internets would change the landscape landscape of cyberspace in this scenario the internet would contain people in a series of digital bubbles rather than connecting them in a global network but that's precisely the approach embraced by this spill i think people get caught up in the details of the bill that's entirely appropriate that's what markups are for but as we consider this legislation i hope that we will step back and contemplate the larger ramifications for what we are doing here uh today i would also note that we've seen editorials in most of the major newspapers of the united states including the wall street journal the new york times and the la times in opposition to this bill yesterday a major union of creative professionals the writers guild of america west expressed serious concerns about this bill the washington post published an online article noting opposition to sopa from many journalists and just yesterday the american newspaper editors association sent a letter to the committee opposing the bill and the manager's amendment universities have come out in opposition to the manager's amendment and i'm sure we'll have a debate about the major cyber security concerns but i would like to submit to the record uh the column written by stuart baker the former assistant secretary for policy at dhs and the former general counsel at the nsa opposing the manager's amendment and indicating that it would still do great damage to internet security by putting obstacles in the way of dns sec the protocol being designed to limit internet crime so bottom line we do need copyright enforcement but there's a better way to do it without the collateral damage to cyber security innovation commerce and the first amendment that the manager's amendment poses and i thank the chairman for recognizing me okay without objection

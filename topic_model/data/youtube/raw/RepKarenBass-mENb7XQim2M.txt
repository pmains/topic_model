uh congresswoman there's more than one hearing as i mentioned what do you see as the purpose and the accomplishments thus far of this set of investigative hearings well first of all in terms of our subcommittee hearing today one of the goals is is to begin to entertain legislation to address domestic terrorism i am concerned about that however because i think with the best of all intentions i am concerned that we pass laws on domestic terrorism and then they get enforced on african-american activists just like over the last few years we were fighting the fbi's categorization of uh black identity extremists which i don't even believe exist but what you saw in the hearing though is that you saw my colleagues on the other side of the aisle just outright lie how you could make a comparison to rioting to the attempted overthrow of the government is just absolutely no comparison and so because for the last four years we had a liar in chief who has essentially normalized lying i'm now seeing my republican colleagues essentially adopt that behavior as well they always did to a little extent but now the wholesale mischaracterization of what happened on january 6 is extremely dangerous because in the last four years white supremacist organizations have mushroomed and if we don't get a handle on it i agree with malcolm nance more to come is going to be much worse yeah and bringing gene in we're discussing facts that have been under assault and hate uh and when you have those two things together it's a real problem uh john stewart used to joke about reality having a well-known liberal bias uh and there are larger pockets of the country that when they hear certain facts like what i just mentioned officials saying what the threat is right there was a time when there was a a larger foreign uh threat of uh related to isis and al-qaeda terrorists that was a larger threat but right now they hear that oh white supremacists and other white hate groups are the threat and they feel wrongly like that's a bias when indeed it's the reality and for that point gene in your analysis uh we did want to show something we've put together briefly that will be familiar to the congresswoman as well which is every living fbi director speaking to this point uh regardless of party take a look much of our history is not pretty law enforcement enforce the status quo a status quo that was often brutally unfair to disfavored groups domestic terrorism as almost as important an issue as the international terrorism whether it be white supremacists militia extremists a sovereign citizen extremists a huge chunk of those domestic terrorism investigations involve racially motivated violent extremists fueled by some kind of white supremacy and i would say that the most lethal activity over the last few years has been committed by those type of attackers gene a gene all violent hate is wrong but there are fbi directors emphasizing the larger problem with violent hate in the united states today is from white thugs killers terrorists yeah that's just a fact and and but you see the developing uh republican narrative i mean this i know you'll be shocked at this but they seem to be ready to try to gaslight the nation uh into believing that uh what happened at the capitol was was was actually equivalent to what happened last summer and nothing all that special they seem to want to ignore the fact that it was in fact um you know in in many ways an attempted coup it was an attempt to overthrow the government to stop the government's functioning and the and the orderly transfer of power it's a very serious thing they're ignoring the fact that these people came prepared for war prepared for combat and battle and that they are organized in groups that have been around for a long time and as as merrick garland said it is hearing you know you can draw the line straight back from what happened to the capitol to the oklahoma city bombing and you could draw the line right back from there to the you know to the to the birth of the ku klux klan and uh after reconstruction i mean you it is it's there it's happening it's the truth uh but they're gonna try to to obscure the truth uh with the fog of lies yeah and congresswoman there are surely leaders in government yourself uh maxine waters who we've discussed this with before who've been sounding the alarm about many of these issues uh including the racial disparities for a long time uh we also have covered the fact that other leaders not exclusively but often black leaders in america uh have been warning about this outside of politics for a long time and recounting stories and documenting what's happening in their community uh dave chappelle uh is known to many for many things but he's got a brand new uh series that i guess you could call the comedy piece but it's boy is it serious at times i want to play a little bit of it for your reaction because it's his reaction his take on january 6th here it is i'm from washington dc a lot of my friends growing up are capitol hill police officers i said what did you do that day what did we do we were kicking crackers down the steps like mother 300 that carried a confederate flag to the rotunda the confederate army didn't even do that he went very far he's a washingtonian he's upset uh to the degree that some of it we of course can't air on a family broadcast but yet that that raw emotion is what we heard from other officers and other people around the country i'm just curious uh your reaction well absolutely the same i mean the raw emotion the anger the idea that this would actually take place and people were allowed to run amok here and we were not prepared and the idea that the fbi sent notification but the capitol police didn't get it well why the heck didn't they pick up the phone when someone didn't respond to their email i mean it is just absolutely inexcusable i know that malcolm nance said that this was known for a long time as a matter of fact he was writing a book and he waited until after january 6 to finish the book because he was waiting to see what was going to happen so this was widely known it's just inexcusable and if you want to talk about white racial terror you have to go back many many many years as a matter of fact a couple of hundred years so this kind of white supremacist behavior is nothing new in our communities and what i am hoping now since it was on the display for the world to see is that maybe we will finally begin to address this problem

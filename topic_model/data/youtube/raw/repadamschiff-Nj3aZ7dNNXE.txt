putin so let's bring in the chair of the house intel committee also previously served on the foreign affairs committee congressman adam schiff joining us from washington d.c congressman welcome back to sunday morning matters and i want to begin with these harsh financial sanctions it doesn't seem like they're happening fast enough to [ __ ] putin's military resources why wouldn't these sanctions happen before instead of using just threats well the problem with uh imposing the sanctions even before putin has ordered troops into ukraine is then there's little disincentive uh to go forward with an invasion because then it concludes well being sanctioned anyway uh i might as well go forward with it uh so i think it made sense to to hold off until uh we saw whether he was going to do it and when he did i have to say both united states our european allies and others moved very quickly and gathered together in support of sanctions many people myself included thought were not possible to kick a lot of the russian banks off the swift financial system which really isolates the russian economy to stop the nordstrom pipeline even the swiss to use their banking system to sanction russia who would have thought the swiss banks would would help in this effort it came together very quickly but it didn't come together after the invasion you know i feel like we're in economic warfare maybe you can clear some of that up for me because you know russia still has handcuffs on the u.s when it comes to oil i know congress along with your republican friends now wanting to cut off russia's oil supply can u.s oil companies keep up with the demand here in the states especially california where we see big gas prices skyrocketing you know i think a lot of our gas and oil production is at capacity we have been exploring for example with the secretary of energy whether we can uh supply more liquefied natural gas to ukraine to europe to take some of the pressure off europe uh and i think we're pretty close to capacity um but uh but the reason why our sanctions are taking such a bite of the russian economy is they are going after the the ability of russian banks to operate in the world market we're going after the russian sovereign wealth fund we're going after the the wealth of oligarchs and putin himself we can still go after and i think we should their oil and gas exports to the united states uh there's no no reason we should in my view be uh supplying russian coffers with any u.s resources while we're sanctioning them that's a further step we could take and and i'd like to see a statement is this a wake-up call for the united states to be energy independent i think it is a wake-up call not only to be energy independent but to be to take a lot of the money out of oil and gas um you know if we can develop renewable sources of energy that strips russia of a lot of its oil wealth it strips saudi arabia a lot of its oil wealth a lot of these nations which frankly are not doing uh much for the world and often doing great harm couldn't do it without the enormous resources they get uh from a fossil fuel-based economy so i think moving us away generally from that reliance essentially strips the wealth out of these autocratic regimes do you think putin is making a nazi-like move when it comes to this invasion of democracy i think that he is an autocrat like the nazis were i think he is also obviously has territorial ambitions the way the nazis did but frankly the way that the czars did the way that peter the great did i think part of what's motivating putin is uh the feeling that he wants to be another peter the great that what made him great was his territorial ambition but i think putin has seriously miscalculated uh he he may have felt ukrainians would welcome russian troops with open arms they're not getting open arms and a lot of russians are already going home and body bags and i also think he thought that the us and nato and europe were divided and would never get their act together on sanctions but we did with record speed um so i think there have been some serious miscalculations on his part you know republicans say the afghan exit of our troops opened the door for this attack for putin showing that biden was weak that's what they say what do you say i i think that's a completely bogus argument uh as if the the war in afghanistan or leaving it or how we left it had an influence on whether putin would invade russia putin would invade ukraine but i'll tell you what i think did have an influence on putin's view about what he could get away with in ukraine and it was the former president donald trump and his willingness to withhold military aid from ukraine in order to try to essentially extort president zielinski into smearing his opponent that told that told putin the us doesn't really care anything about ukraine uh that would we would withhold military aid from ukraine uh and the fact that donald trump is calling putin a genius even now i think putin believes well you know america's divided he has a lot of support in the republican party and i think that has been the encouragement not anything to do with afghanistan i want to get to the state of the union your republican colleague house minority leader kevin mccarthy said in their response to biden's speech it was out of touch he painted a rosy picture while failing to address the inflation again gas prices and violent crime the water crisis in the central valley what is your response to maybe some of those things that biden is said by the republicans that he didn't address in the speech i i think kevin mccarthy must not have been paying attention or he wrote his rebuttal before he listened to the speech the president in addition to obviously addressing the war in ukraine talked extensively about what we need to do to get our economy fully back in swing he talked about what we need to do to conquer the pandemic which has had such a brutal impact on our way of life but also the economy and he laid out the steps we need to take to put that behind us and get americans back to work but he also laid out what he's doing to do to address supply chain problems to address uh inflation uh the fact that he is supporting legislation we passed in the house without a single republican vote or uh that is to help america compete bring those jobs back home make things in america once again uh or if it got a vote maybe it got one or two votes but uh those are steps that we can take to address inflation here at home now inflation is a golden problem but he clearly laid out his plan to move forward in getting people back to work and making sure their dollar goes farther so i think mccarthy just wasn't paying much attention congressman adam schiff in washington d.c thank you so much be well thank you thank you

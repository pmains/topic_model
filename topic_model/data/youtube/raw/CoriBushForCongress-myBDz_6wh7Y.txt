We're about $8,000 from our goal, so I'm
asking you if you would be willing to help us today. This is the kind of work that we're doing. We're out in the community, we're with people, so I need you to help me to keep this going. Let's affect the community now and
directly. I need your help go to www.coribush.org it's the c-o-r-i b-u
-s-h and make your best donation. Thank you for the three dollars. Thank you for the ten
dollars. But I'm asking you if you would sacrifice a little bit more for us
because we're gonna, I'm going to bring in less, and so I'm asking you to help me to make up that difference, so if you can do 50 today if you leave a
hundred today if somebody can max out today thank you so much.
Help us get to our goal. I love you, bye bye.

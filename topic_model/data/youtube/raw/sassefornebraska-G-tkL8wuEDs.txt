well usually a senators first speech is not very newsworthy but freshman senator Ben Sasse waited an entire year before speaking on the Senate floor when he finally did the Republican gave his colleagues a healthy dose of truth the people despise us all and why is this because we're not doing our job there are good and bad reasons to be unpopular a good reason would be to suffer for waging an honorable fight for the long term that has near term political downsides like telling seniors the truth that the amount they've paid in for Social Security and Medicare is far far less than they think and far far less than they're currently receiving the real reason the political class is unpopular is not because of our relentless truth-telling but because of politicians habit of regularize pandering to those who most easily already agree with us guess what normal people don't talk like this they don't like that we do and more important than whether or not they like us trust their government because we do it's weird because one on one when the cameras are off hardly anyone around here really thinks that senators from the other party are evil or stupid or bribed while I'm in favor of more civility my actual call here is for more substance this is not a call for less fighting this is a call for more meaningful fighting a six year term is a terrible thing to waste a two-year term requires hamsterwheel frenzy our jobs do not I think we can do better and I pledge to work with all of those who want to figure out how Thank You mr. president wasn't what wrote her first speech that was worth a year of waiting that was really amazing and impressive very impressed

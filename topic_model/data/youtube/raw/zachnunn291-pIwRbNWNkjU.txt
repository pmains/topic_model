and that is there further discussion on Senate file 516 as amended the chair recognizes the senator from Polk senator nunn Thank You mr. president and thank you to the members of the body for the fulsome discussion on this bill today specifically Thank You senator Garrett for your years of articulating this and prioritizing why a discussion needs to be had at the state level on what we're doing to protect individuals and most importantly to hold bad actors accountable my brief time here in the state legislature I've been proud to work on bipartisan issues led by a gentleman named senator Kinney who we should be spending time tonight watching some of the amazing actions that he's taken to combat human trafficking right here in our state hopefully we get the DVD recording of that when we look at trafficking of human persons that takes on many forms and one of the ways that happens is right here in Iowa we see thousands tens of thousands of individuals who are brought into the state and exploited for their labor in our communities when these individuals get hurt on the job as Senator Bolton highlighted they don't have the opportunity to go forward and ask for assistance they're simply kicked to the curb these individuals come to our state and are brought in whether it be by a John four sexual trafficking whether it be by a coyote across the border illegal or whether it be by an unscrupulous employer here who uses their cheap labor to exploit them an unfair market advantage for their own game at their expense all of these things are wrong and we at the state level should be ready to stand up and oppose this when we look at what we can do for everyday Iowans we have a principle of fairness across the board and so when an employer goes forward and says hey there's somebody who's come to our state legally has gone through the process who's immigrated who wants to be an active participant and a good laborer they get cut in line by a bad employer who goes out of their way to say nope I can hire this guy cheaper and when I'm done with it I'll throw them out what senator Garrett's bill does is it makes sure that all employers are held accountable and those individuals who are seeking the opportunity to work and become part of Iowa as Iowans have that ability so in Senator Holmes words and committee we should be holding our federal representatives feet to the fire we should also hold our own feet to the fire to make sure that we're accountable at the state level let's not exploit those who would serve let's recognize those who want to work and let's help those who want to come to this country and work legally have a pathway to that let's also stop the most explicit exploitation of individuals whether it be sexual labour or trafficking we stopped right here in our state this is a good bill this is what it does Thank You Senator Garrett and I'm proud to be a co-sponsor the chair recognizes

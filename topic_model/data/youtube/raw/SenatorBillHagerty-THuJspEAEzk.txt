this bill allows unlimited pay by the hour political operatives to collect and turn in an unlimited number about of ballots in unmanned drop boxes 24 7 for weeks preceding an election my amendment strikes the provision that requires states to allow unlimited ballot harvesters that are paid or that are operatives of a political campaign a political party or political committee this really becomes all about funding payrolls and creating the largest possible machine of ballot harvesters ballot harvesters who will go out and identify favorable voters and mass gather those votes door to door in densely populated areas nursing homes you can imagine they can do this for weeks preceding the election they do this not by earning the support of voters by communicating positions on key issues they do this by having a ground game that can attack on the ground on the field to harvest these ballots you know in 2018 in north carolina a congressional election was overturned for using just this type of scheme yet here we are today trying to pass this into law what we're talking about a system in which elections are all about mass harvesting of ballots by people who have a strongly vested interest in the outcome it's obviously susceptible to fraud and to corruption would there be help completing these ballots would all ballots be turned in these are very serious questions questions that would destroy confidence of americans in our system i encourage you to support my amendment thank you would anyone like to speak on the amendment senator king senator your amendment refers to page and and lines i'm not sure the pages are the same in the amendment can you give me a section that it amends they may be it may be the same i'm not sure just get cut off here i just want to find them page 203 lines 13 through 16. okay let me yeah see the the i'm working off the manager's amendment that's that that's different does somebody know the section we're talking about here just a second center king he's not looking at the question is hagerty 14 what section it amends right page 203 well i i think all of our amendments are based on the base bill which is what yeah which is what the markup was supposed to be on yeah i guess if you could pull up s1 not the substitute i've got it thank you okay okay okay um while angus is senator king is looking at that i'll just respond here i know a lot of my republican colleagues refer to the practice of helping voters returning their ballots as harvesting but helping voters to return their ballots it to me having seen seniors in assisted livings and the like people with disabilities is a form of civic participation in which americans help each other exercise the right to vote and make their voices heard this amendment would restrict who can help voters return a completed sealed ballot prohibiting anyone who has worked for or even volunteered on a political campaign in the past year it also prevents anyone paid to perform ballot collection and allow states to limit the number of ballots a person can return but 36 states about 70 percent of the states already allow someone other than a voter to return a ballot including states like north dakota and montana and only 10 of the states limit in any way who can help a voter return a ballot the for the people act would ensure that voters can designate someone to return their ballots after they're completed and sealed prevent states from limiting how many ballots a person can return and prevent anyone from receiving compensation based on the number of ballots returned ballot collection is essential for one voters with disabilities and elderly voters including those in assisted living who may face obstacles to delivering their ballot i think everyone knows someone like this and not all these individuals will have certified caregivers even though they may require assistance with returning their ballot native american voters residing on reservations who have limited mail access and may be far away from polling locations post offices or election offices many of us know the long distances that many of these voters have to travel communities of color who may rely on community organizations to help them return their ballots in 2020 the ninth circuit a court of appeals struck down arizona's ban on third party ballot return holding that it was enacted with discriminatory intent and had a discriminatory impact on minority populations in violation of section 2 of the voting rights act and the 15th amendment i would note my colleagues usually point to voter fraud as we've already discussed several times this is exceedingly rare the one i know one example that is used there was an immediate prosecution involving a republican candidate and i just don't think that that should be the reason that we would deny senior citizens who are in assisted living or people with disabilities the ability to have someone bring their votes in as is happening right now in 36 states madam chair this bill this amendment does not deny that right in fact family members caregivers certainly can help and assist and states are addressing this on their own this should not be about opening the floodgates for paid operatives for campaign workers to go into these facilities and harvest ballots states are addressing this on a case-by-case basis that's a far better venue for this to happen i'm sure senator padilla if i may like i uh senator hagrid i appreciate your concern uh i think the amendment is off base as as we are deliberating here it's multiple important perspectives we're reminded of the law we're reminded of the perspectives of elections administrators candidates poll workers etc but let's not forget the most important perspective of all and that is of the voter but i think we all learned in high school government class that our democracy works best when as many eligible people participate so our job is how do we facilitate that maintaining the security integrity of our elections of course but maximizing access to the ballot and participation right that's the bounce we're trying to strike and so the reason i remind us of that you know the this term ballot harvesting we know is charged here's what's really happening what options do voters have to be able to cast their ballot increasingly in many states are adopting the best proven best practices yes for many years people showed up on election day and voted it's even more convenient when you have multiple days during which you can vote in person once upon a time it was excuse needed in many states now no excuse needed to be able to vote by mail and return your ballot by mail some states offer return postage paid for that ballot all these things that we can do to increase access to participation on with the proper protections to maintain the security and integrity of the election in california we did them all right so you can vote early in person you have flexibility of where you can go vote uh you can vote by mail if after all that you can even deliver your ballot to a dropbox if you weren't sure the post office would get your ballot back on time if after all that an individual voter chose to have someone assist them in returning their ballot should that not be the prerogative of the voter to decide for themselves who they trust to help return the ballot maybe it is a family member maybe it's a neighbor what if you live alone you know as long as the voter is empowered to decide for themselves most states that allow for this do have a requirement as you do in california that the person assisting the voter also has to sign the envelope of that return vote by mail ballot along with the relationship to the voter is it a friend is the neighbor is it a a co-worker and whoever it is so this collection about and assisting voters in returning about if that is their choice is something that needs to be protected in my opinion because that's how we should empower voters and help them participate and then senator king senator the california law sounds like you've done specific things to try to ensure that that person that's given the ballot to transmit or to drop in the mail or whatever is identified does this bill do anything similar to that well when there's limitations on who the voter can choose to help them return their ballot then that's imposing on the voter in my opinion but in california do you impose on the voter when you make the no in california we actually empower the voter to decide for themselves if they choose that if they decide they need assistance in returning their ballot they choose for themselves who they trust to help them return their ballot and didn't you didn't you say that person has to be identified as part of the process yes but this bill doesn't require that kind of identification correct the uh but when you're putting limitations on who it is that can assist the voter in returning their ballot now what i'm what i'm asking maybe i'm not being clear here this doesn't do anything like the california law that says a person that is given that ballot has to identify who they are correct but the uh author of the amendment is suggesting that what we don't want campaign volunteers assisting voters and returning their ballot what i'm suggesting is let the voter decide for themselves who they choose and who they trust to help them return their ballot and senator klobuchar when you mentioned 37 states allowed some kind of ballot collection was minnesota one of those um i will have to check but i just whether we do it or not um i well i i did check okay that's i senator blent the point is i i our state has the highest voter turnout in the country well i love our voting laws there's always ways to make things better so i don't have a problem with it i don't think we do have it well i'm good it doesn't i don't have a problem with it i'm going to have an amendment later that limits the pound picking up and returning ballots to three ballots which would solve many of the concerns of somebody that has to have someone do that for them and that would happen to be the minnesota law is a maximum of three ballots could be picked up by any individual and i'd be glad to see the california provision also that would that person would have to indicate somewhere on that ballot who they were that picked up the ballot but that's not my amendment my amendment would just limit it to three though i intend to support senator hagerty's amendment senator king senator hagerty i i understand your amendment and i think the the bill the the uh the bill attempts to deal with the issue that you're talking about by clearly saying you can't pay somebody by the ballot brought in that's an invitation uh uh to to abuse your amendment though says you can't they can't be anybody employed by or volunteer for a political campaign political committee or similar organization during the one-year period ending on the date of the designation my problem is the word volunteered would you consider uh accepting a second-degree amendment that simply said the ballot has not been employed by a political campaign political committee and strike the word or volunteer respectfully um i've just come off of a campaign and our job was to build the biggest field of volunteers that we possibly could we managed those with paid campaign leadership and this is opening the floodgate senator to create a ground game that's all about ballot harvesting i appreciate the senator from california's deep experience and perspective on this but my concern has to do with security we talk about access i'm not against access i want people to be able to vote but this concerns me greatly because i know the energy that goes into a campaign and i know what will happen this will translate into a ground game about ballot harvesting about hitting the most densely populated areas what type of help will these voters receive as i read your amendment you can still have a person bring in an unlimited number of ballots as long as they're not employed by or volunteering in the campaign right that's if a person is a family member a person is a caregiver that sort of thing that would be fine but not a campaign operative whether they're employed by the hour which they can be paid by the hour as a matter of clarity whether they're paid by the by the unit or by the hour they're still being paid or as i mentioned you can build a whole team of volunteers that report to paid operatives i also want to note that nothing in this bill would stop california from requiring that the name that the idb now it's it's it there's no language that would stop that from happening or any other state and i'll reiterate madam chair you want to take the pressure off ballot collection efforts let more people vote by mail provide multiple days of voting in person provide flexibility of when where and how to vote and people would be less reliant on needing assistance in returning their ballot okay so senator merkley uh thank you madam chair the integrity of the ballot is is very important and that's why this bill says that if you collect the ballot it has to be sealed now in some states you have to sign your signature on the ballot across that seal which some states choose to do that some states don't those are common sense ways to make sure that what happened in north carolina doesn't happen what happened there is wasn't a problem with somebody collecting ballots and turning them in it was collecting unvoted ballots unsealed ballots voting the ballots multiple felonies every single time that was done in that operation it was a it was a felony and um and so vigorous prosecution and application of of of the law as well as simple things that states could adopt and beyond the requirement to be sealed you know it's uh in in my state because we've had vote by mail for a long time it's not unusual for groups to get together and discuss issues vote those issues and have somebody go turn in those ballots including for churches to do this i think under freedom of association that beautiful concept embedded in our constitution if a person wants to have somebody carry their ballot and drop it off with proper protections like the envelope has been sealed with a signature that matches the signature database to make sure it's secure that we shouldn't take that that fundamental right away i'm not even sure the courts would sustain this unless there was evidence that it was addressing a critical flaw and when we look at states like like oregon that have vote by mail utah that has by vote by mail we simply haven't seen this be a problem we have seen this one case in north carolina and the prosecutions followed and the re-vote occurred but the answer to those felony crimes in north carolina isn't to strip right of association away from voters who want to enable someone else to drop off their ballot i senator cruz several senators have made reference to the integrity of elections i want to commend senator hagerty for this amendment i think it's a very good amendment and i think if members of this committee are concerned about the integrity of elections you should vote in favor of it ballot harvesting is a particularly corrupt practice there is a reason that 31 states restrict or prohibit ballot harvesting experience has shown that when paid operatives for a political party go and handle the ballots of other people that it invites fraud numerous democrats on this committee and many of their spokespeople in the media say fraud never occurs well i can tell you of a case that is pending right now in the state of texas of a woman who was indicted on over 100 counts of voter fraud for working in a nursing home and collecting ballots from residents of that nursing home some of whom are alleged to be not competent to cast those ballots one of the reasons you don't want a paid operative for the dnc or rnc going to a nursing home is there some people that are no longer at a position to be able to make a choice but an unscrupulous operative can put the ballot in front of them and can have them cast the vote whichever way they're paid to have them cast the vote not only that there is a second avenue for the theft of votes which is if you have an unscrupulous operative on the payroll of a political party if you do have a resident say in that nursing home who casts a vote in a way they don't like there is nothing to prevent them from taking that vote and throwing in the trash and saying nope sorry you voted for the wrong guy so your vote will never be submitted i'm only going to submit the votes that vote for the candidate i'm favoring and i would point out that that when it comes to ballot harvesting this is not just me saying this i want to read to you a quote state and local jurisdiction should prohibit a person from handling absentee ballots other than the voter an acknowledged family member the u.s postal service or other legitimate shipper or election officials and and i want to continue to read the practice in some states of allowing candidates or party workers to pick up and deliver absentee ballots should be eliminated now based on the discussion here that was clearly the rantings of some right-wing voter suppression individual that actually is a quote from the carter baker commission chaired by democratic president jimmy carter that identified in fact let me continue the carter baker commission what they said about ballot harvesting to reduce the risk of fraud and abuse and absentee voting prohibiting third-party organizations candidates and political party activists from handling absentee ballots that's the recommendation of the carter baker commission now unless the democrats on this committee want to assert that jimmy carter is a secret undercover republican engaged in voter suppression i would suggest you should listen to that recommendation and one of the reasons why i and so many others are calling this bill the corrupt politicians act is the recommendations of the carter baker commission that concluded voter fraud is real it is a problem it has affected the outcome of elections there are a series of recommendations from the carter baker commission on how to reduce voter fraud this bill the corrupt politicians act ignores every one of them and in fact expands the practices that president jimmy carter identified as contributing to fraud if we care about the integrity of elections then we should not disregard the written recommendation of democratic president jimmy carter we should not encourage paid operatives and whether they're paid by the ballot or simply paid a salary to go in and collect ballots it is inviting fraud and and if senator hagerty's amendment is rejected that will mean this committee is looking at the recommendations of president carter and concluding we want to do the things that will increase fraud and undermine the integrity of elections i think that's a bad idea okay anyone else should we vote on the amendment

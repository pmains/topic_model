Thank You mr. Chairman I rise today in support of HR 78 the SEC regulatory Accountability Act which would improve and strengthen the SCC's rulemaking process by requiring more rigorous economic analysis what exactly does that mean well an economic analysis is quite simple frankly it's a systematic approach to determine the optimum use of scarce resources involved in comparison of two or more alternatives to achieve a specific objective under the given assumptions and constraints that's a whole lot of words and jumbled but what we need to do is make a comparison what is going to be the benefit economic analysis takes into account the opportunity costs of resources employed and attempts to measure in monetary terms the private and social costs and benefits of a project to a community an economy or to an individual it's in its simplest terms the SEC would have to determine the costs and benefits of proposed regulations as well as potential alternatives to determine a best direction for basically ensuring that the SEC is thoroughly assessing both the need for the regulation and adequately evaluating the potential consequences both intended and unintended and is there a benefit mr. speaker requiring economic analysis by federal regulators is not a partisan issue and in fact both presidents Clinton and President Obama issued executive orders requiring regulators to ensure that their rules were maximizing and achieving a net benefit HR 78 the SEC regulatory Accountability Act would ensure consistent and effective application of the FCC's economic analysis guidance by building on the bipartisan effort to strengthen economic analysis requirements as well as require a retrospective review of existing regulations for independent agencies like the SEC specifically the bill would enhance the FCC's existing economic analysis requirements by requiring the Commission to first clearly identify the nature of the problem that would be addressed before issuing a new regulation too often we're just shooting at a target that we don't even know is actually a target and to prohibit the FEC from issuing a rule when it cannot quote make a reasoned determination that benefits the intended regulation justifying the cost of the regulation end quote additionally HR 78 would require the FCC to assess the costs and the benefits of available regulatory alternatives including the alternative of not issuing a regulation and choose the approach that would maximize the net benefit the FCC must also evaluate whether a proposed regulation is inconsistent or incompatible or duplicative of other federal regulations in testimony before the capital market subcommittee last year former SEC Commissioner Dan Gallagher noted that the FCC regulatory Accountability Act would quote promote and improve Economic Analysis at the SEC and make the agency even more accountable to the in back end quote he further testified that this bill quote will help ensure the economic analysis conducted by economists is firmly entrenched in every rule making the SEC conducts under a federal securities laws recognized for 30 additional secretary mr. Chairman I commend the gentlelady from Missouri Rep Magnar for introducing this important piece of legislation which will better equip the SEC with the necessary tools to ensure that all future SEC regulations will meet these standards with the ultimate goal of achieving the FCC statutory mission of protecting investors and facilitating capital formation I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this important bill and I yield back the balance of my

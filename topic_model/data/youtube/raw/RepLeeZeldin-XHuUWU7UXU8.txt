my amendment expands on this Bill's reporting requirements regarding settlements specifically it will require a copy of the settlement agreements to be given to Congress the status of some outstanding claims and a guarantee that the settlement is in the best interest of the United States there are still too many unanswered questions about this ransom payment a 1.7 billion dollar cash payment to Iran given simultaneously and connected to the release of four American hostages this is 1.7 billion dollars that went directly towards Iran's military this is the same Iran military that not only embarrassed our ten Navy sailors with photography and videography but then gave awards to their generals and appreciation this is the same military that right now is humiliating our naval ships in international waters and threatening to shoot down our planes this is the same military responsible for killing American servicemembers the President of the United States is saying and doing nothing to prevent that instead he just agreed to pay for it my amendment ensures that Congress and the American people have clarity about any American claims which may be conceded through settlements our government enters into at the Iran us claims tribunal now some people blindly loyal to this president will say we owed the 400 million says who we know the money what about the 817 million dollars at the u.s. claimed against Iran that Iran was contesting or over the course of the past few decades Americans directly harmed by Iranian terrorism had sued Iran in US courts and one in two thousand Congress passed a law authorizing that the funds needed to pay those judgments in an equal amount to the assets at that time frozen in iran's foreign military sales account held by the US which was around 400 lien dollars when the American victims accepted those payments there names were subrogated to United States meaning that their claims against Iran became the United States claims against Iran that law clearly states that quote no funds shall be paid to Iran or released to Iran from the foreign military sales fun until such subrogated claims have been dealt with to the satisfaction of the United States and quote that's law but the administration recently paid around full 400 million amount from the FMS fond plus more than three times that amount in interest a total of 1.7 billion dollars in cash apparently without requiring Iran to pay anything the regards to those American victims claims for Ronnie and terrorism the need for transparency about the effect of tribunal settlements on all claims is obvious including counterclaims and subrogated claims being pursued on behalf of the American people I personally tried to access the tribunals website which claims to contain quote many fully searchable public documents end quote I had to request an account on the tribunals website and one of his past without a response a trout clearly is not an acceptable option this bill an amendment are necessary for transparency accountability and national security again it is United States law that quote no funds should be paid to Iran or released to Iran from the foreign military sales fund until such subrogated claims have been dealt with to the satisfaction of the United States quote I thank chairman Royce for addressing this important issue will the gentleman and I thank his staff for their hard work on this bill I yield back mr. Sherman just comment briefly it's my understanding that the statute the gentleman was referring to only provides a statement of policy and not a statutory limit on the power of the president he may disagree with what the president was doing whenever you settle a claim in a complicated relationship you wonder well should I settle this claim without also getting justice on some other claim and the president made a decision that decision can be questioned but I don't think it can be declared to be illegal simply because you can follow the policy language in in a congressional enactment yeah guys if the gentleman was Thank You mr. chairman I don't want you to put words in my mouth that's not what I state about what I did quote was a law and I stated what that law stated but I really don't want you but the just to clarify for the record the statute that you quoted and quoted accurately was a statement of policy and not a statute that a limits presidential action and it'll I do it do I have that right or with the gentleman want to come well the the parliamentarian could opine on this but he hit but I'm not sure you want to hear his answer he is of the opinion that yes it for the record it would be both that it is a statutory well yeah but it is his opinion but I look for to get a very opinion but in in the entry in the interest of clarifying the underlying limit let me just as I'm looking at this event what it does is it deep it adds details to the reporting requirement so that we've got clarity not only about the direct claims being settled but also about any counter claims or subrogated claims that may be extinguished by such an agreement that's that's what the amendment does but my hope is that we this by voice and get on to the final bill but Miss mr. ankle mr. Chairman I have no objection to the gentleman's amendment but I would I would again say that while there may be objections to what the President did he is not the first president to do it has been done by both Democratic and Republican presidents so I think that you know we object to the the attacks on on this president in this administration certainly we agree that there it needs to be more oversight and again I hope that we can sit down and come up with a bipartisan bill to to do that notification but I think what the gentleman is offering is reasonable and I support it I think I think mr. Engel and hearing no further requests for recognition the question occurs on this amendment all those in favor say aye aye all those opposed no in the opinion of the chair the eyes have it and the amendment is agreed to

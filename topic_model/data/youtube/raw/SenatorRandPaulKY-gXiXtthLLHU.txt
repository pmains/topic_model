joining me now from washington d.c senator rand paul senator thank you so much for joining us senator i want to remind our audience here that you're a doctor you also had coronavirus you recovered and then after you recovered you went to a hospital volunteered and helped treat coronavirus patients so you obviously see covid19 a lot differently than maybe some of the folks in the media that don't know anything about it don't really know anything about the science they say it's all about the science but they don't know anything about science um but what we're seeing right now we're seeing a surge in cases we're seeing the very restrictive lockdowns from state to state what's your reaction to everything that's happening right now you know i've said for a long time that people on the left say to us on the right look at the science look at the evidence and so i've agreed let's look at the evidence and look at the science but let's really have a discussion and a real debate about this so about six months ago i said to dr fauci in committee hearing i said the data from four different country-wide studies with contact tracing shows the kids are not transmitting this to their parents or to the teachers it has a very low transmission rate from kids to adults the kids are surviving and doing very well and when the kids go back to school there isn't a surge we showed him charts and graphs from about six different countries and he went off on some tangent and said oh what about kawasaki's disease or something which is a syndrome and it's rare but is something that also shouldn't be deciding whether we're back in school the american pediatric association said kids should be back in school for six months we've been telling dr fauci this and yet they've looked the other way he finally now accepts that we should go back to school interestingly even de blasio the socialist de blasio in new york says kids should go back to school but the democratic governor in my state bashir is still keeping he just closed the school so some people just aren't getting it but yes we should look at the science yeah i'm sure you saw this story making headlines of the bar owner in staten island who was arrested for breaking the covet restrictions i sit here and i watch and my blood's boiling seeing how these business owners have been treated just because of the arbitrary rules it's not like those of us who are against these restrictions want people to get sick or want the coronavirus to spread but we also care about our freedom and then we also see all of these lawmakers who are you know enforcing these rules and voting for the bans and lockdowns they can't even follow their own rules so hundreds of people showed up and supported this bar owner he gets arrested i mean what would you recommend to these businesses that really have no options right now you know when when hayek wrote the road to serfdom he talked about government that was uh you know a corrupt government or intolerable government was one that was arbitrary and capricious and that's what these rules are completely arbitrary and capricious this bar you can go two blocks over and a bar is open two blocks away and the guy's like what the virus doesn't go across the block and i just love to see the pushback of these guys working-class guys union guys in new york who say i want to go have a beer at my local pub and i can't go here but i can go two blocks over that makes no sense there's no science behind it it's completely arbitrary and that's the definition of an unjust law is a law that's completely arbitrary and this is happening across the country in a broader sense if we look at when the masked mandates were instituted and in many different states and countries the incidents of the infection continue to rise if not explode it's showing that most of the things that we are doing are having no effect on the virus i think the only thing that will is a vaccine frankly and we shouldn't take our eye off of the prize we shouldn't say oh just wash your hands and wear a cloth mask which don't work and say oh you'll be fine no we should be saying to our elderly i think it's probably time to go get the vaccine to doctors and nurses i think you're going to find when the first five million people who really need to go out and get it and do well then most of the rest of the public will probably follow and get it as well yeah again as you if you follow the science obviously the lockdowns haven't been working the masks haven't been working you talk to people who've been staying at home not leaving their house wearing masks wearing massive home they still get coveted i mean is it eventually all of us are going to run into kova 19 somewhere whether it's the gas station or going to the supermarket or picking up your prescription can people actually hide from the virus yeah no and i think it's kind of strange in a way so my wife has been exposed to me for a week when i had it and she didn't get it she's been exposed four other times with a driver who had it an hour in the car with the driver and with somebody at bridge all these different places she's been exposing hasn't gotten it we don't understand why but then i talked to a woman yesterday who went to a dinner party with brothers and sisters and they all got it everybody got it at one dinner party you hear those things at a birthday party or choir practice so sometimes it seems incredibly infectious and then other times it's perplexing why some people don't get it at all i think it has to do with immunity and they've talked about this with kids there's a cross reactivity between coronavirus colds and coronavirus covet and so what you find is when you test the blood of children 43 of kids have antibodies to coronavirus colds which in all likelihood is cross-reacting and giving them some protection and i think adults have some of it too just not as much as kids yeah you were talking about your back and forth with dr fauci here when it comes to getting kids in schools and you were criticized for coming out and saying that you know the sign shows that it's okay to send kids back to school it's actually probably more damaging to keep them at home not only is it tough for the parents but also just like the mental health of children and uh there's just so many consequences so when we have these health experts and officials like dr fauci who changed their minds every other day how are americans supposed to take that uh so it's like we're supposed to listen to you but then you change your rules every other day for example when we were initially told that we didn't need to wear masks and then all of a sudden now they want you to wear masks outdoors alone or even in your house see i think the biggest and most important lesson from this is that you shouldn't centralize decision making so for example dr fauci's probably well intended and he has one opinion dr atlas who i greatly respect has another opinion what should happen and a free society is you're free to listen to both of them it's kind of like the news you get both sides on the news and then you're supposed to be free to make up your own mind it's the same with this people have differing opinions on what works and what doesn't work and i trust the american people to be smart enough to figure this out on their own but what we're living in is a world a canceled cultural world where you know it's decided the science is decided the scientific consensus is there and how dare you be a heretic and challenge the scientific consensus well it turns out the consensus has been wrong frankly and now they're admitting they were wrong on schools i think they're eventually going to admit they were wrong on on bars and things one of the interesting things that nobody's talking about is the death rate in new york is almost zero it's right along the x-axis and has been ever since april and may why do you think that is so people are saying oh because they wash their hands and they wear masks well they wash your hands and wear masks everywhere in the united states even in places where the infections are going through the roof it's more complicated than that and i think what happened to new york is they had a horrible death curve a horrible mountain of people who died very quickly in april may and i think the community has some immunity not perfect immunity but enough immunity that they've slowed down the death toll in new york because now many of the vulnerable probably most of the nursing homes you know cuomo made a big mistake but the thing is is the bottom line so many people died but those who survived probably have already had coven in the nursing homes in new york and so that we're seeing less deaths now but uh nobody will we'll discuss that because it's all about wear your mask you know be a sheep do what you're told yeah well and in some of these states like at 10 pm they want you to like go home now we have curfews because apparently the virus runs loose right at 1001. yeah virus gets out after 10 o'clock the virus does not go to protest if they're approved by the left wing so antifa you've never heard of a case of any antifa person getting one while they're trying to burn down city hall but it's just ridiculous stuff like that people are seeing through it so the local guy on staten island wants to go to his usual pub for a beer is seeing these people out there breaking windows and hearing people saying well if they're riding for and looting for a just cause they probably won't get you know covered well that's ridiculous and people are seeing it as ridiculous and it's not that we're saying this isn't serious look i have good friends who are in the hospital a doctor in my town died uh we have another friend who's very sick now and you know we pray for them every day to heal so we know it's a serious disease but we want to do what works and not just tell everybody to do stuff that's not working so for example if you want to protect the elderly you should tell them cloth masks don't work the n95 masks actually probably do there isn't any statistics to show that they've worked nationwide but if you are elderly or sick and you have to be on a plane or you have to be with people for several hours and you don't have a choice the n95 mask is actually pretty pretty effective the cloth mask lets 97 of virus-sized particles go through the mask so the cloth mask is more theater than it is actual uh benefit yeah what did you make of the cdc directors saying that the next three months are going to be the most difficult and challenging in public health history why why would that be i don't think we know yet we have a huge surge in people who have positive tests going on right now and we do have a surge in those dying now the overall death rate is much lower than it was in the spring if we had the same death rate we would be having 10 to 15 000 people die every day which is horrific it's bad enough what we have but it's actually much lower on a percentage basis than it was in the spring i don't know some of the statistics look like we may be cresting that the top peak incidents this may be through now could we come back and have an even higher incidence maybe or it could be that we get to the other side of this and you know they make fun of the president when he said oh well virus may disappear the history of the spanish flu and every other terrible virus not every other one some return but many of them uh returning are never as bad spanish flu has come back in other variants you know the the specific influenza bug but never as bad as 1918 and so there is a time that even naturally and i hope the vaccine will speed this up but even naturally there will be a time at which we crest this and it doesn't get progressively worse so the ones who say the sky is falling they don't know that i think we should be careful and try to do the best we can to protect the vulnerable but we should do what works and if something doesn't work we should be honest enough to admit to the american people what we're doing is not working yeah absolutely all great points senator we appreciate you and your time thank you

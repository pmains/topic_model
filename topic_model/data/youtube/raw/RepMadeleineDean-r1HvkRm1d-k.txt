joining us now is congresswoman Madeline Dean who represents Pennsylvania's fourth District in the southeastern part of the state congresswoman I worked in a White House and if you really want to thank people in a factory for their vital work of making gowns and masks and things that kept frontline health care workers safe you could set up a zoom call like the rest of America what do you think is behind this really not essential travel and this Brian and I talk about all the time moving the president requires thousands of people to be in motion and putting people at risk thank you for having me on today Nicole I'm proud to represent this southeastern portion suburban Philadelphia where we've been particularly hard-hit so what do I think is behind the president's movements tomorrow to Lehigh Valley right north of here sadly to me it looks like a thinly veiled campaign event his events that are going on at the White House or in the Rose Garden are not going so well for him he's put forward an incoherent lacking cohesion policy he's responsible for a deadly denial and deaths sadly by deflecting and blaming others so I think they're just trying to get on the road take him on the road for a campaign event as you say the safer thing to do would be to sincerely thank this manufacturing facility and not put anybody at risk congresswoman Brian and I start this hour every day with the latest numbers of the infections in this country and the people who've lost their lives and I know that is much more than a number for you you have lost the loved one tell us what this disease is like and what it does to families well I want to start with the numbers to the gravity of it here in Pennsylvania we have had nearly 4,000 deaths I represent Montgomery County and Berks County in Montgomery County we have had 556 deaths and one of those numbers is my own mother-in-law Joan cannon in Berks County another hundred and seventy nine dead so what does it mean it means there are heroes taking care of our loved ones as we cannot even be near them my mother-in-law was taken care of Joan cannon just a wonderful woman originally from Scranton just a wonderful woman who became sick with kovat a little more than two weeks ago the wonderful workers at her very small nursing home putting themselves at risk were not a lot of pay kept us in touch did literally did FaceTime calls with us like I do with my own grandchildren and then we did a zoom call with the whole family later as it became very apparent that she was not going to survive and they moved her to a window near the patio so we could actually go over and see her just a couple of times before she died I kept her comfortable and a piece but families like mine and families and even in broader greater ways are suffering this is not a joke these are not numbers when we say 80,000 people in this country have died of kovat in a matter of 8 or 9 weeks these are human beings these are families that are disrupted and not able to appropriately be next to their loved one not able to appropriately mourn or bury their loved one so I take it very personally and I call upon the President to stay home stay out of the way and pay attention to the guidelines that my governor has put forward governor wolf and the guidelines of his own team and let us do our work we are headed back to DC to drive more aid to the people who are suffering to the people who are suffering the public health crisis but also the people who are suffering economic crisis congresswoman I'm sorry for your loss and I note your sadness and your anger and the prediction is we'll be at a hundred thousand dead a hundred thousand souls just vanished by the end of next week and I think I tend to believe that most Americans are doing the right thing most Americans don't want to get this it's not so much that they're following an order they don't want to get this but I'm wondering where the the sadness and the anger is the type of which you display if we take god forbid a hundred thousand people that saw like reverse contact tracing think of all the lives they affected think of all the loved ones they leave behind you'd think our country would be saddened and angered to the point of wanting demanding the science the doctors the scientists to come forward and let's hear from them and only them and and you know what Brian we do have that we have powerful good people whether it's in the administration here in the wolf administration in my own County government were led by a physician so while we're hard-hit we've had really smart voices on this and eyes on this unfortunately the president has gotten in the way and and Confused people a lot of people around here have gone through an awful lot of sacrifice to stay home to stay in to do the distancing we've been told we need to test test test isolate contact trace and then get to our treatment and blessedly a vaccine in the meantime we have the government has a responsibility to not get in the way of that and sadly this president has but I say listen to the the heroes listen to the helpers and to your point Brian think of it a hundred thousand people plus will have lost their lives the ripple effect across families the inability to grieve or be near them is extraordinary what I want to focus on in on also is my own work I'm very fortunate to be a member of Congress at this critical time we're going back down to Washington as you know to pass what is being named the heroes Act and I'm proud to be a part of that three things that are in that one reflects some of my concern about nursing homes these folks are on the front line and they are underpaid and at great risk they are heroes they need a pay increase another part a bill that I am proposed is actually part of the cares Act excuse me of the here act that I hope we will pass on Friday and that will give direct relief to student borrowers $10,000 worth of Direct Relief to student borrowers I also hope we will drive more money to the smallest of businesses so that they can stand our communities back up when it is safe to do some not prematurely and also we need to get more direct cash to individuals to families to students to folks who are simply through no fault of their own had their lives and their livelihoods completely disrupted we will be monitoring all that and we hope you'll come back and talk to us about your efforts there representative madeline dean of pennsylvania again we're so sorry for your loss and thank you for talking to us about it thanks for spending some time with us today thank you both

switch it up a little bit since I haven't had a chance to go to would evaluate some of the things administrator McCarthy there was a memorandum prepared by the senior Army Corps of Engineers is with the water of the United States rule were reported in the news this week are you aware of those memos I have been reading about them yes okay are you aware of the legal and scientific deficiencies raised by the Corps in those memos just from what I've read I do know I have not seen the memo myself mr. chairman I'd like to submit the memos and the attachments into the record and share some of those concerns with you right now with hearing no concerns without objection so order an April 27th 2015 memo for Major General John Peabody deputy commanding in general for the Corps civil and Emergency Operations states and I quote the rules contradictions with legal principles general multiple legal and technical consequences that in the view of the Corps would be fatal to the rule in its current form as is the rule will be legally quote vulnerable difficult to defend it in court difficult for the court to explain or to justify and challenging for the court to implement into quote the rule has abandoned principles of sound science quote and introduced indefensible provisions into the rule a May 15 2015 3 mo States EPA's analysis underlying the rule is quote flawed in multiple respects and the Corrs review could not find a justifiable basis to the analysis for many of the documents conclusions now questioned this rule was jointly issued by the EPA and Army Corps is that correct that is correct Assistant Secretary of the army Joann Darcy testified before the House Transportation Committee in June that the Army Corps quote took these concerns and walked through them with the EPA before finalizing the rule is that your understanding that is my understanding yes can you confirm that the EPA knew about these concerns before finalizing the rule I it since I am not privy to the exact language the memo I can't speak directly but I can tell you that in working with Joelle and Darcy on this rule she indicated that all of the concerns of the Army Corps have been satisfied in moving forward with the final I individually had conversations with her about the changes that the Army Corps was interested in making as the proposal moved through the interagency process and I understood that everything had been fully satisfied really mmm the EPA has publicly stated that it worked closely and carefully with the army cores to make sure just as you said sure that all concerns were addressed before finalization in its April 27th 2015 memo the Corps asserts that to date the fixes have not been adopted so the flaw remains did the EPA adopt the cores recommended changes to the final version of the rule published on June 29 2015 I wasn't privy to the exact interagency discussion within the Army Corps I was privy with I had a close working relationship as did our staff and that's what produced the final rule and they understood that all concerns was satisfied well that's why these two documents come out here showing the quite quite on contradiction because they're saying that they weren't met once again I see the EPA saying that they're above the law not only in rulemaking and you're aware that there are numerous Supreme Court rulings that defy you actually going into this waters of the u.s. application you've got serious comments in regards to the Army Corps of Engineers that you're supposed to team up with and yet you sit here and tell me that we we made sure that it's all taken care of but yet it's not what am I supposed to believe when I hear just the testimony that you gave in front of the chairman and now I'm looking at waters of the US it's just a blatant disregard for the rule of law do you have any comments we regard to that I disagree with that sir I think it follows oh you could disagree all you want in backs are the facts are they not ma'am they certainly are and so there's huge deficiencies with this with this rule but yet you didn't take the time to move it for to do it properly what you did is you forced it down just like everybody else does within agency and so who cares about the rules you know I come from Arizona where water is for fighting over whiskeys for drinkin so these are very very important to us particularly in the way and their overreaching beyond that so I find a very defiant of you sitting here and and in light of these two documents stating that you actually worked with the Army Corps of Engineers that it's ingrained within the rule but it's not ingrained in the rule and you perpetuated a bad rule that has legal consequences and has ramifications for states and water use throughout this country shame on you I yield back to mr. chairman

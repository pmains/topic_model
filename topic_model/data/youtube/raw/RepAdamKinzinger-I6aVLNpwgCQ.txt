  SAYING FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD  TRUMP INCITED A MOB. >> ILLINOIS CONGRESSMAN  KINZINGER. HOW TO YOU THINK IT WENT? -WAS THIS THE PRIMETIME SHOW WE  BILLED IT TO BE  >> I THINK IN A BROADER SENSE,  WHAT IS IT THAT LED TO THAT AND  THE FACT THAT NOTHING HAS  CHANGED SINCE. WE WANTED TO LAY OUT THE OVERALL CASE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THAT'S  WHAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WATCH  THE MOST. WE'RE DOING WHAT WE NEED TO BUT  THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN  LIED AND ABUSED BY THE FORMER  PRESIDENT AND CONVINCED HE IS  THE MOST TRUSTWORTHY PERSON. I DENT GO HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO OPEN THOSE FOLKS' EYES  BUT WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE TRUTH IN FRONT OF THEM. >> THIS WAS NIGHT ONE OF THE  HEARINGS. YOU MENTIONED YOU'RE GOING TO  ROLL OUT MORE PROOF, PROOF OF  WHAT? >> AS WE SEE WHAT THE PROUD BOYS BEING CHARGED WITH SEDITIOUS  CONSPIRACY, IT LOOKS LIKE THAT  WITH THE PRESIDENT. IT LACKS LIKE CERTAINLY HE'S  ABUSING THE DOJ FOR HIS PURPOSES AND WE SEE PRESIDENT THAT  INCREASINGLY BECOMES MORE  DESPERATE. WE'RE NOT HERE TO FILE CRIMINAL  CHARGES. WE'RE WELL AWARE THE DOJ â™ªIS  PROBABLY WATCHING AND  INTERESTED. OUR MAIN PURPOSE IS TO SHOW A  TRANSFER OF POWER. IT CANNOT HAPPEN LIKE THIS EVER  AGAIN BECAUSE WE WILL NOT BE A  FUNCTIONING DEMOCRACY WITH  ANYMORE OF THESE. >> YOU TALK ABOUT PROOF IN  EVIDENCE AND SAID IT LOOKS LIKE  MAYBE THE PRESIDENT HAD A  PARTICULAR HAND A IN THIS. WHAT EVIDENCE? ARE WE GOING TO SEE IT LATER? WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET BUT  YOU'RE SAYING WE'RE GOING TO SEE A DIRECT PLANNING? >> WE'RE GOING TO LAY THAT OUT  IN THE COMING HEARINGS. WHAT WE SHOW STHD TOP LINE OF  THAT. I THINK WHAT WE PUT BEFORE THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE YESTERDAY WAS  COMPELLING. THE PRESIDENT KNEW. IF HE DID BELIEVE THE ELECTION  WAS STOLEN, WITH ALL THE TIMES  HE'S PROVEN AND SHOWN IT WASN'T, I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S MENTALLY  CAPEBIBLE OF BEING PRESIDENT. BUT IF HE DIDN'T BELIEVE IT, IT  SHOW AS COMPLETE LACK OF MORAL  CLARITY AND HOW TO MOVE ON TO  THE PRESIDENCY. THAT'S IF WING TO BE SOMETHING  WE DELVE INTO DEEPER. SO, I HAVE TO SAY TOO. >> WE HAVE A PHOTO OF YOU  HUGGING HARRY DUNN, U.S. CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER. YOU HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING THIS FOR THE PAST 11 MONTHS. WHAT HAS BEEN YOUR EXPERIENCE  GETTING TO KNOW THE MEN AND  EMWITHEN FROM THAT DAY WHO  LITERALLY PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE? >> HE'S 9 FOOT 30. AND ALL THOSE MEN AND WOMEN. I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW OFFICER  REALLY WELL. IT'S BEEN GOOD JUST FROM THE  PERSPECTIVE OF KNOWING HOW MUCH  THEY SACRIFICED. A LOT OF PEOPLE STILL IS DEALING WITH THIS FROMMAU. LOOK, THEY HAD A LOT OF COP  FRIENDS. THEY EVEN HAVE POLICE OFFICER  FRIENDS WRITING AND CALLING THEM SAYING JANUARY 6th DIDN'T  HAPPEN. YOU CAN IMAGINE NOT SKRUSJUST T  TOLL OF THAT DAY BUT THE TOLL OF LOSING YOUR SOCIAL CIRCLE OF  POLICE BUDDIES HAS TAKEN A  MASSIVE TOLL ON THESE PEOPLE BUT THEY'RE HEROES. WE SAW THAT IN OFFICER EDWARDS  AND HEROES DEALING WITH REAL  HUMAN TRAGEDY, REAL HUMAN  TRAUMA. AND WHEN WE SAY THINGS LIKE  JANUARY 6th WAS A TURBRIST  VISITED, WHICH THAT VIDEO LAST  NIGHT SHOULD PUT ANY OF THAT TO  REST. WE'RE NOT JUST LYING TO THE  AMERICAN PEOPLE. NOT JUST PUTTING FORWARD A  CONSPIRACY. WE'RE TAKING AWAY THE SACRIFICE  THESE MEN AND WOMEN DID TO  DEFEND THE SEAT OF DEMOCRACY. >> WE KNOW YOU HAVE LOT OF WORK  TO DO.

I want to talk about the allocation issues in California I want to talk about the unimpaired flows I'd like to ask some questions with regards to title transfer issues with regards to the Bureau and let's start with the allocations as was noted before and I said yesterday we've got a very good blessed year with a hundred and seventy-six percent of above average snowpack in the Sierra and most of the districts that the bureau serves are at a hundred percent allocation in the Sacramento Valley and on the final water users the exchange contractors but on the San Luis unit we are at sixty-five percent and I know that there are issues there and I'm well aware of all of the issues I just don't understand the Commissioner if at a hundred and seventy percent seventy six percent of normal we can't get a hundred percent for the San Luis water unit when can we ever expect to I mean I understand the strains on the system at average or below average or drought conditions but one hundred and seventy six percent of normal could you please explain and is that going to be changed at all here in the next few weeks water allocated in July excuse me sadly really cannot be effectively and efficiently used as it relates to the crops and the farm communities Thank You congressman reclamation we work very hard every year to deliver a full supply of water no I know that it is every year is different I know that there are so many factors that go into it and I know that I South of Delta we were able to get to 80 percent for our mni contractors and we're at sixty-five percent for the other water service contractors we are constantly updating our analysis I know that you're in with the state there's a cold storm coming in yes as we speak rain and snow we'll be watching this the middle of May see if there's any change you can make a decision this week I we will have to see what that storm produces and what the changes are you know I don't want to get to my other questions but frankly this is the system's broke for a lot of different reasons and it's just not satisfactory 65% for some of the poorest farm communities in the valley

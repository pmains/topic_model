I rise today in strong opposition to the cruel
and partisan safety net cuts masquerading as the Farm Bill. The Farm Bill has long been a bipartisan cause
– offering assistance and security to farmers and needy families alike in a way that both
Democrats and Republicans can support. But this extreme bill cuts more than $23 billion
from nutrition assistance programs through eligibility restrictions – kicking a projected
1 million households off the SNAP program and reducing benefits for millions more
Let me be clear: these are vital, life-saving benefits to help Americans put food on the
table during moments of need. The average family spends just ten months
on SNAP, receiving assistance just long enough to get back on their feet. At the same time, the program helps set our
kids up for success. Hungry children perform worse in school, and
studies have shown that children on SNAP achieve higher test scores and are more likely to
graduate from high school.Children on SNAP achieve higher test scores and are more likely
to graduate from high school. Mr. Speaker, The partisan approach was the
wrong way on tax reform, it was the wrong way on health care, and it’s the wrong way
now. I urge my Republican colleagues to abandon
this party-line legislation and instead approach the Farm Bill in the fair, bipartisan manner
we have in the past.

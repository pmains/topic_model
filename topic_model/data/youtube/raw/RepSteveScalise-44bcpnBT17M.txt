anyway joining us now at the inside scoop congressman steve scalise house republican whip member of the house energy and commerce committee uh as always steve welcome to the program we appreciate it very very much i just want to have a little nip here this report that we're getting that the senate parliamentarian will rule out uh irs revenues from more agents you know the old story running around chasing waitresses trying to get them to pay taxes on their tips now the interesting thing that i know i see you shaking your head you're right it's futile but the great part about this was this was originally scored by the biden people as 800 billion to pay for their utopian infrastructure package now you take that out that's a pretty big chunk 800 billion yeah that's the kind of economics they produce like my phones are ringing off the hook of people calling on if only we had more irs agents you know that that and more meter maids in our downtown cities or what people beg us to do my god i mean how out of touch is joe biden when that's what he thinks is job creation you know how about you help businesses get back up and running every small business in our communities are looking for workers and joe biden's paying people not to work eight million jobs going unfilled uh look you were you were there in the white house when we did maybe one of the most powerful pieces of legislation to help families to rebuild our middle class the tax cuts and jobs act and they want to destroy that they want to literally put a new tax on on low-income jobs because those will be the first jobs to go as you know if we raise taxes i hope we don't we're fighting to to prevent joe biden from raising taxes but that's what he wants to do raise taxes on hard-working families and hire more irs agents in washington yeah i just love that by the way in my time steve uh which goes back a ways this has been tried so many times by presidents who are looking for revenues to finance you know phony bookkeeping uh to finance uh some worthless project or whatever but i do want to ask you um talking to some people friends of ours i must say you know them as well as i do and reading the reports it doesn't really sound like this infrastructure bipartisan compromise is really going anyplace you got a bunch of left-wing democrats i read who are now saying let's stop the talking to the republicans and just get on with it so what do you think what are you hearing your ears to the ground yeah larry you know joe biden talked about unity a lot during the campaign he's yet to follow through on that he's not done anything to work with republicans in an earnest way to get things done but look we're working on our own plan that actually has been based on many bipartisan negotiations in the past to do real infrastructure and i'm talking about roads bridges ports seaways and broadband and to fully pay for it without tax increases you can actually do that and oh by the way you need a reform and you know this too you need to reform some of these environmental regulations the endangered species act nipple laws things that drag projects that should take two years to out to 10 years it makes a lot of infrastructure projects impossible just dealing with the red tape reform that too and if you do that you could get a bipartisan deal you talk about raising taxes unionizing home health care workers and calling that infrastructure count me out and frankly i think there are a lot more democrats that realize pelosi's already made them walk the plank on a lot of really radical socialist votes so far i think we're going to win the house back regardless but i think they're running out of an ability to drag democrats into so many more bad votes right now they don't have the votes to raise taxes we're trying to work hard to ensure they they're not able to get that done the red line the red line under the tax hikes uh is very important really important uh i've heard kevin say it i've heard mitch say it to me that's just really important steve scalise before i lose you i want to ask you about another thing which astonishes me after saying the biden administration after saying that they would keep the sanctions on the russian pipeline nordstream 2 in this case which i mean i did a lot of work on this with minutian and briet and other people we had an executive order to sanction anybody there's still 99 miles left so if the thing was stoppable we don't want russia to run all of europe do we um now the talk is they're going to lift the sanctions and they're gonna let the pipeline be finished steve scalise i i just think that say it's not so why are we switching gears like this larry this is where people across the country are scratching their heads they're going wait a minute joe biden walks in on day one and kills the keystone pipeline these are american jobs american energy owned by the way our friend canada bringing their oil to america to refine it which by the way we have the best standards in the world if you're going to refinance anywhere refine it in america he kills that and then he says okay but we're going to let russia have a green light in wave sanctions to have this pipeline between germany and russia so he says no to american jobs and partner partnering with our good friend canada but he says yes to giving a blank check to russia i thought this guy was supposed to be standing up to russia he literally just gave the keys of the store to russia giving them more leverage by the way on energy policy when russia has ever energy leverage they actually use it against american values hurting our allies around the world when you were there we were actually exporting energy to our friends around the world undermining russia taking away russia and opec's leverage and joe biden gave that away he also wants to give away our intellectual property on the vaccine he literally wants to give the american vaccine that we created with operation warp speed for cobit to china giving away our intellectual property china steals our intellectual property that was already a problem joe biden's just going to say why bother letting him steal it he's trying to give it away to them this is psychotic and it's got to stop larry you know steve scalise one other point on this the biden state department is saying that they're lifting sanctions it's like they don't really want to lift them but they're going to lift them because they want to keep the relationship going with germany but i got to tell you i mean i was involved in these negotiations for quite some time europe the european union disagrees with germany this is one of the rare cases where the eu agreed with the us against germany and against russia so i don't know who they think they're currying favor with except perhaps you're right that's basically a pro-russian move which is a you know on its face uh primo fascist stupid but that europe doesn't look at this europe yeah how about we sell germany american energy it's lower emissions by the way because i thought it was all about climate change and global warming we emit a whole lot less carbon when we make and refine oil in america versus when it's produced and refined in russia uh it's unbelievable that they're doing this and they think nobody's going to pay attention people are scratching their heads but they're paying attention and they don't like it lng steve you know lng we could get it out there transportation and all six bucks and compete with russia anyway the producers at the pump and paying 20 30 more at the pump either let's end this madness all right sleeping with you larry let's uh we'll we'll reconvene this discussion very soon thank you very much mr leader i

  TWO MINUTES TO OUR VICE  CHAIRMAN AND THE SPONSOR OF  THIS BILL, MR. MCHENRY.  THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED FOR TWO  MINUTES. MR. MCHENRY: THANK YOU, MR.  SPEAKER. IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY,  THE DAY AFTER THE FIFTH  ANNIVERSARY OF THE JOBS ACT. FIVE YEARS AGO YESTERDAY IN A  BIPARTISAN WAY, THIS DIVIDED   HOUSE, THIS DIVIDED GOVERNMENT   THAT GOT NEXT TO NOTHING DONE  IN A BIPARTISAN WAY WE WERE  ABLE TO ACHIEVE A HUGE   BIPARTISAN VICTORY TO HELP   SMALL BUSINESSES RAISE CAPITAL.  AND IN LIGHT OF THAT, IN THAT  HISTORY, IN THAT SPIRIT WE'VE  REACHED ACROSS THE AISLE AND   REPRESENTATIVE VELAZQUEZ,  RANKING MEMBER WATERS HAVE   WORKED WITH ME TO CRAFT A VERY   GOOD BILL HERE TODAY.  THIS BILL HELPS SMALL  BUSINESSES AND THE REST OF THE   COUNTRY. WE KNOW VENTURE CAPITAL, 78% OF  VENTURE CAPITAL GOES TO JUST   THREE YEARS. IF YOU ARE IN AUSTIN, BOSTON OR  SILICON VALLEY, YOU HAVE   CAPITAL FLOWING TO YOU.  YOU HAVE FUNDS FOR YOUR IDEA.  WHETHER YOU ARE IN URBAN AREAS,  RURAL AREAS, THEY ARE STARVING   FOR CAPITAL. IN LIGHT OF THAT PROBLEM, WE   ARE TRYING TO WORK FOR A   SOLUTION TO THOSE SMALL  BUSINESSES, THOSE INNOVATORS   WITH GOOD IDEAS THAT DON'T HAVE  ACCESS TO CAPITAL. WE RAISED ANGEL INVESTORS. STILL INCLUDING IMPORTANT  INVESTOR PROTECTION. AND SO TODAY IS A GREAT VICTORY  FOR SMALL BUSINESS FOLKS THAT  NEED ACCESS, THAT NEED CAPITAL   TO TAKE THEIR IDEA TO MARKET.  I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT  THIS MEASURE AND I YIELD BACK  THE BALANCE OF MY TIME

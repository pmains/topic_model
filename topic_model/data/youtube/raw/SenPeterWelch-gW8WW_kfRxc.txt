thank you thank you ranking member boss i now am pleased to recognize our first panel uh beginning with representative welch a good friend of mine from uh the state of uh vermont uh mr welch will uh i i now call upon you to make your presentation um thank you very much and i'm gonna talk about burn pits but before i do i just want to say uh to you mr chairman uh and to you mr ranking member and each of the committee members i really really appreciate uh you making yourself available for member day uh it's just so wonderful for me when i'm talking to veterans here to be able to say to them that i'll be talking to you so you'll hear what i say about burn pits but just please know that what you're doing as a committee is really appreciated by the veterans uh and ranking member votes that you you said it very well is you did mr chairman so thank you on my behalf but i know all the members in congress feel that way uh burn pits is a big issue and i know your committee has been doing a lot on it but it's been really significant in vermont a couple of reasons vermonters on a per capita basis actually had more casualties in iraq in afghanistan than any any other state for a small state where rural state and as you know it's a kind of state where folks step up and want to serve their country we had two beloved members um who lost their lives as a result of cancer that appear very much to have been caused by their service in afghanistan in the vicinity of burn pits and when sergeant major mike cram died in in 2017 with cancer his widow pet graham uh to gather the unit that he was with and three other members also have cancer and began advocating uh to do something about burn pits the following year brigadier general mike heston who had several tours of duty in afghanistan also died and his widow june heston uh has has also become extremely active uh those burn pits we don't know what is being burned but we know it's a lot of toxic stuff and we know that a lot of people in the vicinity have become ill we've made some progress there's a permanent end to the use of burn pits but there are some burn pits still operating in host countries so we're reducing the exposure we've improved the registry and that's something that we have to continue doing and congressman ruiz dr ruiz and i have two bills that we're going to be reintroducing the reducing exposure to burn pit burn pets and also the improvement of the registry of burn pit registry act that expands eligibility for our service members who served in syria and egypt finally dr ruiz has introduced a presumption of service connection if you have an illness and you served in the vicinity of a burn pit cancer-related illness that bill would have a presumption of disability much like ultimately happened with agent orange i want to thank you for your us for the progress we've made ndaa in 2020 ended burn pits and gave location and required giving the location list to the va and we want to continue making that progress so the advocacy that you do on behalf of the veterans is going to make a huge difference on getting more people to sign up for the registry to give us more data to reinforce the ban on the use of burn pits which are very very toxic and that would go a long way towards two things one providing medical assistance to those of our service members who did become ill serving in the vicinity of burn pits but two which i know just this hearing is an indication of reinforcing the appreciation and the admiration in the debt of gratitude each and every one of us owes to our service members so mr chairman and mr ranking member and committee members thank you so much for the opportunity to convey this message to you on behalf of my veterans thank you

thank you mr chairman and thank you to our witnesses today ms frazier the american society of civil engineers has rated the state of u.s infrastructure at a c minus and estimated that the capital expenditure necessary to close the gap to get to a b level which they define as a state of good repair is approximately 2.6 trillion dollars now not all of that investment has to be public investment so my question for you is twofold first do you agree that having state of the art world-class infrastructure in the united states is essential not just to quality of life but also to economic competitiveness and sustained growth and how can congress take action to make it easier for private sector entities with significant capital at their disposal to invest in necessary infrastructure improvements in construction oh um thank you very much indeed senator uh it's uh it's a really important question um yes i i do agree that um the america having a far stronger infrastructure than it has today will be important both in terms of competitiveness of the country as well as an important source of jobs and growth going forward the public-private partnership has been shown to be a very successful one in this area where the government can step in and provide credits and other areas where there are gaps in a capital structure or help absorb some of the risks in it to enable new investors to come in and participate uh in in the investments is going to be a very important area and it's one i think i can speak for myself we would be delighted to work uh work with your office on going forward thank you miss fraser and would you similarly commit to working with this committee in my office to explore mechanisms that could make it uh easier for private capital to support the development of clean energy production capacity here in the united states i know that your bank has made some significant commitments in terms of emission reduction yes we would be delighted to do so i think the development as we've heard today of new technologies in sequestration or in carbon capture and others will be absolutely essential in the transition ahead we will be delighted to do so thank you i look forward to those discussions uh mr solomon i'd like now to turn to you could you please lend your perspective uh what are the impediments and what are the opportunities uh for improvement to public policy to unlock more private capital uh for capital investments improvements construction of necessary infrastructure in the united states so i appreciate i appreciate the question senator uh and i think that it it's it's important for us to try to unleash a lot of the private capital that exists or is earmarked uh toward infrastructure i think there's over 200 billion dollars of private capital earmarked for investment in infrastructure in this uh in this country um i think that uh finding ways to collaborate from a public-private partnership perspective uh has always been a successful path to take i think there are things that we can do to potentially expand activities by making certain tax exempt financing easier potentially for rural broadband or housing infrastructure more broadly i think those are areas that would be worth exploring thank you mr solomon i appreciate that mr diamond i'd like to offer you the opportunity to respond to the same question perhaps comment on the statements made by some of your colleagues you know i agree with everything they said and uh i would just add that infrastructure is critical but i would beg you the senate to focus on the output not the input there's too much time to spend on how much money we're going to spend on stuff too little time has been on who's responsible what's it going to cost what is it worth what and also you need to fix regulations i've given this example many times you look at these examples around the country to build a rebuild a broken bridge between new jersey and staten island it took 10 years to get the 49 permits which i had to get sequentially you know it's going to take 10 years to rebuild a broken bridge to get those permits that the cost is higher the risk is higher private capital will not come in and so you have to do those things together and you know constantly with outputs how many bridges and then you'll get full support of everybody if we have we know it's going to be effectively spent we this country has spent lots of money completely ineffectively and that would be a very bad idea thank you mr diamond appreciate that contribution uh to the discussion uh mr moynihan uh when we discuss some of the potential investments in infrastructure uh for example transit and transportation clean energy the energy grid can you comment as well please on the opportunities and the challenges faced by private capital interested in supporting these vital nationalities well i think my colleagues have outlined a lot of the questions and and issues so to speak there is just a lot of money ready to be invested it'll take um some effort on the permitting and other types of a process to speed those projects along um but the money is there and in fact it's being invested as we speak so i think i'd encourage uh a holistic view of this from the amount of money that the government can help to move projects faster the amount of money that the private sector has and then importantly the the atmosphere i'm getting the project done which is required to speed these things along thank you all thank you mr chairman i yield

us off online thank you mr chairman and uh thank you to our panel i want to extend a particularly warm welcome to you ms varda hailing from richmond hills in the state of georgia it's a pleasure to have you with us uh grateful for your testimony please give my regards to your family and um we would like to and appreciate you sharing your story with us but just to help some of my colleagues on on the committee and me to really understand what the situation that you're in means for you and your family to talk a bit more about how the burden of debt that you incurred is impacting your family and your ability to raise your two kids well i have 120 000 and over 120 000 in student loans um my payments are over a thousand dollars a month which you know i'm not paying right now because they're in the pandemics stop but honestly there's no way i can pay over a thousand dollars a month and raised two kids seeing kids to be able to do extracurricular activities um [Music] i can't even have a car in my name a house in my name i mean there's it's a lot you don't know if when it comes out of the pandemic my wage is going to be garnished because i can't pay back these student loans and most of it's from a college that you know has defrauded lots of students um it's it's just a lot and you you wanted to pursue a master's degree ms barton because you wanted to engage in public service correct um i worked for the school system for seven years and wanted to do online teaching and that's why i ended up going to ashford just because they told me with the degree that i got that i would be able to do online teaching as soon as i got done with it i've applied for mania jobs never even got an interview is it fair to say you were misled by the institution that was marketing that degree to you very much so and so you you took on this debt you're unable to make the payments unable to uh own a car in your name yes sir unable to engage in your community and economic life and and with your family in the way that you want to and it's because you wanted to teach it's because you wanted to be an educator correct well ms barta i i again want to thank you for joining us and and sharing your story and oftentimes the senate hears from experts but nothing is more powerful and effective than hearing from the people who are impacted by decisions that we make by mistakes that our predecessors in the congress have made by the predations of institutions that lured you in to a financially precarious situation exploiting the fact that you wanted to make a contribution to our community and our state in our country i thank you for your testimony i look forward to sitting down with you in person uh and um you have certainly strengthened my resolve and inspired me and i hope many of my colleagues to take on this issue with even greater focus and urgency ms barto thank you so much and mr chairman i yield back

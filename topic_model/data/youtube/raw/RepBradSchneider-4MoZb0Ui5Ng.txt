HPOGs are vital grants that give traditionally
disadvantaged Americans new opportunities for career advancement in desperately needed
professions like nursing and phlebotomy. These grants are a win-win - low-income job
seekers get a chance at a higher-paying career, and our country benefits from a stronger health
workforce. In particular, I’m glad our HPOG reauthorization
package includes my bill, H.R. 3767, the Impacts and Outcomes for Health Career Training Act. I’m a strong believer that we have to continue
to evaluate our programs to ensure they are working as intended. HPOGs have shown strong results so far - retention
rates are high and wages are up. But we have to make sure that success continues
and find ways to improve the program moving forward. My bill, which is now Section 3(f) of the
reauthorization package, ensures that HHS will continue to conduct rigorous evaluations
of our HPOG grantees, studying both the short- and long-term impacts of this funding. I look forward to the Committee passing this
legislation, and hope this package is signed into law as soon as possible. Thank you again, Mr. Chairman; I yield back.

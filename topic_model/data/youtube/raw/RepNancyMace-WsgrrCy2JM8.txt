thank you madam chair this this piece of legislation is common sense reform at least to me my constituents sent me to washington to protect their protect their tax dollars and to make sure their government is working for them and not against them the whistleblower protection improvement act gives support to those in government who speak up when they see wrongdoing and in the first six months of of being in congress i've seen a lot of people behind the scenes trying to speak up so why would we not want to do that in the short time i've been here we've seen massive amounts of money wasted on unemployment fraud new revelations about waste in the ppp program trillions of dollars in spending potentially very unfair contracts we've heard from folks inside whistleblowers regarding the border and immigration issues and how we're handling it and most of this would remain in the dark if it were not for people for whistleblowers willing to speak up and speak out and these decisions speak up don't come without a cost earlier this year i waded into an issue involving massive dod contracting fraud and everywhere i turned there were people and whistleblowers who had their lives ruined by the very people they were reporting for wrongdoing these individuals were supposed to have protections but what good does protection do if dla insiders refused to award them contracts for report reporting corruption at our own border this year we've seen whistleblowers point out that this administration is doing what they're doing is wrong and how they're running a shell game to hide migrant children from the press do these individuals not deserve protections when they're trying to speak out this is the reason real america is fed up with washington we've thrown out the good governance for the sake of polling and talking points so today we want to do something right it's time to govern and i urge my colleagues to vote in support of this legislation

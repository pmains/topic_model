we have to finish the work that Muller didn't get to the end tie off the loose ends on those and follow the facts where they may I made the decision a while ago but I announced that today that I believe we should begin an impeachment inquiry and with that you can add congressman Brad Schneider to the list of House Democrats getting behind impeachment hearings and he's not the only one just this week this week alone six more Democratic lawmakers including a member of leadership and a committee chairmen have now come out in support of this move that brings the total number of House Democrats who want impeachment proceedings to start to 130 that's more than half about 55 percent of the whole caucus you see that one independent that's Republican turned independent Justin Amash who also supports it NBC's Leon Caldwell has been going through town halls with lawmakers all across the country she's with us now from Illinois north of Chicago Lee Ann you have been at both congressman Schneider's Town Hall you went to congressman Underwood's Town Hall how much is the issue of impeachment coming up in these settings when constituents are able to interact directly with the people who represent them yeah halli impeachment is a topic that these voters at these town halls really care about that was evidence not only by the questions that were asked by these voters but also the response from the audience not only to the questions asked about impeachment but also to these lawmakers answers so part of the reason we chose these specific town halls is because they're in suburban districts which these voters have been breaking from Republicans in the 2000 and polls are showing they are still doing that and also because these two members had not yet come out in support of impeachment here we are in Illinois getting ready to go to these town halls and they come out for impeachment and so we talked to the voters at these town halls and I asked one of them at Lauren Underwood's Town Hall how she responded and appreciated what Lauren Underwood had to say about impeachment were you pleased with her response to saying that she came out for impeachment very very pleased to hear that and especially that she looked at the article one part of it because why should the Russians be influencing our election I think that is extremely and extremely dangerous halli so voters of these town halls wanted to go to them to tell their members that they supported impeachment and they got what they wanted sounds like it liyan called wild live for us out on the trail in River woods Illinois Leanne thank you much my friend here now a couple other folks familiar to the show sure Michael singleton GOP strategist and former HUD deputy chief of staff

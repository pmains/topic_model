well Thank You mr. chairman and good morning everyone we have an expression in the West whiskeys for drinkin and waters for fighting over and given that the hearing today is the first major hearing this year on California water and at California and Arizona have a long history of fighting over water that dates back to at least the 1920s I brought some whiskey and before we get to fighting I would like to propose a toast may God bless this hearing may we make progress here today so that Congress can finally provide some form of relief for drought conditions and from policies that are crippling Western communities and finally may the extreme environmental groups and others that are holding back common-sense solutions and comprehensive West wide drought relief legislation that passed the House last July finally put the interests of small businesses farmers and American families ahead of the interests of a 3-inch fish that the fighting began Cheers

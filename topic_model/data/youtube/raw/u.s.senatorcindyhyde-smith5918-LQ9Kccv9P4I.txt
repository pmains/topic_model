very much let's talk about the bank enterprise program it's pretty popular in mississippi and it's well received by local banks and credit unions because it allows them to leverage their own assets to invest in the small businesses and the startups which gives them the ability to support job creation and retention in areas that really need it in a lot of states but i was really disappointed to see that the budget cuts from the bank enterprise program by 11 million dollars from the fiscal year 2022 enacted level what were the reasons for these cuts senator let me start out by sharing your commitment to these communities where the bank enterprise program has been so has been effective in helping and i think what we're trying to do is figure out where we can most effectively put the limited dollars that we have available to have the impact that we both care about as you know well in many of these communities you have cdfis and mdis that are also doing business there and what we've what we've done based on the funding that congress provided us is provide a great deal of capital to these institutions so more than nine about nine billion dollars of capital through the emergency capital investment program went to cdfis over the course of this year that we've placed in them in order to make sure that that money is invested well we've added we've asked for additional money for the cdfi program to help monitor but also provide resources to those institutions i think i'm happy to talk to you about how we're thinking about this but i think our goal largely is to make sure that we're building up an ecosystem there that is based on providing resources to those lenders then also ensuring that we've provided support to them so it wasn't our our goal is not to step away from these communities but rather try to most effectively provide funding to them going forward so i think you just answered the program is oversubscribed compared to other programs because it is so popular but how do you intend to support investments in economically distressed areas with reduced funding i mean you're saying you're going in another direction and how do you expect that to compensate so sandra i think our goal is to make sure that on top of the public money that congress has provided to these communities that we attract private money as well so the our goal similar to what we're doing with the small business credit initiative is to make sure that we we attract private investment into these communities because we know that that is the sustain is a sustainable way to make sure that they have the access the resources they need we think that we have a real opportunity to do that working closely through our cdfi office with the money that you've already provided and that's what we would want to do here is to ensure that in areas where there is a need for additional capital because our all these programs are oversubscribed that we would work to attract private capital and what is the status of the 2022 grants right now so senator i'd have to get the team to provide you with an update on where we are in the grant making process at the moment but we haven't completed it but i'm happy to get you to provide you with an update um after this hearing has it been implemented well or i mean do you have any idea if it's been beneficial or so my view is that um as you know well this is a program that um has been um very popular and has been implemented well by career by staff across administrations and that's continues to be the case i think my overarching goal is to make sure that across the suite of programs the congress is authorized we take your resources and we try and find creative and interesting ways to try and pull the private sector in as well to crowd in private capital because ultimately what we know about these communities where we have these programs right now is that they have unfortunately been starved the type of private capital that's needed to building housing to starting small businesses to making sure those small businesses can thrive so a big push from my standpoint from secretary ellen's standpoint is what can we do to take the resources you've provided and use them in a way that attracts private capital to join them in a way that's sustainable over time

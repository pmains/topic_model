mr hargett i i i i i'm sort of astounded by your testimony are you telling me that a citizen of tennessee who is concerned about the coronavirus which by the way your state is number 11 in the country in in uh in in cases per 100 000 people that's not a quote excuse i don't know why you need an excuse to vote but you're saying that someone can't say i don't want to stand in line for two hours with a several hundred other people and protect my health that that's not good enough in your state is that what you're telling me mr hargett under tennessee law fear of attracting the coronavirus is not an excuse well that's pitiful thank you mr chairman that's all all right

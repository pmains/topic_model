madam president senator from louisiana madam president i love senator durbin i hate his amendment here's why these sdrs are not free money they're not free money they're like a crypto coin the imf issues the crypto coin to all the countries that are members of the imf and these countries take that crypto coin and guess what they do they come to the united states of america and say we want to exchange our crypto coin for dollars and guess what we don't have the dollars because we're dead broke so we have to borrow the dollars to give to the china's and the venezuelans and all the countries that hate us in exchange for their crypto coins now that's just a natural fact and if you check the record you'll find that the countries that really need the money to to vaccinate their people about about 10 percent of this money is going to them the rest is going to all the larger companies like china like venezuela like the countries in europe uh very virtually no money gets sent to to the people who need it this is an incredibly inefficient way to do it madam president the international monetary fund issues special drawing rights and a special drawing right is like it's like a crypto coin it's not worth anything it's only worth something if you exchange it for real money and the bad administration decided to encourage imf to issue all these crypto coins and guess what they're all doing they're bringing the crypto coins to the united states of america and saying we want dollars give me dollars for the crypto coin but we don't have any dollars in our checking account so we have to go borrow the money there's no free lunch and you don't get one now all my bill would do would say we're not going to issue special drawing rights to perpetrators of genocide our state sponsors of terrorism in other words no china no free money to china no to free money to syria and no free money to iran it is ludicrous for us to be borrowing money to give dollars to exchange for for crypto coins to china or syria or iran

i just want to say before i get to my amendment here related to sizza that to my colleagues across the aisle there are a number of provisions that were suggested today on afghanistan on terrorism on border issues on making sure drones are made in america if they're going to be policing our borders that i would be more than happy to work with the other side of the aisle on through normal order but at this time mr chairman i'm pleased to offer this amendment which makes a critical 60 million dollar investment in the cyber security and infrastructure security agency sizza my amendment would dramatically expand sizza's ability to hunt down cyber attackers think russia china and ransomware gangs whenever they target america's networks and cloud technology it also invests in scissors work to make those key systems more secure and harder to attack in the first place this past year i think has been a real wake-up call for americans when it comes to cyber security and it's clear that cyber security is no longer just a tech issue that a bunch of national security folks care about it's at the heart of the systems that we rely on for our daily lives it affects every single one of us in may obviously the ransomware attack on the colonial pipeline disrupted fuel on the east coast in june we had farmers in my district asking about the the attacks on jbs the world's largest largest meat processor um and then of course at the beginning of the year the solarwinds campaign against federal and corporate networks showed us exactly how our adversaries like russia are taking advantage of gaps in our own cyber security in search of intelligence so as the solarwinds campaign showed us the widespread adoption of cloud technology specifically by everyone from the federal government to major corporations has created a really attractive target for attackers that's why my amendment gives siza the resources to take advantage of the opportunities of cloud technology while also addressing the challenges it presents all to better protect american networks dhs has told us that this investment would quote dramatically expand scissors ability to hunt down cyber threats across the board and it will help them better understand the threats facing federal state and local and critical infrastructure and inform the way we defend them you know in some of those attacks that we had earlier this year the ones that really broke through with americans they kept asking i was certainly asked in my district what is the sort of 9-1-1 number that i call when there are attacks when there are cyber security attacks who's the quarterback who's the person or the agency that's in charge and i think it's more more important than ever that we have that you know one particular place where folks can go and we are lucky enough here on the committee to oversee cizza who is really on the front line of helping us deal with this new and emerging technology this is also an investment in nonpartisan public servants who are doing the hands-on keyboard work of preventing detecting and defending against cyber attacks i'm pleased that this amendment has been largely pre-conferenced with the senate and has received the backing of dhs and the white house a recognition i think of the importance of cisa and getting it the resources they need i thank the chairman and the committee staff for their work on that front and i urge my colleagues to support the investment in our nation's cyber security with that i yield back

it hapless this week more big news this week Indianapolis congressman Andre Carson will sit on one of the most powerful committees in Washington DC he's been named as one of the 22 members of the House Select Committee on Intelligence the committee is focused on the work of the CIA and e AI and a countering terrorism fight around the world it comes amid heightened tensions after the terrorist attacks as you may recall in France something I talks the congressman about it's critically important that we recognize that we will never win the war against terrorism without getting help from Muslims giving help to sneaks getting help from non theist and others there were there are terrorist efforts that are thrown at each and every day and the reason why is because they're Muslims were helping our law enforcement agencies you've never hear these stories you are a congressman who happens to be the second practice Islam or you are Muslim there has been a backlash from some corner say that you should not be on this committee that you are sort of the chicken guarding the henhouse around here so a Trojan horse the chosen horse what do you make of that criticism she'll be on this committee oh absolutely I think that we need Hindus on the committee we need more Jewish brothers and sisters on the committee we are a diverse society and our electorate is diverse our council should be diverse our Congress should be diverse in our Select Committee on Intelligence should be even more diverse we're dealing with Fleck city of issues internationally and locally and what the message it sends to our society is that when we have a Muslim on the Intelligence Committee it comes from a military family who has a law enforcement background music we're investing in America and we know that muslims have value seven million Muslims in this country many of them can help they have helped the FBI we don't want the relationship to be purely transactional but when we have Muslims at the forefront we can keep our communities a lot safer and I should correct myself the octave it is the fox guarding the hen house right translation that I get thank you brilliant mayor I understand but it is the criticism really is that appropriate or do you understand that there are some people who may question you though I've not seen people say that Catholics to serve on that committee or Protestants or other faiths your faith does not come up with congressman on that committee it only present your faith seems to be an issue with some around the country I'd never compare myself to John F Kennedy but it certainly came up when he ran for president and it comes up occasionally with other people comes up with my friends at a Latino community it still comes up with some of my friends from the Jewish community when they try to break through class feelings if he but I think it's just small chatter Democrats and Republicans independents of libertarians overwhelmingly have been supportive but you always have your critics that's that's a part of

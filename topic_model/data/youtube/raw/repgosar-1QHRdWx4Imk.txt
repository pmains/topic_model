Thank You mr. chairman the mr. administrator Bouvet thank you for appearing today when did the EPA first learn of the high level lead levels in Flint's water I think there were indications in the spring of 2015 with the testing of miss Walters house and some neighboring houses the very high lead levels were being found there now I understand the the concept you know I deal a lot with water that EPA the Environmental Quality but it's set up as a checks-and-balances we didn't you agree mr. Beauvais EPA has an oversight responsibility would you agree mr. Edwards yes I do yeah so so if something fails there's another line of that should should come about so I'm gonna go along this line at the EPA when did APA administrator McCarthy first been as at Flint about this crisis I believe that yesterday was administrator McCarthy's first visit to Flint was until yesterday that she's visited for the first time mm-hmm so the day before this hearing so administrated Ministry of McCarthy knew about this crisis for eight months but didn't visit Flint till the day before a congressional hearing I don't believe that administrator McCarthy knew about the crisis for eight months really something dynamic is this and you didn't relay that up the chain uh well I came into this job in November of 2015 so I don't have personal knowledge of locations that we're done what's what's today today is it February 2016 right to me when you prioritize and I'm by the way I'm a health care provider I'm a dentist you you triage things like this this is something that is a dynamic tragedy because I it's an ongoing problem wouldn't you agree I agree so wouldn't you put the highest priority on that application to figure out how what went wrong and accept some of the blame and and try to go forward would you not this absolutely is our highest priority I was what sure doesn't show it to me because if she knew in November it's February before she shows up in Flint the EPA has been intensively India in this situation it's the same old thing you got to remember that this is the same EPA that knew about what was going to happen mind blow out in Colorado and now has a lot of people all the way down from Colorado Utah at California and Arizona all at risk because of there are some of their actions so yes everybody builds desires or should take some of the blame but at some of that blame goes to the EPA and it goes to the head honcho just like for me example of me in my office somebody comes into my office and something goes wrong I'm accountable for that I find it despicable that the the Gina McCarthy administrator shows up in Flint yesterday instead of going there immediately particularly when we see the outrage from from the other side and from the people on this audience in regards to children and the lead poisoning that occurs that's just despicable Administrator Bouvet and the EPA an employee Susan had been tried to discuss a series of this memo in emails in July 2015 by saying it was a draft stating the memo should have never been released and stating that the man will never had final approval from the EPA hierarchy kevin has since resigned correct yes doctor had Munoz resigned why'd she resign my understanding is that she resigned in order to make sure that the region and EPA could be fully focused on our response in Flint why wasn't she fired I can't answer that question I she stepped aside in order to make sure that we could focus all of our attention the administrator has that ant that question because we're gonna ask that when the administrators here why wasn't she fired the initial memo was sent in June 24th miss had been promised a final memo was a final memo ever released I believe that the final memo was released in October November November in November was it a comprehensive memo that details the chronic Ness and dynamic aspect of this tragedy this particular memo that mr. del toral did was focused on the testing of lead at miss mrs. Walters house and the neighboring homes but this memo I understand is not even nearly the comprehensive aspect that would you consider it a shell of a release the memo was focused on the specific testing that was done at mrs. Walters house in the neighboring homes was a comprehensive look at that situation it is not the entirety of EPA's review of the situation director Creagh I appreciate your testimony today and you were one person today that is accepting responsibility and your government has governor has pretty than the same through this crisis even though there's fault all the way across that is commendable do you believe this incident could have occurred would have occurred had the Flint city council not voted to change its water source I think this incident occurred because of the lack of orthophosphate being added nobody if you never made the change you would have never had this cat catastrophic event right that's a true statement what would have happened if the city would have followed the directions of its water utility consultant there were a couple of different consultants and it would have minimized the problem and what would have happened if the city would have followed the corrosive the proper corrosive treatment is dr. Edwards stated we would not have had this problem so a series of checks and balances everybody pointing the finger and nobody wanting to take the blame except for yourself and the governor I find that very humbling really bad that the government is is is not being part of the solution here so I with that I yield back I think the gentleman now recognized

I Oh mr. stiverson Thank You mr. chairman Thank You chair Yellen for being here today and I appreciate you have a hard job and I just wanted to ask you a couple questions you just said to the gentleman from Minnesota that private investment is lacking and it is clear that you have reduced the interest rates in the economy which is one factor when people choose to make an investment but at the same time it appears that the increasing regulatory requirements that are passed through to consumers through banks including a capital surcharge on bigger financial firms that's nearly double the international average is four point five percent versus two and a half percent a supplemental leverage ratio that is double six percent versus three percent a liquidity coverage ratio that's more restrictive and punishes certain asset classes and a total loss absorbing capital requirement that doesn't consider things like market making that get capital in the economy it just seems like even though you've reduced interest rates with your monetary policy your regulatory policies are increasing costs and therefore decreasing folks ability to make private investment and also doing it at a such a level higher than the rest of the world it just makes America a less attractive place to place jobs financial service jobs and other jobs and I know you've commented that you want to try to take a look at all that and I really appreciate your willingness to take a look at it I know the European Commission just did a call for evidence to review the ways that their financial regulations are actually working and recalibrate the rules to support both liquidity and markets economic growth and lending do you have any plans to do something similar given that our regulations are so far out of whack with the rest of the international community well I wouldn't comment on text policy but our regulations with respect to banking organizations are not really out of line with international standards we've worked jointly with other countries to try to maintain a level playing field and to raise standards in tandem we've really improved the safety and soundness of the banking system we have a banking system that's extending lots of credit credit is readily available to most corporations loans have been growing and banks are eager to make loans they're priced it low interest rates given this environment so clearly there's no you also showing so interest rates aren't doing enough welcome to my point you see so are you I guess you didn't answer my question are you going to be opening up the regulations for comments the way the European regulators have or not because you've said you will but I've not seen anything on it will that happen or not well we're currently going through the grouper process and good looking at our regulations I do want to compliment governor Tarullo for his comments in the Wall Street Journal recently that acknowledged that small and medium sized banks do not prevent or do not present the same systemic risk and therefore he's going to try to reduce their compliance costs those are the kind of things I'm talking about well and they're great to see in the Wall Street Journal I'd love to see them happen so I want to compliment him on his willingness to say he's going to do that and I just want to encourage you to encourage that to happen because if you know the Office of Financial Research which is charged with doing the research on systemic risk did a study a year ago that showed the systemic risk of all the institutions the sixth largest institutions have an overwhelming majority of the risk in the entire financial system and I think we should concentrate our precious regular Tori capital on those that generate the biggest risk for our system and relieve the folks who don't generate risk from things that don't make sense and so I was really pleased to see governor trillo's comments but I would urge you to to actually implement those I'm very supportive of the things that he said we're focused on it I agree that we want to do everything we can to eliminate burden for those community banks and my time is almost expired but I would urge you and I know that this is our monetary hearing and we have a regulatory hearing every six months as well and I would urge you that I know that governor Trillo is an acting regulatory supervisor he has not been confirmed by the Senate but I would hope you'd bring him with you during that hearing which is coming up thank you I yield back the balance mr. Chairman I might have time the gym

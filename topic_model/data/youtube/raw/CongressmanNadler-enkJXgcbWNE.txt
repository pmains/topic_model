I thank the chairman mr. chairman proposals to split up the ninth circuit court of appeals have been floated since at least 1941 well I was a bad idea at the time of Pearl Harbor remains a bad idea today proponents of splitting up the Ninth Circuit generally mask their arguments and concerns over its size and the supposed that your mental effect this has on judicial efficiency and on the consistency of its rulings they say that it covers too much geographical distance and to larger population to be effective they argue that's because it is so large there is administrative waste there are procedural delays and the judge is unable to work together to produce a consistent and rational jurisprudence however the facts say otherwise it is true that the Ninth Circuit is the largest of the 11 regional circuit courts of Appeal in terms of physical area of population covered and the caseload with the district that includes Alaska Hawaii and the territories of one and memory northern mariana islands is no surprise the judges must occasionally travel great distances to serve the entire circuit but we have things called jet planes and email that make it possible to minimize the disruption that any physical distance may cause indeed that disruption is less today than there was in 1941 and with California is the anchor state in the circuit is unavoidable that it will cover a large population unless you were to split the state in half which would be disastrous from the point of view of judicial coherence a large circuit is just a fact of life but there is simply no evidence that the Ninth Circuit sizes impedance ability to administer justice to the people within its jurisdiction to the extent that there is a somewhat higher backlog of pending cases in the Ninth Circuit compared to other circuits more resources can be devoted to resolving those issues d just yesterday the Judicial Conference recommended adding an additional five judges to the Ninth Circuit which would certainly reduce the workload per judge and technology is being deployed the variety of ways that help improve administrative efficiency there was also no evidence to support the frequently made claim that the Ninth Circuit is a renegade court with wild and unpredictable rulings even the often-cited statistic that the Ninth Circuit is allegedly the most reverse Circuit of the Supreme Court is wildly misleading given the very small sample sizes in so few cases ever reach the Supreme Court it is hard to conclude much from the sometimes modestly higher reversal rate higher rate of reversal that the Ninth Circuit faces by the most conservative Supreme Court many generations indeed the worst numbers cited by critics is two and a half reversals per thousand decisions what this debate is really all about is that conservatives do not like the more liberal rulings that occasionally emerged from the Ninth Circuit they believe they can manufacture a new circuit that will produce more conservative results that is a very different and the more dangerous matter like clockwork with see proposals to split up the Ninth Circuit whenever it delivers a controversial decision with which conservatives disagree whether it is really as the Pledge of Allegiance should not include the words under God overturning restrictions on abortion or gay rights are most recently in synonymous decision to uphold the temporary stay on president Trump's unconstitutional Muslim and Refugee ban the Ninth Circuit has long been in the sights of Republican politicians just last night president Trump said of his campaign rally people are screaming break up to nine certain is a quote quote people are screaming break up the Ninth Circuit I'll tell you what that Ninth Circuit you have to see take a look at how many times they've been overturned with their terrible decisions unquote but to manipulate the federal courts in order to achieve the political ends you seek is highly inappropriate just as there is a nationwide movement to end legislative gerrymandering we should resist this form of judicial gerrymandering as well proponents of splitting up the Ninth Circuit will present the vast array of reasons why it is too large and must be broken up but none of their arguments withstand scrutiny and the proposals that have advanced to solve the alleged harms a site would not actually achieve the results they say they want any proposed 12 circuit would still cover a significant distance and leave in place a large Ninth Circuit based in California all while introducing uncertainty into the law at Great taxpayer expense well I believe that splitting up the Ninth Circuit will be both unnecessary and unwise I appreciate having the opportunity to hear from all our distinguished witnesses on this issue I would note that all three of the judges appearing today like majority of their colleagues in the Ninth Circuit oppose such a split as does the American Bar Association and numerous other practitioners and experts who have studied this issue in great depth I look forward to the judges testimony and to the testimony of our other witnesses and I yield back the balance of my time

thank you mr chairman you know i i i just want to say the suggestion that the chairman's statement saw that those of us who are concerned about climate change change is an over reaction well look at the wildfires in the west how many acres have to go up in smoke look at the flooding in kentucky how many lies has to be lost look at the droughts in the midwest where farmers are producing a fraction of the crop that they would normally produce our colleague senator tester was talking about how on his farm he can't produce as much as he used to because of climate change look at the cattle ranchers who are selling their cattle prematurely because they don't even know if they can keep them alive and look at the northeasters that we get on the east coast and i could go on and on these are tectonic shifts that are affecting our very lives and livelihood and that's an overreaction i think mother nature is not overreacting she's sending us a message flooding is one of the most expensive and most frequent natural disasters in the united states and climate change is only going to intensify these events and it's critical that our communities are prepared for the challenges that lie ahead in new jersey we're leveraging federal resources from community development block grants to build state-of-the-art resilient infrastructure like hoboken's rebuild by design this 230 million dollar mitigation initiative which i help secure funding for will help alleviate repetitive fund flooding and protect against damage from storm surges and for every dollar we invest in mitigation the federal government saves six dollars in disaster relief spending so dr vashallah shouldn't the federal government be investing more in innovative large-scale flood resilience projects like the rebuild by design and in general on mitigation to reduce damages for the costly disaster rate that subsequently comes forth absolutely senator i think the costs of inaction far outweigh the costs of any overreaction and the hoboken example is an excellent one the work in hobo can to reinforce the coast the water system and build public infrastructure like beautiful new parks is also going to protect the local hospital that was under many feet of water after hurricane sandy and so i think we we are failing to be make the connections to where the positive benefits spread through the rest of society in reducing costs in the health care system for example well i appreciate that you know six to one i i i'd be willing to make investments than anything that gives me a six to one rate of return and that's what mitigation does that's why i introduced the bipartisan nfip react which supercharges billions of dollars for pre-disaster mitigation and resilience in the nation's most flood-prone areas uh and i i hope we can get to that because that's gonna not only save us money and save lives it's also gonna create a lot of jobs along the way i've long been a vocal advocate for mass transit in my home state of new jersey and across the country and i'm proud of the work the committee's done under the leadership of chairman brown to advance federal investments in our transit systems including the historic bipartisan infrastructure bill signed into law last year and as a former mayor i've seen firsthand the transformational effect that access to transit can have on a community but transit impacts go beyond just economics the fact is every transit dollar we spend is also in my view a climate dollar mr florida what role do you see transit playing in our communities as we decarbonize our economy well senator mendes as a former mayor you know that transit systems can be the lifeblood of a city they help us make become more connected give workers access to jobs and bring together economies and areas that didn't have bridges connecting each other before as we work with ohio communities one of the key recommendations we have is to invest in mass transit as you know mass transit as you said every investment we make there is a climate dollar every dollar we invest there is a climate dollar mass transit is a far less carbon intensive way of transportation than single occupancy vehicles and as we also know transportation is now the largest emitter of greenhouse gases the largest economic sector emitting greenhouse gas emissions in the united states yeah so taking off from that uh how will creating more livable walkable communities help not only to lower a greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainability but also reduce costs for consumers and promote affordability this is the essence of something i call the livable communities act where we try to uh look at both the housing needs that exist we had a hearing the other day in our country and at the same time create the linkages to existing infrastructure on transit and they create access to jobs what's your view on that one of the key areas we work with ohio communities on is to make their communities more livable and walkable and this means central planning as you discussed uh it helps ensure that we're preserving public health and have access to green space it is a critical piece of our sustainability future um but i think i want to point to your your example on reducing costs because i think this is a really important one and one that you all are considering with the inflation reduction act um the technology and the economics have now aligned where we have opportunity to invest in technologies that will reduce our emissions and save us money save consumers money but this is not as easy as it sounds we're fighting up against incumbent industries that have been at it for generations and in order to do that we have to make sure that they have that barrier to entry lowered and that they can get into the market and so i think this is a really important point that you all are investing in and encourage that thank you thank you joe

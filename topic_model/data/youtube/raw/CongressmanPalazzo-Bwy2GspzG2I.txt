Mr Speaker I rise today to honor the courage sacrifice and service of members of the greatest generation from my district Navy veteran art Albert from Hattiesburg and mr. John rounsaville of Jones County Mississippi mr. Albert truly exemplifies dedicated selfless service having fought in World War two the Korean War in the Vietnam War I first met mr. Albert during the Mississippi Gulf Coast honor flight which brings World War two veterans to Washington to see their memorial last month I had the opportunity to speak with mr. Albert at the victory of Japan day anniversary ceremony in Hawaii here I learned that art was serving as a machinist mate aboard the USS missouri on September's second 1945 where he witnessed the Japanese formally surrendered to the United States ending World War two although he would disagree like so many of his contemporaries to focus not on his service but the greatness of our nation as a whole art Albert is a true American Hero through his service and his quiet work building our great nation at home he has brought honor to himself the state of Mississippi in the United States of America I am honored to have him as a constituent and to have the opportunity to know him both as a person and as an enduring example of the values that have made America great

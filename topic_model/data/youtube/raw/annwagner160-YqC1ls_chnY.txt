their perspectives unpaid leave so please join me in welcoming representative Crenshaw representative Wagner representative velour ski representative Cunningham and representative Alfred let's give them a round of applause if this is on I am on we just concluded as you know a fantastic panel with the Senators and now we'll hear from members of the US House of Representatives who have taken a leading role in advancing paid leave again my name is Laurie Todd Smith I'm the director of the women's Bureau at the United States Department of Labor my experience over the last thirty years has been focused on education workforce and early childhood development early child as child's early relationships are critical in shaping brain development specifically for the first three years of life a child's early learning connections is so important in shaping their brain development specifically for those first three years so a person's ability to contribute to society and workforce begins at birth it's critical that investments in early childhood begin on day one in the most crucial time of brain development just some food for thought as we add to the conversation on why paid leave is so important so let's get to it directly hearing from the people who are leading on this work we'll go through one round of questions and if time allows I have additional group discussion questions so I'm going to start with representative velour ski as a member of the House Ways and Means Committee what would be the advantage to working families of having a paid leave policy how do you think that would benefit our nation's economy sure thank you very much today I can tell you we've been looking for about the last year on what the concept of paid time leave would look like and one of the things that we did is the deep dive in the private sector to look at what our small business is doing what can we do to better get women off the sidelines back into the working economy how can we do that without mandates and how can we do that where small business could be a big part of this as well so one of the things that we've been looking at is the concept of using the private market as a partner there's a lot of companies already out there in this country they have paid parental leave and if you look at what the private sector is doing which is kind of all over the map but something that we could do as as a phase in a phase one I think are really targeted towards women and Millennials but absolutely want to spend quality time with their families they want to do more things than just you know being at work they're great employees they've been there a long time or in this case Millennials getting into the market but we looked at ways that we could pool resources together be a partner with the government not necessarily having it just purely government funded but we've got so much great information back for the private sector that and passing the in the National Defense Authorization budget with the paid time off piece that's in there right now looking at mothers having children adopting children or adopting or foster care I think we do look at those three principles in this country and we already have an example in front of us today we've just found and all the research we've done any women off the sidelines are back into the workforce is one of the best things we can do for certainty and security in our own country so I am grateful having a chance to chat with all of you today and I'm very grateful than Defense Authorization budget has actually put a set in stone example of where we're heading in this country in a bipartisan area ended by personally great thank you so much representative Cunningham you are a self-described advocate I love that term as a father can you also speak to the importance of ensuring that both parents have access to paid leave it's like nothing else I think it means something my son boots at home and you know he's almost 2 years old and our journey was a little bit non-traditional should you say we we did our big rollouts announce them that I was running for Congress and literally the next day my wife found out she's pregnant and so it's just like buckle in and so you know the first year and a half has been quite a ride obviously with everything else but you know the end of the day it's a team effort and you know she had a complicated pregnancy and delivery where she lost a lot of blood and had a transfusion and and was in the hospital and I was working for a small law firm and the law firm was already being you know open enough with me campaigning and she delivered our son on Saturday and on Monday I was back at work and you know that's the reality for a lot of people because look less than 10% of employers in our country offer paternity leave and you know I regret that I regret not being able to be at home with her more especially during those first critical few weeks number one for the bonding of my son boon and also just being there for my wife and you know it's tough it's real it's really tough kid there's no manual for for having kids and you come home with with this baby and you're like what do I do now and you know he's crying you know why so you know we're getting launched into that it's it's tough and it's emotionally draining and you know I think just just have it just being there for your significant other for the person you love it just means the world and it takes a unit it truly does and and so that's why I think that you know some of the other countries are far ahead of us in this in this realm and and we need to play catch-up because and it's not only just the right thing to do you know but I do think that it's it benefits our country of benefits economically later on down the road just to to keep families together and during those during those hard times those tough times emotionally so you know I think it's I think it's more you know more traditional and in the past where we offer leave for just at mothers but the the spouses as well need to be on that same level too and I'm glad to see that we're we're moving that way in an in a bipartisan way Democrats and Republicans because you know we're humans first before we get up here and we're fathers and mothers and yeah and how and hopefully after to you know the in Freudian slip the but yeah I'm glad to see the face of Congress changing too you know it became in a very powerful freshman class with a lot young people and who had who had these experiences and who can hopefully transform these experiences into legislation impacts everyone so much okay representative Crenshaw you're the co-sponsor of the new parents Act why do you think it's important for Congress to lead on paid leave well there's a there's a deeper reason it's I think it's the sustainability of our civilization you know where we're as being millennial we're having we're getting married later or having kids later and there's a variety of factors for that you know cultural factors societal factors and but possibly this factor as well the fact that it's difficult to have kids and it's difficult to afford it so that there's a reason I think we should lead on it and there's there's vast agreement that there should be some kind of program there and then the question becomes how do you do it in a sustainable way okay and how do we do it without really overburdening those same children that we want to have with an increasing debt an unsustainable program so we have to get creative about how to do that and I think that's exactly what this panel is about everybody here has their different ideas on how to do that that the concept remains basically the same we're trying to borrow from benefits that we already have so the new new Parent Act which which represented Wagner is on as well and you know brought me on so thank you she's really the leader on this one in the house I just want to be clear about that and I'm proud to be part of it because it makes sense okay fiscally it makes sense and it makes sense for the the core idea that we're getting at that everybody here is talking about which is you you we already have an aging society and that's going to put pressures on us fiscally and culturally that are gonna be very difficult we have to address that but we're seeing it play out in other nations we're actually doing pretty well in America you look at Japan or China or Europe they're vastly aging population and that puts pressures like bad bad pressures on their on their fiscal situation that we're going to that we're some that we're going to be viewing as well and in dealing with and having kids it's the way out of some of those problems and whether it's a new parent act or the other other proposals out here a smart creative way to address that problem is what we should be talking about and so I'm just proud to be part of that great thank you so much okay representative Wagner the women's Bureau held listening sessions across the country I mentioned this in the earlier panel on paid leave we consistently heard about flexibility and how important that is in the plan what do you think are the key components for a good plan well a flexibility is very very important for mainly for the for the parents but also for the employers we've got to be able to work with your employers to build a paid family leave program that works for business and works for for the new parents I mean we're hearing on this this panel now I I was paid family leave before paid family leave was cool I'm not just a mom I'm a grand mom and and have employed countless young people who are new parents and I think it's it's a shame that we are the only country in the industrialized world that does not have a full on paid family leave program and I insist that we're gonna fight for that and I have and everywhere that I've been employed I started it the the family leave program when I was at the Republican National Committee the first one ever and have carried that on once getting here to to Congress yesterday huge victory was NDAA what a win-win and two leaves and I mean I have to give tremendous kudos to our leadership on both sides of the aisle in Congress to our president who it feels very passionately about paid family leave to Ivanka Trump who's brought us all together on this and and what the new parent Act does is adds maximum flexibility in terms of taking either you can take one month you could take two months you could take three months you could take grapes in between you could do a month and then take half days and then whatever you want to build is what we want without mandates without raising your payroll tax something that's this budget neutral that offers the kind of flexibility that both employers and that young parents want but we've heard on this panel from some of the young dads and soon-to-be dads I'm sure and moms it's is that this is a time having a child is a time of great joy but it can also be time of anxiety especially when you're young and and you're working and it's all new and you've got rent to pay and and and mortgages and and and food and then there's there's diapers and sleepless nights and all the things that they come with this incredible joy of being a parent and we need to make this as positive an experience for the parents and and for that you born precious child and and then workout for the employer - and I do believe that that paid family leave will enable especially moms to get back into the workforce sooner faster and and stater they're less dependent upon government programs oftentimes as a result they get back to work and and that's eventually what we want so I think that it's good from an economic standpoint good for our children and our families we can make it good for our businesses and I am just so pleased and proud that we certainly as a Republican Party are finally talking about this and moving things forward on a bipartisan basis so I'm grateful for the movement we've seen for the the the out crying of support and listening to our constituents and and doing the right thing for our families great thank you so much one more question you've been waiting patiently representative Allred as you know does a bipartisan topic and it needs support across party lines in order to become a reality what do you think is a realistic path forward well thank you and the son okay there go ahead as I was talking about sleepless nights I was think about my son Jordan who I was up with from 1:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m. last night but my wife and I like Joe we planned very well we had a baby a month in to my time here in Congress we don't have a leave policy for members of Congress so I gave myself two weeks off it wasn't off of course you know it was changing a lot of diapers and helping out and being there and I'm glad that we do have bipartisan efforts around this because this is not a partisan issue everyone is going to experience the same things and they're going to need their government to do everything we can to try and give them some flexibility so we have a bill that at least Stefanik and I introduced in the house that dr. Cassidy and Kristen cinéma introduced in the Senate to bring forward child tax credits allow people to take up to $5,000 of the child tax credit in their first year just to give you a flexibility it's not everywhere I want to get it's not the end goal that I want to end up with but that flexibility I think is incredibly important and some of these smaller steps that we're taking although I think the NDA is not a small step I think it's a really big step but I think they're going to lead us down the road of getting to a bipartisan consensus hopefully around a national program here and we have to you know I think that people expect us to do this and I think you know all the tensions that Dan mentioned are are very real these are things that are going to just be increasing and in our modern society and with all the demands that are placed on parents we're going to be responsive to that you know I'm I was raised by a single mother my mom taught in public schools and I can tell you that you know families are making tough choices out there they're making very very tough choices and when you have a child come along with her through adoption or or you you know give birth to one those choices become even tougher and so anything that we can do to ease that tension and to make sure that these folks remain productive citizens productive workers that their kids get that crucial crucial early days with their with their family members is is so important you know the Department of Labor when I took my my leave from Congress back in February at when our son was born did a press release we attached a Department of Labor study about the importance of paternity leave and how important it is and how the outcomes are better for families overall when men take leave as well but their outcomes are better for the women things are better less violence in the home better economic outcomes I mean it's it's really there's very few things you see that have such a positive impact across the board as as when you have both parents taking leave and both having time off and so I think we're all trying to work towards that and I'm thankful for that I'm thankful that you know even though this climate that were in now that we're trying to find bipartisan consensus on these issues and I agree with Anna Mae I think this is what our folks expect of us and that's what they sent us here to do it's excellent to kind of piggyback on what you just talked about a little bit I'll throw a general question outs you're all welcome to respond but a newborn baby parents with a newborn Barrie if parents have this tremendous financial impact with the expenses of the first year of life can you talk a little bit about how paid leave helps support the financial stability of the family whoever one's taken I'm happy to just drop a note on the line but I think it's critical because remember that you know when childbearing age is is young I was was able to take advantage of a major corporation that had a paid leave program but I also with one of my children was on my own and as I said the expenses that come from running a household as a as a young married couple and and and the expenses that come from a newborn child are key so this is a critical point in time where some amount of money whether you're doing what Marco Rubio's that are Rubio and Dan Crenshaw and I have been working on by taking it on your own social security once you've paid in for a certain amount of time but an advance on your own social security so take it early knowing that upon retirement you've got three choices you can you can pay a little bit more back for a period of time you could delay for a year or two or you could do an I would have done which is I would have taken that money in my when I was 29 years old and and then just paid it back when I was 40-something years old when I was a little bit more financially stable so the key here is to recognize how important it is to to provide some kind of money and support to a new family as they are venturing into this exciting and joy of a new child because it makes a difference every dollar makes a difference and if you've got enough money to feel comfortable in doing staying home with a child I do believe you're more likely to go back into the workforce you're less likely as I said to get end up on on a dependent government program long term I think there are great benefits for our society for economy and I think it's allowing us that the the ctc of the child tax credit advanced the same kind of concept where they're able to get a chunk of money early on that that then it's slowly gradually paid back as a gets our feet underground more so that really amount of money that paid leave program for both moms and dads is key excellent yeah I think an area that we looked at as well in ways and means was the financial stability to single moms that are out there and how connected they are to this concept of paid time off and if there's one consistent message that I hear in my district and we are involved in my district and a lot of frontline right there help in in different kinds of programs and different kinds of ways to connect single moms would still have in their part of the American Dream and to be able to be successful we look at this as a frig a new bridge a bipartisan bridge and a bridge that literally is created I think out of the heart and passion of this president and you know when Ann mentioned is the second ago I thought about the first time I met with Ivanka Trump which was months ago on this issue and nobody else in government was talking about it there was no concept there was no putting anything together it was kind of a you know Republicans they haven't really shown a whole lot of interest in that and I have been amazed myself for the work that we've been able to do in our districts and then come back and report that information and the unbelievable partnership between what Ivanka's done to get this done through the NDAA as a great place to look at it as a model and then you're gonna hear from the president soon his passion for the American worker to get men and women off the sidelines back into establishing healthy successful families so they can reach the American dream and I'll tell you this is one of the most passionate group I've ever worked with and I've been in government this is the fastest I've ever seen something turnaround as this is turning around so I'm telling you for all of you out there that have supported this from our president and from Ivanka I am honored to be a part of this and I do believe that next year we'll see rock-solid legislation with everybody's heads together opening a whole new door for the American people and I think it's going to be a bridge of hope for single moms [Music] and I'll just add you know reiterate that government has a strong interest in keeping families together you know they're less - less likely to be dependent upon government programs and and and and money and and you know the those of us who have at one point live paycheck to paycheck and hand them out realize that you know the the strain of being um you know financially strapped it's not just what you can and can't buy but it's the emotional toll it takes on you and you know I remember my wife tell me stories that her being in a room with her little sister and hearing that yelling and the screaming next door from her parents is all based upon money it's all based upon you know not having the resources to buy X Y or Z and so you know and that's oftentimes what leads families to breaking apart it's a financial stress so by leaving it it's not just about you know about buying what you need to buy but it's about relieving that anxiety and relieving those pressures and and making families more likely to stick together because some of their problems are alleviated and I think that's the core of it that's why this is so important emphasized the the flexibility aspect of this and this is again just being a millennial even on the elder spectrum of the Millennials I understand I understand what we like right and we like flexibility and we also understand something very fundamental which is that the best indicator of your wealth is your age so the older you are the more likely it is that you're wealthy so if you're in your late 60's and you're about to retire for Social on Social Security there's a good chance that you've had the time to build up assets build up a business build up savings and wouldn't you like to give that money right back to your 25 year old self 30 year old self while you had your first baby of course you would of course you would choose to do that right and that's the whole concept behind that the new parent act and it's a really good concept it doesn't add to our long-term debt and it's it's it's it provides that flexibility in it and it also keeps some skin in the game right it's it's not a handout right you're just borrowing from your future benefits and and you know that you have to pay that back because you know that having a child is an investment just like everything else you do as an investment whether you're on a student loan or getting your first mortgage your family is an investment and this allows you to invest in that without all the worries that a lot of new parents I think inherently understand and add to that with a new parent act it also it is the solvency of the trust fund is not touched anybody who is a current or a future social security a beneficiary is not impacted in a way shape or form that the business owner is not either it is truly we have to start thinking about this as our own money in advance on what is ours whether it has with the tax credits or whether it has to do with your social security benefit and and and when you talked about the economics of it the flexibility of it the anxiety the stressors it's it's it's during that early time period but you're not as financially stable and that's what we're trying to provide so and that's what works talk about excellent points so we just have a few minutes left it went fast you all talk really well so how about we just do last thoughts again at the end here and then I have a couple of comments at the very end so we'll start with you at the other end this time and work this way would you like to go first last thoughts on paid leave frankly and as well may be I think some of those who didn't get to have their there that the answer to the next question I'll give my time I'll give my time away because I you know I just really want to emphasize the flexibility of it and how important this is for the younger generation iPhone applaud an on passno an opportunity to speak yeah member of Congress that's a rarity yeah no I just want to thank everyone on on this stage and and the fact that everyone's showing up and and putting down any partisan differences and and at the end of the day trying to make some changes they're beneficial for young families because of the strike and you know highlight enough that the stress and the strain is you know my older brother told me one time he's like I don't feel sorry for anyone who doesn't have kids you know that under under scores just the stress and anxiety of it and so we need to be I think as you know as stewards of our tax dollars up here just making it easier for young parents and not more difficult I'm and I'm glad to be part of something that's doing that I think I'll just recap what I said earlier this is this is a phenomenal phenomenal concept to see government working from grassroots up and to see bicameral bipartisan government coming together and saying we believe in healthy stable families we believe in the American Dream is available to every single person in this country from single moms to very stable stable families now and in order to secure our economic momentum right now in this country is investing in its workers its families and standing together for the value of what that means for having children adopting children and for fostering children in this country that need a good new permanent home and I say to everybody on this stage today to our President and to those who have been involved this is what we're seeing is the new age of the American worker and nobody is left behind thank you for all of your interest [Music] [Applause] I would just say I'm gonna continue to fight for for paid family leave and that we get that and that we find a bipartisan consensus I will say to everyone who's in this space who works in this area who is passionate about this that we can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good there you know there are families as I said they're making very tough choices you know I was raised by a single mother when we were at the end of the month there was some tough times and he had to wait til the next paycheck came in and if families can't wait for us to have a complete consensus or one party control or or you know they don't have time for us to do that they need us to do something now and it is to act I think that's what they sent us here to do and I think that you know when you talk to people out there who are really you know in the throes of this which I am right now but we're lucky but who are really struggling through this you understand the urgency of this issue and so I want to thank everyone involved with this panel and with the legislation that we are you know considering because I do think that this is not the kind of an issue that we can put off and just say well this is our end goal and it's gonna be 10 20 years before we do something about this I'm hoping that we can have something done much sooner than that and I think with conversations like this is how that happens well as the only grandma on the panel our glammo I'm happy to pave the way all right and in and literally you know it's it's it's far overdue our time is now we are the only industrialized country in the world without a paid family leave program and I'm gonna do everything I can as I have through my entire working world to make sure that we are doing the right thing right by our families by our children by our workers by our taxpayers the time is past due and it is up to us to act and to act now and to act together so thank you all for your tremendous interest it is a labor of love so thank you thank you to the panel and thank you all to you I've been reflecting over the last hour about the women's Bureau and next year the women's Bureau will be a hundred years old on June 20th and thinking about issues as they relate to helping working families is something we've been working on for a long time so the fact that we're poised to make paid family leave a reality is truly remarkable so I want to thank all of you for being here everyone and watching online as well for your commitment to America's working families thank you so much

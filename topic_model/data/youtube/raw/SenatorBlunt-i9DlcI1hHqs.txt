and a president something I want to talk about days something you and I both care a lot about and that's farming families and trade you know for those of us who grew up on or near farming families we know that there are a lot of things that are beyond the control of families who farm for farming and ranching families the only real certainty is uncertainty the only thing you know for sure if your mom and dad are dairy farmers like my mom and dad were is you don't know for sure you don't know about the weather you don't know absolutely for sure that your equipment is all going to work exactly like you need it to at exactly the time you need it to in some farming situations you don't know whether the help you need is going to be available the day you need it the watermelons can't wait the strawberries can't wait the tomatoes can't wait but you can't have a staff on all the time ready to pick the watermelon the two weeks they needed to be picked or whatever those farmers have to deal with but uncertainty is part of farming that's why trade agreements with other countries are so important to America's agriculture and this is a part of our economy that not only feeds our country but goes so far toward feeding the whole world trade agreements can provide a little bit of certainty about markets and the opportunities that people that have to sell the products that they're able to grow in Missouri agriculture is an eighty eight billion dollar industry it employs nearly 400,000 people in our state Missouri farmers and ranchers export export more than four billion dollars worth of products every year trade deals that lower goods on that we're trying to ship that lower tariffs on goods that are paid by Missouri farming and ranching families are a good deal now I could go a long way beyond this to because only does the agricultural sector impact people who make agricultural product seeds chemicals that we need fewer and fewer of all the time because they get more effective all the time both in the seed and chemical area people who make and repairs machinery but people in transportation people and insurance people who run the local coffee shop people who the school district depends on for those property taxes all are benefited by a strong agricultural sector now we make lots of other things in our state too we make airplanes we make pickup trucks we make car as we make beer cans we make all kinds of things are impacted by trade but particularly when you and I are out talking senator in our neighboring states with are the communities we deal with in agriculture trade is a top-of-the-line issue it's just an important part of the economy of most of our states frankly because of our location where we live infrastructure is critical we're also the hub for products that go all over North America but that integrating that infrastructure into water and and rail and cars and trucks all make a difference in how we compete now Canada and Mexico are our two biggest trading partners in I'm sure our state and I know in the country Mexico in recent months has become the biggest trading partner we have Canada the next biggest trading partner we have these are not inconsequential relationships when the United States signed the North American Free Trade Agreement 25 years ago it did a lot to open those markets for our products and to not only strengthen our economy but to strengthen the neighborhood our exports of food and agricultural products to Canada and Mexico quadrupled under the NAFTA agreement the treaty also helped to strengthen ties among our countries you know a strong Mexico is actually good for us we have these problems at the border right now that Mexico is trying to help us solve almost nobody is coming from Mexico they're coming through Mexico and why aren't they coming from Mexico like they did 25 years ago because the Mexican Mexican economy is an economy that works for people who live there strong Canada is good for us there is more that the daily trade over that canadian-us border of things passing back and forth is incredible and has been for a long time but it's also much stronger than it used to be keeping these connections strong is essential trade increases our economic security but it also increases our national security living in a good neighborhood is what we all want to do and that's the value we've seen out of this Agreement for the last 25 years now the the agreement could have been better and the president's made it better the u.s. MCA is going to be better than NAFTA know NAFTA would be a bad thing NAFTA replaced by US MCA would be a good thing it's time that we begin to build on what we've learned in that 25 years and move into this century with a new agreement that works for farming families for ranching families for workers for people who again make automobiles and airplanes and other things this leads to more American jobs and it leads to great benefit for us economically but again let me repeat the the national security impact of having two neighbors that want to work with us what we just saw the president negotiate with Mexico where they're helping secure that much narrower border at the southern tip of Mexico then we would be able to do at the much bigger northern border that's helpful we're there working to help people stay there as their cases are being heard that's helpful to our country easier to keep keep people there and have their cases heard then let them dispersed throughout the entire United States certainly we hope to gain from the new u.s. MCA treaty but we hope our neighbors all so benefit from that treaty and no they will the three countries all signed this agreement in November Mexico's ratifying it already the Prime Minister of Canada says they stand ready to call their parliament back into section into session to ratify it as soon as it's clear we're going to trade is essential all three of our countries agree on that Democrats and Republicans agree on that members of the House and Senate agree on that now what we need to agree on is how to have a time to vote and approve this deal let's give our economy the boost its need let's give our neighborhood the strength that we've seen developed over the last 25 years Madam President we hope our friends in the house bring this to the floor it'll be a bipartisan vote it will be a comfortably passed vote but you have to decide to have the vote for that to happen and I hope we're close to that moment

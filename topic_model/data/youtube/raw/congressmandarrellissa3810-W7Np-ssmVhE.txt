former congressman and current congressional candidate our friend daryl eisen joins me now i'm going to call you congressman because you were and you probably will be again uh okay uh china uh how do we make it accountable uh and with the closure of the uh consulate in houston uh it appears that there's a lot more going on than most americans know what can you tell us congressman well there's a lot more going on and it's been going on for decades under the biden era those eight years china was allowed to expand its footprint of the united states they were allowed to increase the trade deficit by vast amounts under the trump doctrine first we looked at trading partners where we could make deals better like canada and mexico then the president turned on to china entered into agreements but said they'd have to live up to standards the rest of the world appreciates and is willing to live up to and one of them is not having state-sponsored espionage of our commercial industrial and obviously uh military secrets and that's where china is not making it and that's where the trump doctrine now with secretary pompeo and others is engaging in the kind of activities that china understands which is if they won't play by the rules then we're going to take their spies and shut them down and that's what the president's doing and it's the next step in a trump doctrine that he promised when he campaigned and he's been delivering for three and a half years you know what's amazing uh a congressman speaking to congressman kevin mccarthy earlier he talked about legislation that they tried to get passed on on issues relating to china and its obvious malfeasance and you know the democrats would have no part of it uh and and what's stunning to me is the president was on all of this before china unleashed the virus before china lied about the virus before they sent defective ppe equipment before they insisted that people they sent the ppe to said thank you when it was defective i mean what else can we do in this are in this fight well it's pretty clear and i spent two decades legislating that it's not about legislation the rule of law and the rule of international law is something that the president already has the tools the difference between this president and the last administration with vice president biden is that this president has the will to engage you see it with china you saw it with canada and mexico and quite frankly you see it where he's defending our federal assets around the country because he knows the law is on his side and he's using the power of the president in a way the last administration didn't and the next administration if it's biden won't oh okay and in the short time that we have left you know i think the president had a good week this week uh it appears that you know he is you know fighting for law and order uh you know with foreign policies now getting it on the right track uh he's fighting for federal employees inside the the facilities uh and and sending uh help uh and he's sticking to law and order it's classic donald trump what do you say the president had a great week because the president wasn't hunkered down the president was doing his job he was expending that vast amount of energy greater than any president of the many i've served with uh that's where the president shines versus somebody who hides in a bunker reads from a teleprompter and then doesn't even get that right sometimes the fact is the president has the courage to go and take questions any and all questions and he has the he has the willingness to realize that he has to change sometimes what he's been doing when conditions and the science is appropriately changing and that's what we're doing right now we're seeing a president reacting to the science as it is and showing the leadership that president trump is now famous for all right daryl eliza thanks so much for being with us

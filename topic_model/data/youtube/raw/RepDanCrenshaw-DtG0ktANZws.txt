keep being lied to i hate being lied to and this video is about you being lied to by the democrat party regarding all of these election integrity reforms that have been happening across the country but especially in places like georgia in my home state of texas they'll say things like it's racist voter suppressions threatening democracy stealing the right to vote they'll talk about these election law reforms being jim crow laws on steroids jim crow 2.0 here's the truth about what's actually getting passed and how that matches up against the democrats dishonest rhetoric [Music] first let's look at georgia joe biden claimed that the laws passed their amount to jim crow on steroids it must be pretty bad right jim crow voting restrictions by the way included poll taxes literacy tests and other racist means to forcibly prevent black people from voting so these george laws have to be much worse than those jim crow laws right because these are jumpcro on steroids well no even the washington post had to debunk joe biden's lies about the georgia laws saying in reality election day hours were not changed and the opportunities to cast a ballot in early voting were actually expanded that's the washington post by the way more than that there are many democrat states that allow fewer days of early voting than the georgia or texas law requires including joe biden's home state of delaware when it comes to voter id requirements eighty percent of americans favor common sense voter id requirements and georgia is even accepting alternatives to driver's licenses to verify absentee voters democrats want you to believe that voter id laws lead to voter suppression but is that true does requiring a government issued id to vote really suppress minority communities no first of all just ask them but if we want to look at data researchers for the national bureau of economic research found that between 2008 and 2016 voter id laws had no negative effect on registration or turnout overall or for any specific group defined by race gender age or party affiliation in other words democrats are lying to you now let's take a look at texas where the state legislature is debating bills that houston's mayor sylvester turner called jim crow 2.0 voter suppression is wrong and these bills represent jim crow 2.0 but here's what the bills actually do put safeguards in place so poll watchers aren't denied access improving transparency and confidence in the results protects individuals who require assistance such as seniors those with vision problems by requiring information from the assister why because those voters are more likely to be victimized bipartisan activists claiming to be helping somebody with a disability it also increases penalties against ballot harvesting which is the practice of gathering and submitting completed absentee or mail and voter ballots by a third party or individuals volunteers or workers rather than submission by voters themselves directly to ballot collection sites it also creates uniformity in early voting times to reduce confusion while ensuring at least 12 hours a day and polling places can be open until 9 pm this fixes the different voting times in different counties that were confusing voters in the past election it prohibits universal drive-through voting which was a logistical nightmare also prohibits election officials from distributing mail-in applications to people who didn't request one and ensures polling places and machines are distributed fairly based on number of eligible voters democrats claimed we're trying to remove voting stations from democrat held areas but that's not true at all it's about establishing a standardized formula that is based on the number of eligible voters and when it comes to when it comes to mailing out mail-in ballots to people who didn't request them that's a big issue in a lot of states you might receive a ballot with other people's names on it and when you see that ballot with somebody else's name on it and you know that you could fill it out and just turn it in well that removes confidence in the entire election these reforms also require that voting machines are able to produce a paper audit trail requires live streaming accounting for large counties as well so does any of that sound like racist voter suppression no of course not the majority of these reforms simply unwind the emergency measures implemented during the pandemic so why are democrats lying about these voter integrity measures because they need an excuse to pass hr1 they call it for the people act which would make permanent every problematic reform that led to the chaos of the 2020 election it would basically make voter id laws obsolete puts federal government in charge of every election procedure in every single state that's why they want you to believe these bills are supposedly racist supposedly voter suppression republicans that just want to end democracy as we know it here's what's woke code for though republicans trying to make our elections more secure here's the thing i don't think democrats want secure elections i think they like the chaos they like you to distrust the election process none of these reforms are outside the bounds of normalcy for common sense most americans agree with that that's the truth

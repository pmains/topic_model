but famous chairman you know al Qaeda stated goal is to bring down the infidel in Western civilization I was the chief of counterterrorism the Justice Department it's clear the hijackers came from a certain background we can't deny the fact that they were Muslim major Assad just north of my district in Fort Hood was radicalized by allah ki at a yemen and right next to my district killed 13 soldiers now went to the funeral I saw the birds the combat boots in the in the rifles this is real it's real stuff in Miss Patel for you to say that these hearings or do not rest on firm factual basis i would say you talked to those families and when you say they adopt we adopt a view of radicalization the treats religious belief as a precursor to terrorism i would argue that we have to look at the obvious that there is a religious component to this it doesn't reflect the vast majority of Muslims I agree the vast majority are good law-abiding citizens but there are those within the United States the enemy within that do you want to do is harmed and bring down this nation and kill our soldiers and kill innocent civilians like Daniel Pearl who is Slade as you vary dramatically missin the money to testify to ninety percent as a chairman said of these acts are committed by one percent of the population so I understand your statistics but when you look at the overall picture I strongly disagree with your testimony and I find it somewhat offensive to to the victims I don't know if you have any comments of that I think the one comment I would make is that you know I live in this country I live and work in New York City right by ground 0 I have two kids they go to school every day they take the subway I'm a mother I think about their safety I to worry about terrorism I too am NOT unsympathetic to people whose families died because of violence and terrorism of course not but i think the the best way to keep our country safe is to use evidence to drive counterterrorism policy and when I look at the studies and what they show me they show me that using religiosity or using ideology as a predictor for who is going to become a terrorist and who is not simply doesn't work can I can I just this stuff in that because I I think ideology is important i think the moderate Muslim is the most effective weapon we have against radical Islam I think we can defeat them on the battlefield and we have but we can't kill it I mean it's an ideology it's a struggle for ideology and and that at the end of the day are we going to win or lose it some would say the war on terror is over and that presumes that radical Islam is is over I would argue radical as long as unfortunately alive and well and it's an ideological struggle that if we don't win this it will bring down Western civilization i want i'd like to get the other panelists viewpoint on how do we win this war on ideology and and are we in fact or in fact winning yet well sir um i believe that you society the united kingdom the government of the united kingdom has directly now confronted this real phenomena that you're talking about that we also have non violent extremism it is the rhetoric that dr. Jasser is talking about that is in our mosques it is the theology that is being exported from the government of Saudi Arabia into our country and this is a very difficult conversation to be had I know because the government of Saudi Arabia is an ally but I will tell you that as a woman inside of my faith one of the hardest parts about practicing my faith is the interpretation of Islam that comes out of Saudi Arabia and tells me in my mosques here in America that I have to sit behind a wall that I have to sit in the basement maybe sometimes I don't even get a room and so from mosques from Seattle to Los Angeles to Washington DC and the Upper East Side of New York City I've been thrown out of those moths because I've dared to believe something that the civil rights movement taught me which is separate is not equal and yet it is a theology that comes out of Saudi Arabia that practice that makes that a practice in the US and I would argue becomes a dangerous precursor for violence extremism it's not definitely a certain indicator but once you go down that slippery slope of interpretation it becomes dangerous see my time is expired Thank You mr. chairman

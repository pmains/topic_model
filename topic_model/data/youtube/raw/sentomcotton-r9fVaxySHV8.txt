joining us now is the senator from the great state of Arkansas Tom Cotton senator I'm not going to ask you about the house I assume you left for a reason so I'm not going to ask you about what's going on in the house I do want to I do want to ask you quickly the Senate leadership challenge was that about the midterms is there some deeper issue and will the Senators be able to put it behind them going into the new year well I did leave the house trapped for just two years I remember about three or four months in people like you and Jim Jordan and others were encouraging you to run for the Senate I thought you had a lot of confidence in me but then I began to realize maybe you're just trying to get me out of your hair since you stuck around for another six years in the House of Representatives um look we had very good Frank conversations those were private deliberations obviously the race was settled we re-elected Mitch McConnell's our Republican leader and a whole slate of Republican uh leaders uh in slots two through six one thing we all agreed on coming out of those conversations this past week is that we still need to focus on the election that's remaining in 2022 and that's the runoff in Georgia with Herschel Walker there's a big difference between having a 50 50 Senate as we've seen over the last two years and having a senate that's 51.49 giving the Democrats much easier control of the agenda you remember what it was like when I was in the house with you in 2013 and 14 with a Democratic Senate and a democratic press and it's tough enough if you have an evenly divided Senate but it's even tougher for Kevin McCarthy than the House Republicans with a majority Democratic Senate so we all really need to focus over these next two plus weeks on helping elect Herschel Walker in Georgia all right Senator it looked like a tough electoral map for Republicans this time around 2024 looks a little bit better I mean I know you know we don't want to take anything for granted but but but the the future looks a little bit better in 2024 is there any chance at all the acrimony if there is acrimony persist or you think the conference is Unified going forward I think largely unified Trey again I saw the reports about anger and tension in our private conversations I didn't sense that at all people who did I say have a pretty low threshold for anger and tension it's a lot worse in my days in the Army you're right though about the 2024 election once we get through this runoff in Georgia and hopefully we'll or hopefully elect Herschel Walker Democrats are going to be competing in 2024 in States like West Virginia Pennsylvania Ohio Montana New Mexico one thing that I think the new Congressional Republican majority of the house should focus on that we'll want to focus on in the Senate is helping restore America's energy Independence all those States I just mentioned to you in addition to having Democratic senators also produce a lot of energy whether it's coal or oil or natural gas we need to begin begin to restore America's energy Independence which will help bring down the prices not just for your home heating bill and filling up at the gas pump but the prices for everything I think that will do a lot to help Americans if we can help get the focus back on America's energy Independence all right I want to ask you about your book I declined by Design intentional rather than incompetent however people want to phrase it it seems like your argument is that there is intentionality on the left and the positions they take that are resulting in the decline of our country yeah Trey and Only the Strong I lay out the case going back 100 years liberal Democrats have had a lot of doubts about American especially American power at best they're ambivalent about American power and oftentimes are openly hostile to it I mean that in all of its aspects military strength energy independence strong Sovereign borders a strong network of alliances around the world that give us freedom of action so what you see in the sense of decline many Americans have I argue and only this strong is not an accident this is something the Democrats have intentionally pursued especially in the presidencies of Barack Obama and Joe Biden to go back to the energy issue Joe Biden has repeatedly promised that we're going to end fossil fuel production America we're no longer going to mine coal we're no longer going to drill for oil and gas so when you're paying three and four or five dollars a gallon as people were earlier this year for a tank of gas or a gallon of gas at the pump that's not an accident that's not bad luck that's what the Democrats want to achieve when you see our military falling below say 3 percent of the total economy of America barely half of what it was at the end of the Reagan buildup again that's not an accident that's a choice that the Democrats have made for decades because they are at best ambivalent about American power here at home and our role in the world Tom Cotton prolific author and a conservative who went to Harvard so I'm sure that Senate meeting did not hurt your feelings at all because you've been through a lot tougher things than a lunch in the Senate rotundra Tom Cotton from the great state of Arkansas thank you for being here

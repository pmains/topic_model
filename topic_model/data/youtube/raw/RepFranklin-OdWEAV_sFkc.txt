he joins us now congressman thanks for being here in the pantheon of bad ideas from this administration where does this one rank it's right at the top with any of them of all the things i could possibly imagine calling the irgc anything other than the terrorist organization is simply absurd explain to us just how dangerous the irgc really is so the irgc or the islamic republican guard corps is is absolutely iran's uh terrorist arm of their regime they are uh the proxies uh they're they're behind all the proxy forces that are causing uh disturbances in the middle east you know whether it's hezbollah uh in in lebanon or hamas on the gaza strip or the houthis in yemen the codes forces attacking our own troops in iraq at every turn uh the iranians are the ones that have their hands at it and uh the irgc is that arm and that's not just my opinion you know i was talking to general mackenzie of central command last week when he was testifying before us i asked him specifically about the irgc and and his quote was you know they are the heart of iran's terrorist regime and that they have their tentacles and everything in the iranian economy so anything we do to economically strengthen iran will immediately play right into the hands of the irgc it's just another example i think of this administration's diplomacy of wishful thinking that's really how it is but why congressman why is the white house willing to make such a concession like this well as we've seen time and again this is a white house that feels that you can treat uh you know your your foreign adversaries with a with an attitude of appeasement and again back to the diplomacy of wishful thinking if you just they live in a world that they wish existed instead of the one that's reality and we know that to be the case but as we saw uh tragically in afghanistan you can't negotiate with terrorists and that's exactly what they're attempting to do here again let's look at this through the lens of afghanistan why does this administration seem to want to legitimize terror groups first the irgc and then you mentioned afghanistan the taliban it makes no sense congressman again it's wishful thinking and then you know that's it's it's as simple as that and i think you can extrapolate that to many issues i think republicans see the world as it is and then democrats see it as they wish it to be and that's fine and maybe that helps us temper good solutions in the long run but the reality is this is an administration that does not deal with the reality of the facts on the ground look democrats have a tough road to hoe just on domestic policy when it comes to the midterm elections is foreign policy going to be their death blow it's it's death by a lot of blows uh it would seem you know whether that's one big harm of it and you know and and in america we do have the luxury of not having to pay attention to foreign policy when things are working well and typically americans vote their pocket books in this situation in the course of just the first 15 months of the bond administration we've seen just horrific consequences on the economic front and the foreign policy front it's just at every turn the biden administration is making the wrong decision whenever a tough decision is called for you mentioned a pollyanna world that the democrats live and i want to switch gears to a pollyanna republican world let's say republicans take control of the house and the senate and somehow are able to convince the president to go along with regard to iran policy how should we combat iran and its quest for nuclear weapons well we hold them at arm's length and make them step up and behave responsible on the world stage and i would say as long as they continue to engage in terrorism like they are on multiple fronts throughout the middle east you don't treat them like a civilized player on the world stage it's just as simple as that they're a rogue regime my fault isn't with the iranian people they deserve better leadership and you know it's been that way since 1979 now and then that's for them to do we're not we're not in the business we shouldn't be in the business in my view of regime change but this current regime is not one that can be treated responsibly speaking of the world stage there is literally a stage or was just on our screen president biden expected to be at that podium very very soon to discuss his plan for russian oil that is what is being reported basically as reports that the president is going to try and get europe off of russian oil congressman we've been talking about that since he started january of 2021 why is it taking one month of absolute carnage in ukraine for joe biden to come along well you know i think it was churchill who had said you know you can always trust the main the americans to do the right thing but only after they've exhausted every other possibility this is a this is administration that follows sadly uh america and the free world need strong leadership in the united states and it just hasn't gotten it this is an administration that waits uh waits to make a decision and when they do it's it's typically uh too little too late we've completely unilaterally surrendered our energy independence not only can we see our gas prices lower at the pump now if we were still producing our own oil but we could have helped uh europe become or be less dependent on russian oil we facilitated it now we in the world are paying the price if there's a thesis statement from this segment congressman it's that nothing this administration does makes any sense congressman you make a lot of sense congressman scott franklin we appreciate your time thank you sir thanks for having me on good morning

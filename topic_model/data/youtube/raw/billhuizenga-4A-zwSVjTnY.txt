Mr Speaker I rise today in opposition to this three trillion trillion dollar liberal partisan wish list with our nation facing an unprecedented challenge this bill erodes the American people's faith in government when the speaker refuses to work on a bipartisan manner to move our nation forward giving money to Planned Parenthood creating marijuana diversity studies permanently rewriting our nation's elections law have nothing to do with the challenges we are currently facing and certainly do not help West Michigan job creators or their employees sadly provisions in this bill actually disincentivize small businesses from reopening or helping people get back to work in a safe and responsible manner what the manufacturer in Kentwood the pizza shop owner in Muskegon are the farmers and growers that I heard from across West Michigan expect is for Congress to take a reasonable and responsible approach that is not as what is happening here today this mother of all Christmas tree bills isn't the heroes Act in fact it should be called the cynical partisan act of 2020 and has absolutely no chance of becoming law I urge my colleagues on both side of the aisle to reject this bill and turn our focus to helping our constituents safely return

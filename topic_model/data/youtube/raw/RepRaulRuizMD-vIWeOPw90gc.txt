for 17 year old elizabeth esteban harvard university was a distant dream 2 800 miles away from her home in california but a world away from the community she grew up in speaking the tribal language of perepacha the language of her parents immigrants from mexico who work in california's agricultural fields elizabeth esteban lives in a mobile home with her parents and her younger sister and brother elizabeth was concerned about applying to harvard college because she thought she couldn't possibly afford to go there but most harvard students are on financial aid and pay only a portion of the tuition or none at all harvard's financial aid system is based exclusively on the financial need of the student and is designed to make sure that students do not have to graduate with any burdensome student loans elizabeth esteban did not know all of that when earlier this month on a day when her internet service was working at home she opened an email and discovered she'd been accepted into the harvard class of 2025. [Music] and then another email came that said she would receive a full scholarship to attend harvard perhaps inspired by her congressman raul ruiz who brought her to the last state of the union address elizabeth wrote i plan to run for congress and in the future my ultimate goal is to run for office to become president of the united states crazy some may say not a bit crazy and i ask you to remember when you go into the voting booth someday and see the name elizabeth esteban on the ballot please remember that you met her here tonight on the last word and joining us now this year's valedictorian at desert mirage high school elizabeth esteban she is now a member of the harvard class of 2025. elizabeth thank you very much for joining us tonight we're really glad you're here what did it feel like when you got that email with that acceptance to harvard i felt every emotion because i wasn't expecting it i was really expecting a rejection letter and when i saw and bought letters congratulations it was just it meant the world to me and then the other good news that you got which was that harvard will cover you won't have any bills from harvard whatsoever for all four years yes that was the most exciting news because my one number one um worry was not affording college so knowing that i'm not gonna have to worry about that and focus on my studies was just relieving and how did your parents react to this well at first they didn't understand the truth meaning about getting a full ride um but then they were proud of me and they hugged hugged me and told me you're gonna be able to accomplish all of your goals if you go to harvard you know elizabeth harvard's 385 years old and you got in in what everyone knows is the most difficult year ever because last year due to covid many of the incoming freshmen took a gap year and are only going to come this year so there were very few seats very few uh open slots for acceptances for this year fewer than ever and you got one so it was even harder than it has been in the past yes um getting into college has been very complicated um as the years go by but i just want to tell the young people to just try it out and don't live a life just regretting it and questioning what if i did try and what if i didn't get accepted and what about your uh younger brother and sister are they looking up to their big sister thinking maybe they can do something like that yes my brother already has um what he already knows what he wants to do when he grows up he wants to be a nurse and then become a doctor so i'm really happy to be there and just um guide them and help them out as well and i i want to talk about the the language that your parents uh speak their native language which is a tribal language from from mexico there are maybe 200 000 people in the world now who's who speak that language uh and you grew up with that uh and how has that how how has growing up in your family uh created your view of life in this country um well growing up in a community where most of my most of the people that live here are hard working farm workers and my parents that implemented those values of working hard be determined respect everyone it just helped me out and it it actually made me mature even faster um because i had them and they always taught me although all those values growing up and so the first time you will see your college is when you show up to go to your college yes that's right all right well you might need some advice and i have somebody right here eli rivas who like you is from california recent graduate of harvard college he works with me every day on this show he also uh got a scholarship uh to attend his four years of harvard he's going to help you out with everything you need to know he's going to let you know where all the cool places are to hang out so your support system is already here thank you so much i really appreciate it

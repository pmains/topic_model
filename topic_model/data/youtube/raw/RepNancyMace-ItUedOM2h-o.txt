lawmakers from both parties are condemning an attack on south carolina representative nancy mace's home over the holiday weekend after it was vandalized with messages targeting the congresswoman joining me now to discuss is congresswoman mace hi congresswoman thanks for joining us ma'am thank you for having me again today yeah of course and you know sorry to hear that it's under these circumstances you've shared images of the messages that were spray painted on your property why do you think whoever did this chose to write what they did well we don't we don't know yet we don't uh have all the answers i can tell you it was shocking to walk up to my home and see it spray painted seeing the graffiti the expletives that were used with my name and to have this have to have this conversation once again with my kids i'm a single mom i'm raising two kids this is their home this is where they live it was jarring and and it's shocking this is the second time in seven months that i've been targeted for vandalism the first time was my car on the day of one of my debates and now they showed up on my front step at my house and whomever did this if they think for one second that i'm going to be intimidated by them showing up here well they can think again um i'm not going to back down from my beliefs or my convictions or working hard for the people that elected me to congress well and you know part of the messages i saw in the pictures you shared it said past the pro act so it seems to be that part of this is politically driven what's your response to to that it's very weird there were anarchists and antifa symbolism you know the anti-government anti-political symbolism and at the same time you know they they spray painted on my house to pass the pro act i mean sort of which is that i think that they are confused and then to walk out and see f u nancy out of my front door um it's very jarring and it's sad makes me sad for my community for my neighbors my neighbors and ask for this my kids are innocent and all this they didn't ask for this either but the divisiveness in this country the rhetoric leads to consequences like this we've seen the left leftist activists they shot steve scalise they put senator rand paul in the hospital and today he's missing part of islam over the last 15 months we've seen them loot destroy and burn down cities in this country and we've got to say enough is enough this has got to end our kids and our country are counting on a better future yeah certainly and hopefully the local authorities there and your community can give you some more answers as they investigate but i do want to shift to another topic dr anthony fauci he's been under intense scrutiny as we know for his role in funding the wuhan institute of virology now a trove of his emails that were released just recently it shows early on in the pandemic he dismissed the idea that the coven 19 pandemic that that the virus might have originated in a lab and then we saw the mainstream media calling it a conspiracy theory for more than a year but now this idea is popular what do you make of that why do you think that is well to see the way the mainstream media has handled this uh i don't believe ethically you had president trump last year uh talk about it being a potential leak from the wuhan lab and he was he was touted as a conspiracy theorist fast forward a year later in the new york times is blaming president trump for it being leaked out of the wuhan lab dr fauci has not been clear transparent or honest with the american people whether it's to wear a mask or not to wear a mask whether it's uh that american taxpayers paid for funding and research or dana function research in a wuhan lab and contributed to the problem he doesn't know the answer to that either there were 900 pages of emails that were released today it seems like he says one thing in the public and does another privately and myself and i know senator rand paul have been very vocal calling out dr fauci calling it like we see it and calling out the double standard here um all right and finally yesterday we saw joe biden seemingly criticizing moderate democrat senators joe manchin and kristen sinema for voting with republicans he called them out essentially during a speech in tulsa oklahoma what do you think that says about his confidence in getting his agenda passed and what does it say about the democrat party more broadly well thank god senator manchin and senator cinema don't listen to joe biden or nancy pelosi or the democratic party all the time they are doing the work of the people that sent them to congress and to the senate and so it's it's i want to praise them for their work and standing against their party it's very rare that we see democrats stand up against their party nancy pelosi really has a choke hold on members in the house of representatives um and really controlling how they vote and it's refreshing honestly as a republican to see two democrats stand up against their own leadership and we have republicans we we do that all the time in the republican party and so it's refreshing to see it being done on the other side it's important for the future of our country to have those strong voices how do you think something like this might play into the midterms i mean they're you know they're not that far away 2022 is around the corner how do you think that might come into play there well when you look at the economy right now 250 000 jobs created just last quarter alone you're expecting 1 million you're looking at record taxes we're looking at inflation a growing debt 28 trillion and counting the deficit is 3 trillion when people really start feeling the pain and we've seen prices at the grocery stores go up 21 we've seen we're seeing pain at the gas pump we're seeing lumber prices up 381 percent over the last few months when people really start feeling the pain of the biden administration and nancy pelosi and aoc's policies in their pocketbooks then we're going to have a very strong 2022 midterm and you're going to see republicans win back the house we only need five or six seats to do it and we're going to do it all right we'll see how this plays out thank you so much for your insight and your input again sorry about what happened hopefully you get some more answers about uh a vandalism at your home congresswoman nancy mace of south carolina thank you for joining us thank you

ranking member on the shop committee on economic growth tax and capital access mr music for five minutes thank you very much madam chair and uh thank you mr williams for being with us and as reiki member luke meyer said thank you for your service to work to our country and and in your work you clearly um uh have the know-how and uh dedication so that's that's great to see um you know first madam chair i do want to bring up what bringing luke meyer has mentioned a number of times and that is the absence of secretary of treasury janet yellen um it's kind of inexplicable that the law states and the requirements are to appear in for this committee within uh time frames and and yet the requests seem ignored so i just want to go on the record saying that's uh really irresponsible and kind of hard to believe actually but moving on moving on um so uh mr williams what uh hearing you out and sounds uh like you've got a a very focused plan and you're there for for all the right reasons to figure this out it's a pretty big operation you're running what what are your goals like for this year what what are your either macro or micro goals within 60 seconds if possible sure for the year yeah um i'm an office for not a big organization so my goal would be to actually grow that and be able to provide more resources really on the the underserved there's you know again this trick of a goal is to get legislation making sure because again that's something that now i have to spend a lot of time on and then if we know that there's fast and growth accelerators because those will be the programs that we really believe we can get to underserved states if we have those funds that we would then need to manage and execute and get those awards out quickly so potentially on the 11th i'm going to have a budget of some type and then once i get that my job is to execute that as quickly as possible because the money doesn't do any good in treasury it's got to get to those helping small businesses an office of four so uh but you have how many clients how many well i have a lot of clients i guess it depends on how you look at it i consider you my client um we have the small businesses the the agencies business clients so so we deal less directly with the companies our goal is to build this national eco innovation ecosystem so we have 84 growth accelerators that we work with that are funded on this year we have 33 fast awardees so those are you know groups that we work with they have we have contracts with that we monitor and um and then we have an ecosystem we just have calls and we connect with people we don't fund but that we try to provide information to them and our goal is to kind of share the information in one place and push it to those that need it right good is it possible for me to get a list of the number of businesses that have accessed and utilized and uh gained support from i mean there's 7 000 awards made 33 000 proposals submitted every year um about four to five thousand companies our website is over a million hits every year um so those are the kind of but i can give you any more details in pennsylvania or just in my district for that matter um i think well i have it on charity but yeah i can give you that information actually and it's it's on our website sbr.gov you can pull up each year each agency but i can get you that good well i'll i'll do that thanks so you you do see and i'm sure you you aware of this and are focused on doing everything you can to change it in a reasonable way that certain areas areas of the country receive far more uh utilize the program far more than others such as the northeast and the west coast as well as um some companies receive upwards of 50 phase one awards in a single year now that's not necessarily a bad thing could be a good thing but how would you explain that seems a little lopsided um i'll have to look into the 50 phase one awards uh but the the issue of i mean there's a couple reasons why certain places in the country don't get as much awards um vc funding goes to you know five states 80 of it i mean so there's there's infrastructure issues that um that exist and so that's why we really believe there are great universities throughout the country that that's a good place for us to lock into fast and growth accelerate establishing out them they are now much more focused and transitioning research that they weren't really years ago nsf forming a kind of translational side of nsf where we're really going to start funding more of that basic research the small businesses are the glue to that those are the ones that are going to be motivated to take that and then they'll stay locally and so i think that's what we need to do is more programs to put some boots on the ground in those places and help them get access to this program it's still a government program i mean government programs aren't always the easiest and so we want to train new people real quick you probably won't have time to answer this but provide us or me any specific recommendations you have that we can help you improve your program because it sounds important stability and i think some of these resources programs that we talked about so we can do more would would help okay thank you back madam chair

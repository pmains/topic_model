BUT HE ENDED UP SPARRING WITH SOME HARD-LINE MEMBERS OF THE GOP, SOME OF WHOM EVEN TACKLE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. LET'S GET SOME PERSPECTIVE NOW FROM REPUBLICAN REPRESENTATIVE MIKE JOHNSTON FROM LOUISIANA. CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THIS EVENING. IT WAS QUITE A NIGHT. AND THE SPEAKER, MCCARTHY, ALSO ENCOURAGE MANY OTHER MEMBERS, IN FACT ALL OF THE MEMBERS, TO BE POLITE, FOR A LACK OF A BETTER WORD HERE. I WITNESSED, AS YOU DID INSIDE THE CHAMBER, A NUMBER OF OUTBURSTS. AND I WONDER IF YOU CAN RESPOND TO HOW YOU FELT IN THAT MOMENT ABOUT THE ATMOSPHERE THAT WAS WITHIN THE CHAMBERS THIS EVENING >> I'M NOT ONE THAT'S INTO CATCALLS. IT'S NOT MY STYLE. BUT I UNDERSTAND THE EMOTION THAT WAS IN THE ROOM, I THINK WHEN YOU HEARD A LOT OF THE OUTBURSTS AS IT'S BEEN REFERRED TO, IS WHEN THE PRESIDENT WAS I THINK BLATANTLY SAYING SOMETHING THAT HE KNOWS IS NOT TRUE. HE SUGGESTED THAT THE REPUBLICANS, OR MANY REPUBLICANS I THINK HE SAID, WANT TO SUNSET SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE. IT'S NOT A FACT. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE MEMBER OF THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE THAT IS EVER SAID SUCH A THING. AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT THE POSITION WE'VE HAD. WE'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR ABOUT OUR PRETENSION TO SAVE THOSE PROGRAMS. AND WE THOUGHT IT WAS AN UNFAIR STATEMENT. >> WELL, THERE WAS THAT MOMENT WHERE HE DID LOOK AND TALK ABOUT FINALLY A MOMENT OF UNITY HERE. AND THE IDEA OF EVERYONE AGREEING THAT THOSE TWO PROGRAMS OUGHT TO REMAIN IN PLACE. BUT THERE'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN SOME DISCUSSION BY SOME MEMBERS ABOUT WAYS IN WHICH TO REFLECT ON OR HAVE IT COME UP FOR A VOTE OR APPROPRIATIONS PURPOSES. ARE YOU CLEAR TONIGHT THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTE UNITY WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, THAT NEITHER PROGRAM WILL BE TOUCHED? >> YEAH, LOOK, I'M THE VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS. I'M IN THE NUMBER FIVE LEADERSHIP POSITIONS. I'M VERY CLOSE TO ALL MY COLLEAGUES. I DON'T KNOW A SINGLE ONE WHO SUGGESTED ANYTHING CONTRARY TO THAT. WE MADE A COMMITMENT TO SAVE THOSE PROGRAMS, BUT WHAT WE UNDERSTAND IS YOU'VE GOT TO SOLIDIFY THE FOUNDATIONS OF THOSE PROGRAMS SO THAT WE CAN MAINTAIN THEM. THEY'RE ON A TRAJECTORY TO GO BANKRUPT IN LESS THAN TEN YEARS. SO, WE HAVE TO FIX IT, WE NEED GROWN-UPS IN THE ROOM TO MAKE, YOU KNOW, TOUGH DECISIONS ON OUR BUDGETING GOING FORWARD. AND WE'RE COUNTING ON THE WHITE HOUSE TO HAVE A GOOD FAITH NEGOTIATION WITH US. IT'S NOT A GOOD START TO MISSTATE THE POSITION OF THE OTHER SIDE. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT MY COLLEAGUES WERE REACTING TO. >> WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PROSPECTS OF BIPARTISANSHIP, OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S QUITE THE NARROW MAJORITY, AS YOU'RE WELL AWARE IN THE HOUSE. BUT THERE'S ALSO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TODAY SEEMING TO CALL FOR AN END TO FIGHTING, TALK ABOUT WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE MADE CLEAR THAT THEY WANT. OBVIOUSLY, THERE IS A DIVIDED CONGRESS. AND CERTAINLY, THE WHITE HOUSE OF A DIFFERENT PARTY THAN THOSE OF THE MAJORITY OF THE HOUSE. DO YOU SEE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR BIPARTISANSHIP ON ANY KEY EFFORTS THAT YOU HOPE TO PROMOTE RIGHT NOW? >> WELL, WE CERTAINLY HOPE SO. I MEAN, THAT'S THE WAY THIS PLACE IS SUPPOSED TO WORK. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE PEOPLE WITH VERY DIFFERENT IDEAS AND PHILOSOPHIES AND VISIONS FOR THE GOVERNMENT. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE HAVE TO GET TOGETHER AND WORK THOSE THINGS OUT. THAT'S HOW CONSENSUS IS BUILT. THAT'S HOW THE FOUNDERS SET THIS SYSTEM UP TO WORK. AND WE STRAYED AWAY FROM THAT. AND I THINK THERE'S A WILLINGNESS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE TO DO THAT. BUT WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER ON IDEAS THAT MAKE SENSE. AND WHAT WE HEARD TONIGHT, LARGELY, WAS IN OUR VIEW A SPEECH THAT WAS REALLY DETACHED FROM THE REALITY THAT I THINK MOST AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY FEELING, WITH REGARD TO RISING COST AND RISING CRIME AND THE OPEN BORDER AND ALL THE PROBLEMS ARE FACING. WE DIDN'T HEAR THE PRESIDENT ACTUALLY ADDRESSING THIS DIRECTLY, AND TALK ABOUT THE REALITY OF THOSE PROBLEMS. SO, YOU HAVE TO AGREE ON WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE BEFORE YOU CAN COME TOGETHER AND FIX THEM. I THINK THAT'S A BIG CONCERN WE HAVE. TONIGHT >> WHAT WHERE THE AREAS WHERE YOU FELT THERE WAS THAT DETACHMENT? BECAUSE HE DID MENTION THE IDEA OF THE BORDER, FENTANYL, THERE IS A MOMENT, PERHAPS, CAUGHT SOME PEOPLE OFF-GUARD IN THE CHAMBER, THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS SPEAKING ABOUT FENTANYL AND ABOUT OVERDOSING IN THIS COUNTRY, AND THE TRAGIC NUMBERS THAT WE ARE SEEING. AND THEN HE AGREED WITH THE IDEA OF THE CHANTING THAT THE BORDER WAS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR THERE. WERE YOU SURPRISED BY ANY MOMENTS THAT THE PRESIDENT SEEMS TO AGREE WITH YOUR PARTY ON THESE ISSUES? >> WE WERE SHOCKED TO HEAR A COUPLE OF THOSE LINES. I'M SURE A SPEECH WRITER PUT THOSE IN FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES. BUT THAT'S NOT BEEN THE POSITION OF THIS PRESIDENT. CLEARLY, IT WAS HIS POLICIES THAT CREATED THE IMMIGRATION CATASTROPHE WE HAD RIGHT NOW. WE HAD HEARINGS FOR THE LAST 48 HOURS HERE IN THE CONGRESS, IN THE HOUSE, WHERE EXPERTS AND BORDER PATROL AGENTS AND PEOPLE DIRECTLY INVOLVED ON THE GROUND CAME TO TELL THEIR STORIES ABOUT THE HORRORS THEY'RE FACING EVERY DAY BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION AND THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF, BECAUSE OF THE POLICIES DAVIN ACTED. SO, IT WAS NOT A SPEECH THAT MATCHED REALITY. AND THAT WAS OUR CONCERN WITH IT. WE HEARD MORE TONIGHT ABOUT CRACKING DOWN ON JUNKIES THAN WE DID ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND THE THREAT FROM CHINA. YOU KNOW, THERE WERE SOME LINES IN THERE THAT THEY OF COURSE INSERTED FOR APPLAUSE. BUT IT DOES NOT MATCH HIS ACTIONS. AND THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. >> CONGRESSMAN, IF YOU ARE ONLY GLASS HALF, FULL MAYBE THEY ARE JUST IN THERE TO REFLECT WHAT HE THOUGHT. I HEAR YOUR OVERALL SENTIMENT. BUT I THINK WE CAN BOTH AGREE THE IDEA OF NOT A SINGLE PRESIDENT HAS CREATED THE FULL IMMIGRATION CRISIS WE ARE SEEING. BUT I UNDERSTAND THE POINT THAT YOU'RE MAKING. THERE WAS A RESPONSE, OF, COURSE FROM THE FORMER TRUMP PRESS SECRETARY AND CURRENT ARKANSAS GOVERNOR, SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS. DELIVERED A REBUTTAL OF COURSE TO THIS EVENING. SHE MAKES CLEAR THERE IS A STRONG PUSH, IN TERMS OF HER MAKING, ONE FOR A GENERATIONAL AND CULTURAL CHANGE THAT NEEDS TAKE PLACE. I WONDER, IS THAT THE ARGUMENT YOU THINK THAT IS GOING TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE FOR CONVINCING VOTERS WHY REPUBLICANS SHOULD LEAVE? >> I BELIEVE THAT'S A BIG PART OF IT. I BELIEVE WE HAVE TO CAST OUR VISION AND PRESENT OUR MESSAGE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. BUT THE THING ABOUT CONSERVATIVES AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S WE STAND FOR TRIED AND TRUE PRINCIPLES. THEY DON'T CHANGE. RONALD REAGAN SAID IN HIS FAREWELL ADDRESS, THEY CALL ME THE GREAT COMMUNICATOR, BUT I REALLY WASN'T THAT. I WAS COMMUNICATING GREAT THINGS, THE SAME GREAT THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN IN OUR NATION SINCE THE FOUNDING. BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM, LIMITED GOVERNMENT, FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY, FREE MARKETS, HUMAN DIGNITY. THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT MADE US GREAT. AND THAT'S WHAT WE STAND FOR. SO I BELIEVE WHEN WE MAKE THAT CASE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THEY AGREE WITH US. I BELIEVE WE ARE STILL A CENTER RIGHT COUNTRY. AND THEY WANT SANITY TO STORE TWO REPUBLICAN POLICY. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO -- HOUSE REPUBLIC MAJORITY THAT WE'VE BEEN GIVEN. HERE AND TO MAKING THAT CASE AS WE HEAD INTO THE 2024 CYCLE. WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THAT. I'M VERY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE

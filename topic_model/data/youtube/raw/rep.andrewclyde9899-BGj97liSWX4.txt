last week I was part of the 20 conservative members who fought for significant institutional change in order to restore the people's voice in the people's house of the many victories we secured for the American people the Thomas Jefferson motion to vacate the chair is the most important to me as it holds the speaker accountable to the people this Jeffersonian motion stood strong for more than 200 years before then speaker Pelosi removed it in 2018 consolidating power in the hands of a select few in leadership by restoring this historic rule every solitary member has the authority to hold the speaker accountable for following all of the rules including passing single subject bills allowing members at least 72 hours to read the legislation before voting on it and reinstating the Holmen rule which allows amendments to decrease funding for certain government programs all the way down to the individual job description I thank my Republican colleagues and speaker McCarthy for working in good faith to produce you stand past a-roll's package that ensures this body is working for the people and not for itself and I encourage every member to vote for it fixing a broken Washington D.C is a major win for every citizen

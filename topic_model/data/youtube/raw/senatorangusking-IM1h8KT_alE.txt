mr. president I am going to be offering a little bit later this afternoon a motion to instruct conferees in connection with the tax bill it may be one of the most simple straight forward motions ever offered in this body I can read it in its entirety we move that the managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two houses on the bill HR 1 be instructed to insist that the final conference report not increase the federal budget deficit for the period of fiscal years 2018 through 2027 couldn't be more straightforward don't increase the budget deficit why well this chart basically tells the story we are headed into literally uncharted territory with regard to our national debt it is a threat to this country it's a threat to our national security it's a threat to every man woman and especially child because they're the people that are going to have to be paying this debt this is a history of our debt in constant dollars going all the way back to the Revolutionary War and it tells a very powerful story at the very beginning of our country 1790 a big piece of debt to pay for the Revolutionary War they paid it off another mountain of debt to pay for the Civil War it was paid off the debt goes up again to pay for World War one and it was paid off and then it goes in up for the depression and then to a peak in World War two but what happened after World War two as we all know World War two was fought our country was defended victory was achieved by something that's been called the greatest generation and the greatest generation paid their bills they paid off the debt from World War two it went down in the 70s and then back up again in the 80s and here's where we are today and the bill that was passed in the dead of night early Saturday morning adds one and a half trillion dollars to that debt one and a half trillion dollars we're adding to the debt at a time of low unemployment a grow enormous growth in the stock market and a relatively strong economy not perfect by any means but compared with where we were five or six years ago we're in a in positive territory on the economy that's when you should pay down debt not add to it unnecessarily if we were in a crisis as we were in a recession if we were in a conflict that required an immediate mobilization that's when you want to add to the debt that's what you borrow for we're borrowing to plate pay park ranger salaries we're borrowing to do the ordinary operation of government and now we're borrowing to give major tax cuts in a time of relatively positive economic growth and I know it's not as high as it should be in as high as that we want it to be but this bill that we passed it's going to add to the debt isn't going to do much of anything to assist us with growth the analysis of the joint taxation committee is it will add eight tenths of one percent to GDP growth in ten years that's almost immeasurable eight tenths of one percent in ten years it doesn't come close by the way to paying for itself doesn't come close maybe fifteen or twenty percent and by the way that's an interesting number because all the studies that I've seen about tax cuts and their effect on economic growth is they do about 20 percent of their cost the other 80 percent is eaten by our kids it's unethical what we're doing if five-year-olds knew what we were doing and could vote we would all be out of a job because they are the ones that are going to have to pay this bill and to see this mountain climb it doesn't take a lot of imagination to see that we're going to be higher than in World War two in a matter of a few years added to by this bill that we just passed the other night it's unconscionable it's unnecessary if indeed we were going to expand the economy three or four percent a year and everybody says that's what we're going for maybe okay but that three listen you know three percent a year times ten that's 30 percent growth but we're talking about eight tenths of one percent over ten years not per year over ten years so my motion is very very simple don't come back with a bill that adds to the deficit and there are lots of ways we can do tax reform there are lots of ways we can cut corporate taxes make ourselves more competitive we can do offshore tax cuts there are lots of ability to do this without hammering the deficit in fact I understand as of this morning we we improve the finances of this bill by mistake to the tune of 389 billion dollars a mistake in the bill that we pass because we did it so fast that nobody knew what was in it I have a new rule the faster a bill goes through the United States Congress the worse it is and I think that's what we've seen in this case we can deal with tax reform we can increase our competitiveness we can get our taxes aligned our particularly our business taxes with the rest of the world without loading this debt on to our children a tax cut when all you're doing is borrowing to fill the hole is not a cut it is a shift of the tax from you to your kids you're on your deathbed you're lying there and you say to your children come on over I'll give you my last words and they've come over and they're listening they want wisdom what you say is here's the credit card we had a great trip to Acapulco you can pay for it that's on responsible nobody would do that but that's exactly what we're doing in this bill it's wrong and it's not necessary it's not necessary and I think one of the questions that we're gonna have to ant ask and answer and we're gonna see it it's gonna play out is what our company's going to do with this new found in come when the taxes are cut dramatically from thirty five percent to twenty percent is that money going to go into new plant and equipment is it going to go into wages is it going to increase people's wages productivity or is it going to go into stock buybacks which raise the value of the stock that's great for the owners but that's what it doesn't do a thing for the workers and it doesn't do much for the United States economy so again my motion couldn't be more straightforward and simple work on the tax bill in conference I think you're gonna have a hard time making a good bill out of it but whatever you do come back with something that's deficit neutral and by the way that's where this discussion started last January the leadership in both houses and in both parties was talking about deficit neutral tax reform and somewhere along the way it became let's break the bank let's add new debt to our kids let's create a situation where we're not going to have any slack when we need it no business would run this way and is wrong for us to try to run the country this way so mr. mr. president I'm gonna make this motion I hope that my colleagues many of whom on both sides of the aisle have been talking to me into the country for years about the dangers of the deficit and they're suddenly I predict if this bill becomes law about the time the ink is dry they're gonna say oh my lord we have a deficit look at that I didn't know that and we're gonna have to cut spending we're gonna have to cut Medicare Medicaid Social Security because we have this huge deficit well we don't have to add to it make it worse in this tax bill and that's what's really bothering me because the very people who have been talking to me and and I've been listening to for 20 years about how serious the deficit is I was fool enough to believe them I think it is a serious problem and I think we need to address it but this is the opposite of addressing it we're making it worse at the very time we should be talking about paying down the debt not adding to it mr. president we can do better the American people expect more of us we can do better and I believe and deeply hope that we will come to our senses and do better with in connection with this bill

Republican senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana joins me now he's a member of the Senate finance committee Senator good to have you here nice to have you in New York thanks for stopping by um what's your reaction to what the President says there it's hard to keep from laughing inflation was 1.9 percent when he took office under under Republican policies and now it's been 13 since he took office 8.5 percent year over year the president's policies have either been inept or incompetent or you name even malevolent but they are hurting the American people and this midterm will be a referendum on those policies so here it's interesting though because when you poll people this new poll from the AP nroc which is the same one that found that 46 percent thought their financial condition just felt like they were in poor condition right now they say 55 say it's out of his control it's not his fault and we've heard for the administration over and over that it's worse in other places that this is all because of Putin so the American Rescue plan as they called it it could have been called the American recession plan was 1.9 trillion of federal spending every Republican voted against it every Democrat four Economist left of center said it would ignite inflation and it did the inflation reduction act so-called they just passed uh is is predicted to increase inflation over the next two years and and and for giving student loans adds more out there to drive up inflation now these are their policies which have been uniformly supported by democrats uniformly opposed by Republicans and that's where the responsibility at least in large measure allies uh for these higher prices yeah politically I guess right now with four weeks to go he's going to continue to deflect he doesn't want to say it's our fault because he's got candidates that he's worried about across the country but when you step out of that world you look at the IMF they said you know we're probably heading into a global crisis sort of situation Jamie dimon all of these smart folks have been watching the economy for a long time say look we're already in in really bad shape and in fact in 2023 it's going to get worse so would it make more sense for him to be more honest with the American people about what's going on there's a cynicism that this Administration is showing reportedly asking the Saudis to not increase the price of fuel until after the midterm part of their debt loan forgiveness expires after the midterm so they are using these inflationary policies if you will but but they're trying to mitigate it until after the election now that is wrong what do you think about that I mean you know we haven't really heard that kind of negotiation or begging or whatever you want to call it with OPEC since since Jimmy Carter yeah that's because it'd be that's because since Jimmy Carter we've had a policy of developing North American energy resources this administration's policies have been deliberately attempted to Tamp down a development of North American Energy and it worked it worked it worked and now we're bad news yeah 15 more for for natural gas you know I think your statistic was 30 more for utilities it's incredible think about it if he had not stopped the Keystone XO pipeline the first week he took president presidency that would have been completed and there would be 800 000 barrels a day coming from Canada to the Gulf Coast my State and Texas to be refined for our use they killed that the first week they have not granted permits to drill off the coast of Louisiana I'm told that the permits were applied for in in January once they are once they are granted within six months our natural gas and oil will be coming to be refined on our Shores to create jobs into lower prices they've not given those permits this many months later incredible thank you very much

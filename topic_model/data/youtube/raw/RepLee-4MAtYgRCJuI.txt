thank you very much let me first thank you congresswoman waiting for those very kind and humbling remarks but also for your tremendous leadership on so many issues not only since you've been here in Congress but before you you have come representing your constituents and really looking out for speaking out for and working for the most vulnerable in our society so thank you I'm really proud of what you're doing with the Congressional Black Caucus also congressman Jeffries for continuing to organize these important sessions really to beat the drum and to allow our country to understand what the issues are that the Congressional Black Caucus continues to work on because if in fact we address those issues as you know that the most vulnerable are dealing with each and every day will strengthen America and so our country will be stronger so thank you both for making sure that we're doing that we celebrate tonight the start of Black History Month but I'd like to reflect quickly again what we're doing tonight on dr. Martin Luther King Junior's dream of true democracy in his famous speech I have a dream let me just quote here what he asked the American people to do he said to make real the promises of democracy now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate Valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice now is the time to open the doors of opportunity to all God's children and it's the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood of course and sisterhood as I think about his powerful words going into Black History Month and his challenge for America to live up to her highest ideal we must reflect on how far we've come and where we need to go now of course the right to vote the bedrock of our democracy which dr. King reminded us of when he said give us the ballot and we will fill our legislative halls with men and women of goodwill so in his honor we must pass the voting rights advancement act HR 2867 introduced by a woman a member of the Congressional Black Caucus congresswoman Terri Sewell in 1967 dr. King explained the underlying nature of the challenges facing our country in his book where do we go from here chaos or community he talked about these triple evils he wrote about poverty racism and foot and war he said they are the forms of violence that exist in a vicious cycle in our country he says they are interrelated all inclusive and stand as barriers to our living in the Beloved Community so when we work to remedy one evil we affect all evils so we must come together as never before to address these issues that infect our communities in order for our nation to move beyond the quicksands of racial and economic injustice of course the first of these evils is poverty a harsh reality lived every day by more than 46 million America's our joint economic committee report championed by congresswoman Maloney and the Congressional Black Caucus demonstrated and showed that African Americans are disproportionately affect by the scourge of poverty the poverty rates in our community is twenty-seven percent one in three african-american kids live in poverty one in five kids in the entire country live in poverty poverty rates throughout our country are much too high for everyone and we know how to eliminate poverty our system leader remember the Congressional Black Caucus great human being who has worked so hard to eliminate poverty for so many years has come up with a formula that would target resources to those rural and urban communities with the highest rates of persistent poverty have our half in 10 act which establishes a national strategy to cut poverty in half over the next decade that's more than 22 million Americans lifted into the middle class in just 10 years by coordinating local and state and federal anti-poverty programs also our pathways out of poverty act this is a comprehensive anti-poverty bill that starts by creating good-paying jobs while redoubling our investments in proven programs that empower families to build pathways out of poverty into the middle class and of course dr. King mentioned the second evil which is racism while racial barriers and biases are endemic through our society they're very and most apparent in our broken criminal justice system it's high time that we work to fix our criminal justice system that far too often fails african-americans yes black lives matter so today in America an african-american is killed by a security officer police officer or self-proclaimed vigilante every 28 hours that's nearly once a day one in three black men can plan to spend at least some part of his life behind bars and men of color makeup seventy percent of the US prison population let me say that again seventy percent of the US prison population are men of color that's simply outrageous now we've ended legal segregation our first african-american president is serving his second term in the White House our attorney general Loretta Lynch serves as our first african-american woman attorney general but so much must be done to achieve the dream of liberty and justice for all dr. King told us over and over again that we live in two Americas this was in 1967 in one of his speeches the Kerner commission report still describes american society today and so we've got to really look at our history and acknowledge and honor the legacy of those who really brought us this far look at the statistics and what is taking place now in communities of color and the african-american community just shows us what we have to do we have a long way to go dr. King finally spoke of war he talked about the fact that our nation continues to be involved in endless wars and communities are suffering the cost the Pentagon consumes sixty percent of discretionary spending compared to eleven percent that we spend on education job creation and resources to help our young people live the life that they so deserve in terms of being educated and providing workforce training housing healthcare all the opportunities that are the American opportunities to allow us to live the American dream so congresswoman Beatty and Jeffers I just want to thank you for allowing us the time to talk tonight we have real solution do you have real solutions every member of the Congressional Black Caucus have real solutions to end poverty to end racism and to end war and so during Black History Month we need to recommit ourselves to all of the solutions that members of the Congressional Black Caucus and members of this body and as a whole have if the political will we're there so that we can honor the legacy of those who came before us during Black History Month but by honoring them we say we're going to pick up that mantle and really address these triple evils once and for all

thank you congresswoman uh thank you for leading on this issue and so many other issues that are reports to the veterans military community um my name is dan caldwell i'm a senior advisor for concerned veterans for america as a congressman veterans for america is supporting this legislation for one simple reason those who chose to put their lives on the line for this country should not have to choose between continuing a medical treatment that is working for them and federal employment opportunities and the benefit that they the benefits that they earned in the service of their country that is wrong that many veterans have to make that choice and the state's reform act corrects those injustices for years as previous speakers have pointed out we've been employing americans overseas in support of the global war on terror for many these deployments have taken a toll on mind and body imagine every day going outside the wire and hundreds of pounds 100 pounds worth of gear engaging in direct combat on months on end for even the toughest mines and bodies that will take a toll and for many veterans medical cannabis has proven to be a better solution than the high doses of medication that the va supplies and often has very excuse me intense side effects that can inhibit a veteran's growth and we believe in options we believe in choice and we believe that veterans should have informed choices around cannabis the va should more importantly do research to determine whether or not these alternative treatments can be better than some of the current treatments which we've seen have led to addiction and ultimately haven't uh treated the fundamental illnesses that are driving some of the problems we've seen coming out of this global war on terror so we're honored to be here today again congresswoman thank you for supporting this legislation we look forward to working with you and the other original co-sponsors

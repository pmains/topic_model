i also want to associate myself with the comments of the senator from Arkansas about slow payment to physicians and hospitals this is a problem in my state as well and the problem is that if the VA ultimately denies the claim the hospital has missed the deadline for filing a claim for reimbursement to a secondary ensure such as Medicare so what happens is the health care provider ends up not getting paid at all so I really hope that some energy will be put on this problem as I said it's one of our most important strategies we simply have to get it right

let's find out where we stand at the moment in the house we're joined by two representatives from each side of the year the aisle representative bill Pascrell from the dem he's a democrat from new jersey representative mike kelly Republican from Pennsylvania gentlemen thank you both for joining us it's hard to know where to begin but let me ask you representative Kelly I mean the Senate has said now we're not going to talk until the house can come up with some kind of a deal where does it stand right now with the House GOP well I think we'll be looking at some vote this afternoon but with our conference this morning I think we did we try to come through with a proposal that again it's about fairness and making sure everybody gets treated fairly under Patient Protection Affordable Care Act's so we put some things in there that would open the government up right away and we did the CR chill generate 15th and then we'll do the debt ceiling to a februari seventh which gives some certainty to the markets right now it gets us back on an upsurge but really what we're talking about is fairness just making it fair so that every member of time versus senator but you had to know that it was going to muck things up for the Senate I mean why come up with it right now when the Senate was so close to a bill of their own and I understand that but our job in the house is to make sure that it's fair and I don't think that any American sitting back there right now and think that there's carve outs for certain people is fair they don't think it's right that members of Congress senators the President the Vice President members their staff get a little different program than everybody else it does come down to who are we representing we represent the people and I think we go forward with a very strong message stainless that we're going to protect you we're going to everything we can to act in your best interest and if that's the wrong approach then we're not in America so let's hear from the other side well is that is that true how do you how do you respond to that bill Pascrell well let me tell you something the one of the issues that might just brought up the issue of fairness we've had six months to deal with fairness when we wanted to go to conference on the budget the Senate passed the budget just two days before that the House passed their budget we should have sat that like we do any time both houses pass a budget and deal with what the reality is instead we waited to six months now we're talking about fairness you've got to be kidding me let me tell you about the fairness about our health care the contribution of the federal government started in nineteen fifty-nine just like any company contributes the health of health care so does the federal government and they want to stop this they want to end and that is why mr. Boehner tried to work out a deal with Senator Reid many months ago on this very issue we can come to an agreement on this if we get away from our audio loudness are you are you willing to take on Obamacare are you willing to give up your health care benefits and go under the Obama care plan if that's what it took out do it why is it that way below that's what you asked I'm giving you a fair answer straight answer okay and I want to see happen to be talking about a ramp where you've raised the debt ceiling and after you come up with a continuing resolution well that's right that's right we are not going to have a gun to our heads and do that and I mean you had to have seen the poll numbers that came out late last week that it shows the tremendous frustration of the American public that no deal has been met at this point and we ready default the US default yeah I think I think we're all frustrated you know I was talking with bill before we went on now when he came here in 96 you know what our national debt was it was about five trillion dollars its climbed the time he's been here it's climbed to almost 18 trillion dollars now as far as what we're trying to get to yeah it's a frustrating firm but yes it is enough I was the president I'd be particularly concerned to watch my approval ratings go all the way down now I don't think there's any question that American people are frustrated with Congress right now but keep in mind there's two chambers in Congress there's a house of representatives also a Senate we have passed so many pieces that would keep the government open pack the pieces we passed in a bipartisan effort would have opened up fully a third of the government that's now shut down its a partial shutdown remember that so we've done things together to move it forward unfortunately the Senate continues to table them and I got to tell you I've been in a business my whole life a negotiation and that I've compromised with people but we can't start off a discussion with whatever you bring in we're not interested in talking about that's not a compromise that's it being a dictator point large how are you concerned that the the u.s. debt gets downgraded by the ratings agencies I'm very concerned about that and they've worn this Moody's has warned us we met with Moody's just last week I learned concerned about going to step down from your positions and allow someone else in the job who can get the job done I can get to draw on all you guys fight I could get the job done i'm not going to do something i'm not going to escape the back door i'm trying i'm working hard every day let's put what mindset in context 96 what the deficit was we didn't pay for either war we have come to a situation where we had a meltdown of our economy in 2008 let's put things in context nobody was spending money there was no capital be invested in 2008 or 2009 the government has to step forward as they've done in every recession in the 20th century put it in context and let's be really fair about it before we go we're running out of time congressman kelly give us a timetable what are you voting on tonight and do you expect the house to have something to show to the senate by tonight absolutely i expected for you there we were in conference this morning i'll see when we get to this afternoon we have an opportunity to look at it and vote on it and there's no reason why we can't come together but I got to tell you it is about fairness I had a stint put in in January medical device why are we doing why are we putting a heavy onus on that we got to do things that make sense with American people we can do it I have no problem working with bill Pascrell we're both on ways and means together we both believe the tax reform right now especially pro-growth tax reform is needed we got to move the country forward we got to start talking about raising our client listen with making the markets jumpy guys this this is moving forward for the American people by having a government shutdown I'm sorry saving guess is what you think this is what the American people want then this government shutdown no I don't think that's what the American people one else oh no it's one of the mechanisms is put in there by the founders whenever we get to a situation we have an impasse you have to have tools that you can use in order to present your side of it now I listen it's the downgrade is coming because we have never fixed our debt problem we continue to grow our debt yeah there's a concern right now with the debt ceiling I get that but long-range you talk to Moody's you talk to those folks and find out it is our inability to deal with the future and to get our house in order it is our rising debt that is going to kill America in the long run it just won't work the math doesn't add on was impossible Maria beyond literally beyond the rhetoric we could have a simple resolution in the house and the Senate as the Senate they'd have that would open up the government and bring us to pay on that we already had which both sides have agreed on both sides of agreed on why don't we do it because mr. Boehner is afraid because the wing of this party is not going to let them do it and that's where we are you are not having held captive we got to go at this point gentlemen thank you both we certainly wish you well thank you for is that true mr. Kelly is that true that this one wing of your party that's holding all the stuff holding us hostage yeah listen listen I think whenever the talking points start off with that you know already that's the talking points that are being held to know that's not true that I got a point and I know bill doesn't go by talking points but everybody else does apparently in this party I would suggest if we can't do what's in the best interest of the American people we shouldn't be here it's that simple very good thank you

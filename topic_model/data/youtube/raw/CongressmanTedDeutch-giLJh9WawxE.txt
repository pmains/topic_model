Attorney General Sessions thanks for being here General Sessions who do you work for do you work for the American people or do you work for the president United States well I'm a member the executive branch and I work for the American people and it's with that in mind your work on behalf of the American people that I want to ask you some questions about facts and public media reports on February 14th the president asked the FBI director about the Flint investigation and I quote he said I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go to letting Flynn go he's a good guy I hope you can let this go close quote then on May 9th the president fired a Comey on May 11th he went on television and announced that he fired Comey because of and I quote again the Russia thing with Trump and Russia close quote General Sessions do you think it would be reasonable for the members of this committee to conclude that the president by first interfering in one investigation and then interfering an investigation into himself committed obstruction of justice I don't believe that's a fair conclusion and I would but it's a matter that guess would be in the breast of the special counsel and the obstruction of justice being any among other definitions the most popular one in statute any communication that endeavors to influence of structure impede the due administration of justice that's exactly exactly what the President did in both of those cases and in spite of moving on to the special counsel you brought up in spite of efforts bipartisan efforts to protect the special counsel mr. Muller the Republican leadership and this committee have refused to take action to ensure that he's protected do you believe that the president has the legal authority to fire special counsel Muller I'm not able to express a any fire members of the special counsels team I'm not able and general session do you believe that the president should have the authority to be able to block investigations into his own campaign investigations have to be conducted by the appropriate law enforcement officers without fear and favor without politics or boss right and without fear of being dismissed by the president in order to block that investigation because again that would certainly appear to represent obstruction of justice and when you fail to acknowledge that it is essentially a green light to the president to go ahead and do that now I wanted to talk about the special counsels investigation thus far there have been some indictments there's a guilty plea can you tell me in your opinion does the president have the power to pardon george papadapolis it would be premature for me to comment on that I believe because president has power to pardon there's no doubt about that right would you be does he have the power to pardon Paul Manafort and Rick gates ahead of a trial and a conviction I'm not able to comment on that I haven't researched that question I'm sure I think it's settled maybe subtle law but I'm not what do you think the set of laws I don't know and does he have the power to pardon Michael Flynn any other member of the Trump campaign let me I see this does the president of the power to pardon his own family members with it could the president today pardon Donald Trump jr. for among other things being in contact with WikiLeaks regarding these emails can can he make those pardons today before there's anything further that comes from the special counsels investigation I would not be able to answer that at this moment with any authority general sessions you you started by telling us that you're the American people's lawyer now you're not recused from giving us answers on these you're not comfortable giving us answers on these but here's the problem that we have you said when you started your testimony today that there is nothing more important than advancing the rule of law and when you answer the way you have it suggests that the rule of law is crumbling at our feet you took an oath to uphold the Constitution we took an oath to uphold the Constitution and while members of this committee in the majority may choose to abdicate their responsibility with regard to these very important matters you cannot and the interference what what you've told us today in just this exchange what we should all be concerned about is another Saturday night massacre if you can't tell us that the president shouldn't fire or can't fire the special counsel and and everyone who works for him we should be worried if you're telling us that the president may be able to pardon in advance all of those who are being investigated we should be worried about the pursuit of the rule of law General Sessions then again we we may in this committee the time of the gentleman has expired the Attorney General can respond well just briefly one of the things if you respect the rule of law is the Attorney General should not be giving legal opinions from the seat of his britches so you need to be careful about that and that's what I'm saying to you today I I do appreciate that general session hired these are not new issue that I would require you to expose from the rule of your thank you

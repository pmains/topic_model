bring in California Congressman Raul Ruiz we should note he is an emergency room doctor he questioned dr. bright today and is sitting in the intersection of these issues which is why we go to you on both the medical and the governmental oversight I'm also joined tonight by a friend of the beet and yellow gives Legere of the Center for American Progress she also worked for President Obama thanks to both of you for being here congressman beginning with today's hearing what do you think is important that people know the dr. bright was saying and how do you know whether it's true well you know first of all as a emergency physician who practice on the front lines during the h1n1 pandemic and a public health expert educated at Harvard the most striking takeaway is that it didn't have to be this way all the deaths and the economic turmoil could have been avoided all to the degree that that we're experiencing it now at the right time in January early February dr. bright informed the administration of the urgency to start making plans and massively producing masks and tests and other critical equipment but he was dismissed and if that's not striking enough the other takeaway is that we could learn from that mistake and start preparing for the future in the sirs that may come in the fall season but instead we still don't have the preparations in place we don't have a plan to distribute REM this severe or any other potential future antiviral or medication so you know that those are very to loud alarms that the American people in the administration should very much heed let's also play again from the hearing where you questioned the doctor their discussion on vaccines take a look if you can imagine this scenario this fall or winter maybe even early next spring when vaccine becomes available there's no one company that can produce enough for our country or for the world to be limited supplies we need to have a strategy and plan in place now to make sure that we can not only fill that vaccine make it distribute it but administer it in a fair and equitable plan and that's not the case at this we don't have that yet and it is a significant concern your reaction my reaction is that we need to learn from the past and be forward-looking because of the presidents and the administration's dismissal of the early warnings we are several months behind in this pandemic but we can still make aggressive change and massively produce what we need testing massively create contact tracers that can massively fortify our containment phase to prevent a overburdened healthcare system and we need to start acting now so it's not too late we can do it but we need the President to stop dismissing this virus we need the president to follow the public health experts advice and recommendations so that we can do this responsibly and safely and prevent another shutdown in the future Danielle I'm curious your reaction to this news from Senator Burr it's not nothing when people in power give up power this under obviously some significant pressure you know I have to jump in to apologize to you I'm jumping in because we're having the technical difficulties which we do with everyone helping out and working from home I think our folks are gonna talk to you to see if we can get your audio better but congressman I'll give the same question to you while we work on that which was the question congressman about Senator Richard burr these reports had come out now he's under this and your reaction you know my reaction is that if if indeed he profited by insider information at the expense of the American people I think that would be very shameful we're going to let the investigation take its course but you know as you mentioned earlier earlier re the the sign of true leadership is to put the others before self to put the American people above own personal interest and that's what we need we need an administration we need a leader in office right now who is credible who is consistently transparent with the American people who really gives them the truth and-and-and with with clarity so that we can have all the information we need to make the right decisions make the right preparations and have the right equipment necessary to save lives congressman I want to go over two other things that are related we mentioned some of what's happening on the ground when different nights we try to show different parts of the country let me show you again what we showed viewers in Wisconsin because you have this reopening and the questions how do you do it and do you do it you know in a responsible way with CDC guidelines if you do make the choice to go out or do you have what you see here which is no social distancing whatsoever no masks it's like back to business as usual and I we don't show this to criticize these individuals we show it as a warning you're a doctor and you can walk us through the fact that these individuals may be putting themselves at unnecessary risk and if you're in a place where it's all reopen and you want to have a beer I think we the answer is it's America that's your choice you can go out and have a beer if you're in that place but we are being told by all the experts to do that with distancing so leave a couple seats between each other with the beer I want to mention that for your analysis and also play something that many viewers will recognize one of our doctor experts dr. Joseph fair contracted the virus and spoke about with his informant knowledge where he thinks that might have occurred which also relates to the same issue of whether people are following guidelines take a listen it's packed completely I had someone sitting right next to me none of the attendants were wearing masks if you're in a confined space like an elevator or an airplane and the fiber powder particles flowing through the air it can get through your eyes and I did not have goggles on as an epidemiologist my very best guess is probably that's how I got it doctor fair recounting his belief that he may have contracted this on a flight where at least some individuals were potentially too close your reaction and as we've dealt with our audio issues Daniella will be rejoining us I'll get her go after you well my reaction as a physician and public health expert Arie is that we need to go back to the basis this is a virus that is highly contagious that's transmissible from droplets that can enter the eyes nose and mouth and get a person infected that can last on surfaces and individuals can get really sick whether or not you have underlying illnesses whether you're 75 or you're 12 years old those that have underlying illnesses and that are older can die from this at a higher rate than those that are younger but still the young can still die is evident therefore there's a right way to open our economy and get our workers back to work and then there's the wrong way the right way is to wait when it's safe and we have B we're at the down slope of the transmission curve and we have safeguards in place in order to do the contact tracing appropriately and rapidly with enough tests and isolation and Quarantine location with social support services in order to put out flares before they become surges in order to put out campfires become before they become forest fires the wrong way is to prematurely go back to work without the safeguards and then you have people causing another surge which would only require us to shut down the businesses again which would only hurt our businesses right the right way helps our economy keep businesses open the wrong way hurts our economy and and and risks lives and as you say it's it could be a double loss if it's not done well congressman Raul roux is also dr. Royce thanks you for wearing both hats today and Daniella Fat Joe used to say mic is on right before he spoke and our mic was off too much so thank you for trying we'll have you back for sure when we fix it thanks to both you my apologies we're gonna fit in a break

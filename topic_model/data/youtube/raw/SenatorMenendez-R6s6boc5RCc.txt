[Music] this hearing of the senate foreign relations committee will come to order assistant secretary leaf we're glad to get to welcome you in your new role we're glad you finally made it and most importantly we're happy that you're here thank you for coming before us today uh deputy assistant secretary of defense stroll uh thank you for uh coming back to the committee uh as i'm sure many know the assistant secretary was our middle east expert for a while so we're glad to see her back i have been asking a simple but important question for some time that i hope this hearing will answer what is the administration strategy on syria during the last presidential election secretary blinken wrote quote when joe biden is president we will restore u.s leadership on humanitarian issues and yet with the frozen conflict in syria leading to immense humanitarian political and security dilemmas leadership from the united states or elsewhere seems lacking flights to syria are resuming embassies in damascus are reopening when bashar al-assad landed in the united emirates in march he was given a warm welcome as any other head of state would have received as if he had never ordered a barbaric bombardment of innocent syrian civilians as if assad never ordered chemical weapon attacks that left children gasping for their lives on ventilators this comes within weeks of new evidence of syrian atrocities coming to light video of assad's soldiers forcing victims to climb down into a mass grave before massacring them think of the message this sends to other dictators around the world who would butcher innocent civilians you can commit war crimes in broad daylight on camera and the global community will just shrug its shoulders this is not lost on iran after propping up assad with billions of dollars after supporting him with hezbollah and the revolutionary guard court such impunity only fuels iran's regional aggression whether through attacks on u.s personnel in assets or threatening our allies and partners in iraq and jordan not to mention fueling an active battleground on israel's border and it is not lost on putin no one who has followed putin's brutality in syria for the past decade should be surprised that he is starving and shelling ukrainians just as he starved and shelled syrians while i have seen the administration's written strategy for syria as required in the ndaa which was skeletal from my perspective i look forward to delving a bit more in detail into the tools and us international political will to execute that strategy i'd like to hear whether you believe u.n security council resolution 2255 has lived up to the path we thought it once could because it seems the roads we need to be traveling on are crumbling earlier this year in an attempt to free imprisoned extremists isis launched a massive jailbreak in hasakah they attacked a syrian prison with car bombs and gunmen in a battle that lasted more than a week on top of that the assad regime and hezbollah are manufacturing addictive anti-federant bill pills called captagon effectively turning syria into a narco state trafficking the drug throughout europe and the middle east to obtain hard currency despite sanctions and with the u.n mandate for cross-border humanitarian aid expiring next month there is a real question as to whether russia will support an extension particularly as the war in ukraine has ushered in a food crisis that has hit syria and a number of its neighbors we need to continue to prioritize our response to this dire humanitarian situation we must continue to support our partners in jordan lebanon turkey and across europe who have absorbed the syrian refugee community that amounts to 6.8 million people worldwide added to this another 6.7 million who have been displaced within syria leaving an entire generation of syrian children growing up with dim prospects of ever returning home or the possibility of a bright future so to close let me lay out what i see as priorities that the u.s and the international community must continue to hold the assad regime accountable for its crimes we need a comprehensive strategy one that enforces fully the robust set of u.s sanctions as a means to build leverage that will sharpen assad's choices and maintain his political isolation this includes using such sanctions against assad's benefactors in moscow and tehran it also means sending the clear signal that we cannot tolerate a return to business as usual with assad and his murderous regime a strategy would lean in with aggressive us diplomacy to continue to marshal the international community in support of this leverage and to reinvigorate the political process to this end i am glad that the nea bureau now has an appointed and confirmed leader in you assistant secretary however there remain a number of nominees for vital positions in the middle east that need to move forward including crucially for syria tamara wits as usaid's assistant administrator for the middle east a u.s strategy would continue to prioritize bringing its own resources and the resources of the international community to bear on syria's humanitarian crisis while being judicious to focus our assistance in ways that doesn't benefit the regime it would include how to help continue to help syria's neighbors especially jordan and lebanon who have shown incredible hospitality to those fleeing assad's brutality but nevertheless are bearing a significant strain to that end we need a full court press at the united nations to address a possible russian veto of the mandate for the last remaining border crossing for desperately needed humanitarian assistance coupled with a ready-to-implement strategy for pushing that assistance if and when russia uses its veto putin cannot be allowed to hold desperate syrians as ransom for demands of relief in the ukrainian context that strategy should include new consideration of russia's role in syria following this invasion of ukraine and the steps needed to reduce russian activities while denying iran and hezbollah the ability to film any vacuum created by russia's preoccupation with ukraine it should also address turkish role in syria taking into consideration his hosting of millions of refugees and its position as a launch point for humanitarian assistance to its destructive campaigns against our kurdish partners in the fight against isis including renewed threats to invade northern syria it would further flush out steps needed to counter the danger posed by hezbollah and the iranian weapons of traffics across syria and it should lay out concrete steps to be taken to secure the release of u.s citizens austin tice and majid hama kamelam who have been detained by the assad regime since 2012 and 2017 respectively it must provide a path forward that allows unfettered humanitarian access and war crime investigations and it must provide a long-term legal strategy for ensuring that the horrors that bashar al-assad and his regime have inflicted on the syrian people do not go unanswered and it should describe how the u.s can help rally the weight of international pressure on assad to pursue the political path to unfreeze this conflict on this congress has been clear we overwhelmingly pass the caesar syrian civilian protection act whose primary purpose is to sanction companies or individuals who facilitate assad's brutality whether they are doing business with the syrian government or its security services providing aircraft or spare parts and i would like to see the administration use all these tools we cannot simply allow the regime to return to business as usual we cannot turn our backs on the syrian people and we cannot give up supporting them as so many desperately try to work towards a free and democratic syria america's values its principles and its reputation on the world stage hang in the balance with that let me turn to senator risch the ranking member

thank you very much madam chair I appreciate your and the ranking members leadership in holding this hearing the work of the Securities and Exchange Commission is important to protecting investors and I also want to thank each and every one of you for appearing today it's been nearly 10 years since Allen Stanford I was arrested for running the second largest Ponzi scheme in the history the United States and the collapse of the Sanford Financial Group over 21,000 victims of mr. Sanford's crimes mostly hard-working middle-class Americans some of which reside in my district have yet to been repaid to be repaid in any meaningful way at all the Sanford victims have received approximately four and a half cents on the dollar while the seemingly more influential or well-connected victims as a Maddog Ponzi scheme have received 75 cents on the dollar recovery this result is really difficult for the public and me quite frankly to understand and obviously it is not acceptable of the more than five billion dollars in losses the court-appointed receiver has recovered just 750 million but what is more appalling than that is that nearly 50% has gone into the pocket of the receiver if it couldn't get any worse the receiver recently barred use his authority to bar individual investor claims against the banks who potentially aided and abetted to Sanford fraud in fact one of my constituents and Alicia Mendez and a dozen other victims recently wrote to the receiver and asked them if they might consider changing their course to which the receiver did not even give them the courtesy of a reply so I would like each of you to express to me or respond it's the question of whether or not you think is appropriate to bar investor claims in a case that has returned investors only four and a half cents in ten years and we can start with Royce Minh and go right down the line so thank you for bringing this topic up obviously it's a travesty as the right word as you the travesty is is the right word I think if there is it means for collecting for wrongdoing we need to ensure that that is something that people can count on to collect if we don't have an adequate system it creates questions and shakes our confidence not only the financial service industry but the oversight of it okay miss commissioner purse I'm happy to look into that issue I'm not familiar specifically with with the issue of the receiver barring barring investors from pursuing claims against banks I'm happy to look into it and get back to you well thank you chairman I'll try to be brief to give my colleagues time but I've actually spent a lot of time I've spent a lot of time on this I've met with the victims victim groups I went down and met with the receiver in the examiner about ten days ago this is not an acceptable result at all with respect to your specific question about the bar there's a judgment to be made there Minds can differ I'm aware of the issue and we're continuing to to look at it but I've rest assured I've been I've been fairly fully briefed on this issue I do I have you do you understand it you're gonna do more than observe it I do you plan any engagement you foresee any engagement do you foresee the Calvary coming they help the victims I let me somebody say this I'm looking for any opportunity to help the victims get more money back faster okay we'll have another question about possible solutions you can be thinking about in the meantime Commissioner Jackson congressman thank you for bringing this to our attention I think Commissioner Royce been put it just right this is a travesty unlike commissioner purse I'd be happy to look into this more deeply of all the things you've said sir what's most troubling is that you have a constituent who didn't get a response and any American investor who's been involved with the situation is entitled to that so I'm happy to look into that further sir thank you Commissioner Lee yes I agree and I will say that in my experience as an enforcement attorney I've seen firsthand the damage that's done to victims such as your constituents and I find it extremely troubling so I wholeheartedly support any effort we can make to return more money to those investors and we'll work with my colleagues to do so okay my time is about to expire so I won't get to ask the other questions but I would appreciate it if you would let my office know of possible solutions you have online or might be able to come up with or anything that you think Congress could do to empower you more to do something about this my time is up I yield back thank you madam chair

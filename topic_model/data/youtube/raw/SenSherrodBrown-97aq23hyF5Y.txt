senator from Ohio Madam President I asked NASA sent to Spencer the quorum call without objection Madam President last week the American lost a baseball legend and a pioneer for civil rights Frank Robinson Frank Robinson so much of his career in Ohio he starred first for the Cincinnati Reds all-star World Series champion a team that built a team around him in Cincinnati with vada pence and others near the end of his career he came to Cleveland and he managed for the Cleveland Indians he was a pioneer for change in baseball Larry Doby whom we honored earlier was honored last year with Congressional Congressional Medal Larry Doby was the first African American player in the American League played for Cleveland came up only several weeks after Jackie Robinson broke the color line then Frank Robinson in 1974 became the major leagues first african-american manager I was at the game when he when he first made that that first game he managed he hit a home run in his first at-bat as the D H for the Indians so he was what's called a player manager in the day since his passing we've heard people say that Frank Robinson was one of the most underappreciated legends of the game but the same could also be said of his importance to our country there are a few players in baseball who have accomplished anything close onto the field or off the field that Frank Robinson did the only person to win an MVP in both the American and national league with the National League Reds the American League Orioles he was Rookie of the Year at the Reds he won two World Series championships he was the World Series Most Valuable Player he won the Triple Crown with the Orioles he was a Gold Glove winner he was 14 time all-star he had 600 career home runs the championships the wards the records alone don't defy don't define who Frank Robinson was or what a success meant to so many people the Reds signed him right out of high school he still strove for Maury took courses at Cincinnati's Xavier University at the beginning of his rookie season he knew that courses wouldn't count toward any degree yet he persevered he's traded the Orioles in 66 he witnessed redlining and segregation that prevented him and his wife from finding housing one of the best players in the major leagues he couldn't find housing in nineteen in the 1960s in Baltimore the city's star baseball player but because of our country's racist housing policies Realtors wouldn't sell him a home parenthetically I would ignited MIT I would also point out that today some of those racist housing policies continue and we have an administration and housing regulators that simply seem too busy to want to enforce fair housing laws my wife and I live in zip code for for 105 in Cleveland Ohio our zip code had more foreclosures in tooth half of 2007 than any ZIP code in the United States don't think that at some of these housing problems in this country and segregated housing again isn't because of some of these some of these actions of the administration and prior to that he didn't stay silent he joined the NACP became a voice for the civil rights movement and as I said he was traded to the Indians Cleveland in 1974 the Indians made him manager as I said the first major league African American major league manager in the history of Major League Baseball it took 30 years it took exactly 20 27 years after Frank Robinson broke the color line for the owners in Major League Baseball to actually hire a black manager 27 years that accomplishment so meant to so much to so many he proved that the amir he proved what never should have been in question all that american that african-americans belong not just on the field but belong as leaders just like any other american that accomplishment resonated not only among baseball fans but in factories in schools and offices around the country he was assembled as so many young americans that these roles of authority and leadership weren't just ones that only certain kids whose skin was a certain color could dream of these dreams are for everyone it was a powerful message it paved the way for so many great leaders on and off the baseball field two years ago the cleveland indians unveiled a statue of Frank Robinson in my hometown and Cleveland at Progressive Field mr. Robinson spoke at the unveiling talked about how far we've come but then he said there are people out there in the minor leagues and at the big league level as coaches they've earned their way up but they just don't seem to be able to break that barrier as often I can tell all I can tell them is don't give up do not give up we still don't see nearly as many African American managers as there should be it as we celebrate Black History Month we as a nation need to heed Frank Robinson's words we don't give up on his dream of breaking down the institutional barriers that are set up for people of color in baseball in throughout our society we don't just honor black trailblazers we continue can we continue our country's unfinished work hard work isn't paying off for far too many people in this country a hard work doesn't pay off for far too many workers and women and people of color have even greater challenges it's even harder to get ahead no matter how hard they work we know that this country doesn't respect work doesn't respect the dignity of work doesn't on earth reorge we as I said we know is is difficult as much as this country doesn't compensate people for the work they do it's again even harder for women and people of color let's honor Frank Robinson's memory let's honor the legacy of black Americans not just with words but with actions to change change that

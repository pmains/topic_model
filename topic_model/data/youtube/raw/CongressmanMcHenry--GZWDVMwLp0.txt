mckenney joins us right now so we're very good to have you thanks jim um the early differences are that the senate wants to sort of stagger or delay the corporate tax cut is that a non-starter to you uh that's not where we are in the house and that's not where the president is so this is a negotiation not just being in the house in the in the senate but also with the white house and the president has a really important voice in this obviously because we wouldn't be in the game for tax reform if he did not win the election a year ago so everything's in play at this point obviously but we want immediate rate reduction and we want permanence now they are also trying to deal with some provisos in your measure in the house measure that have proven very unpopular inability to write off medical expenses and all of that are you open to any of this stuff as well look i look everything that we do every decision we make actually impacts our ability to have broad rate reduction so we've made the tough choices in the house to dramatically simplify the the individual code the corporate code and the individual pass-through small business code and so i think we've made the right choices in the house not perfect obviously a lot of give and take to conform with senate rules and so we're cramming as much tax relief as we can to middle class families and to businesses as possible and still conform with the senate rules when you talk about the medical expense question it's utilized by a very small percentage of largely wealthy people it does not have that broad-based impact on families that we think is necessary for it to meet the desired consequences so what is your sense of the timetable here maybe these to your points or these differences are ironed out um but i believe the goal was to get this done in the house by thanksgiving to get it done in the senate wrapped up and signed by the president by christmas doable yes it has to be doable because we want to have immediate tax relief for middle class families the complaint i hear loudly for my constituents at home and what we saw in elections in virginia yesterday is republicans want results and they demand outcomes and so if we get outcomes we actually pass tax reform and get the first steps of health care reform done the first fulfillment of the president's pledges when it comes to immigration and border security look we're going to be in fine shape a year from now and if we don't get anything done then people are going to say what what use aria so we know the consequences of failure are very real um and that motivates us to get this thing done in a timely fashion you know since a lot of people have criticized the plan maybe given the limitations and the budgetary requirements in order to get this through reconciliation and the simple majority of votes that you it's already watered down and now the senate could water it down some more are you disappointed in the senate um that this is not what it was originally billed to be that a lot of people just disappointed that the tax cut isn't that big well originally it was supposed to be revenue neutral and the senate was able to come up with a compromise to have a trillion and a half dollars of tax relief uh we want to go further in the house obviously we don't have to conform with the senate rules to do what we want to do in the house but if we want to get a bill through the senate with 51 votes we have to conform with their rules am i disappointed in the senate look i'm a member of the house we wake up every day disappointed with the senate it's what we do it's not a partisan issue it's just the nature of a bicameral legislature but i i think even still uh my senate colleagues my senate friends know the consequences of failure um and they will see it uh next november or and we'll see it next november in the house if we don't get things done we're gonna get things done you should hear what they say about you all right uh i'm getting i'm kidding thank you congressman very very much thanks jim all right well probably the

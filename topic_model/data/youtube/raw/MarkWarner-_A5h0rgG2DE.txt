this Supreme Court nominee picked by Donald Trump with quite a shocker the unanimous basically bipartisan appointee decision in the Nixon case was that the rule of law apply to the president and the tapes had to come out I mean most people remember that whether he went to law school or not judge Cavanaugh saying maybe that was wrongly decided maybe Nixon was wrongly decided and that was because of the tension of the time does that view concern you and do you think the White House may have picked him in part because he seems to be more solicitous towards the Nixon view than then holding a president accountable Oh Ari I mean I think it was pretty remarkable at first at the White House this president out sourced his Supreme Court choices to the Federalist Society so he had already had a prearranged group that was anti choice that was anti you know the pro of the protections in the American the Obamacare in terms of folks with pre-existing conditions that had all the conservative positions it is kind of curious the more we see judge Cavanaugh's record about this imperial view of the presidency by the fact if he's not willing to stand with traditional American jurisprudence about holding President Nixon accountable then Lord knows where he stands on on this president and unfortunately that may be one of the reasons why he was selected all right and I'm and that's a big question people are asking was that something that put him somehow head and shoulders above Senator Mark Warner thank you sure go ahead sure section being re that we need to get all not only his opinions but we ought to hold this judge to the same standard that judge Kagan was held to that we ought to be able to at least get a look at his his writings and emails when he was in the White House for President Bush hmm very interesting a Senator Mark Warner thank you Thank You Ari

the chair recognizes representative kamek for the purpose of offering an amendment in the nature of a substitute thank you chairman bilirakis I have an amendment at the desk the two to H.R 750 offered by Miss kamik without objection the reading of the amendment is dispensed with representative camet is recognized for five minutes to speak on the amendment thank you chairman belarakis and all of my colleagues here today I am so glad that we are considering the caution Act of which I am proud to lead with my friend and colleague from the great Sunshine State of Florida on this subcommittee Mr Darren Soto every member in Congress understands the National Security risks posed by the Chinese Communist Party the CCP has very publicly stated their goal to undermine U.S leadership in the world and part of that mission involves International Espionage efforts against the United States government our citizens and our allies a critical part of this operation is a massive data collection on American citizens across the country through a variety of methods which includes Tick Tock what many Americans across the country view as an innocuous social media app filled with fun dances filters and Trends is in fact a method by which the CCP is collecting information on all users Tick Tock which is owned by bike dance a privately held company that is headquartered in Beijing is actually not a private company people must remind be reminded that the so-called private companies in China are actually required by law to turn their user data data over to the CCP in short the government owns them and by extension everything that they collect data on and their users in December of 2022 FBI director Chris Ray noted that the Chinese government can control Tick-Tock can control tick tock's recommendation algorithm that allows their government to manipulate content that could be used for influence operations in addition to the data collection risks for other Espionage operations on December 29 2022 recognizing these security risks of tick tock the president signed into law no tick tock on government devices act which prohibits Tick-Tock from being downloaded or used on any device issued by the United States government or government corporation the caution Act of 2023 which I introduced with representative Soto would build off of the prohibition of tick tock on federal devices to inform consumers of the security risks posed by using the app specifically the bill would require any person selling or Distributing a mobile app that is banned on federal government devices to disclose the fact in a clear and conspicuous manner to any individual who downloads updates or otherwise uses the application this required disclosure would be enforced by the Federal Trade Commission every person using Tick Tock in the United States at minimum deserves to know that the federal government has banned the use of the app on federal devices due to the severe security risks this bill would properly inform individuals of the risks prior to downloading or updating the app again I would like to thank Mr Soto for helping lead this effort with me and would like to thank chairman bilirakis for considering this bill in today's markup I encourage all members of the subcommittee to support it and with that I yield back

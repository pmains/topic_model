the congressman raja krishnamoorthy went on that taiwan visit with speaker pelosi he joins us tonight hi congressman welcome to the show so you are well aware of the controversy surrounding this trip the head of your own party the president of the united states was not thrilled what was accomplished i think couple things one uh especially in light of what we've seen in ukraine it's so important for us to shore up our alliances with our partners and friends in that part of the world where china has been throwing its elbows militarily long before we visited taiwan and it continues today then secondly we also want to shore up our economic partnership with these folks uh the we talked a lot about the chips and science act which we passed last week in light of that and in part due to that uh for instance taiwan is investing 25 billion dollars in american manufacturing facilities for uh semiconductor manufacturing and so that is really important as well because they are looking to increasingly move their investments from the people's republic of china to places like the united states and we want to be there to encourage that but it came with risks right i mean since the visit china has escalated military intimidation against taiwan by firing multiple missiles um you know lots of warnings you're hearing it also the concern from the u.s side as well were the benefits that you laid out of this trip really worth the the risk to taiwan and the united states here and the consequences absolutely a hundred percent um if the cost of avoiding those risks is seeding control of taiwan or even exceeding control of our travel schedule to the chinese communist party we are not going to pay that price and so uh the only thing unfortunately that the folks who run the chinese communist party respect is strength and so we have to show strength in order to keep peace and stability in that region let me ask you this uh because it leaked out that this was maybe some somewhere that that nancy pelosi and the congregation were going to go i mean had it not leaked out would you definitely have gone or did you feel like because it was already out in the public sphere you had to go then because you didn't want it to look like the chinese leader is dictating your travel schedule now we were going to go regardless remember this was planned before but unfortunately speaker pelosi myself and others came down with kovid and so we were unable to go before at the end of the day we need to be there meeting with our partners and allies who feel tremendous um kind of almost insecurity about chinese aggression and so we have to make sure that we do everything we can to restore their confidence uh that we are there with them and and so we are going to do that so i want to get to domestic affairs in a moment but one more question on this on this point of taiwan the us has occupied sort of an awkward middle position when it comes to taiwan um but still holding the line that look we have a one china policy does this trip um create the perception at the very least a full-fledged support of taiwanese independence perception of a change in policy um i don't believe so i believe that we basically reaffirmed our uh six assurances our joint communiques to the chinese government the prc as well as uh what is obligated under the taiwan relations act but one very important part of the taiwan relations act is affirming and supporting taiwan's right to defend itself and we're going to continue to do that even at the same time that we're trying to make sure that there's peace and stability across the taiwan strait all right i want to turn back home here you tweeted this week quote this is how prevalent the big lie is in republican politics arizona will have a full slate of election deniers on the ballot in november but at the same time democrats are throwing their weight behind some pretty extreme candidates in gop primaries is this strategy too risky i think that uh unfortunately these are the folks that the republican party in a lot of these states are electing um and i think but democrats are helping to raise awareness of them and and putting money in their coffers in some of these places in some of these the dcc uh spent 300 000 dollars in michigan i believe for gibbs the opponent of peter meyer and gibbs one go ahead yeah i think that uh mr gibbs was going to prevail regardless uh of what the d triple c did but at the end at the end of the day i think the voters of the republican party have to decide who their nominees are and um any uh efforts to clarify what some of these folks positions are um you know makes it more transparent about what their choices are um all that being said uh i think that uh even other people who are not necessarily election deniers are maintaining very extreme views whether it's regard to reproductive health care you saw what happened in indiana with a near total abortion ban or their views extremist views with regard to basically denying that there's any need for common sense gun regulation and so i think those are really going to be front and center on the election ballot in november okay thank you so much and i'm i'm distracted by what i think is a toddler or your child behind you very cute that's the reality of doing live heads from home congressman raja christian murthy thank you very much well deadly violence this evening in north

Brekke dues were getting in to transition sources Trump transition sources now confirming to CNN that the president-elect will delay his scheduled news conference on his business plans than his conference have been scheduled for this thursday the sources now tell CNN the president-elect will make the announcement on how easing up his business to avoid any potential conflicts of interest as much as possible handing over the business to his adult children that news conference the sources say will now take place in January we're getting more information on this we're back with the house intelligence committee member Andre then are you satisfied that he will be able to make sure that his adult children his two sons in particular some others run the business so that he avoids any potential conflict of interest as president of the United States well mr. Trump's decision to choose whomever he wishes to run as organizations as a personal one I just want to make sure that we don't have the appearance of impropriety or any impropriety as relates to our commander-in-chief being focused on the issues of the day the job of president is very demanding and it requires that that president be free of any personal business obligation to focus on the American people and focus on our presence in the world and moving our country forward as you know the president-elect is rejecting the CIA is concerned the intelligence committees concern about Russia's involvement he's concerned that all of these stories all these reports are politically motivated to raise questions about his legitimacy as as the elected president of the United States what's your response to that well I think the men and women who work hard each and every day throughout our 17 intelligence agencies do a great job I think it's important to note that we cannot minimize their great work nor can we recklessly accuse this of being a false flag operation I think it's irresponsible and it's unbecoming of a commander in chief and my hope is that mr. Trump will walk back his language going forward because i think these times are ever critical wolf and it's time for us to make these assessments quite seriously because we are the greatest nation in recorded history and that does not come without its enemies how do you respond to that tweet that the Trump campaign released over these past few days saying look the US intelligence community got it way wrong as far as Saddam Hussein stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction and they might be getting as I don't believe ever you hear from the US intelligence community you're a member of the Intelligence Committee what's your response well you know it's obvious that intelligence is not perfect it's we're always making corrections that the intelligence community is always coming with additional information from different sources and so it's not it's not fail proof but at the same time he cannot cite the situation that happened with Saddam Hussein in Iraq and compared to this one I think what is most important is that he has the microphone he has the largest stage in the world and to talk recklessly because he's still speaking to his group of supporters he styling himself as being someone who's anti-establishment he's styling himself as someone who was a bit of a matter of maverick and that fits into his narrative I want you to listen to congressman to what the president-elect said yesterday about the daily presidential intelligence briefings that he's been getting maybe once a week the Vice president-elect gets them every day he gets a baby once a week listen to what he said these are very good people that are giving me the briefings and I said if something should change from this point immediately call me I'm available on one minute's notice I don't have to be told you know I'm like a smart person I don't have to be told the same thing and the same words every single day for the next eight years could behaviors but eight years I don't need that you think that's an appropriate attitude for the incoming commander in chief you know think about the words my grandmother told me I think about Lee Hamilton one of our state's dignitaries and statesman who said on the Foreign Affairs Committee I think about congressman any Jacobs who gave me the advice to master the briefing master the briefing master the briefing it's about showing up putting yourself into the work understand the different policy issues and it may sound redundant but if you're there for practice each and every day understanding these issues that will help hone your instincts it will put you into in tune with the hard work and the sacrifices that these men or women are making our intelligence community engine every day and you may miss something if you simply dismiss the intelligence briefing there's so much going on in our world each and every day that requires a commander in chief to be briefed by the FBI and the CIA on a daily basis and to be as dismissive as he has been troubles me because this is not a business this is the United States of America ten members of the electoral college they're asking for a full intelligence briefing on Russia's role in the election before they make it official they do their vote next week for the electoral college youth what today John Podesta was the Clinton campaign Sharon and he came out in support of that effort that these members of the electoral college should have a full-scale briefing you really think that's a good idea I think it's important that the the members of the electoral college are briefed to the degree that it would it would bring calm to their minds I don't think that a top secret level security briefing is necessary but I think that perhaps a briefing is not out of the question to the degree that it would calm their concerns I think going back to the founding fathers wanting to establish the Electoral College which is very complicated that's another conversation but at least in wanting to prevent a buffer in fact from having the influence of a foreign nation interfere with our elections and so here we are right now with members of the electoral college being deeply concerned about the results and the fact that there could have been external influences ie Russia I don't think it's it's it's out of the question to have some kind of briefing the level of the briefing concerns me but to have a general briefing i think is acceptable but you really think it's a realistic is credible at all that the Electoral College where they meet next week won't make it a fish and elect Donald Trump as the next president of the United States what wolf based on the numbers the numbers that you see each and every day the numbers you see more than I do I think you could best answer that more than I can he's got the it's got you know he clearly has a lot more electoral college votes then Hillary Clinton has and that should make it official alright now we're going to I just want to wrap it up with one final question that congressman I know you got to run before I let you go even as Donald Trump is questioning Russia's involvement in the hacking of the DNC the Clinton campaign he's also now seriously considering Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State that announcement could come as early as this week how concerned are you if you are about tillerson tiller sins work over the years in Russia and his personal relationship with Vladimir Putin well he certainly doesn't have a background as a diplomat I'm concerned that anyone who is representing our our nation as a global ambassador of sorts will have to be a deeply insurance of the issues of the israeli-palestinian conflict issues with Syria Russia the Ukraine South China Sea and other parts of our globe just to name a few but to have someone who is alleged to have ties to the Russian government given mr. Trump's rhetoric given the evidence that has been unearthed by the CIA as it relates to hacking control that troubles me even even more so and I think we have to take a greater look beyond the political pageantry that's taking place beyond the narrative of mr. Trump being this maverick of sorts going against traditional politics we have to look at the future of our country and going forward we cannot take this electoral college a process lightly and we cannot take our electoral process lightly and we have to really decide the fate country whether you're Republican or Democrat independent libertarian we have to really talk about these issues and not allow elections to be based on our emotional response but really look at the candidates deeply and look at their background experience and see who we really want to leave our nation lead our nation going forward congressman Andre Carson to the Intelligence Committee thanks for joining us

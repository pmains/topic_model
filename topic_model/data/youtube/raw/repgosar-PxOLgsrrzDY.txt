Thank You chairman McClintock for holding today's hearing in to my friend congressman Scott Tipton for introducing this important legislation in the West we have a saying whiskeys for drinking waters for fighting over and nowhere is that more true than the state of Arizona in Arizona water means life the majority of my state would be an under populated desert without the forward-thinking of leaders when it comes to water policy those leaders recognize that Arizona faces constraints on its water supply more severe than almost any other state in the nation and took careful proactive precautions to protect and manage our water resources in fact before Arizona even became a state the territorial legislature adopted the 1864 Howell Code that established our prior appropriations doctrine over surface right surface water rights the pursuit of water enabled a small state of ranchers miners and farmers to take off economically and become the beautiful diverse place to live in today and the century long battles over our natural resources in particular water rights had an integral role in formulating our state's political landscape today Arizona is a very independent state politically shaped by people of all walks of life who are valued states rights and self-determination that is why this bill we are considering today is so important Arizona has one of the most if not the most intricate state water law in our country the right to water is a carefully guarded property right held at a higher value than a person's home or mature material possessions so the notion that the government can come in and hold permits leases and rights of a hostage and have in efforts to get a private entity to forfeit its private property rights its water right is downright offensive and that is exactly what the United States Forest Service is currently doing under a 2011 directive pertaining to ski area special use permits the Forest Service is trying to require an applicant for a permit to relinquish privately held water rights to the federal government as a permanent condition there is no compensation for this transfer of Rights even though our constituents or their descendants have spent major portions of their lives in their money to the these rights this is an egregious policy that must be stopped and is a violation of our state sovereignty and individual property rights in real Arizona our economy is heavily reliant on activities on federal lands including northern Arizona Ski Area Arizona Snowbowl our minds our ranches and our agricultural production these industries are the bedrock of Arizona's five seas and our economic viability and the Forest Service's policies could bring all of these important economic drivers to a halt my friends congressman Tipton's legislation the water rights Protection Act shields our constituents from this kind of federal regulatory water grab and upholds our state's sovereignty to protect its water interest I support I strongly support these goals in fact I see fighting for these goals as my obligation as one of Arizona's rural representatives to the federal government I look forward to working with some of the experts on the ground in Arizona and with Scott to make sure to ensure that no state recognized is no state recognized water rights goes unprotected from the class of actions this bill prohibits ultimately I look forward to helping the bill's sponsors quickly advanced as bipartisan legislation its enactment is critical to a reasserting state sovereignty over water rights and the economic viability of our Western communities I look forward to hearing from the witnesses and I yield back the balance of my time thank you

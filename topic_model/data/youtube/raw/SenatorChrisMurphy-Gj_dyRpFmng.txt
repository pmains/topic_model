and I'd share the ranking members grave concern about the announcement this morning regarding the withdrawal of non-emergency personnel from Iraq it's a vague announcement this could be consular services it could be all non-military personnel we have no idea about the details miss Thompson can you share any details with us this morning about exactly what personnel are being withdrawn from Baghdad in other parts of Iraq senator I don't oversee Diplomatic Security but I assure you the team will take the questions back for our leadership miss Thompson I want to talk to you about Iran for a moment I just want to confirm what the purpose of our pressure campaign is many of us feel that it's been ham handed without a well-defined endgame but I assume that the purpose of this maximum pressure campaign is in the end to compel the Iranians back to the negotiating table to enter into a new negotiation over a set of u.s. objectives is that the purpose of this campaign that's an element of that campaign yes senator what do you mean that it's an element it's the the strategy is has it more details than that I mean that is one portion of it it's also to prevent the continued expansion of the Millian activity through the region and and the list that the secretary has been forthcoming with with the 12 items so it that is certainly an element of it but we don't imagine that they are going to fulfill those 12 objectives on their own this is where there will have to be a negotiation with the Iranians over our desire to have them fulfill those 12 u.s. stated goals that's correct the Secretary's has stated he prefers a diplomatic solution of that and so this set of goals that the secretary has laid out which calls on the Iranians to stop enrichment never pursue plutonium processing and their ballistic missile program release all prisoners and support for Hezbollah Hamas and Islamic Jihad and support for the Houthis withdraw forces from Syria and support for the Taliban and the IRGC support from and terrorist groups and stop threatening behavior that list remains our bottom line that is what we expect the Iranians to produce either on their own unilaterally or through a negotiated process that's correct senator let me ask another question of you mr. Trachtenberg let me try to ask the same question that Senator Menendez asked a a negotiation requires to willing parties right nobody enters into negotiation if they're told that the outset they're going to get nothing from it and so let me ask the same question that he asked regarding why China would enter into a negotiation with the United States and perhaps with Russia when today reportedly China has 300 warheads and between the United States and Russia we have thousands I'm not asking you to sort of lay out what our concessions would be but give us an idea that you have some plan as to make the case to China that there would be a benefit to them to limit their nuclear capability what general area of concessions might we offer them well senator I appreciate your question we are at the beginning of a process right now and I would say China has envisioned itself as as a major power on the world stage China has been flexing its military muscle China has been undertaking a number of actions in order to garner respect and attention as a major player now if China wishes to be treated as a major player then China should accept the responsibilities of a major power in the world today and that includes engaging with respect to its nuclear arsenal and its nuclear capabilities so while we are at the start of this process I believe that it is entirely legitimate for us to seek ways to engage the Chinese such that they understand if they are going to be a player a responsible player on the world stage that they should address these issues in a responsible manner so III ask these questions because it appears to me as if the preconditions for negotiations with Iran and what seems to me a very ill thought out strategy for engaging China is just an excuse to get no agreement if you set up a list of requirements for negotiations with Iran that are wholly and completely unrealistic if you believe that the Chinese should negotiate with us just because they are a great power you are setting up the negotiations for failure in fact you're setting up the inevitability that the negotiations will never begin and so that's what I think you here as a worry from many members of this committee that well we would love for Iran to give up their support for Hezbollah Hamas the Houthis we would love for them to abandon their ballistic missile program I would love for the Chinese just to decide that because they are a great power that they should start negotiations with us when it comes to arms control hope is not a strategy and I worry in the end that these are just all excuses for why we are never going to enter into a meaningful dialogue with either that's why too many of us this seems like escalation with no end game

also tonight at this very moment senator Ted Cruz is approaching his fourth hour of speaking out against Obamacare the Texas Republican has vowed to continue talking until he is unable to stand his symbolic act comes six days before a potential government shutdown tomorrow the Senate is set to take his first action will avoid a shutdown while setting up a showdown with congressional Republicans steve chen appeal on capitol hill tonight with what this all means see and obamacare at the center of that political dividing line but the bottom line is a decision must be reached in less than a week now mate may seem like a daunting task several local lawmakers are trying to press that process forward with the potential for a government shutdown less than a week away frustration on the hill is reaching a boiling point I am so frustrated for all the people of Maryland in all of the people in the united states that should have a government that they can count on to operate the budget ball is now in the corner of the senate which may not pass it back to the house until late in the week setting up a government shutdown showdown it would be catastrophic uh Minter's and and just tragic because there's no reason for it senator Tim Kaine on the Budget Committee worries about among other things a stoppage of military pay although in past shutdowns that pay has later been administered retro actively still the political pressure is on to settle the stalemate it's going to take a lot of moving pieces to fall into place at the right time there's a clear path to avert a shutdown but there's also clear signs that John Boehner could hold it up and we could be standing here next week having a discussion about how long shutdown could last senator Kaine agrees on the need for less posturing and more political give-and-take and points out this budget battle isn't just about the money it's about congressional compromise it will not happen unless the house agrees to sit down at a table to a budget conference if they refuse to do it then we're going to continue to have one challenge after the next but if they agree to do it and we'll be able to find a compromise so if there's a political shutdown would we feel it right away yeah we would from furloughs to the shutdown of national parks and museums if you're trying to travel forget about getting a passport that said many political analysts believe that the government will be able that Congress will be able to avoid the shutdown but if so expect a last-minute deal live at the Capitol Steve shanna be abc7 news

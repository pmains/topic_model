congresswoman maxine waters the democrat of california as ever congresswoman thanks for your time tonight you're so welcome delighted to be with you again the president's new strategy for afghanistan are you for it or are you against it well first of all i'm terribly saddened uh after having listened to the speech uh i felt bad for this young bright articulate president uh who wants to do the right thing but made commitments during his campaign that he was going into afghanistan he was going to get osama bin laden and now he's backed against the wall with a strategy that i think has no end it doesn't really resonate for me i'm saddened because 30 000 new troops are going to go into afghanistan i guess they're going to be fighting in pakistan and afghanistan al qaeda and taliban and where does it end and what do we do we have to kill all of the taliban and we're going to try and transition that government into a democracy i don't get it it doesn't work for me was the the setting of a of a beginning of the end essentially in saying that the troop drawdown will begin no later or will begin by july 2011 and will be fully underway no later than january 2012. was that not sufficient in terms of an end date or are you suspicious that at some point the military will have to talk him out of it or try to talk him out of that end date well for me it sounded as if we were going to begin training uh the afghanistan troops uh in 2011. i did not hear that we were going to have them all trained and we would be able to get out i think that he meant that to be the beginning of a withdrawal but of course we don't know when there's no end date to it then i would if he had said or or if someone from the administration says in the next few days look this is this is the time frame the the withdrawal begins uh ready or not for want of a better phrase july 2011 august 2011 somewhere in there where will some of your concerns be modified at that point or is this larger than that some i like the idea that we would get involved in a real withdrawal and we would employ diplomacy and that we would engage the 43 other nations that he pointed to to help us do all of this but i'm not convinced have you been able to speak with any of your colleagues about this either since the speech or before it you have a do you have a sense you have a sense of this and you have a sense of whether you and and those who think like you are going to be grudgingly supportive of this president or will you attempt to to stop what he wants to do yes i did have an opportunity to speak with my colleague barbara lee who is the head of the black caucus and who's very prominent in the progressive caucus and we both agree that we cannot support the president this continuing effort and we will not support him so what happens we've heard uh from several sources that this will be budgeted through ordinary means there will be no special bits of legislation the way president bush handled iraq if these regular requests for funding come through you you will have to vote against them yes i would have to vote against it as a matter of fact the president did say that his request would be transparent and that it would be shown in the budget people are talking about a war tax they're talking about all kinds of things but for me i cannot support this expansion i cannot support a budget that will cost us one million dollars per year for every soldier that we send there is too much and we're losing a lot of young lives and we have a domestic agenda that's unmet a big deficit i want to focus more on the domestic agenda i want to wind out of afghanistan with some help for rebuilding that infrastructure and being of assistance to the people but i did not hear that articulated quite that way congresswoman maxine waters of california great thanks for your for your frankness and for your time tonight well you certainly welcome thank you that

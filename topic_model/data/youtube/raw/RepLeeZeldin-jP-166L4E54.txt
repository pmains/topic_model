laying out the very important case here tonight my second special counsel is needed with regards to misconduct at the highest levels of the DOJ and FBI related to Phi's abuse how and why the Hillary Clinton email probe ended how and why the Trump Russia probe began and we cannot expect the DOJ and FBI to fully investigate themselves Mr Speaker I have a great amount of respect for everyone at the Justice Department who has served and continues to serve for all of the right reasons so I mentioned earlier integrity independence patriotism objectivity and commitment to the rule of law a Special Counsel can ensure transparency and accountability so that these historic legendary and necessary agencies can move forward with their important mission better than ever before the list of concerns the warrant an immediate and independent investigation is long and growing by the day first tonight I will discuss the misconduct with regards to how and why the Hillary Clinton email probe ended next we will cover FISA abuse and finally we will discuss the manner in which the Trump Russia probe began was extended continued and became a special counsel probe but before discussing each of these topics individually is important to address the political bias that it has existed among individuals at the highest levels of the DOJ and FBI first there was FBI agent Peter struck who is the chief of the FBI's counter espionage section additionally there was agent Struck's mistress FBI counts ELISA page aside from the fact that they were in love is important to note that these two individuals exchanged many texts detailing their personal biases overcoming their better judgment in performance of their duties text messages exchanged between struck and page during a period of August 16 2015 to May 17 2017 shows substantial evidence of politicizing federal law enforcement and improperly handling investigations within the agency the texts contain egregious evidence of bias against President Trump before and after the November 2016 Paige would write quote Trump should go F himself and quote struck would text quote F Trump now that's barely even starting to scratch the surface with those two it's also worth noting that their texts for some reason were not stored within the FBI archive system an egregious oversight blamed on a technical glitch and even after these messages were partially recovered by the agency's Inspector General in January 2018 many unanswered questions remain regarding impropriety and bias then there was DOJ senior official Bruce or forth and commanded the agency while the DOJ and FBI were improperly submitting FISA applications based on fusion gps's work on behalf of the DNC and Hillary Clinton campaign it was never disclosed that Bruce ORS wife worked at fusion GPS and that he served as the middleman between Christopher steel and the Justice Department then there was FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe whose wife dr. Jill McCabe was running for Virginia State Senate and received six hundred and seventy five thousand dollars in donations from the Virginia Democratic Party and common good VA the leadership pack controlled by Democratic Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe a longtime Clinton associate there are just these are just a few of the many highlights of partisan bias at the highest levels of DOJ and FBI that list and the evidence runs much much deeper the Hillary Clinton email probe while these various rogue agents were busy trying to obstruct Donald Trump from day one they were failing to properly complete their investigation into the Hillary Clinton male controversy during her tenure as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton violated federal law and state department rules regulations and protocol by using a private email server near Chappaqua New York home she would transmit emails that contain sensitive information or classified material on this unsecured server this use of a private server was meant to blatantly get around FOIA and to avoid having to turn over incriminating emails in the case of a subpoena her plan proved to be partially successful various sensitive email subject to grand jury and congressional subpoenas were destroyed through bleach bidding and the destruction of hardware before they could be obtained by investigators the FBI led by then director James Comey began an incomplete investigation into this serious issue and according to transcripts obtained by the Senate Judiciary Committee Comey was prepared to exonerate Secretary Clinton as early as April or May of 2016 when he began to draft a statement announcing the end of his investigation before up to 17 key witnesses including Secretary Clinton herself and several of her closest aides were even interviewed Cheryl Mills who served as counselor and chief of staff to Hillary Clinton during her whole tenure as United States Secretary of State was offered immunity from prosecution by the FBI during this investigation exchange for access to her laptop that contained many of the questionable emails why and after watching president's trump trip president Trump's personal attorney last week at a no-knock raid of his home in office that is especially troubling how the scales of justice are just not equal under the law that's a big problem back to Comey now he contradicted those transcripts I mentioned when he stated during sworn testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on September 28th of 2016 that he made the decision not to recommend criminal charges for Hillary Clinton after she was interviewed by the FBI on July 2nd 2016 that was a flat-out lie under oath former director Comey in the final draft of his statement aloud Peter struck to replace grossly negligent which is legally punishable under federal law with extremely careless which is legal which is not legally punishable under federal law federal law states that gross negligence and handling our nation's intelligence can be punished criminally with prison time and/or fines and then there was the infamous tarmac meeting on June 27th 2016 just days before Hillary Clinton would end up being exonerated attorney general Loretta Lynch at a covert meeting with Hillary Clinton's husband former President Bill Clinton aboard AG Lynch's plane on the tarmac in Phoenix Arizona the likelihood of this conversation being just a small talk was zero let's not forget that it was AG Lynch who insisted that the Hillary Clinton male probe not even be called an investigation instead he insisted it be called a matter as if the Clinton campaign was driving the bus of the investigation and calling the shots soon after Comey violated DOJ rules and unilaterally exonerated then presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in a public statement to the media one day later on July 6 2016 an announcement followed from AG Lynch that the DOJ investigation into then presidential candidate Hillary Clinton would be formally closed with no criminal charges the seemingly endless trail of crimes and misconduct relating to Hillary Clinton's emails did not end there in September 2016 the FBI during examination of the personal laptop of former Congressman Anthony Weiner as part of an unrelated investigation to him sending sexually explicit messages to a teenage girl discovered previously unexamined State Department classified emails belonging to his spouse top Clinton aide Huma medine the man within the FBI tasked with examining these additional emails was guess who FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe whose wife was then in the midst of a Virginia State Senate campaign generously supported by Clinton operatives and Clinton allied money it then took until October 28th of 2016 for Comey to announced via a letter to the chairman of the relevant congressional committees that he was reopening the investigation an additional egregious delay after McCabe failed to even examine the illicit emails for at least three weeks at the FBI discovered them on Anthony Weiner's computer the DOJ Inspector General is still conducting an investigation into whether then FBI deputy director McCabe and other FBI saw to purposely delay the release of these illicit emails for politically motivated purposes Hillary Clinton's privileged status or whole career and especially during the Obama administration as above the law does it end with her illegal misuse of classified emails throughout the Obama administration while she was serving as Secretary of State and later as she was running for president the Department of Justice also failed to fully investigate serious concerns surrounding the connections between her her husband and the Clinton Foundation - Russian controlled company uranium one which receives State Department approval to purchase American uranium mines in 2010 also in 2010 while Russian state interests were working to both acquire a majority stake in uranium 1 and to purchase American mines Bill Clinton was paid $500,000 for speech in Moscow by a Kremlin linked Russian investment bank that was underwriting uranium 1 stock nothing to see here right the Obama DOJ ignored an FBI probe on a matter a confidential informant who worked with the FBI to uncover bribery and other corruption related to the uranium matte uranium one matter was threatened with reprisal by the Justice Department under AG Lynch when he tried to come forward in 2016 the Senate Judiciary Committee launched a probe in October of 2017 to investigate the uranium 1 issue including whether federal agencies such as this state department knew the FBI was looking into possible corruption before the deal was approved mr. speaker this again it brings home the urgent need for an independent and fair investigation collusion with corrupt Russian actors is indeed a very serious concern and a threat to US national security especially when critical resources that impact national and global security such as uranium are up for grabs too questionable companies that were not properly scrutinized the do to their connections with an influential family FISA abuse mr. speaker there are also very serious concerns that in October 2016 the FBI and DOJ used politically biased unverified sources to improperly obtain a FISA warrant I own an American citizen this warrant granted us intelligence and law enforcement agencies sweeping power to collect bulk information and conduct about collection which results in surveillance of a broad array of private communications from the past present and future including those of US citizens not specifically targeted in the FISA authorized warrant to obtain these warrants FBI and DOJ officials submitted an unverified dossier prepared by Christopher Steele to the FISA Court failing to disclose that Christopher Steele was hired by the firm Fuzion GPS which was hired by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign to prepare this dossier and that the source was unreliable and soon thereafter was going to be terminated as an asset the FISA Court was not informed that Christopher Steele was actively opposed to the election of Donald Trump that he was the unnamed source cited in the media reports that the FBI used to corroborate his dossier and that fusion GPS had been hired to perform previous anti-trump research efforts in 2015 the woods' procedures which are the FBI's mandatory vetting process required for all FISA warrant applications instituted to ensure that all facts contained in an application are accurate and verified to clearly support probable cause for the warrant it was clearly not followed former director Comey then admitted in sworn testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee On June 8th 2017 that material contained in the steel dossier was known to be both salacious and unverified since FISA applications are rarely turned down and almost never subject to appeal are presented in closed court with no public record where the government is not challenged by any defense it is imperative that the government take extra care to validate the information being utilized to build their case before they take the extraordinary step of waiving rights of a US citizen without his or her knowledge or the opportunity to defend themselves these are secret documents submitted to a secret court to spy on an American citizen the government has a responsibility not only to provide the best evidence they have in support of their case but to also provide the best evidence that they have against their case these deeply flawed in questionable FISA warrant applications utilizing illicit sources and politically biased intelligence were approved by DOJ and FBI officials at the highest levels before being submitted to the FISA Court it was further not disclosed to the FISA Court as I referenced earlier that the wife of the fourth ranking DOJ official Bruce or was an employee of fusion GPS and Christopher Steele directly transmitted the dossier and other information to Bruce or through Bruce or for submission to the FISA Court let's talk about how and why the Trump Russia probe began mr. speaker make no mistake the Trump Russia probe was launched because Donald Trump won the GOP nomination for president states it's clear why do J and FBI didn't want to turn over the memo opening the investigation they didn't come up with a sufficient alternative justification to start the probe the Trump Russia probe was then continued because Trump became very close to possibly being elected president states it's clear why do Jane FBI didn't want the Nunez memo released they broke the rules and misled a FISA Court to improperly secured a warrant to spy on a US citizen the Trump Russia probe then became a Special Counsel probe because Donald Trump subsequently won the election and the FBI director then illegally leaked classified info to the media to trigger a Special Counsel appointment director Comey had prepared a series of seven memos containing classified information including notes on his conversations with President Trump he then admitted in sworn testimony to the Senate Committee on Intelligence in June 2017 that he had leaked this classified content to a personal friend and encouraged that friend to share the material with the press that is a blatant violation of federal law meant to protect sensitive information from falling into the wrong hands an investigation conducted by the Senate Judiciary Committee later revealed that the personal friend of director Comey was professor Daniel Richmond of Columbia Law School that mr. Comey provided him with four of the seven memoranda all containing classified information mr. speaker in closing with all of this grievous misconduct at the highest levels of the DOJ and FBI the blatant violations of the Constitution and law and so many serious unanswered questions this matter must be investigated by someone who can act independently from outside of the Justice Department the nearly two and a half years the des Trump Russia probe has continued on with zero accountability still appears to be without any evidence that President Trump colluded with the Russians this has been some of the most tumultuous years in the history of the FBI and DOJ but with transparency and accountability these awesome agencies can get everything back on track in March 2018 former FBI director McCabe was fired by AG Jeff Sessions who noted at deputy director McCabe quote lacked candor including under oath on multiple occasions and had partaken in quote unauthorized disclosure to the news media this is among other violations noted in a report issued by the FBI Office of Inspector General after a wide rage reaching investigation to McCabe's conduct a myriad of other DOJ and FBI personnel have been fired demoted or resigned during these past few years former FBI director Comey chief of staff to the director James rebecky FBI general counsel James Baker FBI agent Peter struck FBI counsel Lisa Paige FBI special agent Josh Campbell DOJ senior official Bruce or FBI assistant director Michael Court an and Assistant Attorney General Peter Kazakh the DOJ Inspector General's Office has undoubtedly done great work to uncover misconduct and expose bias but the mission of the OIG is limited only to quote deter and detect waste fraud abuse and misconduct and DOJ programs and personnel and to promote economy and efficiency in those programs a fully independent special counsel has greater autonomy than an AG IG or other federal prosecutors to run a non-biased investigation and if NASA sorry bring forth criminal charges with so much at risk including integrity of our federal law enforcement agencies which are tasked with protecting our nation and upholding the rule of law the need is more urgent than ever this is not about politics but about the principles that bind together our nation and our constitutional system of government equality under the law and impartiality of justice it was it what brings all of us to the House floor tonight urging the Attorney General the United States to take immediate action through the appointment of a second special counsel too many questions remain unanswered and too much is at stake mr. sessions it is very important to take this action and appoint a second special counsel

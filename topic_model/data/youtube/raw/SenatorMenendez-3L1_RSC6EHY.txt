so um let me start off with you Mr Garcia the the diversity and inclusion subcommittee submitted their recommendations on July 7th 2021 that's after the long two-year period you just you describe it's been about a year since then and I wanted to get your thoughts uh on the progress that has been made in your view what if anything has changed about the overall state of diversity and asset management Since You released these recommendations and how would you rate the sec's progress in responding to your recommendations sure thank you Senator uh first it is remarkable that the AMAC there are only two minority members on the whole committee unanimously supported all of these efforts and many of them come from the biggest institutions in this country it has been extremely disappointing that here we are today Senator and only the two most least impactful items have been implemented if I were a teacher I would give it an eye for incomplete because not only do they do the two least impactful with very little Fanfare uh but there's already been comments by the other Commissioners that suggest that they want to have it a discussion in a dialogue and it sounds like from their own comments that they are supportive of most if not all of them and I believe the public deserves and we on the amec deserves if they're not going to be implementing them why not we spent hundreds of hours under the guys that this faka committee was relevant and important and we sure would like to see a conclusion one way or the other senator yeah let me ask you I think it's important to note that using the excuse of fiduciary duty to exclude women in minority-led firms runs contrary to the actual data there's a large and growing body of evidence including Amax study that shows diversely LED firms outperform their non-diverse counterparts so this is about the bottom line not even talking about any societal benefit I'm just talking about the bottom line given this data do you agree that a firm's diversity particularly at the management level is material information that investment advisors should be able to consider when making recommendations to their clients absolutely Senator I'd go a step further I would suggest that the elimination of women in minority-owned firms that have already been proven to perform just as well if not better than the non-diverse firms by excluding them you might very well be in violation if you produce your duty because after all your duty is to Source good managers regardless of who they are and so my view is by casting a very narrow net on purpose to bring up barriers of Entry to exclude these firms is not right and is costing your clients and last question to you does uh do you believe the SEC currently has the authority to implement these enhanced disclosures yes sir in fact we worked very closely with many of the SEC staff uh legal staff and one of the members of our subcommittee was a former SEC legal staffer and we were very careful to make sure that everything that we recommended is within their Lane of their Authority so that's already gone through the process or we would not have even recommended it I would even suggest that one of the items which is the pay to play rules all we asked was to reevaluate it and to study it my own view is it should be discarded entirely because all it does is favor other Industries to the disfavor of the financial community and as a person who has worked very hard it just doesn't feel good to suggest that there are more people in my industry doing things they shouldn't do than any others and commissioner purse said it best which she said there are already laws on the books yeah so I think about this question uh as a question of proving the bottom line right and there are many elements of it for example years ago Chevrolet tried to sell the Chevy Nova in Latin America Nova and Spanish means it won't move uh I don't care how good a marketing plan you have if you're trying to sell a car that won't that's called it won't move it's not going to do very well that's just a simple example of language but understanding language business Customs culture in the c-suite and a senior executive management is helpful to the bottom line I think about the Hispanic community that has a two trillion dollars domestic Marketplace younger by a decade than the rest of the population growing exponentially for bottom line reasons I would want to be uh on them like white on rice which means having individuals who understand uh the nature of how you get greater market share and and in doing so there is a ripple effect the benefit to those communities that if I can can help my company make better investment decisions that would endure to the benefit of places in the country that they might not otherwise look like they would have opportunities for enhancement of Economic Opportunity for people there so that's that's in part how I look at this Center Scott

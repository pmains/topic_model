I yield time to my good friend the gentleman from Louisiana representative Higgins I thank the gentleman I thank my colleagues and I hope America is paying attention because we cannot continue to fund a government that appears to be determined to destroy our country from within we have millions of illegal aliens crossing our Southern border we've lost all operational control the sovereignty of our nation at the southern border they're asking for more money for covid since March of 2020 we've spent eight trillion dollars just on kova that's 8 000 billion dollars you cannot convince me or any American across the country that are cut that our nation has actually spent that money we should have a full accounting of this money they want more money for Ukraine we've already sent them about 70 billion dollars do you know how much Russia spends my colleagues every year on their on their military their entire budget I'll answer the question it's about 70 billion dollars we've given to Ukraine the entire budget for Russia for their military expenditures we have no control over this money we're not sending them any more money not without a fight they want to see our past A continuing resolution a short-term budget to keep the federal government operating until December that's after the elections have ejected our colleagues across the aisle but before Republicans will be sworn into the majority on January the third that's wrong on every level it's like identifying an arsonist banishing them from your neighborhood and giving them gasoline and matches on the way out we cannot allow it We Stand strongly against it but we don't have the votes America report there's not enough Republicans in the House of Representatives to stop this CR in the formula that the Democrats intend we need Americans to communicate and stand strong align yourselves with the conservatives in the House of Representatives like my colleagues here tonight and help us fight the good fight to preserve our Republic and I yield back to the gentleman

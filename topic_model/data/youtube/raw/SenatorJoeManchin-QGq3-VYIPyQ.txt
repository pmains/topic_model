when West Virginia Veterans need assistance with the federal agencies like the VA it is my honor to advocate for them I recently had the honor of assisting Mrs Denise Tucker of Charleston with a VA claim for a pension and aid and attendance benefits for her father Mr Charles Mooney my office connected Mrs Tucker with a veteran service officer who helped her navigate the paperwork and I provided this information to the VA on the Family's behalf I am happy to report that Mr Mooney's claim for VA benefits was approved I contacted Senator manchin's office and spoke to Kimberly Berry and she got me going in the right direction it was such an overwhelming experience that she said the benefits have been approved yeah I got very emotional it means that my dad is still allowed to stay in his home with proper care and he has 24-hour care and without the benefits from the VA and the help from Center mansion's office it would never be it wouldn't have happened I wouldn't have been able to do this I would have had to put him in a nursing home Senator manchin thank you so much for making sure that my father is taken care of and his benefits were given to him in a timely manner so that he could be cared for in his home thank you Mrs Tucker for allowing me to assist your family and thank you Mr Mooney for your service if you or someone you know is in need of assistance with the state or federal agency please contact my office at [Music] 304-342-5855 my staff and I are always ready to help fellow West Virginians foreign

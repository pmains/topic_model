ah Thank You senator Rubio and thank you to the congressional executive commission on China and the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission for organizing this important hearing today I commend our panelists for their courage and thank them for being here today since 2011 China has spent more money on controlling its own population than on defending against foreign powers according to some sources China's annual spending on domestic stability maintenance as they call it its police state apparatus frankly now surpasses defense spending by nearly 17 sent mrs. Joe does stability maintenance effectively dampened descent or has it sparked resentment against the state that's true on both fronts it creates more enemies more people who suffered from such mayors of so-called stability maintenance but on the other hand it also surprised people's opinion and with the digital technology now it's really hard to associate even a small group that's a really big challenge for the people on the ground now we have intimate connections with all of them it's really very dark time for them especially with new technology you would say that this is foster dissent and resentment and disassociation on all fronts correct yeah but on the other hand it does reprise effectively you know there's it's very difficult to organize now thank you thank you since 1997 Hong Kong has fostered respect for the rule of law for human rights and personal freedoms as an autonomous special administrative region of China however China has aggressively sought to erode civil liberties in Hong Kong including by harassing the operators of a museum commemorating the 1989 massacre professor mins nur how can the United States support efforts to combat China's bullying tactics in Hong Kong that's no question and I think congressman Wagner you you highlighted Hong Kong is an excellent issue to focus on precisely because as the space arose a space that once existed in China erodes it's directly affecting hong kong as well and it's not just the individual building of you know it's the rest of the of the book self seizure the people in Hong Kong bringing them into mainland China it's the erosion of the norms with respect to electoral practices this purpose this proposed extradition law that's going through I certainly think congressional concern on this issue is something that at least triggers interest in Hong Kong precisely because Hong Kong's trade status question is what does that mean for Beijing is this something that's sufficiently that I'm not entirely sure but that's clearly you're seeing delegations of folks from Hong Kong who are coming to the United States right now focused on this and I would be expecting the extent that some of you are on the Foreign Affairs Commission that's probably one of the top issues that I want Beijing to know that we are watching what they are doing in Hong Kong very very closely I understand that China's concentration camps in Xinjiang province where an estimated as we've heard already 1 million Muslim leaders have been detained are evolving now into a forced labor system mister where Akashi how can the international community her the creation of a gulag in Xinjiang promise thank you this is what I think as I said earlier there were time to express concern they were trying to make condemnation their time to harsher punishment and then they're also time to know how to hurt the opponent so when you know when it was when when they hurt they reacted a little bit regulations or reasonably being 30 years in living in exile as a political dissident that's one important lesson we learn outside pressure works but what is the outside pressure I would work today the Chinese government have grown it's it's ability just like you just mentioned to suppress the dissent within China was there enormous expenditure and then also the confidence that comes from the international community when a trade delegation goes to Beijing and to negotiate the access of a market and investment and at the same time raise the question of human rights but not waiting for an answer for it that sends a very wrong message to the illegal to the Chinese regime and also unfortunate let me to Google people too so what I'm saying at this time the only we have long landed sorry we have long passed the the places that we we go be we should go like a condemnation we have long past that a direct pressure on the people who make those decisions I'm talking about Xi Jinping I'm talking about the governor of the party chief of the Qin Jia Hui Autonomous Region and apply the magnetic Human Rights accountability act seems at this point the only resort left for the United States you said we are watching you know what yes I think Chinese we need to be doing yes what you're saying I thank you yes China has begun implementing a vast Social Credit System a dystopian system of punishments and incentives intended to encourage quote good behavior miss Kay Luton how did gentlemen inform the creation ten of the social credit system and how is it being implemented I think in a broad sense what Tiananmen served to illustrate for the CCP was that information was something that could be very powerful if used against them but if managed properly it could be a powerful asset as well and so in the years following the Tiananmen Square massacre I think the party was even more careful to try to put in place well in advance mechanisms that would guide the direction of information technology when I was a reporter in Hong Kong I saw this unfolding in the 1990s with the so-called golden pride that's the this predated the Great Firewall as we knew it and then eventually evolved into it and now what we're seeing with the social credit system or systems because they're still overlapping and not quite formulated yet you do see a vision for social management that I think has been there from the beginning but now the tools are gradually falling into place with which to implement it I don't think that it's quite there yet I think that a lot of what has been discussed about this system may not be fully implemented in reality but simply understanding the intent is useful I think because there is really a large possibility of wide-scale harnessing of data to manage society in ways that we just haven't really conceived of yet we're starting to see the outlines of that now and I think were to really be implemented both within China and elsewhere around the world it would be a true truly chilling for democracy it is chilling my time has expired again I thank all the witnesses for their for their courage and your diligence I yield back

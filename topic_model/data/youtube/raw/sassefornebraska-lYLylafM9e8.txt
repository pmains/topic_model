hi my name is Ben Sasse you know every Sunday in church I look up at an altarpiece my great-great-grandpa carved about a hundred years ago lately though I worry more and more about the next hundred years about what Obamacare will do to America I'm running for the US Senate and some are calling me the anti-obamacare candidate and you know what I guess that's true for the first time Obamacare has put Uncle Sam in the abortion business that's a major setback for the sanctity of life there are no protections for people of faith in some states government forces Christians to choose between insurance that pays for abortions or becoming uninsured I'm running to dismantle Obamacare and to restore the religious freedoms our grandparents fought for I'm Ben Sasse candidate for US Senate and I approve this message paid for by Ben Sasse for US Senate mink

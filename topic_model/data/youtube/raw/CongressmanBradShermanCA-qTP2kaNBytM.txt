Brad Sherman California as to your bill I'd point out that most Isis fighters go into Turkey where perhaps their passports are stamped and then they sneak in to Isis controlled areas where Isis has a shoddy record of stamping passports and we may have to look at every European passport stamped in Turkey that would obviously be an issue what is now an issue is dash's ability to actually produce phony passport that that would be another issue mr. secretary I've got so many issues most of them I think he'll choose to respond for the record first on them on the budget this committee has urged and voted that you spend a million and a half dollars broadcasting in the Sindhi language to reach a huge part of Pakistan southern Pakistan in the Sindhi language we talked about this last time you were here now your budget requests an additional thirty five million dollars for our broadcasting efforts my hope is that you'll be able to respond for the record that if we get you a substantial increase maybe not the full thirty-five million but that the first additional dollars will be to broadcast in the language of southern Pakistan I think it's worth it only takes a million and a half the rest is for whatever else you choose to spend the money on and I want to compliment your general counsel and in Karachi for looking into the assassination of Anwar Liguria who was a Sindhi a protector of this of Sindhi culture as to our work against Isis during World War two we had bombing rules of engagement that led to the deaths of 70,000 French civilians because we were serious general de gaulle never urged us not to bomb an electric facility because it would inconvenience french civilians he never asked Dwight Eisenhower not to hit a tanker truck because the civilian might be driving it yet I'm told that in bombing I we will not hit a moving truck and we will not hit electric power lines because not only do we not want to kill any civilians even those working for Isis but we don't want to inconvenience those living under Isis and it is a major inconvenience not to have electricity I hope you would comment for the record about our rules of engagement against Isis I now want to focus on Iran North Korea provided the nuclear technology that was used at Al Khobar which the Israelis destroyed in Syria a few years ago now North Korea has a dozen nuclear weapons that's about what they need perhaps the next one goes on eBay not quite that flippantly but you get the point I spoke to the Chinese Foreign Minister yesterday and I will urge you to urge him as I did that China prevent any nonstop flight over its territory from North Korea to Tara ran such a nonstop flight could easily export one or several nuclear weapons if on the other hand that flight stops for fuel as of course it should if China requires they will but I'm sure the Chinese will take a look at what's on the plane it's natural that you're here defending the nuclear deal it was I did vote for it but there are very good aspects of that deal but I'm concerned that the administration now is just in a role of defending Iran as if anything any comment about Iran is an attack on the deal I would during rouhani's tenure we've seen a lot more executions in Iran and I hope that you would personally issue a statement condemning Iran's violation of Human Rights particularly when they kill people for the so-called crime of waging war on God you meant as to the missile sanctions you indicate we sanctioned a few companies we sanctioned a few individuals those companies don't do business in the United States those individuals do not want to visit Disneyland and I hope that you would sanction the Iranian government for it's violation with sanctions that actually affect the Iranian economy otherwise to say certain individuals who have no intention of coming United States will not be allowed in the United States indicates an acceptance of Iranian violations and under the UN Security Council resolution 2231 Russia can't sell fighter planes to Iran unless the Security Council specifically approves that I'll ask you to will we use our veto to prevent fighter planes from being sold to Iran from Russia why don't the gift is a video I think it's a matter of the committee there's a committee and it's in approval in the committee but we would not approve it and would we if would would we use our veto if necessary to prevent the best of my knowledge congressman I I don't I haven't looked at the specifics of the of the transaction etc in principle we are very concerned about the transfer of weapons and so you know we would approach it with great skepticism but I haven't seen the specific transfer or what the request is we have a committee that will analyze this thoroughly before anything happens and the committee signs off on it I assure you we'll stay in touch with you thank you chair recognizes that mr.

HR 1160 - water recycling investment Improvement Act is the Bureau of Reclamation's title 16 water recycling program the most successful and also a primary water recycling program which has proven to be the most effective Bureau of Reclamation program in improving water supply by providing long-term savings while boosting job growth in lowering our reliance on imported potable water especially in Southern California towel 16 provides cost shared funding for water segment projects that reclaim water and reuse municipal industrial domestic or agricultural water and naturally impair groundwater or surface was across the 17 western states my legislation would increase 2016 authorization from 50 million to 500 million giving because there's a backlog of approved projects legislatively approve projects 977 million dollars already approved and cannot be funded it's giving local water agencies the necessary funding to increase capacities for existing recycling plants or create new cost-effective projects to boost water supplies in 2018 Gao published a study on the program which details overwhelming demand for title 16 and highlighted the importance of water recycling to address water supply concerns Gao found that in total reclamation has awarded 715 million through 2017 which is leveraged more than 2.8 billion in non-federal cost share mr. chair my ask for unanimous consent to enter the record ta juice Gao study from December 2018 thank you not only do these projects create jobs and boost our local economies farms and businesses but title 16 projects can be brought online with wet water not paper water wet water in as little as two years in contrast to the dams which take 10 to 15 years to build and cost over 2 billion now these projects provide long-term savings which is why water district and sanitation agencies are overwhelmingly supportive of the program since 1992 Congress the right 53 title 16 recycling projects producing more than 400,000 acre feet of drought resistant water supply unfortunately due to the lack of funding there is the back love of nearly a billion as I stated of congressionally approved eligible title 16 projects demonstrating a clear need to continue and expand funding that is why it's unacceptable not to not approve the bill and who I introduced my bill to increase the authorization in order to address this huge backlog Congress must address the backlog and work to provide more drought protection for the 17 western states my bill will accomplish this task it's a no brainer we have to explore new ways to expand our water portfolio and water recycling is one of the best ways to do so I urge my college to take this issue seriously support increase and robust funding for 12 15 16 program by supporting HR 1160 too mr.

speaker for the last month I have traveled up and down the 25th district of texas talking to my constituents about their biggest concerns they're fed up with Washington's out-of-touch economic policies that are hurting their families and their businesses business owners and individuals need certainty when it comes to their money and their taxes that's why we need to quickly pass a tax extenders bill so business owners can stop playing defense and focus on what they do best creating jobs since Texas doesn't have a state income tax Texas need to know if they can continue deducting their sales tax and their federal income taxes business owners need to know if they can continue taking risk and innovating with R&D credit and companies need to know that they are not the target of tax bias by extending the bonus depreciation credit permanently ensuring these incentives is just the first step for true comprehensive tax reform but these are good sound policies that my constituents want and that our economy needs let's give America the certainty they deserve and pass the tax extenders and remember the 911 victims in god we trust' I yield back

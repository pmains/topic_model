now back to biocentury this week we're on Capitol Hill talking about pediatric cancer with representatives Chris Van Hollen and Michael McCaul with patient advocate nancy goodman nancy creating hope act it was your it was your baby what was it what was the problem you're trying to solve and very quickly how did it do it thank you the problem is that there is almost no drug development specifically for kids with cancers kids cancers are different from adult cancers so what we did is we created a voucher system if the drug company develops a drug specifically for kids with cancer the fda gives them a voucher the company can use it or sell it and the voucher comes with rights to a faster FDA review on any other drug perhaps a very large market drug so so representative McCall Van Van Hollen you get people coming to you every day with ideas like this and most of them don't go anywhere how did that happen well as Nancy's she's the author were just the vehicles for this idea it turned out to be one of the most exciting challenges I've had in my tender in Congress to try to get this passed we had some opposition initially but we got the children telling cancer advocates on the hill and then passed it with broad-based support at the other day I do think the pilot program and it was passed as a pilot has proved to be successful as Nancy mentioned the first voucher has been sold now for 67 million dollars so industry recognizes it as does the FDA that this actually works so what we liked it is in the next Congress make this a permanent program and and I guess then the the real question then is is this the exception that proves the rule that it's impossible for both parties to work together and actually get something done in Congress or can there be a following you know can are we going to have more bipartisan collaboration on pediatric cancer well I think we Mike and I look forward to continuing to work with each other and Nancy in the advocates to do whatever we can I mean if Congress can't come to agreement on what we can do for kids with cancer then it's a really sad day but as this as this legislation proves we were able to to do that and to the extent that we identify other creative solutions that require legislation or require us to urge the FDA or the NIH to take action we're on the same page that's that's what the caucus is all about so to answer you you've got them to pass the creating hope back what's next on your agenda we already talked about modifying the prea the what else is on your agenda I think generally the issue steve is still access to drugs whether it be drugs developed specifically for kids or drugs developed for adults that can potentially benefit kids and we're looking at both regulatory reform legislative action and administrative actions I know that neither one of you are on the Energy and Commerce Committee but they're working on this path to 21st century cures we've had fred Upton and Diane to get on this show talking about that d do you expect that you had cancer caucus will work with them to try to get legislation move forward absolutely and the legislation that we all worked on together the creating hope act was actually something we ended up attaching to another piece of legislation that had to do with the food and drug administration so what they're doing the Energy and Commerce does provide us an opportunity to have a vehicle to do some of the things we liked it hopefully is congressman McCaul noted earlier updating priya could be a terrific bipartisan effort again I think also expand expanded access and the compassionate use would be an area that would benefit children probably more than any other segments of population but it would benefit all cancer patients across the country I think that that's something I'd really like to see me for next to Congress represent van hollen represented Nicole you you finished last week that summit meeting for the congressional childhood cancer caucus well you know who talked there what in kind of what are the highlights one of the things that that are on the caucuses life well there are there are lots of issues it was a very exciting summit dr. Francis Collins from the NIH spoke I'm proud to represent the congressional districts that is home to NIH but what I want to say to anybody watching this please check to see if your member of Congress is part of our childhood cancer caucus because the more members that are participating the more voices that rally behind these causes the stronger that we can we can be as a bipartisan group it was very successful we had that dr. the pin yo president of D Anderson my wife serves on the board the visitors are we had the chief medical officer from Johnson & Johnson but to see the the parents the survivors quite frankly the courage to come forward and advocate when they've gone through a tragic event and turned that into a positive that's what's so inspiring to me to see these kids who have survived but also talked to the parents whose children did not survive I think that's the hardest thing to accept but you see the again the courage of these families and advocates coming forward to make a difference that is actually an amazing thing of course Nancy's an example of someone who's overcome the tragedy and keeps on going right well one of the most exciting things about the the terrific summit Steve was that d the community of people who've lost kids are whose kids have suffered from pediatric cancer are really coming together there's now the coalition against childhood cancer there's the alliance against childhood cancer and these umbrella groups are doing great things to make our community much more effective so I'm wondering you know G some some of these issues there has to be some kind of an adversarial relationship for example between the advocates perhaps and regulators on some issues or between advocates and and drug companies how much how much kind of conflict is there and how much collaboration is there so I can tell you first with the FDA you know we are very thankful for everything the FDA has done and we view them as real leaders out in front in promoting drug development strategies that will help kids and we're very grateful for them with respect to drug companies we understand that their fiduciary duty is to the shareholders and we want to work with them to find ways that they can be successful and our kids can get treatments oh great well thanks very much

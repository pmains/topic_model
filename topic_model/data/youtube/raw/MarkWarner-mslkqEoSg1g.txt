my name is mulatto morn I'm a sophomore here in dr. my major is broadcast journalist I think right now a lot of people are unsure about the economy they're unsure of whether to invest their insurer about my job market out of a graduate my name is darnell Chapman I guess a little science major jump right now I feel good you are gonna rise and after once I graduate from school 2014 there won't be many opportunities available to know you and it has in common with Democrats needs to get out more to the onions I want to hear from y'all it doesn't have to just be on on what I talked about but I want to hear what's on your mind what you're looking for out of washing what your nick is concerned as far as a job job so today I'm not too not too sure on that right now and that's why I want to take action now in preparation preparing now so that whenever I do graduate I will sort of know what is going on and what I need to do know what I think you need to be successful I think it's well right now we're kind of fighting it's our own economic challenges and we got to kind of rise to the moment showing that we can kind of put outside your Democrat Republican hats and get something done on a couple of these issues I think would help be the single biggest thing we can do to restore confidence restoring confidence would actually jump start a lot of job creation I think the senator really gave us a little bit of assurance in finding jobs when he talked about the private sector as well as the government having a part in creating job I now understand that we need to take that step we need to have faith and we need to take a chance in Aragon wait for you I

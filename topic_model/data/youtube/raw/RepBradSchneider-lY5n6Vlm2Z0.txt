The opioid addiction crisis was the topic
of conversation today at a special roundtable discussion hosted by Congressmen Mike Quigley
and Brad Schneider. They were joined by doctors, patients, and
community leaders in a discussion about opioids and how new legislation would affect it. "Physicians are not evil people. We all have to take responsibility for what's
happening in our culture today, and a part of it has to do with our expectation of what
is pain, part of it has to do with our ability to realize the stigma that still is assigned
to substance misuse disorders." Quigley and Schneider's federal bill would
require doctors that prescribe opioids to take continuing education courses every three
years to learn more about abuse and prevent over-prescribing.

hi good afternoon how are you this is don Clavin tenant supervisor as i'm joined as always on our Facebook live communications right now by Councilman Anthony D Esposito and the head of our town emergency services dr. Davis he's kindly known and again I want to thank all of you who were taking the time to watch and I hope all of you are are safe in your homes and again you know following the protocols of everything we're doing a couple of quick updates for residents first off last week the governor had closed all marinas and golf courses and happily over the weekend he did announce that we will be reopening of marinas with safeguards earlier today we announced the protocol we'll be doing here in the town of hempstead for marinas with safe spacing signage and restrictions so we're asking everybody to join the the town website to get information on that and later this week we will be announcing the reopening of our golf courses with safeguards put into effect for your safety in addition we did get last time a lot of residents who were talking about extension of tax payments I'm happy to announce to you that earlier today that the Nassau County Legislature by emergency declaration have extended the time period for paying taxes they're sending it to the county executive and we're hopeful that the county executive will sign off on that also I have heard word that the governor may also be exciting an executive order extending the tax payments as soon as we get further details on that we will have it up in our town social media accounts both Facebook and Twitter also if there is an extension we will be putting forth a plan for collection of taxes and Janine Driscoll the town receiver and I are working closely with our colleagues all the town board members to put a plan into effect to make it convenient easy and most importantly safe both you as well as the staff and lastly Saturday the governor announced that marriage licenses will be available online I've been in communication on Saturday right at the announcement with Keith Murray our town clerk she's already moving forward with initiative to try and get those available online for residents to utilize and again every day seems to be a little bit changing and as it does we're trying to implement those savings those those changes and those safeguards for both you the homeowner the taxpayers as well as our almost 1,900 employees I'm and with that I do want to take the time to thank our employee workforce again from every department it's just amazing from you know sanitation to you know at the the crude at the cemetery to our Highway Department to the water department and everybody and in between it like you can see there and go through every single name we're grateful we're grateful for every single one of you we're grateful for you helping the residents at this time and we're appreciative and you should always know that every one of the board members is just thankful we work with you and we want you to be safe we want you to be happy and a lot of you have been putting a lot of yourself forward to make sure a lot of vital services are taking place with that let me start with some comments at councilman any comment supervisor just wanted to say thank you again for your leadership during this pandemic and I also want to thank dr. Dave I know some of our residents have been critical of some of our Facebook live town halls and the information saying that you know there is some redundancy but obviously we're and we're answering the questions that's on everyone's mind and I think that's what's most important here dr. Dave has been a valued member of the town of hempstead for 22 years it's not something that just started he's been around for 22 years and I know I speak on behalf of all the board members just like supervisor Clavin said we are thankful and lucky to have him especially while we're facing the coronavirus so dr. Dave I just wanted to say thank you the initiatives that we've brought here to the town of hempstead not only specific to the corona virus pandemic but the things that we've done here in America's largest Township to secure the safety of residents whether there is a corona virus or not have been great we've foster great relationships with the fire service we foster great relationships with the police department ambulances and we believe that the work we're doing saved lives so not only for the last 22 years but mostly for the recent work that you've done I want to say thank you and I want to thank all the residents who have logged on to these Facebook town halls and the questions that they've asked again they may be repetitive because maybe you missed one or or two here and there but nonetheless we're here to answer the questions we're here to provide resources that you need and quite frankly I think it's great that we're able to bring to all residents our neighbors a talented medical doctor that they could ask questions to from the comfort of their couch so thank you both for your leadership and I look forward to working with you in the future thank you like I said I think anybody that's been watching and anybody that that's reached out to you and your entire staff have done an amazing job and we were all grateful for that and it's I've actually had a number of residents who have watched it and and said boy I've learned a lot there were a lot of great initiatives so we're all grateful and in addition many of you may not realize through the doctors and his staff efforts he's been able to make sure that several staff members were quarantined at appropriate time which halted the spread of this deadly disease any more of our town facilities so you you've not only been informative but but frankly you've really saved lives and it's something that I think we're preached up here in the town and I know for a fact there are other towns now looking to follow the model of having an EMS here for our our 750,000 residents that live here in the town of hempstead and the town of hempstead is ground zero for this epidemic on Long Island if not you know you know in the United States where we're grateful so with that maybe you'd like to give some updates give a little little conversation and I I will tell you I thought invaluable one of the issues in it I received so many positive responses was from the fact that your demonstration of how to appropriately put on a face mask went a long way cuz a lot of people don't realize they put their hands in there so thank you sir sure you got it guys hi everybody so here we are again but like the councilman and the supervisor said you know we're here for you I have my bass bass today I look like a ninja with it on we'll put that on now because won't be able to see me talk to you but it is important guys that you have your hand sanitizer and that you have your face mask and that you're doing what's right for the community so you know if you know if you guys get a chance to watch the previous video I did have a very you know detailed explanation of the best way to put masks on and off most important thing as always is making sure that you wash your hands you got to make sure that your hands are clean you got to make sure you're not touching your face you know the the masks again are to as our social due diligence to help other people you know we want to make sure that we're doing everything to save other people as much as we're doing everything to take care of ourselves and I think that's the thing that has been the maybe the best silver lining in this whole pandemic is that everyone coming together to help each other and and you know by wearing your mask by doing your social distancing by keeping your hands clean you're taking care of yourself but you're also taking care of others and you know just like the council was talking about you know I I have to tell you that um and a supervisor you know some of the most rewarding opportunities I've had and in the past couple years has been the public health initiatives that we've done on behalf of the township I am an emergency doctor by trade I am trained also as a an emergency medical services position meaning that I provide medical direction to EMS squads to fire departments to ambulances I ride out in the field as a physician of Omnicon calls but when you are in the hospital you're obviously playing a very important role I work at NYU went through up they've been great through this whole thing they've been very supportive of what we're doing here there have been very supportive of our staff and our and our our doctors and nurses and and pas and NPS and all that all the folks at the hospital but when you're there you only can take care of the the single patients in front of you but what here what we've been doing is we've been talking about is we've been taking care of the community and that is it that is an important thing that the government should be doing if something as they as these next gentlemen we're talking about we've been doing this for a long time and only now does it bring a light on what we're doing but this has been something that's been ongoing for many years I and again I work for the town from as an EMT I started in 1998 and I'm still here helping you guys out and obviously our role is a little bit bigger now but that's important it's it's to take care of our communities it's a take care of our friends and neighbors it's to take care of our workforce so to make sure that our government runs to make sure that our workforce is safe to make sure that our buildings are you know are set up in a way that we that people can feel safe to come to work because they're not going to get sick when they come here you know we're doing everything that we can you know the virus doesn't care the virus is is it spreads and does its thing and it's up to us to do the team work to fight back and we've been doing that and it's extremely rewarding I have a huge team as they mentioned the EMTs and are working down the beach I I cannot be more proud of them and you should know the job that they're doing to make sure that everybody's safe and and everyone that we work with all of our partners as the council mentioned we cannot be more thankful for the county partners for our state partners for our local partners fire police EMS everyone that we're working with is it a team effort and we're all here to make sure that you're safe and that's what's the importance that mean if we ask a question more than once you know people want to make sure their questions get answered it and you know we're we'll sit here until all the questions are answered and I even go on afterwards sometimes and answer people's questions so you know we're here for you and with that we'll just get to a question then a little questions there are yeah well I'll give you before again Duell points why don't you give the residents an update of some of the numbers you're seeing at hospitalization and and what's taking place there so they get a little more informed on locally sure of course so um so the good news right now is it looks like that that curb has definitely flattened I know that when we had previously talked that curve was on it was on a crazy upward trajectory we had lots and lots of people getting sick we had people unfortunately that we're dying it was you know very sad and very scary you know I the important thing to understand right now is that we made that all of the efforts that we've done they're working that curb now has flattened out it was a very horrible Lehigh Plateau but it has plateaued and now it looks like it's starting to come down and that is good news but kind of like when you when you're sick and you get an antibiotic from the doctor and you have a ten day supply of antibiotics and around day three or or you start to feel much better it still means you have to finish the antibiotic or you're gonna get sick again and that's the thing that people have to understand that yes this is working yes it's getting better yes we had a horrible toll that we now we don't want to return to but if we don't do this the right way now and we don't continue to be disciplined and help each other and follow the the rules that curve could go back up the 1918 Spanish flu there were actually three peaks before it finally went away and that was the last pandemic that we that we that we faced more than a hundred years ago the second peak was actually worse than the first because people had saw that the techniques were working the social distancing the closing of businesses they felt that they were okay to go out and then they was would world war two started to wrap down wrap up and end they had they had parades and parties and then that's when the second wave started and none of us want that so it's the good news of this is that we're all working together the good news of this is that this is all working but we have to stay the course right now we have to not reverse it we have to keep taking the antibiotic in this case taking the steps that are that are distancing us and washing our hands and wearing masks and things that are not normal for us but if we continue that we hope the men to watch that continue to go down the hospitalizations are going down the people on ventilators are going down where people are going home I mean there's still a lot of sick people but what we're getting there so I mean there is some good news we don't want to always you know be focusing on the bad there is good news out there so so just continue to let the doctors do what we do continue doing what you guys are doing and then you know we'll get through this together that's the plan okay I saw a question right there about recycling I thank you for the question I do want to let you know that again recycling was suspended only for the ability to have an extra 15 trucks available for general purpose pickups I spoke earlier today with the Commissioner of Sanitation we're already looking to announce an initiative for placing vehicles at different locations during different hours that residents can pull up have the recycles taken from the vehicle and put inside the recycling trucks and we're already looking about when we'll be able to restart the recycling program again it was done out of the production for the 400 men who were down there going to work every day at 5:30 and hitting the streets and we have put a number of protocols in place as the separation there are usually three people in a truck we don't have that any longer we have to the third person goes separately to the locations picked up and is driven so we want to bring it back we will do so and we're going to put forth some initiatives to to help you get him out of house and I know it's an inconvenience and I appreciate all of you but this was done for the safeguarding of employees as well as the general population to ensure that there was general and regular pickup of garbage and so keep them keep up to date and we'll let you know and make the changes just don't work the techniques that we all talked about with the recommendations of me from watching things to make sure that our workforce was safe so what the supervisor is talking about that's the things that we're doing behind the scenes that you may not necessarily see but we're doing to protect our workforce and to protect our citizens so that's next you know we have to change the way we're doing business this is a whole new world but we're doing it in a way that's making it safe make a little slower might make it a little different but we got to be safe and still continue everything yes and you see a number of questions coming up you know saying like Oh what are you gonna reopen parks and what are you gonna do somebody had an idea about you know are you gonna ban block parties and social and social gatherings I think the real answer is through the doctor and the directives that have been put forth by the state you know we implement policies look in the last week you had the marina's closed midweek last week and golf courses and this past weekend they said okay we're gonna reopen them but you have to put some safeguards if the state says we can't do certain things then we'll have to file the state's lead if the governor makes it that you can't do something we won't if they say you can but you have to have safeguards in effect through the the advice of the doctor it was their medical professional will implement those you know we want to provide the services that we're allowed to want to do it in it in a manner that's that's safe for both everybody watching as well as the workforce accounts Minetti so I know there's a quick question from the president of our great CSEA local 880 Union about PPE that I can answer she's asking if an employee asks for PPE is it proper to tell them requested from dgs so we've been working with the Department of General Services as well as our emergency management team to make sure that we allocate all of our resources properly so if any worker asks for PPE he could he or she could ask directly to his department head or her department head and they will contact either the commissioner or Deputy Commissioner of general services who will then allocate the PPE and then just another question regarding marinas from mr. baumann he said he was reading the post regarding marinas opening will facilities we have our boats stored be allowed to open for business to get them in the water so as far as I think we understand is that the governor said that marinas are now able to open so I can't speak on any specific marina whether they have the staff to put boats in the water but as of now as long as they're following proper protocol and following the advice of the state in the town they should be able to open as long as they have the resources and the employees in your zone and and just to the councilman for all of our workers we also obviously are talking to to the folks from general services and to into the leadership team to make sure that we train people to use the personal protective gear just recently we got a we learned that and there were animal control officers that may have be entering people's houses in limited situations where they have to they have to deal with an animal that might be dangerous and we had a significant concern from the EMS team that they might not have the right equipment their boss actually already had equipment for them but we made sure just as a double-check that we delivered them personal protective gear kicks and actually sent one of our senior EMTs down there to train them in that so in that is something that we're doing again to keep the workforce safe it's very important that not only is that equipment available but that we have our EMS team out there teaching people how to use it it's not some of this stuff is not intuitive we don't want just the equipment there we also want to make sure we're teaching them I have been a long time in in Kate Murray's office at the beginning of this going through I'll have you know how to put on gloves and how the best way to to take the gloves off and make sure you're watching him saying Jenny Driscoll's office so it's important that our workforce is not only safe but trained and used to stuff properly and that that stuff is available so I mean it's it's a coordinated effort among all of us to make sure that they're safe and and you know today concerns you all know how to reach out to the EMS team we there's that we have a phone number an emergency medical operation flying for our town workers that they can call anytime and they'll talk to either one of our EMS personnel or me personally as the town's doctor to get their questions answer to make sure they're safe so that's just another thing that we have been running since the beginning to make sure that our workforce is safe it's extremely important just to kind of enhance on the hotline and the emergency medical operations center that we've set up for our employees that's something that's sort of unique to a Township right arrey yes yeah no I mean I mean just having the super eyes I mentioned and stuff just having a physician working for the town I have I mean I've worked here since I started as an EMT and come back and then we've developed this position and then and then over the past couple of years it became a robust role where I take the lead as the physician making sure that we do the best things we can for everybody that emergency medical operation center that is a unique resource you know it's at first that you need to have a time to have a doctor that can offer this you know this level of recommendations and advice and then that emergency medical Operations Center we set up specifically for our workforce to keep them safe and and that is also something that probably we're leading the the pack on that and maybe someday we'll be we'll be teaching others the best way to do this when we get on the other side but but but it's definitely something that's never been done before but it's been working great something that we initiate from the beginning because we recognize the importance and and something that that winds grown every day and it's showing in spades how well it's working I mean yeah I mean I mean we I I have talked to hundreds and hundreds of our workers and I think probably almost all of them it seems but I mean I I feel is probably a couple hundred calls a day through that line and that's you know that's important yeah the we a couple of questions that kind of time people are saying you know when what are you to reopen parks you know we want to open parks for the ability of people to get out and unfortunately you know you've so many people that are in there there are consequences you have taken for example the leafy preserve which is a wonderful facility when it was opened and the first week of the governor's locked down order levy Park was so jam-packed that the cars were backing up all the way to America we need to temporarily close that facility again and the advice of doctor for the safety of people because you had hundreds and hundreds of people mingling coming to a location we want a reopen facilities another recent problem we had was Lido Beach West it's a great town facility unfortunately we had a number of individuals who were showing up down there and you know not following the etiquette proper or social distancing and hang out and unfortunately we need to take steps and that ties into what I think is a really great question is the enforcement if it is a town facility and our public safety officers or Bay constables can resolve you know the spreading of the crowd or the closing of the facility or making sure people are following protocol they will do that but in other instances that you hear people you know we get there's a you know the mr. Softee truck coming down or um you know these kids are doing something at another facility a lot of that falls on the Nassau County Fire Marshal and I tell residents you have to call there but if it is in one of our town facilities and and we see it one of our either our public safety or Bay councils address it but you know when it comes to reopening we have to see what forth the requirements are from the governor and as we said earlier those change day to day but also there's the conversations we have with the doctor about how we reopen a facility and we put in safeguards for you as well as for the the men and women who work here that's why I said you know a lot of people I know are late comers are still talking about the taxes as for any of you who came out a little bit late the Nassau County legislators by emergency you know had emergency meeting and extended the deadline today we believe until June 11th and it might go to the county executive for to sign off if that takes place that's a wonderful relief for tax payers here but now we have to make sure we put in safeguards of how those payments are going to be processed that is safe for both for both you the taxpayer as well as for the the town workforce and Janine Driscoll and I are already in conversations about that so as I said we want to get back to a new normal but the questions be in some cases is it going to be a new normal and that's an evolving subject we have the conversations with the doctor about the protocols we need to put in place to make sure it from its the employees having a sanitizer or a mask - you know how we deal with our public restrooms so and and I'm very grateful for the residents because for the most part people have been nothing but understanding but if you do see something that you're saying you're noticing in a town facility that we can address we will send our public safety to that area or the big console but it's something that's out of our realm we will direct that to the fire marshal can you see any questions yeah so there's a question from a Eileen Costello ask me about any updates or announcements for Town of Hempstead lifeguards and obviously so many of the our summer employees look forward to lifeguarding our beaches our pools so as of right now we're you know like the supervisor said we're following the protocol the state day by day and really monitoring everything but if you have any specific questions you could send an email to aquatics at toh mail org or give them a give Aquatics a call at 2:00 nine to nine thousand they are still processing applications because if and when the town beaches and pools open we want to be ready for everyone to enjoy their summer so aquatics at toh mail org or two nine to nine thousand and you can reach our aquatics department so just adjust to that guys you know I'm well first off I could tell you that our EMS team and our lifeguard team we are we work together very closely you know I'm pretty much in daily communication with with the head of a product Justine Anderson and with the carps Commissioner Frank Sangha and I can tell you that our EMTs originated as part of the Beach Patrol that's where I started in 1998 on a quad on the beach and our EMTs and our lifeguards obviously understand how important the beaches are and and you know I can tell you personally that my connection to the beach I live in Lido Beach now because of all the years that I work down there so I now have a condo on the beach because of how much I love the beaches so any recommendations that we make are going to be what's the safest for everybody but we do understand at a personal level how important the beaches are and how much people want to be there but what we it would be the worst thing ever to open up the beaches have there be another peak and have so many more people get sick or get get hospitalized or or have people died like that would be that would not be worth our social you know our social needs for you know socializing and relaxing in the summer so we're going to do what's right we're going to do what's what's responsible and hopefully we get to a part where we can let people enjoy our beaches again if it's you know whatever it is it is if it has to be delayed because that's the right thing to do that it'll be delayed but the beaches will still be there but but but do understand the that we all know how important that is at a personal level to just from my background and why I started working here so I mean it's just you know you guys are there saying that's it's it's we're all part we all live here we're all town and set residence we all this is this is us if where it affects us just like it affects you and that's I think maybe that gets lost sometimes so I just wanted to highlight that step you know that's the importance of this dock with the emergence in the new requirements from the governor about Facemash that in public or whatnot we do we hear in a regular basis that people are wearing gloves and then they discard them they throw them in lots which you know in and of itself is very troubled times dusting it's disgusting and you know then it turns up to the cleaning factor if it's if it's town facility you know you have to make sure the the town equipment could do it over it's a practice Ellie they have to do it maybe you could just talk to people about you know a little bit more of the sanitary aspects of what they need to do and by just discarding them in a parking lot and and having a sea of blue which is a revolting in terms of you know the what the downside is of them not thinking this out sure it makes sense and supervisor to to that point so guys everything we're doing you want to have sanitation be you know the in the for front everything should be as clean as possible that's why it's so important that we keep our sanitation workers healthy so they can they can take the garbage out and make sure everything's clean if you aren't taking steps to protect yourself and then just discarding that personal protection gear in public then that is making it less sanitary for everybody else so that's actually the exact opposite of why we're doing these things remember the masks we're doing the masks more to help out others and then you know the gloves and some of the other you know steps the hand-washing and not just in the face more to help ourselves so you know if you take those items and you just discard them in a parking lot that's actually more dangerous for everybody including yourself because that increases the the that increases the bacteria and viruses in general not just coronavirus but but all of those things so you're increasing the chance that anybody can get sick by doing that so the best I would say the best advice I could give on what I've been doing in my own personal vehicle because you can imagine with a lot of the places we have to be some some days I feel like I'm living out of my truck i I have a brown paper bags and then if I need to use personal protective gear if I'm using masks if I'm using gloves I'm then discarding those in in that bag and then they are clean in an area where it's not going to contaminate anywhere else and then I just dispose of that bag properly at the end of the day so you know if you don't have something like that you still want to make sure that whatever you're using ends up in the proper trash receptacle so our people can pick it up it just takes up art are really hard-working sanitation and general services folks away from other tasks if they have to be cleaning parking lots and and and you know and fields and and any other sidewalks and that kind of stuff so you want to be socially responsible all around including properly disposing of those things in a garbage you know in a proper garbage uh receptacle or you know keep it with yourself and then dispose it when you get to your own house so and also when you take those off remember if you have gloves you want to take the gloves from the bottom and you want to peel the glove that way because then the dirty stuff that's on the outside of the glove that ends up on the inside and then you're not recontaminate in your self and then you can take those gloves throw them out into the right place so that no one else is getting contaminated by it so again just do this also responsibility of taking care of others and that just Falls you know along that same line and if I could follow up with with another question just explicitly for you duck every day people are reading about you know oh it's in symptoms of flu the symptoms for coronavirus you know over the weekend it was you had blue toes Saturday it was you had had a rash maybe you could just go through everybody again because you even know we've been going it changes it involves what are the basic symptoms for you know coronavirus and where should you know it let it be the temperature you take that should be a little more concerned and follow-through I don't want you resolve that for a couple of people um so you know it's it's a good review there are actually what originally made this somewhat difficult when we first started fighting this virus is it seemed that it could it could present in many different ways but I there is a kind of a overriding theme that we've been seeing now the more and more patients that we've seen and the more that we've talked about this and the more workers that I've talked to that that have called with concerns the first and foremost there are other viruses out there just like the supervisor said so coronavirus is a majority what we're dealing with thankfully the flu season is starting to taper down now but when coronavirus originally hit it was very high flu season as well and then obviously there's other respiratory viruses rhinoviruses you know respiratory syncytial virus there's a million other viruses that we deal with but those have kind of taken a little bit of more of a back burner and then obviously there's other bacterial infections that can cause respiratory problems and cough so you know we're not asking you to be doctors I'm also asking you not to dr. Google stuff Google is a great search engine but not a very good doctor and the problem is is if you start looking up things you're going to start diagnosing yourself and getting yourself worried and it's not going to give you the right answer so the first thing I can tell you is that if you think you're sick stay home it doesn't matter what illness do you have you do not want to be spreading the the illness to other people we should just have that as a general rule moving forward from now on if you're sick you should not take it as a badge of honor that you went to work sick we should go home when we're sick because we don't want to spread any virus or any affection to anybody else regardless of what the virus or infection it is so stay home if you're sick the symptoms that are pretty much universal that it seems to coronavirus now again coronavirus to present in many different ways the symptoms that I would say that are most likely to clue you in fever is usually the first one really bad body aches is another one there's an inflammatory response that the virus induces and that causes body aches then loss of sense of smell and taste people actually completely lose their taste and smell somebody actually sent me one of our public safety officers that be a very funny picture of him smelling and licking a by a bar of Irish Spring soap because he could not taste or smell it and said that should be the new coronavirus test you know I know we're not encouraging that but that was very entertaining so but just the point is that the loss of sense of taste and smell is um is very important because this virus seems to be unique to this virus um and then you know there are lots of other symptoms that um a dry cough sometimes diarrhea sometimes a rash so that's less you know obviously if someone's having chest pain or shortness of breath they want to seek medical attention and that's also the question people have asked like well what do I do if I think I'm sick clearly if there's a life-threatening medical emergency you need to call 9-1-1 you need to have an ambulance take you to the hospital I know people are scared to be in hospitals but I can tell you from my experience at my hospital and why you Winthrop I know that all the hospitals have now set up areas where there's kind of segregation of the folks that are sick with coronavirus and the folks that have other medical problems so you should not be afraid to go to the hospital if you're sick the hospitals are meant to be taking care of sick people even in the case of coronavirus but i can tell you that urgent cares have been a wonderful resource during this and it really shown how important they are to the our health system and you know telemedicine is also very important so so my recommendation if you're sick you have a fever stay home bad body aches stay home you can't taste or smell anything stay home but all those other symptoms do not be spreading respiratory viruses to other people if you're having life-threatening symptoms call 9-1-1 and go to the hospital otherwise call your own doctor and your own doctor will likely do a telemedicine consult with you that's been very big and hopefully moving forward that'll be a really good resource in our in our health system or go to an urgent care they've been wonderful in helping us out with this and really good partners so Venus I can tell you that the the city md's have been great that go helps have been great Pro health you know the AFG there's a couple of them out there those are the ones that I know that our workers have gone to and have been very helpful taking care of our workers that have needed so just you know just know that those resources are out there and that's good and and that's that's kind of an important rundown for right now for that so kind of a two-fold once a question one's a comment first the comment I guess was questioning asking and wondering if we are in touch with our seniors and I know that you've been in touch with Commissioner Murphy from our seniors program yeah this supervisor has made sure that we continued the you know providing them meals and you've been in touch with the housing authority to make sure that there is any issues that you know to to assistant yeah so the head of each of the senior centers has been checking on the seniors in their Senior Center and then if there's any concerns they've been running that up the chain and then we have an EMT that Heffernan who's retired from the County Emergency M Damon's Bureau and she's been following up on those for us and it's actually her she's she's part of our Public Health Division and it's been her job to make sure that we're keeping an eye on all the the senior related issues if there's any concern that there might be a senior that's having a problem we can send one of our EMTs to check them out or we can get a connection to a family or connection to resources so that that has been from the beginning actually why we originally did not close our senior centers remember we were going to last a close the senior centers it was we took every step to make sure those senior centers were safe and it was so important to us to give them the opportunity to get those meals and to have people checking on them and to get those resources and they access all those resources to those senior centers so when we finally had to close them that was a huge hole that we had to then fill and then we developed this system in place to make sure that we were not losing them or or or you know what losing track of them so you know keeping touch with them and making sure they're safe has always been our priority and continues to be our priority yeah it's just this morning we had the housing commissioner in going through some of the protocol that's been in place the procedures that are checking up on the residents the additional cleaning that's taking place under your advisement so it's it's a very important question but between the the housing authority and the senior enrichment they have been still providing the meals checking up on residents and making sure that that people are being monitored and taken care of because with all the people you know sort of being enclosed you know you have to be wary of them and yeah and you have to be very very concerned and and look you know this this this is affected every community you know there is no community that hasn't been touched by this it's affected everybody in the private sector to you know got you know god bless people in the town workforce that were you know world personal friends with and again and doc I do think they're stressing the point of it's invaluable the information you're passing on in a regular basis it's and I get you know people as far as Wisconsin we said somebody from Florida my friend Brian sits watch this is every single day with this wife in Wisconsin they enjoy but they find it informative and I said I think that's that's a good thing and again I get for those people came on like as I read it we will be reopening under the guidelines of what New York State does that includes buildings that includes parks and when it comes to the programs we have to see frankly what the the medical professionals tell us we can and can't do and as it comes forth we will share that with you a lot of the cases we don't know you hear about you know some levels of government closing some facilities for the rest of the year I was driving in today on the radio and they were talking about Broadway might not open till September or not at all this year but but with that the town is open and I do want to remind residents you know go to the town website you can dial the five one six eight one two 3600 number that's been created if you'd like to talk to anything from the building department to the clerk to the receiver of taxes to the parks department we also have dedicated email accounts for those that are modern if you have questions you're looking for information you're looking for that application you're looking to get to get a building information we will respond either by FEMA email or call you back so I would tell people you know we are open for business we want to provide the services we can even in the limited capacity so reach out to us and we will do so an interesting question especially someone like me born and raised in Island Park on the water someone has asked you know obviously we're encouraging as long as you're keeping social distance go outside and get some fresh air obviously as the weather gets warmer the south shore of the town of hempstead has a lot of green flies you know we live a lot of marshland a lot of green flies so there is a question between mosquitoes green flies is any of the corona virus transmitted through any insects they're afraid for their children grandchildren that's a good question actually the answer is no it has to be it's a respiratory virus so the only way that the virus can enter your body is through your respiratory system that's why we talk so much about minimizing the cough droplets with masks and while we talk about making sure we wash our hands and making sure we don't touch our face and and that we are doing the social distancing so good even from mosquitoes yeah so yeah so the good news with this guys is it's not a blood-borne pathogen it is not something that is spread by by other you know by insects by you know animals I mean there is some thought that that you know I think this has come up a couple times can pets get this in the Bronx Zoo right so it seems that it's possible that that they can accidentally get it but they are not able then to spread it to other people so I mean and it's a very very low risk to to pets and to other animals so so the the only way to get this is from person-to-person transmission right now and that is through the respiratory tract so if you're avoiding those respiratory secretions you're avoiding those droplets you're washing your hands you're wearing your mask you're not touching your face you know you can get other viruses like West Nile and things due to mosquitoes but not for ours so that's you do talk about how things can tonight they you know like constantly spraying my hands now and then I never realized how much I did touch my face yeah Oh before I know anyone so I'm watching it that went like this that I was like no and be sensitive you know I guess some of the the concerns a lot of residents have been bottled up for a little while yeah they want to get out you know yesterday was 59 degrees and everybody wanted to you know you were thinking it was the hottest you know data to run down the beach you know when it comes to and I want to bring back to that to the mass because people are over saying why do you have to wear them out in public and we spent I was watching some photos of from the the less epidemic of 100 years ago of baseball players wearing masks while they're up hitting and the fans were in the mess again go through exactly the importance of why a mask is necessary in the public in general and why do people that could wear it sure so and you know I talked about this last time as well the this specialized n95 and the ones that are like highly filter masks those have to stay with the health care providers because we are in very close proximity to very sick people and that helps us stay sane so we can keep you know your friends and families healthy and and you safe but the just the general cloth masks are surgical masks the reason that that helps your neighbor is because it's spread by the cough droplets so we talked about these droplets you know when we're talking when we're breathing when we're coughing when we're sneezing little tiny droplets they come out of our mouths and they go into the air around us now most of those droplets sink to the floor right away that's how that six foot distance helps you because it very few of those droplets make it any farther than four or five feet which is where they get that kind of six foot rule from but there are tiny little droplets that come out that kind of can float in the air in an open space like this room in an open air environment like outside which is why people go outside as long as they're not within six feet of each other it's not being spread through the air but when you start to get into more enclosed environments with more people around each other we're talking about you know businesses if people are shopping in supermarkets if you people are taking mass transit if eventually we start to loosen up these restrictions were allowing people to get more congregated in groups and stuff once you start getting more and more people together then you get the risk of these what they call a super spreading event where you can get so many of these tiny little wayward droplets that they kind of they kind of collect together and then can spread the disease by wearing masks like this and you put this on you know this goes over your face all right that prevents those coughs drop it's those tiny little droplets from from making it away from you they get trapped in the mask then you take the mask and if it's disposable you throw it out or if it's rewatchable you we wash that obviously washing your hands like we always do and then that that helps your neighbor by decreasing the number of those cough drop lights if there's less of those droplets around then there's less of a chance of spreading the virus and even though like you said you look at those pictures from the 1918 flu it seems kind of crazy that we're taking steps that work that are a hundred years old you know every little bit helps there's there's no it might not be the best thing ever to have on a mask but it's something and if we took all of these these tools together used every single step we take to slow the virus that makes the virus not as infectious that makes everybody healthier that eventually stops this then you know the treatments that we develop eventually and the vaccine will then finally be the end of this pandemic but at least it's taking the steps that we need to protect each other and and we've had some people who are supplied masking with people who volunteered I know last week with sherry she was home she was said she was wanted to make mess and that was gonna prove invaluable because somebody did post that they can't find a surgical mask anymore and that's why I said the cloth mask has a benefit so something like that that if you make it from home if you distribute it out to a senior or somebody like that it'll go a long way so anything anybody's doing home if you've the means to make them and you want to donate they will go through the seniors they will go to the needy they will go to the children we will get them out because every little bit helps counseling any questions there I think question just came in should we disinfect our groceries before touching them okay so um a lot of the a lot of the chemicals that would be used for disinfection you do not want to put on your food because those chemicals can make you sick the actual really good news about this um this is also one of the silver linings is this virus is not very hearty outside of the body it is uh it's it's a I'm gonna call it a naked virus but what I say that is basically there's no strong wall around the outside of this virus it's a it's a little piece of nucleic acid it's some proteins and it's some fats and it's a tiny little particle and that's basically all it is there's not something that's really protecting that so the good news is is the best way to kill the virus actually it's just regular old soap and water you know we talked about hand sanitizer when we don't have access to soap and water but just regular old soap and water because the soap is enough it emulsifies the fats it breaks the facts apart and the soap breaks proteins apart I mean that's what soap is doing when you're washing your hands you're it's acting like a solvent and taking all of that and kind of breaking that apart and then washing it away so just regular old soap and water is actually our best our best tool to fight this virus it does work so obviously we we use disinfectants because we don't always have soap and water we use alcohol-based products but we don't always have soap and water when it comes to your groceries if you're using harsh chemicals and your groceries you're going to get sick from the harsh chemicals but there's not a lot of good literature to say that you get this through eating it the virus doesn't seem to live on foodstuffs and food prep I mean I lip Hannigan's in Point Lookout been great to us they've been feeding us they've been feeding me they've been they literally have been offering me food and and I just had a rubella salad last night and I didn't think twice about eating my salad from Hannigan's a they're clean B it was yummy and C I'm not concerned that I'm going to get this from food as long as you're taking the other steps so you know the regular routine things you would do to clean your food anyway because it could have you know let it could have e.coli on it or you know you know you know chickens can have other bacteria you know you want to do the normal things you do to prep your food you want to do the normal things you do to clean your food before you eat it but other than that there's nothing specific you have to do the chance of getting this from eating it from food is extremely well so get your takeout enjoy your food know that the people who prepare your food they know how to keep it clean they don't to change those tasks that's the good news about this virus it dies easily outside of the body you just have to not get yourself exposed to it and and and and with that I want to say thank you to the doctor in the councilman before we have some final comments I will say you know when it comes to updates on the parks when it comes to updates on the taxes when it comes to updates on the recycling we will share that on the social media accounts get that out there as much as you can you know a lot of the stuff we're already looking at implementation but how to bring things back a lot of it falls into the guidance of both the state as well as our medical providers and that comes from everything from you know garbage collection to the reopening of various park facilities to to equipment councilmen delay any final thoughts I just want to say thank you all at home for tuning in again and I hope this finds you and your family safe and healthy and dr. Dave just in your closing comments if you don't mind you know it seems like that the news and media loves to focus on I guess the negatives that are surrounding coronavirus and obviously there are a lot of negatives people are sick people are losing their lives but there's also some good news and that's because of the work of people like yourself because of our nurses our doctors our first responders our EMS those in the medical healthcare professions can you just kind of fill everyone in on you know the hospitals and the rate that people are surviving this beating this getting it over and being released to go home with their families and remain healthy for forever sure I mean first off just along those lines please thank your first line we I talked about this last time thank your first line responders thank your social workers and remember those aren't the people you normally think about we had talked about me giving good tip to think the key to check me out the grocery store I mean I mean there are a lot of people out there that have become first responders who never knew that they were first responders so I just it's very important that you thank them you look out for them you ask them how they're doing it means a lot to all of us when you do that and and you know we you should be reassured that that we're going to beat this as a community as health care providers we want to help you we want to make people safe we do not want people dying we are learning every day every day every person we take care of I mean even just in having that operation center where I've had the opportunity to talk to hundreds of our workers I learned what the virus was doing I learned how the virus were making people sick and then I was able to give out better advice to people about how to combat that so just you know in a little microcosm of what I did with our town works flowers understand that all of the health care providers are doing that with all of the patients that we're taking care of so you know there's all of these research studies out there you know as to what medications work we've heard about a number of them you know we're not sure which ones work but I can tell you I know of at least six or seven studies right now for treatment possibilities for this where they're actually researching this to figure that out you know people are going home you know they're celebrating by playing music in the hospitals when people go home you know people do recover from this most people who get this do not end up in the hospital do not end up dying you know there's a you know more than 90% of the people that get this right now on the case fatality rate in national counties four percent that is a very high number but but that means that that 96% of the people are you know it's so you know you got to put some in perspective that the toll has been terrible and there's no death that is it not you know impactful where we are sad for everyone and and personally we we mourn for them but but you know we do everything we can to keep people healthy we support the folks that lose somebody because that's terrible but understand that you know we work together you work to stop the spread you know that we're gonna find the treatment there will be a vaccine you know you know even back in 1918 when they have the flu they had very limited primitive medicine back then and that eventually became more like the seasonal flu it went away it took about two years hopefully this won't but understand that that we life will return to normal at some point so just we just got to remember to work with each other understand that people do go home do get better the health care providers taking care of you learn every day how to do this better just I could tell you just uh just a you know real quick before we go we learned both in the hospital and an EMS that when people are really short of breath we usually just put one oxygen mask on now we've learned that you can actually add a second oxygen source so we put the little tube in your nose called the nasal cannula and put an oxygen mask over that and we found that that more than anything was saving people's lives and it was just a little thing that we all figured out collectively between EMS and the hospitals and then we immediately disseminate that information and save lives decrease the number of people that ended up on ventilators and increased saving lives just by adding those to option delivery devices so that's something we all figured out in real time to save people and to help them get better so all of that is happening for sure so if you want to put the light at the end of the tunnel this will get better you know understand that we're all on top of this and you know we'll work on this together and well-well get through this well I want to I want to thank you as always dr. Dave and and council D Esposito of being here I want to thank all of you for taking the time to watch I hope was informative we appreciate the great questions you can always email us additional questions that we can put on our next Facebook's life that we could bring forth or again you can email or call the town of five one six eight one two 3600 with any questions and again we look forward to reopening doing it in a safe manner that the doctor says we can implement and when it comes to you know recycling again it is a big one idea today that we will be bringing that back and we were going to put forth a little program to alleviate that and lastly I'll finish on this when it comes to the property taxes again for those who've joined late because it's a reoccurring theme the County Legislature majority put forth a declaration today extending that tax payment it's got up to the county executive to sign she signs that that will extend the tax payment and Janine Driscoll and myself with the Town Board will implement plans for that tax collection in addition as I said Kate Murray the town clerk is working on the program to have to put marriage licenses available online after the governor made that available this past Saturday so we're working on that so as things change everyday please go to the town's social media accounts we'll put any changes of policy procedures that are being done there and again please stay safe you know I follow the doctor's advice and we'll all get through this together so thank you all very very much Stacey

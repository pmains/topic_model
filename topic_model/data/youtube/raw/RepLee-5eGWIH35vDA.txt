thank you I Mr Speaker I rise today to challenge this house to live up to our constitutional duty to debate the ongoing war in the Middle East for nearly two years our brave servicemen and women have been fighting yet another war as they face snipers and mortar rounds incredibly some claim that they are not in combat how can we claim this is not combat and worse how can we ask them to go to war when Congress cannot even muster the courage to debate it and authorize it or not the last four presidents have bombed the Middle East with little or no congressional oversight will we allow a fifth president to continue these wars unchecked as the National Defense Authorization Act comes to the floor next week I submitted an amendment to force the debate on this war and repeal the 2001 blank check for endless war that got us into these perpetual Wars as you can see the Congressional Research Service has indicated that this 2001 resolution has been used over 37 times and these are some of the areas in which that's videos that is just wrong the Rules Committee should allow this important debate to come to the house floor mr. speaker let us debate this war its cost and its consequences and talk about a real strategy to end isil's

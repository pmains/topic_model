everybody on the old Kabuto getting ready for the presidents in his first State of the Union address an address that will not be attended by at least a dozen Democratic congressmen and women who for various reasons have better things to do Nancy Pelosi meanwhile is urged that everybody behave tonight those who are going to be there and allow President P I'm quoting here his slobbering self when I get the repeat on all that with Steny Hoyer the house Minority Whip mr. Bernardo it very good to have you thank you for joining me good to be with you Neil thanks what did you make of her saying allowed the President to be as slobbering so that doesn't sound nice look what we have urged our members to be as people polite attentive and not replicate some of the really bad things that were done when Obama was president and giving his State Union we ought not to act that way and I think you will find our members respectful so you're talking about Congressman John Wilson at the time is who's shoutout you lied to the president don't do stuff like that yeah but at least he attempted this well you can argue that but look the President of the United States is leads our country we need to listen to him whether we agree with them or not and whether we support him or not that I'm going to show him the respect that the president the president the office of the presidency do alright so for those twelve colleagues of yours who are not coming is that showing respect or are they entitled to do whatever they want oh they're entitled to do whatever they want we never have I think either party have everybody present for one reason or another but in any event they're entitled to do what they want to do all right the president is going to do a lot of crowing as you know congressman about the tax code saying that they're working Nancy Pelosi is called a chump change crumbs but to a lot of folks a lot of people think $1,000 ain't exactly crumbs or chump change what do you think of that well I don't think $1,000 is chump change Neal but when you compare it to what the upper 1% got you're talking about 23 dollars a week versus about $1,100 a week so ironic when pulse Ryan our speaker and and the president and very frankly the Secretary munchin that said we're not going to give money to the upper 1% because they don't need it but the people who needed all the working people who are working hard striving and making have from these companies heretofore thoughts only benefit their shareholders there they handed out bonuses and the lights almost four million Americans likely more to come did you anticipate that because I've talked to the White House sir they did need an admission that no I did not anticipate it neo I think it's good for the workers god bless them but what's going to be good for the workers is overtime how they're treated with respect to salaries and benefits and retirement health benefits so the initial pump was it was a pleasant surprise to many and that's that's good but the fact of the matter is the distribution of the tax cuts first of all which create a huge deficit that's going to be very bad for the economy in my opinion in the long run notwithstanding their claim oh it's going to pay for itself the economy but we've had deficits right we've had deficits we had a lot of it under President Obama maybe four perfectly sound reasons coming after recession but both parties are guilty of deficits right well you know you say both parties are guilty of deficits Obama took over in a deep in the deepest recession we've had since the depression which means the deepest recession almost anybody alive in America has experienced and the Republicans opposed the effort to get us out the Recovery Act all of them in the House voted against it it worked it worked very better here than any ten trillion in debt excessively on the Republicans right no no I'm not but frankly the economic policy the president is pursuing that with these deep tax cuts was the Democrat the policies that were pursued and oh one another and frankly we were promised the best long-term recovery ever and that did not happen as a matter of fact we had the deepest recession no it wasn't totally the administration's policies but in fact frankly the previous administration in the Clinton administration had one of the best economies anybody alive today has experienced and the Republicans said his policies in 93 we're going to bring the economy down and make it very hard for working people it did exactly the opposite so there's a substantial difference in performance I think between the Democratic administrations and the Republican administration ease could surprise you're open to that but more more investing tens of billions of dollars Apple 3 250 billion oh the next 10 years that could surprise you right well I think that would be good for the country hope that happens I hope I hope it does alrighty Steny Hoyer a pleasure thank you sir for taking the time okay Neal all right

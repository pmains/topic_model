so you've been sending in your questions this was a question from brendan the protections that our first responders have are due to the negotiations of their unions as a proponent of removing protections from them would you also support removing similar protections negotiated by the teachers union my guess is that they're referring to the police union in that question what do you say to that well i'm not sure what they're referring to you know in the what we're doing is addressing qualified immunity and that's something of course that the unions uh are opposed to so i could not say that i would do that with teachers union i think that is total apples and oranges so the problem in policing though and you know remember when we watched george floyd be murdered that police officer was looking dead into the camera he didn't care he was looking in the camera and he had his hand in his pocket as he slowly killed george floyd because he was acting with complete impunity and so that is one of the basic problems in in policing and one of the key parts of our bill now i will say uh without hands down it's the most controversial part of our bill but to me that applies to to policing i think that might be what the person is referring to in the teachers union and i don't see the relationship at all all right now let's go to a question which a big question a lot of people have today about protests and beaches why is it okay this is from lisa okay to protest outside and it won't have an effect on the illness but they're closing the beaches what's the difference now as a member of congress you're not the person who made the call to close the beaches but members of your party people that you have supported are making that call is that a good idea for july 4th keep everybody off the beach well yes i think it is a good idea and i'm sure that when that decision was made that was made because july 4th a very social holiday where people are going to be drinking lots and lots of people would go to the beach and how you're going to maintain social distancing i think would be very difficult now people were worried about the protesters as well but you know it was interesting because i saw a lot of the protests where number one the protesters were masked lots of them and in some cases i saw the majority and you also saw them socially distancing which i thought was interesting there were a lot of protesters that were not social distancing and we've seen at the beaches in recent weeks a lot of people are social distancing at the beach and they are also outside so you understand why there's some frustration on that issue

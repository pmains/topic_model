social media for your business um i'm gonna kind of present a small presentation um please feel free to put questions in the chat as we go along and um i'll i'll take periodic pauses to kind of go through those so we don't get too far ahead and then obviously questions at the end um i'm going to jump right in i'm going to start kind of talking through all of the different social media platforms that are out there and then we're going to kind of drill in and focus a little bit more so one second while i share my screen here okay april are we good can you see everyone see that yes we're good okay great so first i think the biggest question for everyone is you know what platform should we even be using obviously we have kind of the the uh big platforms that everyone knows about the facebooks and linkedins and instagrams of the world but every day every week there seems to be a new social media platform of some sort something that people say you know you should really be on this or you should really be thinking about this for your business or you should just try this out as an individual and it's becoming really um crowded and sometimes confusing for our business owners to kind of figure out um what they should be using oh okay so um first of all uh you know the big ones are facebook instagram twitter linkedin those the kind of the big four um and then after that pinterest and youtube are fairly popular i think youtube is actually not considered a social platform but it's become more of one over time after that you know you kind of get into reddit and snapchat tick tock is the big one from this past year and then we've got a handful of messaging apps that people are jumping into like whatsapp which was just purchased by uh facebook a few years ago facebook messenger and a handful of others so it gets really crowded it's very hard for business owners to kind of stay on top of what is going to work best for their business so that's kind of going to dive into today um and let me start by just saying you shouldn't be on every platform um that's way too much for any one business to handle unless you're a really large company and not all of them are useful to you your target audience is not necessarily on all of these platforms so i i just encourage you to really think about you know where is my target audience going to really be and let that kind of dictate what you uh what platforms you try to use um so facebook the the very first oldest social media site that really is still lasting they're the largest platform at 2.5 billion users currently this is really you know if you're not sure what to use facebook is probably the best place to start it's especially good for consumer based businesses if you're selling to consumers if you have a shop or a gym or a bakery or something like that facebook is definitely where you are going to want to start facebook is really useful for getting people to share your content and it's your really best bet at getting new followers and engagement right off the bat um probably all of your friends and family are on there you know they're often people that can share your initial content and start to get the word out about your business um important to note facebook is actually programmed to um allow for video to be seen by more people uh photo and graphics after that and then plain text so if you're on facebook video is definitely where everything is heading and you really need to think about that as as i know most entrepreneurs don't necessarily do video unless they're doing something like a facebook live which i know also a lot of entrepreneurs like myself are still uncomfortable with so but video is definitely the thing that's going to get you the most bang for your buck uh second instagram uh which was also purchased by facebook is one of the second biggest and growing uh social platforms there's over a billion new users currently and it's growing very quickly the thing with instagram is that's a slightly younger user base now slightly younger doesn't mean teenagers even though most teenagers are on there but definitely a lot of the older generation are not using instagram as much as say facebook such as something to keep in mind um instagram relies heavily on visuals so when you go to your instagram feed it is all photos all graphics all video um so if you are an especially aesthetic business if you have you know beautiful cupcakes or a cool product or um gyms really do well in any kind of uh related exercise type business those all do really well their cafes do really well there any type of product business really if you are more of a business to business uh model your you may not do as well on instagram so let's just put that out there right at the beginning i'm a business to business company that i work in but we do a lot of creative work so we're on instagram but we don't really get as much engagement on instagram instagram is really focused on simplistic design as well something you may not know is that photos or designs that have a lot of negative space which is just kind of a plain color on the sides for instance or a more dominant color such as a blue really primarily they'll actually generate more than 20 percent more engagement than other photos of say a picture of your dog or you know just a picture of your office space or something like that instagram also is a place to use a lot more hashtags than a facebook and that's the best way to generate new followers and the reason for that is that instagram is not as friendly to sharing posts as facebook is so that actually limits your ability to find new users so if you are a business that's selling online for instance using hashtags and finding your your tribe your your customer base is really going to be useful to you okay if you are in a business to business business such as myself linkedin is really the place that you want to put your primary focus it has 740 million users currently and most people on that platform engage more than other platforms they're professionals they're looking to do more business they're looking for solutions and customers the other thing too is that a lot less content is actually being shared on linkedin though there's a lot more a lot of users on linkedin a lot of them aren't sharing content uh compared to say a facebook what that means is you have a way greater chance of being seen and that's really important especially again if you are selling to other businesses um if you're selling to consumers primarily like a restaurant your restaurant at home product those kinds of things this platform is not going to be as useful to you but that doesn't mean that you should ignore it especially if you're in the market for new employees because most new hires do can come out of linkedin you might be able to find your next person there you may also be able to engage with other companies you may be able to think about a new model for your business that adheres to a lot of business people so this is something not to ignore but it's not going to be as popular to you as as some of the others the last one i'm going to dive deeper into his twitter which has been around a long time but it is a smaller platform this is one that a lot of small businesses struggle with because they don't know how to use it or maybe they just shouldn't be using it there's about 192 million users and the slant on user base is older so there's not a lot of teenagers on here if you're selling to to teens or younger people in college this is probably not the platform for you um it's better for a lot of short content and more often so whereas facebook will actually punish you for posting more than once a day if you're under a certain number of followers twitter you can kind of share all day and they will keep allowing your posts to go through but twitter is a really good place for business to business businesses especially if you are in the city or if in if you're in a higher population area you'll find more users there who are on twitter who are looking for your business also if you do a lot of blogging this is a really great place to get those links out um so if you are on twitter or think that that's going to be useful for you you really need to focus on building your follower account by getting retweeted uh which is really just you know sharing getting people to share your post and engaging with your followers you can use this to drive more traffic to your blogger website and hashtags are much more prominent on the social site as well okay just a couple quick tips and then we're going to kind of dive into facebook a little more in depth um there's a couple things that i think a lot of people really struggle with social media not all social platforms are created equal there is a lot of differences between them and there's a lot of different ways that those platforms are are using that your post that you're sharing and so it's really you need to be mindful of that because for instance like i mentioned earlier facebook will actually if you're under 10 000 followers i think it is right now and you post three times a day they'll actually show all three of those posts to less people so facebook is not the place to be sharing multiple times per day very different story on twitter like we talked about so you kind of need to be aware of these rules if you're going to use these as you're one of your primary marketing sources and that's really hard for people to keep up with um it's kind of a follow-up to that you know you also need to just think about again where is my audience i can't drill down on that enough if your audience is consumers linkedin is not where you're going to find them so on and so forth um i see a lot of businesses you know you go to their website and they'll just have like five plus uh icons to all their social media sites and that's really something you need to stay away from uh secondly over time start things have started to change from an seo perspective how you are viewed on a search engine like google social media is starting to have an impact on that meaning that if you set up a facebook page for instance and you don't fill in all the information and you don't post on there very frequently google is going to start recognizing that and they're going to start punishing you for that from an seo perspective so this is becoming more and more important consumers are also looking for you you know and if you have a a facebook page up that hasn't been posted to since 2017 they're going to see that and they're going to think i wonder if they're closed i wonder if they're out of business i wonder if i can even go there anymore and they're going to move on from you um so the first first little tip here which i don't have on this slide is just purely if you're not going to use social media don't have a page lingering out there don't create one just to create one if you're not going to keep up with it that will do more harm than it will help you um back back to the slide though do use social media platforms to promote your business this like everyone knows this is becoming more and more prominent in our world today especially with the pandemic social media has has even changed in this past year um and we can dive into that a little bit um but you really want to show that you're a real business you want to show why people are going to want to engage with you and when they do when they comment on your post when they share your thing you know those kinds of uh engagement activities do engage with them back comment back um it shows that you're a real business it shows that you're paying attention to your customers and it will create loyalty um but also do be ready to adapt and change so this year is a really great example of that this past year um everyone flocked to social media and digital marketing even if they've never done it before just because of the pandemic and realizing you know this is a situation that's going to last some period of time it's destroying our previous business model and we really need to engage with this so as many of you have probably already learned engaging with your users is really important in adapting one thing that did happen this past year is that algorithms changed once again social media sites will change their algorithms on how content is viewed and that's affecting people so um besides that more and more people than ever have been online we've been at home we've been on our computers we've been working from home and and therefore there's a lot more people on social media kids are out of school or rather doing school from home for a while some of them were just out of school so they're all kind of engaging a lot more what this means is that there's also a lot more stuff being shared on social by businesses and by other people and what that means for you is that the level of visibility that you may have gotten two years ago is not necessarily the level of visibility you're going to get today i have a lot of social media clients and i can tell you that all of their uh reach and impressions on their posts dropped quite a bit um about about april last year and that has not changed we expect a higher a higher amount of impressions but still a lower amount than they were getting prior to the pandemic will that change back it's really hard to tell at this point as we talked about don't try to use every platform especially at first if you're new to social media pick one that's going to be the best for your business that might be linkedin that might be facebook that might be instagram just start with that until you kind of get a regular cadence that could be every day that could be three times a week it could be twice a week but try to get in the habit of sharing something regularly don't spend lots of money on ads so if you've ever seen the facebook ads for themselves trying to get you to spend on that same on instagram and other sites don't spend lots of money on that don't be tempted they're going to tell you you know we're going to be able to if you spend five dollars get this in front of a thousand eyeballs well those thousand people may not be the people that you want to see your posts they may not be people living next to your local business and you will get the eyeballs but they may not be your your custom the customers that you want and when that happens you just really end up spending a lot of money i've had clients come to me uh before we work with them and and they'll tell me things like oh we spent you know a thousand dollars last month on ads and had no new sales well that's devastating to a small business and it's just not something that's usually worth your time if you do want to use ads or feel like they could be beneficial to your business i highly encourage you to get some expert help don't use the platform just to be trendy this happened a lot this past year with tick tock which was a big conversation topic not just from a social media standpoint but also from a a governmental standpoint as it was almost banned this year uh tick tock is a very trendy platform is it here to stay i think the jury's still out on that um but tick tock is also based around music and i you know locally there's a a kind of business that is completely unrelated to music they do like car repairs and and they do tick-tock and it's just not useful for their business i don't know why they're spending the time on it so don't just jump to the next new social media platform chances are they may not even be around in a few months and it might have just been not been worth your time last don't focus on pushing sales it really works uh what does this mean so if you've ever been sold to by a car salesman and they're just really trying to push you into it that's what it feels like so the facebook pages that put out we have a big you know 50 off sale and they put this out like every day for weeks at a time or they try to tag people in it and and get their attention those kinds of things just don't work anymore they used to work you know 10 20 years ago but people and consumers are smarter than ever they're getting blasted with these kinds of advertisements and marketing every day they've learned to kind of see what's real what's not who's a good business owner who's not um these kinds of of posting rarely work the second thing is that social media sites are actually starting to punish those people for doing so um actually securing them less views and less eyeballs uh for instance right now the big thing on facebook is that if you actually type in your post telling people to share or to like this post inherently it will be seen by less people facebook recognizes that and will actually show it to less people okay um so next i'm gonna kind of jump into uh facebook pages a little bit more specifically um i chose facebook to jump into a little bit more in depth primarily because it is the biggest social site and it usually is the the one to start with uh facebook works for most people works for most businesses no matter what kind of business you are facebook is definitely the one probably to start with uh so right off the bat one of the biggest issues that i still see today is that people are not actually creating facebook pages for their business they will sometimes create a profile which is really reserved for human beings you me and it's what my profile is right and they'll put in their business name somehow and they'll put in a business picture this is not doing you any favors i see a lot of them it's not treated like a business and therefore you will not get the same amount of likes and friends and and eyeballs that you want to it's also very limited in the amount of tools you have the facebook pages which is built for businesses has a lot more tools to use second thing that if facebook does catch you doing this which they don't pay super close attention but if they do find it they can't ban you for doing that uh the second thing that i see a lot of is a lot of business owners will try to create a facebook group okay facebook groups are also very different things they work differently a facebook page for your business can actually hold or create a group underneath it and if if your business needs a facebook group for some reason for instance i've seen some gyms where people will buy into a subscription type thing and especially over the pandemic um the gym owners would share something in that group private to that group of people who are paying those kinds of situations create that facebook group underneath your page don't make that your only business page so in this in this photo here is a screenshot of what this looks like when you do start to create a page so this is what you should see you can find that by clicking on the plus button in the top right corner over there where i have that drop down menu and you can actually see there you can create a page from there inherently you also can create a group and a handful of other things so this is what it looks like when you start to create that make sure when you create your facebook page you are filling out as much information as you possibly can that it's asking for okay sometimes people think that some of these things are overkill or why do i need to add you know more than one category or tag or a description and the reason is that facebook looks positively the more on you the more information you fill in so does google and a handful of other search engines the more information you fill in the better chance you are going to be found the better chance people are going to follow you the better chance that people are going to trust your business which is the most important thing so fill in as much information as possible um there are usually a couple things that don't really fit your business for instance facebook right now is really pushing whatsapp and will ask you for a whatsapp number for your business as a part of the page setup i don't have one i don't find that super useful uh you might in your business but that's one that you could skip once you have created your facebook page it should look similar to this so this is this is my business page you'll see over on the left hand side a handful of different options which i'll kind of walk through but make sure that you've chosen an app name here that you put in a picture a cover photo up here uh we'll get to this action button in a moment make sure that you fill in the type of business you are there's a handful of other options down there such as phone number email contact information things like that also you'll notice here that there's a pinned post this is a little feature that you can kind of use to put something at the top even after you post more so when my business uh created this video we felt like that was really useful and videos are also as you know seen by more people so we pinned this at the top and it's the first thing that people see when they come to our page even if we've been posting you know maybe a new blog we've written or some other piece of content what that does is it just kind of helps add to the brand of your page and gives people a little bit of an introduction to who you are so definitely use this pinned post feature to kind of help you brand your page and not just have the most recent thing up here if you look on the left side there's a handful of other tools i'm going to walk through a few of them during this presentation but there's a lot of tools over here and it gets really confusing just some quick tips the business app store is not usually the place to start here um you'll also see the ad center like i said earlier don't don't jump to the ad center facebook ads are not going to make or break your business i promise um and then here's the edit page info if you missed a couple information things this promote button will also get you to some of those ads that you don't necessarily want to do last you can also do a facebook live directly from here if you are interested in that like i said before video really does help if your business is hosting an event definitely create it from the page not your personal profile but from the page there's also some offers if you're having a sale or a job posting if you are hiring so those are those can be useful to you as well okay the action button so the action button is that that that big blue button in the top right corner if i go back um and what that does is is usually in by default it's set as follow which is shown on this list here so if you want people to follow your page they would click that button you've probably seen this before you've probably followed businesses before what a lot of people don't know is that you can change what this action button does and that might be really useful to you so if you're just starting out you got like you know 10 followers definitely just leave it unfollow start to build your brand build the engagement with people until you have more followers but if you've already built your business if you've got 100 followers 500 followers so on and so forth you might want to consider changing this button and the reason for that is that you can actually get them to do a different action and if you guys know from a sales perspective you want people to get to you the easiest way possible the quicker they can get to you the more likely you are to engage with them and create a real lead or a real sale so for instance if my primary goal is to get them signed up for my email newsletter i might click the sign up option if my primary thing to do is to schedule an appointment with somebody if i'm a you know hair stylist or something like that oops i might click the the book now button if i have an online booking software i might want my customers to just call my my store or my number and you can actually change the button to just be a call button so they can call right from that button there it's a handful of other options here but definitely this is something to to pay attention to especially as you grow your business this might just help you close sales a little bit faster they just added this one uh fairly recently start order where people can actually order food so if you're a restaurant or something like that especially again during pandemic times that might be something that might be useful to you okay so the page info so you're gonna have an opportunity to fill this stuff out you know once you first start your page but if you ever need to come and fill in more info this is where it is located this is ours and what you'll notice is we actually went with kind of a slimmer description and the reason for that is though you're not you there's a limitation the amount of characters but you don't necessarily want to put a big paragraph here people just are not going to read it try to make this as simple as possible try to brand yourself using this description section okay the category section is extremely important as well as facebook search becomes more and more prominent you're going to want to pick the items in the categories here that really describe who you are so for us it's marketing agency web design photography and video okay pick the ones that are most relevant to you this is going to help you get found not just on facebook but also in google search you may have noticed in the past few years as you do google searches for things the facebook pages are coming up really fast and toward the top of the list so these are the things you want to be doing um and again can't iterate enough fill out as much of this as possible there's some additional stuff below this picture here okay so you might all be wondering what do i post uh maybe you guys struggle with posting stuff uh frequently you're like i just don't know what to write i get i get stuck on this i don't know what to do um again video is always seen more than other posts if you're not doing video even if it's just with your phone right we all have our smartphone we can do a quick video um this is what you're going to want to start with um take pictures you know set up a product put put a little setting the other thing too is to just set up you know a little bit more lifestyle type photos with your business if you have a store how how are your products used if it's a restaurant you know what new menu item are we putting out or what's a special going on just take pictures of those and put those out and just say this is a special or this is something we're trying come in and check it out um plain text posts i just don't recommend really at all for businesses this would just be text with no additional content they just don't get seen very often and they're not really worth it i've seen some businesses that still do this it just doesn't really get you what you want um in addition to to these kind of basics you know having relevant hashtags is useful to you on facebook please don't hashtag bomb your post and put 100 of them just to put them find a couple that are really relevant or meaningful to your post or your business so for a restaurant that might be hashtag foodie that's a big one and facebook will actually as you type start to type these in will show you like how many people are following those um getting people to share your posts is one of the most important ways to get your name out there facebook shares and the more people that share it mean way more people are going to see it so if i share a post from a business it's way more likely that all of my friends on facebook are going to share it if me and my wife for instance share the same thing and we have friends that have us both on facebook they're even more likely to see that so if you have you know multiple friends in the same kind of groups you can really get your business out there by encouraging sharing emojis in your post if you don't overuse them are also really useful to just kind of help your posts stick out so what we try to do a lot with some of our clients is just add a couple images and some of the posts here and there it just kind of helps with the visibility as you're scrolling through and if you think about yourself you know when you're scrolling on facebook right because we all do it you might begin to recognize that your eyes are actually drawn to posts with an emoji more often than others it's just kind of a statistic there so definitely be paying attention to that and use them as appropriate um last quality content will always be seen more over time okay so please don't just post just the post try to come something good about your business try to come with something useful to people that something that people really want to engage with or that they need to know um back to kind of the ad salesman uh thought from a little while ago if you're just selling every day if you're just posting come in and buy come in and buy we're 50 off or you know we really want you to buy this this product and you just kind of slam people with that but they'll probably just honestly unfollow your page they're not interested in seeing that so on the right side is a post that we did recently that received quite a bit of engagement this is a video we actually shared our logo design process and kind of walked through this as one of our finished logos you can see that we're you know got about a 500 person reach here not as much as i really want but engagements are about 40 and that was really a good and that's again video if this is a photo it'd probably be you know half that or something like that um notice too you can actually change some of the fonting in here so we've like bolded this sentence that also helps your post stick out and then also remember that social media is just the means to an end right social media in most cases is not your final product it's not where what people are buying from you so you want to leave them somewhere else and usually that's your website um or you know if you're a restaurant maybe an online ordering menu or something like that but you want to leave them somewhere else you want to capture them because if they're seeing posts that's great but from a sales perspective you want to close that sale so putting in a link to a page on your website putting in a link to wherever you want them to go next maybe to give them your give you their email address or something like that include that in a lot of your posts as well okay facebook stories so this is um becoming way way more popular um and you have also probably seen stories on instagram maybe on snapchat so on and so forth facebook stories are a way to get in front of more people more quickly but there's a catch and that's that the content disappears within 24 hours so this is really used for things that are um maybe uh a post that's leading them to a full post on your page that's for instance what these are here um they might be just quick things the things you maybe could reshare um another thing we do is when when we have an event going on when we're filming or when we're taking photos at one of our clients events we'll just do like a quick uh picture upload and say here's where we're at and what we're doing and that'll disappear within 24 hours the reason why they're so useful from a marketing perspective though which i had to learn myself is that stories have a way higher rate of engagement so as you put up a story um you may have noticed as you log in personally to facebook you'll see those at the top of your feed as soon as you log in um so for my own business even i'll actually see those stories before i see a post a regular post and so that's why they're becoming more useful social media platforms are kind of putting them right up front and center so you're way more likely to get more engagement just remember again stories are supposed to be more genuine and authentic they're supposed to be a little bit more about um not the the craft fully written or designed post but they're just here's something that's happening right now here is a special thing going on in our store here is a food thing that just happened you know and it looks really cool and we just put that out here is um something going on at our gym you know right now um here's something that just happened in our office um i saw a business um had someone trust i think the woman at their front desk dress up as the easter bunny right and they didn't want to make a big post out of that but they just put it as a social story and you know disappear for 24 hours but it just received a lot of engagement because it was like oh what's going on right now right there people want to to feel like they're a part of something going on right now so that's what facebook stories are for i say all that just because stories are becoming much more popular again stories are probably not the place to start if you're completely new to this you need to build a page following first okay kind of the last big thing i wanted to hit before we go to some q a time facebook insights so this is another menu item on that left-hand side and that big long list that we showed earlier facebook insights are the biggest part of your page you can put out a million posts you can see that people are you know eyeballs are on them but if you're not really looking at your insights you don't really know what that means for your business um you know some people would say that all marketing is good marketing or all advertising is good or pr um but that's not always true and if you're putting out stuff that's just not doing well and you're not seeing an increase you need to be aware of that and then make changes to kind of complement that right so looking at these metrics sometimes this is confusing to people so i'm going to walk through a little bit first and foremost i think one of the biggest questions people have are what is what does reach really mean what does impression mean and so on so facebook reach or post reach um is really how many people are actually seeing your content so they have viewed it in some way it was in their news feed they went to your page they saw that a friend shared it you know something like that impressions is slightly different impressions are the number of times your content is displayed on a screen okay so that might be you know someone quickly scrolled by it it might be that um a sec a person has seen this content more than one time and that's included in the impressions number okay so they might go to your page for instance three times in one day and those each count for impressions and they don't count for reach if that makes more sense and then engagement is how many people are liking or clicking or viewing or interacting with your post or content so this means that not not only did it you know kind of come through their feed but they actually did something with it so if you've got a video that means that they they viewed it they listen to it um if if you see post likes or if gloves or things like that that would that would count here if they clicked on a link in your post that would count here um if they commented that would count on engagement so understanding these three different things is really important and it does get a little confusing but if you look at this data here what you'll find now this is one of our clients is that what you want is obviously these numbers to go up you'll see like some big pops and what you really want to do is find where this peak was right what post was that was it a video was it a piece of content that people really engaged with find where those peaks are what people really are looking at on your page and do it again so if it was a video probably do another video if it was you know maybe you posted a picture and you had a question for your customers and people were answering in the comments right do that again find another question to ask um so on and so forth so find those peaks kind of look at what you're doing and see what's working um but this this data is really is really important this is a very simplistic version uh facebook will actually let you view data from you know a year plus ago over time month to month and download that so you can look at that and really see how you're doing over time and if you're doing something right you should see kind of a slow you know incline you might see dips and you might see peaks but you should overall just see a slow incline if you're doing the right things okay now the other thing too is to talk about these metrics so region impressions especially when you're starting out are really important and really good you want to see those numbers going up however engagement is really what you're looking for if lots of people are seeing your posts because you have 5 000 followers that's great but if they aren't engaging with any you're getting like zero likes and no comments right that's not really good for your business because what's happening there is you're never actually making it to a point where people are really interested in what you're doing which probably means they're not gonna buy anything from you which is really the thing that you're going for here so really pay attention to the engagement especially this is the thing that you have to pay attention to the most and also adapt to the most okay okay so that was kind of a brief and quick overview of facebook um and i'm sure there's some questions so um april i don't know if you've been receiving any or if we want to just kind of have people ask now but we can kind of jump into that um no i haven't received any questions in the q a um does anybody have any questions you can raise your hand and then i will um press on your mic or you can put it in the chat also and feel free to ask questions about not it doesn't have to be about facebook about any uh social site that was mentioned today or something like that be fine too and erase your okay beloved [Music] are we good now yes ma'am everybody um thanks april for allowing me to speak but one of the questions i have is like um regarding social media you're on linkedin uh facebook now i know you're addressing facebook right now but uh if you have the instagram and the twitter as uh like four accounts that you may manage uh is there way that your website uh for your business or organization can post something on your website that will go to all four of those without you having to duplicate each section yeah um so there are ways to do that um there's software to do that such as hootsuite is one uh buffer is another that i'm pretty familiar with um one little word of warning um the different social platforms are actually distancing themselves from one another and the content is being posted differently so for instance i might post a picture on facebook and it might show up just fine and then you know i'll see it's posted on instagram and it will look distorted or stretched or cut off okay so um what's happening right now is that a lot of uh the sizing of different things and whatnot is looking a little different secondly people are engaging with content differently on those social sites so again if i post uh for instance you know maybe an event coming up and i'm at my business and i'm posting that on facebook for instance um that's gonna show up differently on instagram and instagram is gonna treat that post differently so if i share a picture of maybe a little flyer that i made with a lot of words on it that's actually going to hurt you on some of these different social sites because they'll actually look at photos and if there's a lot of words in the photos you'll be viewed by less people so those those pieces of software to do what you're asking for definitely exists lots of people use them i would just caution you to be careful about you know where we're sharing certain content versus others now that doesn't mean that you can't share the same kind you know kind of information on those different sites you probably should but it's just a matter of thinking like here's how facebook handles this and here's how linkedin handles this and i just need to craft that post a little bit differently depending on where i'm sharing it thank you you have another question yeah i'm glad he said that because i was talking to one of my uh you know we discussed things like that with my marketing on how we share things and and somebody had brought up that and i'm glad he said that because now i know that's not the way i'm going to make sure that we approach it but the other thing too is um i know that there are different age groups that are on different platforms so uh is there a way that you would suggest that you were things on one compared to the other ones that you're on can you give us an example yes sure um let me just think about that for just a second um so yes in general there are different age groups however the big four kind of have a pretty solid group of of all age groups but as as i mentioned earlier you know linkedin for instance you're not gonna find any teenagers on there um twitter you're gonna find you know mostly a little bit older group um so definitely if you're you should really just be thinking about who you're targeting you know if you're saying it's anyone that's 18 and older from any age group well then you just need to kind of write your content gotcha um we need to write this content differently on facebook you know that's that's more again slightly older leaning uh social media site so you might post um toward that dinner this might be different so as an example um if i want to if i'm having an event and i want a mix of different kinds of people there you know on facebook i might just create an event and share the information and start to share that with whoever whoever is on facebook right and that might work really well but let's say this event is a community event and we want a lot of teenagers to show up to our kids and we're gonna target instagram to do that well in order to grab their attention you know an event poster really just isn't enough right kids heads are all over the place these days they're seeing all kinds of things thrown at them what you need to do is really focus on how you're capturing their attention right so an event poster that you know plain white paper with information might do great for a 40 year old but it's not going to capture like organization or business does but you just kind of got to think about how you're sharing that i would say that um younger generation also is looking more at stories so sharing stuff on stories on on facebook and instagram would be a good start as well does that make sense it makes a lot of sense and i appreciate that you know we target more business uh entities than others but we do have a lot of organizations that are non-profits and some of them are youth organizations so i'm sure that that information will really appreciate it and if you know when we share that with them as well so i appreciate you mentioning that thank you yeah if you have other questions my my emails down there you can send me some specifics if you'd like does anyone else have any questions please raise your hand it looks like we're gonna have any questions that's it um okay uh go ahead no go ahead i was gonna say i could just briefly go back to um kind of overview um so you know if we want to just kind of briefly hit some of these other ones um more in depth maybe um some of you some of you probably heard of these some haven't you know again you know we mentioned tick tock was like the really big social site this year that really hit its dry and got a lot of followers and was entertaining content this is still one i think some business owners are being are successful with using it especially if they have a business where they're really engaging directly with consumers but again it's one that you know if you're doing business to business or anything like that i just recommend staying away from snapchat is another like that if you're targeting teens or younger people specifically snapchat can be useful to you but the platform itself is just not really built for doing business uh very well and they're trying to break more into that but i've seen some business owners really try this and i just continue to see that it's not a really great investment on the other hand if you are a business that has again product or if you're a crafty type of business or thing someone things like that pinterest might be a really big one for you so for instance um there's a business locally they they sell kits of of crafts for kids right and pinterest is a really great site for them because moms are on there they're looking for these kinds of things for their kids families around there looking for things to do especially when they're stuck at home right and there's less events for them to go to and so pinterest might be a really big is a really big deal for them and it might be for for you as well so i wouldn't ignore some of these other ones we didn't really talk about today i just say that be really aware of how they're used the messaging apps are another great example not usually initially considered social media but they're starting to build up these business platforms um which are becoming more and more useful um for businesses so if you've dipped your toes into that that might be useful to you the other thing i would just say is remember as you create these social sites people are looking to engage with your business okay that means if you create a uh let's just say a youtube channel right they're going to be looking for content there and again i'll just repeat myself don't create these sites if you're not going to use them if you're going to create a youtube page awesome if that means you're going to do a lot of video content be ready to do that it's easier than ever to create video content just on your own without the help of another larger company or something like that that does video but be just be aware that you need to continue to post there and create that interest the other thing too is i often in our own business find that people where i'm gonna find somebody is anyone's guess they might reach out to me on facebook they might go to my website they might go to our linkedin and they're gonna message me wherever they they found me if i'm not paying attention to those messages i'm really likely to lose that sale right if i ignore those messages for three days because i'm not looking at my linkedin right i'm probably gonna lose that sale probably gonna lose that lead um so just again if you're gonna kind of jump into this and really try to use social media for your marketing have a plan figure out what you're going to do do not do everything doing everything is a really great way to ensure that you do a lot of nothing so okay do we have any um questions let's see what we thought well thank you very much jesse um for i've said the social media basics what to do and what not to do on how to get started on social media that's a lot of help um i know for a lot of especially since the new the new normal [Laughter] everybody has um discovered online and facebook a lot of you know especially older people they're now discovering social media yeah absolutely businesses online and looking at websites to see if they should get this i know my mother's calling me like every day how do i look up someone so how do i afford this myself so yes that's so everybody's looking at social media that's a great point yeah there's there's more people than ever and they're looking at it more often so and tomorrow we'll also be having a webinar um with summer

another night of tensions and some arresting of protesters in washington d.c the scene was really tense the other night after the final night of the rnc at the white house senator rand paul and many others including some of our folks were harassed leaving that event now senator rand paul is among many who are demanding answers about who exactly is organizing and supporting these protesters backing and writing in an op-ed quote who are these people who paid for their hotel rooms who flew them in law enforcement needs to look at the funding of violent criminal activity like this and national democrats need to confront it it's organized it's paid for it's violent it is not about black lives or any lives it's about anarchy and destruction writes rand paul for example this is the accosting of a new hampshire rnc representative this young protester singled him out and she knew his name watch this of black individuals in the united states mr ager how do you feel about the killing of black individuals in again so republican senator rand paul of kentucky joins us now senator thank you uh for being here you know you watch this uh i think it's a young woman totally head covered uh in this protest moment she knows the name of this rnc representative from new hampshire now i would understand that people in new hampshire might know him i did not know this man's name i don't know how many other people would recognize him by sight but that struck me sir well it's the same thing we ran into and you know i have a certain amount of notoriety but we showed up on the corner and once someone yelled it's rand paul we've got him trapped then it went from a dozen to two dozen to three dozen the crowd got bigger and bigger but the crowd also kept pressing in and we fortunately got to a corner where there were a couple of policemen but we were just all sort of you know getting crowded and crowded and crowded people pushing and shoving and i really was uncertain whether the police had enough people to actually repel them if it became a full-scale attack and i said to the policemen they know who i am you need reinforcements he radioed for reinforcements i think we still stood there for 10 or 15 minutes with the crowd you know closing in on us and i fully believe that the police had not been there we would have been drugged to the pavement we would have been kicked and stomped until we were bleeding from our ears like the people in portland and in other places this is this is something that we should stop and at the very least you should be less arrested for disorderly conduct you should be arrested for not letting people move there's got to be a crime here inciting a riot but i know you can't put these people away forever but they need to be arrested so we can find out who's funding them how they're getting there they're staying in 600 to a thousand dollar a night hotels they have plane flights to come here some of the people we picked out in the footage that were attacking us are from other cities and we can see them in riots in other cities so we're now seeing that the people are being flown from portland to minneapolis to dc for these riots and it is not your first amendment to trap people terrorize them and threaten to kill them and call them all kinds of awful names that is not your first amendment right that is not in the constitution you mentioned seeing the same people this one is a woman who was confronting representative brian mast and this video has also made a lot of uh you know people have watched it a lot uh as it has been replayed and then you see her in another video she's also she also shows up in in your video now that's just around the block but you know it's interesting to me that that these same people are confronting all these different folks but you've raised a lot of questions here about who's funding them i don't know where they what hotel they stayed and maybe you have done some digging into that um but you know what are some of the answers to those questions do you think who's funding them well i think the only way we know is through asking a judge the proper ways we have to get a subpoena but we should look at their financial records we should look at who paid for the hotels we should subpoena airline records now i'm not talking about randomly i'm talking about for people who are accused of a crime that we have evidence that they've been committing a crime and i think it is a crime to incite a riot it is a crime to threaten people it's a it's a crime to surround people and tell them they can't move anywhere this is not a first amendment look if it were if it were a rally to be against no knock raids i have a bill called the briona taylor bill i'm actually for you know get it for reforms of this where we don't do no knock raids in the middle of the night and yet they're attacking me these people are so clueless and such idiots they're out there for violence and they're out there for mayhem but they aren't out there for reform look i've been a part of protests my whole life protest against big government or protests against this but we go and we have speeches and we talk about it and then we knock on the door and we lobby congress but you don't try to kill people you don't kick people in the head in the street the pictures that are out there you know this we don't we cannot we can't have a country that ends up on fire like portland well you know what it sounds like joe biden has finally come around to uh thinking that as well uh he spoke in pittsburgh today he now says and they did not mention this once at the dnc um about the violence that was happening in the cities and we've also heard a lot of people downplay it oh it's nothing you know it's all um peaceful protests and then you've got you know a few rabble rousers anybody who was on the streets of dc the other night and i would imagine and i was i would imagine that it felt very similar to what you feel on the streets in portland and some of these other cities but here's what joe biden is saying about this today listen to this these are not images of some imagine joe biden america in the future these are images of donald trump's america today he keeps telling you if only he was president it wouldn't happen if he was president he keeps telling us that he was president you'd feel safe well he is president whether he knows it or not what do you say to that senator i'd say joe's confused these are his supporters and i haven't heard joe biden or kamala harris come out and say what happened to my wife and i and the other two ladies that were with us was wrong you know i haven't heard one word of rebuke they're afraid of these people also and they're afraid to rebuke them because these are their supporters this is their base the people attacking us attacking the federal building this is joe biden's base and he needs to disavow him but senator what do you do what do you say about black lives matter the woman in charge of black lives matter in louisville said that it was good that we were afraid she could see fear on our face and that she was happy because that's the way she has to live and they have to live so we should live in fear also this is their message all right that somehow they are living in fear so everyone else should be terrorized as well and instead of the message that what a great country we have and you can succeed too no doubt that the feeling that you express is what i was feeling on the street that night as well and they don't care who they're talking to they have no idea it's like pulling down the statues they don't know what the statues represent or what those people actually did they did the same thing to you but what do you say to those who say well there are also people on the right who are doing this sort of thing and and they point to kyle rittenhouse uh who is now accused of killing two people what i would say is these cities that are on fire are run by democrats do not go and you know so you're going to be part of vigilante justice run the heck away from these cities move away from these cities get away from these cities but don't go there armed they're going to have to figure out that their representatives their their democrat mayors have let them down but i'm not for militias and vigilantes going to these cities stay away from these cities these cities are in ruin and they're on fire but they've been on fire because democrats have been in charge for 50 years in every one of these cities senator rand paul thank you good to have you here tonight sir our thanks to him

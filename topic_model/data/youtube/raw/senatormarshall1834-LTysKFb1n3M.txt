thank you mr president before the kova 19 pandemic few people other than scientists and national security experts were familiar with gain of function research senator i'm sorry what do you want me to say i asked to initiate the quorum call objection senator from kansas okay thank you thank you mr president before the kova 19 pandemic few people other than scientists and national security experts were familiar with gain of function research now as we continue to search for the origin of this pandemic and begin to learn more about the dangerous research that's been largely kept from the public eye it's becoming a household phrase before we get started on the current state of play i'd like to give a brief history of this research and how the federal government has poorly perhaps negligently approached its oversight and funding in late 2011 over a decade ago the ns abb which is nih's advisory board stopped two scientists from publishing an avian influenza gain of function study why because they were afraid that this study would educate bio-terrorists that's right in 2011 a decade ago scientists had figured out how to make h5n1 highly pathogenic even influenza more contagious which have been catastrophic for american agriculture dr fauci personally called both scientists and convinced them to volunteer to pause their experiments in early 2012 dr fauci encouraged all influenza scientists to voluntarily pause influence the gain of function research and told them and i quote it's essential we respect the concern of the public domestically or globally and not ask them to take the word of influence as scientists dr valachi obviously concerned about the public perception out there dr fauci also almost prophetically stated that he worried about and i quote again unregulated laboratories perhaps outside the united states doing work sloppily and leading to an inadvertent pandemic accidental release is what the world is really worried about and i end the quote from dr fauci in 2014 after several biosecurity accidents in the united states research labs the obama white house implemented the gain of function moratorium on influenza as well as mers and sars research because of the potential risk of lab accidents and inherent gain of function danger these two moratoriums clearly demonstrates that the united states government and nih our primary public health agency understood the risk associated with this research and understood the threats it posed despite this pause though certain viral gain of function research projects continued at the university of north carolina researcher was later shared with chinese virologist named dr xi the bat lady she was famous for copious amounts of research conducted on chronoviruses that live in bats now outside of those north carolina studies dr fauci failed to heed his own call on united states scientists to pause their gain of function studies and offshored the paused research to china not just once and not just recently but practically continuously for over a decade it's disturbing that one of our top public health agencies directed this risky research to be offshored while encouraging the pause in that exact same research here in the united states in 2012 dr fauci gave a new grant to peter dasik's eco health alliance a company that america will soon know the name of all across of america he gave a new grant to peter dasik's eco-health alliance for avian influenza research in china which was truly gain of function research in 2014 dr fauci gave another new grant another gain of function grant to dr dasic and eco health for sars research in china through these grants peter dasik partnered with the wuhan institute of virology in late 2017 nih announced a lift on the gain of function pause apparently without consultation with senate confirmed state department or national security leadership significantly there was no director of the office of science and technology policy in place with only an acting hhs secretary at the helm nih essentially lifted the moratorium on their own by slipping it in between administrations and self-policing today we can't see the research record from dr fauci's offshore projects because the chinese communist party has possession or at least supposedly has possession of equal health records and nih resist sharing theirs by all counts dr falchi and ecohealth's research in china led to the kova 19 pandemic and dr fauci's worst fears that a lab accident in a foreign lab became reality at a very important hearing yesterday at the capitol hosted by senator paul before the senate homeland security and governmental affairs subcommittee on emerging threats and spending oversight dr richard e bright a renowned microbiologist declared that is indeed possible that this research did lead to the outbreak of coba 19. dr stephen quay and dr kevin s felt other expert witnesses on the panel agreed that viral gain of function offers no civilian use or benefit let me say it again both these doctors agreed that viral gain of function offers no civilian use or benefit but is so risky it can cause a pandemic that will have a worse impact than a nuclear attack it is indeed a weapon of mass destruction despite warnings and past lab accidents our public health agencies like nih continue to fund this weapon of mass destruction research often in china nonetheless in fact at one point nih paid for more viral gain of functioning experiments than the department of defense according to hearing testimony given by dr fauci on this topic in 2012 shockingly congress has minimal insight into the amount of research that nih performs there's no transparency into the risk evaluation process there's no proper oversight recently this is news our office just learned that usaid is currently paying 125 million dollars to the washington state university paul allen school for global health to collect potential pandemic pathogens in high risk areas for outbreak once collected these samples are being used in dangerous gain of function experiments through their deep vision grant this project initially partnered with five countries in africa asia and latin america but could expand to others the university researcher collecting storing and experimenting on these pathogens in foreign laboratories in each country even worse these hazardous research techniques are being techniques are being taught to foreign research while experimenting with potentially deadly pathogens in laboratories where the u.s has no regulatory control authority no process exists to create to screen us researchers or foreign researchers by intelligence analysts for their potential as threat actors the us has no ability to control who the technology or the deadly pathogens are shared within these foreign labs and cannot enforce proper storage techniques usaid is putting everyone at risk right now our u.s public health agencies like nih and cdc cannot be entrusted to oversee risky research with the current guardrails that are self-selecting and self-policing certainly our united states agency for international development cannot be entrusted yet federal agencies continue to dispense funds for gain of function research now dr fauci recently became before congress and publicly declared that he had no intention to stop using u.s taxpayer dollars to fund chinese communist party research projects folks this is a national security issue since january of 2020 i've been trying to sound the alarm on this virus on this issue on this weapon of mass destruction but it's largely falling on deaf ears in congress and with the current administration yesterday's hiscac hearing was the first time congress examined this subject since the outbreak of coven 19 and unfortunately none of my colleagues across the aisle bothered to show up for this hearing clearly just clearly declaring that this was not a priority for them additionally mainstream media has attempted to bury concerns about gain and function research and the possibility of a lab leak this is unacceptable we must pause this research until national security experts can help create appropriate appropriate risk metrics guard rails and processes for this research it's important note that this is estimated to only compromise less than 0.1 percent of all biomedical research and less than one percent of virology research dr richard ebright testified that because gof research of concern can cause pandemics this small part of the biomedical research enterprise is highly consequential and requires effective oversight and certainly that current oversight is not effective mr president this is a bipartisan national security issue and anyone who studies this issue in depth will conclude that viral gain of function is a weapon of mass destruction anyone who examines this will conclude that covet is like a nuclear hand grenade with its pin pulled out it's already killed a million people and can kill millions more every witness will conclude like we did yesterday that the potential is much worse than any type of benefit from this research this covet virus is likely a product of u.s funded gain of function research the research has produced no benefit in 10 years and was seemingly no benefit on the horizon and this is why i brought my legislation to the floor today to place a moratorium on all federal research projects grants to universities and other organizations conducting gain of function research and risky research on potential pandemic pathogens this is an urgent matter that must be acted on today kansas i want to thank my colleague for her kind comments and certainly the chairwoman has my commitment to continue to work with her on the pandemics prevention act as well but if my colleagues do not agree with placing a full moratorium on gain of function research i ask for unanimous consent to adopt the safe risky research act which stops federal funds from being used to conduct risky research with countries that threaten our democracy and public health now we recently learned that usaid has been paying for this dangerous research in china we know that this research is being conducted in africa asia and latin america but we don't yet know all the other countries where they fund this risky research what we do know is that despite their relationship with the state department this funding is being dispensed by usaid without state department security consultants consultations oblivious to the proliferation potential federal agencies that oversee national intelligence maintain list of countries that may pose a risk or threat to national security the department of state for example maintains a list that includes burma the people's republic of china iran north korea pakistan russia saudi arabia and others this legislation is common sense we shouldn't be collaborating on dangerous research with their adversaries i think it's obvious that all members of our committee agree with us that they think they support this this bill in this legislation on march 14th health committee held a markup where this amendment the same tax within this bill is unanimously adopted in the bipartisan prevent pandemics act i appreciate chairwoman's murray working so hard collaborating with ourselves and during the market she supported this specifically that it protected biomedical research enterprise that it threads the needle excuse me you stated that it threaded the needle in terms of protecting biomedical research enterprise by taking steps to address some of the concerns she's heard from other committee members given the inherent risk nih's unwillingness to fully cooperate with congressional oversight and senate democrats objection to taking the needed step of placing a complete moratorium on gain of function research we must at least pass this narrow approach today

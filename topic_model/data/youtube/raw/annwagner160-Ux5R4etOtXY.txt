I want to thank my my good friend and colleague the gentlelady from Indiana Jackie Vallauris Lord milori we are classmates and came in to Congress almost seven years ago I am so grateful to her for pulling this special order together tonight to talk about the most vulnerable in our society talk about the right to life the gentlelady he from Washington State and and I have to say your story moves us all and we are so excited about your growing family miss Roby I cannot thank you for your support your passion your dignity when it comes to supporting life all of my colleagues that are here with us tonight and stand with us on this legislation and above all I want to say mr. speaker that I believe our president last week at the National Prayer Breakfast said it best and I quote all children born and unborn are made in the holy image of God every life is sacred and every soul is a precious gift from heaven none of us could say it any better than that I never thought the time would come when I would have to actually argue and fight and debate and stand for providing health care to infants after they are born and yet here we are there are apparently many Slater's who believe it is okay to will allow a child to die after it's been born well I first heard the news of state officials and York and Virginia believing that it is acceptable to delimit health care for newborns babies I was horrified but I will tell you mr. speaker it's not just in the Commonwealth of Virginia and the state of New York in fact only 26 states have affirmative protections for children born alive after attempted abortions only 26 states and in fact in recent days Vermont Rhode Island and New Mexico are considering legislation to loosen the late term abortion restrictions that have gone forward in Virginia and New York in fact New Mexico's House passed HB 51 which would effectively permit abortions up until birth and eliminate all restrictions thereafter so to me it is unthinkable Keable that a baby is born alive anyone's first instinct could be anything but to try to save that precious innocent life by any means possible our babies are some of the most innocent most vulnerable members of our society and it is our response it's ability our duty our calling to make sure that they are cared for every year baby survived late-term abortions that are left to die on tables and bedpans in operating rooms this should not happen in the United States of America is a flagrant violation of our Constitution and an offense against women and children I implore my colleagues to support Lord our bill HR 962 the born alive abortion survivors Protection Act and Mr Speaker we will bring for the next 25 days until we can put forward a discharge petition we will bring the born alive act and ask for unanimous consent that it be passed by the full house this should not be in question this is a piece of legislation that was passed in the hundred and 15th Congress now we will do that the next 25 days until we can put together a discharge petition and force it to vote under the state on the floor of the United States House of representatives last week I was told when I offered the unanimous consent decree that it was the wrong time I quote to fight for the most basic of human rights well mr. speaker I say it is always the time to fight for those who cannot fight for themselves I asked my college to join me join us in this fight for innocent newborn babies I thank you and I thank the gentlelady for her courage and her standing up for life and I yield back [Music]

joining us now from kentucky gop senator rand paul senator we'll get to the procedural questions about the senate trial that i know you're concerned about in a moment but first you just heard liz cheney does president trump bear any responsibility for the attack on the capitol on january 6th you know i opposed the notion of uh which i think was a misguided notion of voting to overturn the election either with congress or with the vice president but i think if we're going to criminalize speech and somehow impeach everybody who says oh go fight to hear your voices heard i mean really we ought to impeach chuck schumer then he went to the supreme court stood in front of the supreme court and said specifically hey gorsuch hey kavanagh you've unleashed a whirlwind and you're going to pay the price you won't know what hit you if you continue with these awful decisions this inflammatory wording this violent rhetorical attraction was so bad the chief justice who rarely says anything publicly immediately said this kind of language is dangerous as a mob tried to invade the supreme court so if people want to call hold president trump accountable for language there has to be a consistent standard and to my mind it's a partisan farce because they're not doing anything to chuck schumer not doing anything to representative omar not doing anything to maxine waters it's just not fair it's just partisan politics under a different name uh this is the case that republican rather the democratic house managers will make before the senate this next week they will note that mr trump tweeted his followers a number of tweets but one of them to come to a big protest on january 6th be there will be wild he wrote and then they will play videos of what happened that day what he said how they reacted uh we made our own compilation of those including some clips that are circulating on the internet take a look senator we fight we fight like hell and if you don't fight like hell you're not gonna have a country anymore senator you you talk about other people who have said things but you know we here there had been weeks of misrepresentations about the election then he called people to come to washington then he talks about fighting like hell people in the crowd are talking about going to the capitol and then they demand uh to find speaker pelosi and uh to hang mike pence the vice president of the united states is that not incitement for insurrection i don't condone any of the language and like i say i opposed philosophically and voted against overturning the election however i think you're going to see the trump defense play video of maxine waters telling crowds to mob trump administration and restaurants and attack them they'll probably show clips of cory booker saying get up in their face of these congress people you'll probably see comments from representative omar wishing and celebrating the violence that happened to me when i had six ribs broken and part of my lung removed i think you're going to see all of this and people have to judge for themselves are we going to impeach and and potentially criminally prosecute people for political speech when they get say get up and fight for your country let your voices be heard has nobody in this country heard a figurative speech you can argue that his position was wrong and that it was misguided i accept all of that but if you're going to criminalize his speech you have to do it with the same standard you can't just criminalize republican speech and ignore all the democrats who have incited violence look at the mayor of seattle she went on and on about this being a summer of love kamala harris went forward and said we should bail out these violent protesters one of them has gotten out three times committed crimes three times including cracking the skull fracturing the skull and causing a brain injury after kamala harris advocated for getting him out of prison so the thing is is we can't just have a double standard both parties have to be treated the same i think democrats had any bit of self-reflection they would be saying this is a really terrible idea all right let's talk about the other issue which is the one that you raised i guess a week and a half ago which is whether this whole procedure this whole trial is constitutional you offered a motion contending it is not because you said a a former president a president who has left office cannot be the subject of a senate trial the other side argues that under that standard a president could abuse his power quit at the last minute and could not be held accountable by the senate for obviously if it's if it's a legal crime he could be but for a political crime the senate would be unable to touch him under your standard i think that argument ignores the fact that yes the president can be prosecuted and if they think he incited a riot or an insurrection which is such an overstatement and such a conclusion without any sort of presentation of evidence all the left-wing media just concludes it but the thing is is yes they can take him to court they can take him to trial and do it i think he has suffered under public opinion his numbers are greatly reduced and so i think there's all kinds of punishment but we have to look we've had a country for 250 years and every other congress thought it was unwise to keep you know going after an ex-president con constitutional scholars which have said that the constitution says you impeach and disqualify if the person isn't there to impeach you can't do either one of them and so there are constitutional experts senator paul also before my colleagues senator paul that's not quite true if i may if i may in 1876 the then secretary of war william belnap serving under ulysses s grant was about to be impeached for accepting bribes he raced to the white house and resigned but the house impeached him anyway and the senate decided that it had the authority to try him and it did try him and although a majority sought to remove him to convict him they didn't get the two-thirds but isn't that the 1876 case of william belnap a solid precedent no because we've never impeached a president because we always thought it would destroy and tear up the country and divide us further the thing is is when you look at impeaching the president the constitution has some very specific requirements it says when the president is impeached the chief justice shall preside and to me this is one of the shocking things when we showed up we found out that yes chuck schumer had called justice roberts and this hasn't been reported widely but he did and justice roberts said heck no i'm not coming across the street because you're not impeaching the president this was a strong signal to all of us that this was going to be a partisan hearing with a democrat in the chair who's already voted for impeachment you think we're going to get any fair rulings out of a democrat that's already expressed favor for impeaching him previously and is going to vote this time to impeach him so it is a farce it is unconstitutional but more than anything that's unwise is going to divide the country if biden thinks he really you know if he really meant anything about that unity and he really wanted to be a statesman you know what he would have done he would have come out and told his party enough's enough let's move on we won the election and let's move on with our agenda but instead they can't let go of president trump and they're going to keep kicking and kicking and kicking but to the rest of the country and to most of the republicans it looks like bitter rancor that they can't get the election you know they can't get over the election senator i've got about a a minute left i want to ask you a couple of quick procedural questions do you think the senate will call witnesses how long do you think the trial will last and is there any chance that the senate will vote to convict donald trump zero chance of conviction 45 republicans have said it's not even a legitimate proceeding so it's really over before it starts as far as witnesses i think unlikely to be witnesses if they do want witnesses there's going to be so much evidence that the president had nothing to do with this it was planned previously on facebook the bombs were planted the night before people were attacking the capital who weren't part of the speech they were already attacking the capital while he was just beginning to give the speech down there there's all kinds of evidence that goes against them the fbi is investigating all these people and people being investigated are being invested how long do you plotting this in advance and senator how long do you think it'll last uh hopefully uh as short as possible for this is really bad for the country so i'm forgetting it over within a couple of days and moving on and look let's debate policy and let's quit uh sort of just all this uh craziness that everything has to be about attacking president trump senator paul thank you thanks for joining us today always good to talk with you sir

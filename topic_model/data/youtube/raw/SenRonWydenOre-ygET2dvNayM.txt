okay well you know what my biggest room yeah my big concern you know which I mentioned to your brother-in-law is is you know he's got some assets and I don't know how that affects thanks yeah yeah massive come into play and that's part of the process would explain all that to you what where you need to jail ha what needs to be done well I'll be accredited an attorney that we that we work with you'll have that conversation which will explain that to you in more detail okay but anyone not just say is it the VA allows you to qualify regardless of what your assets are and I've had people with over a million dollars all apart to his benefit wow so you know you'll hear you only have this much money you can do this do even be close you go qualify and how do you do that though I mean that's what I don't understand we have to reposition the assets that's all it is a means-tested it has a tested benefit but essentially there are legal workarounds and if you know it's basically you together good presentation for the Veterans Administration and that's what we do we help people position assets and coordinate presentation effort to be a student just to kind of make it short I mean his income isn't a thing cuz he's only getting Social Security but he's got assets that it probably between his house and some savings and stuff it's probably you know a little bit over five hundred thousand dollars and I'm wondering if that precludes him from qualifying no no it doesn't especially if he's got a little bit of flexibility how much the house where the house is really not an issue at all yeah if you want to quit them until you have three hundred other stuff okay yeah I'm qualified people would be on seven hundred thousand dollars worth of liquid assets well your issues here are you have about a quarter of a million dollars plus cash the government's going to want him to use his money first if we don't do estate planning which were allowed to do according to the VA parameters okay so what does that mean we're that means is basically a repositioning the assets to where again the software tells us what we can and can't do if I'm just going to give you a kind of hypothetical for example you may be able to reposition reallocate those funds into a trust that junior if you're a junior ologist of you do the trustee of and will not so plus VA benefits a day after by reallocating those funds so that I could qualify I mean they get nineteen sixteen month tax free plus restaurants and be eight months waiting they may get a full check of about almost twenty seven thousand dollars in the funds thereafter come each month to you tax rate

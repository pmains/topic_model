he joins us right now Congressman Andrew Clyde from the great state of Georgia Congressman great to have you on the show well John thank you very much Amanda great to be with you on your show this evening this was an amazing weekend not just for the Optics and the history and all the the passionate debate but at the end of the day when you look at the rules package Americans have so much more transparency so much more accountability than they've had in a very long time I don't think I've seen rules like this and since maybe the time when Newt gingrich's last time there was this sort of people's control of the people's institution how important a victory was this for the American public I think this was a absolutely uh consequential victory for the American people it was necessary we saw the moment we took the moment uh this as you said has is a set of rules it has not been seen in Congress for decades and I think it will bring fundamental transformational accountability to the government we all know that Washington DC has been broken for a long time and I came here to fix it uh the rest of us came here to fix it and that's I think what we're doing with this rules package and holding the speaker and Leadership accountable to make sure they do what they're supposed to do according to the Constitution and I'm really excited about it I think we're going to do great things going forward in this Congress it was a bit of a rocky start but you know that's the way a constitutional republic works and it works for the American people and that's what we did we gave better representation to the American people through this rules package no doubt yes sir and and I think that what transpired and and throughout the whole process what emerged to me was a very Silver Lining which is that you have people different factions with differing opinions within the Republican Party who are willing to stand up for what they believe in as opposed to the other side of the aisle where we have seen for cycle after cycle after cycle the speakership race is not really even a race it's just decided regarding these rules packages and the what I think a lot of Americans want to see as a culture shift not just rules change and mood change but a cultural shift in Congress what are some of those main bullet points that you want to tackle first oh sure number one being the fact that we have a single subject uh bills now and amendments that are that must be germane to the subject so we're not going to have any more omnibuses you know those those terrible things that have tremendous earmarks in them that that are thousands of pages long that's just not going to happen anymore then we've got a mandatory minimum of 72 hours before a bill can come to the floor after its final text is released so members actually have the opportunity to read and debate what's in that bill then we've got regular order which means every bill that goes to the four has to go through the committee process be read and debated in committee and amendments available in committee as well I mean these are just transformational things for congress um and then we've got the amazing Church committee that's in this set of rules or or church style committee that's going to go after the weaponizing of federal agencies against American citizens I'm really excited about that part of it uh I think that's going to um uh just just bring the claws back in from the federal government and it will allow people regular American citizens to no longer have a government that is is using uh the commercial sector to proxy as a proxy to deny first amendment constitutional rights so I this is a great rules package I'm looking forward to uh voting on it tonight and seeing it successfully across the finish line and I'll tell you one one last thing I have seen a speaker in Kevin McCarthy fight you know his last four words of his acceptance speech was I don't give up and you know we saw him fight through 15 of vote series you know I think that's going to terrify the White House and the Senate because we have a speaker now that has shown he knows how to fight and he's going to fight for us yeah no doubt his medal was definitely shown on on display for all of us to see Congressman I want to talk a little bit about the border the president went down there again it was an Optics event it really has no real effect on the crisis affecting our border a lot of people say hey this is a multi-faceted system the president doesn't Force the law the Homeland Security Department doesn't uh or kept it keeps the Border open doesn't allow the Customs border patrol agents to do their job and then there's a third layer of this non-profits collecting lots of federal money often and they're involved in taking the illegal aliens who get into the country and traffic them inside does the new Congress have some plans to address the ngos that are involved in that part of the illegal immigration chain well we certainly have plans to address the Border crisis and that is the Texas border plan is going to come up for a vote that is in our rules as one of the requirements and then you are right about these uh these non-profits like family Endeavors for example uh who had a single Source contract a non-bid contract initially for 86 million dollars and then the next second contract was over 500 million dollars these are things that that I that the oversight committee has not really been able to go after because we were not in the majority we are going to go after these sorts of things and I'm really looking forward to that as well because we are going to expose what the bind Administration is doing to damage uh the security of the American people because if you don't have border security you do not have National Security and President Biden owns every bit of it I was glad that he went to the Border well as you said earlier it got near the border uh today this weekend um and uh but what he really saw I think was just a whitewashed scene he didn't really even get to uh to see what was going on there but I think that was uh probably intentional but it's amazing uh that just a majority party electing a speaker can force the president to do something he hadn't done in 50 years and that it's actually go to the Border yeah great point yes sir Congressman I wanted to ask you about something that a lot of folks are already shuddering over the thought of just a little over three months from now we've got tax day I don't think covet is going to push back that deadline but regarding these 87 000 IRS agents it seems to me that one of the culture shifts on the Republican side of the aisle with you and the majority is that y'all are going to be I don't want to say exploiting utilizing in a creative manner parliamentary procedures that that can be shifted a little things like the whole mineral is that something you guys are ready to implement right away day one on day one the Holman rule is a phenomenal rule again that's in our rules package but the Hoenn rule does is it allows Congress to go and to reduce the funding of an agency and it is so granular that it can actually go down to the individual job description of that agency and we can defund that agency um at at the federal employee level so the Holman rule is going to be a great tool to use in during this particular Congress and I'm looking forward tonight to voting to defund the 87 000 IRS agents yeah a lot of people are sharing that as one of the first actions of this new Congress Congressman you have been a champion of Liberty for a long time and you speak eloquently of the need to protect the core Liberties of this country we see more and more evidence of the censorship that's going on the Homeland Security Department the White House new documents came out this week and showing the Biden White House putting pressure on big tech companies uh where are What are some of the solutions that you think Congress will be able to impose to restore the assurance that our government's not going to go out and try to squash the opinions of everyday Americans in the big Tech space well uh I'm glad you mentioned that because uh just last month I introduced what is called the Free Speech Defense Act and that would eliminate the ability of the federal government to work through these particular um media companies these big tech companies like Google and Facebook and um uh Twitter as a proxy to eliminate the First Amendment rights of American citizens because the government can't do it for the Constitution and they cannot also do it as a proxy working with these companies to do it by proxy and that's what this particular piece of legislation would do I'm looking forward to uh introducing it again in the 118th and maybe we can get it across the Finish Line in this Congress yeah important stuff congresswoman before we let you go we got to talk about China and covet and I know Republicans many of you have expressed interest in digging into the origins of that and not necessarily just Anthony fauci and his support gain of function research but who are some of the other major players who you want answers from as far as coven well I think our intelligence agencies need to pipe up and tell us what they know what has what have they been keeping secret about covet we certainly are going to be um interviewing and uh deposing Anthony fauci and we are certainly going to do the very best in our ability to find what the actual source of covid was uh was it weaponized in a Wuhan lab or or or where where did it come from you know I I think that most of us believe that but we're going to figure out the exact origins of covet and hold China responsible for it too because that's what needs to happen so we've got about 10 seconds left just real quickly declassifying documents will be an important part of that won't it yes it will it absolutely will the American people need to know exactly what happened

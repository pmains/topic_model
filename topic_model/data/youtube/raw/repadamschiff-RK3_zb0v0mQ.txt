joining me now is the highest ranking democrat that mccarthy's threatening intelligence committee chairman adam schiff who is also of course on the january 6th committee and led donald trump's first impeachment um congressman it's no surprise that you're being targeted i suppose for this kind of retaliation but in having covered the house i'm quite surprised given that it is not even parallel to anything that has been contemplated against a veteran member of former chair if you were dethroned as if the republicans take over yeah what's your response well i mean the two are are not disconnected that is what what marjorie taylor green and paul ghost are want uh is really important kevin mccarthy right now um he not only defends the q and on base of his support but he's terrified of losing it uh and so marjorie taylor green is calling for vengeance uh so kev mccarthy uh craven as ever is calling for vengeance um frankly though the the threat i'm more concerned about is ken mccarthy will do whatever donald trump tells him to do uh and far apart from committee assignments that means that kevin mccarthy will uh vote to overturn the next election next presidential election if donald trump loses again he voted to do so the first time he'll vote to do so again only this time if he should ever be in the majority or be speaker he has the ability to carry that out and that is such a real and direct threat to our democracy um kev mccarthy can never allowed to be become speaker and in that sense i think the midterms are really an election at which democracy itself will be on the ballot one final point on this is when you democrats took over uh you didn't remove devin nunes as the ranking republican even though you and he had been adversaries during all the years when he was chair no of course not and you know i think the the break and precedent here is that mccarthy has been unwilling to hold his own members to account as we saw in the past with others whether they were democratic or republican speakers they would hold their own members to a certain ethical standard mccarthy hasn't done that and so it's fallen on the democratic party to uh enforce some ethics involving when members glorify violence or death uh threats against other members or engage in dangerous conspiracy theories or uh racist uh rhetoric or conduct uh but mccarthy has broken that press event uh and will he break other president really depends on what he's queuing on base wants and even more importantly what donald trump wants let me ask you about mike pence because the new york times is reporting that the former vice president is annoyed disillusioned with the committee as it seeks to question him how concerned are you that he won't cooperate because you may well not have the legal tools to try to get him to cooperate well i hope that he'll be willing to cooperate you know i suspect though that his decision won't be based on whether he likes the committee or doesn't like the committee or like something the committee said or doesn't um i think he's trying to figure out politically how it impacts him i don't think that should be the predominant consideration it ought to be what's best for the country mike pence knows that he is a material witness to efforts to overturn the election he was the target of many of those efforts he was the subject of death threats they had a noose erected uh outside the capital of gallus for him because he did his constitutional duty because he refused to capitulate to donald trump's demand that he ignore the constitution and essentially uh decertify the election results so i think he understands very well what's best for the country what he's trying to figure out is what's best for mike pence um i hope it'll do what's best for the country and we're hearing something very different from another republican republican senator mike rounds uh saying that his party should tell the truth about the 2020 election after he was attacked by former president trump in recent days take a listen to senator rounds comments i think as republicans we owe it to tell the truth and i think integrity matters and so in my opinion if we want to keep the confidence of our supporters and our voters then we have to be honest with them and the less than a minute that we've got left uh can you respond to that he's absolutely right uh the truth matters uh integrity matters uh if the republican party is gonna have any future uh it has to get back to being a party of ideas and ideology and not this anti-truth cult of the former president so i think he's spot on uh and i think it will also not only be important for the republican party it's important for the country that both parties be wedded to the truth uh and stop uh tearing down in the case of the republican party um public confidence in our elections because that way leads to political violence as we saw on january 6th adam schiff congressman thanks for sharing with us today we appreciate you

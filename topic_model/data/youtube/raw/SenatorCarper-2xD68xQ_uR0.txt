leadership's been described as keeping out a step when everyone else is marching to the wrong tune and as you introduced your mark last week i couldn't help but notice that it was criticized uh from the left it was criticized from the right and some folks from the press said well what do you think of that and i said well sometimes when good attack from either end of the political spectrum means maybe you've come to a pretty good starting place and i think we have uh and i like to paraphrase the churchill who who uh used to say this is not the end this is not the beginning of the end this is the end of the beginning and i think when we finish our work at the end of this week and i hope to report it out to bill with bipartisan support that it will be the end of the beginning with a lot of work still to still to do i as most of my colleagues know i i go back and forth to uh uh to washington on the train just about every day i go home uh just about every night and before i catch the train at 7 19 train in the morning i usually uh stop at the central ymca and and work out and uh try to work out every day of my life i um drive drove today uh past the wilmington hospital on my way to the y and i tell by the why i was reminded that as i drove by the hospital i was reminded last night that and frankly every night in just about every day of the year every day and night people line up at that hospital use the emergency room they use the emergency room because that's about all they have the care that's provided for them is care that we say is um uh provided for uh for charitable reasons as it turns out we pay for that and every one of us who has health care coverage pays about in this country every one of us pays about a thousand dollars a piece to provide health care for those who who don't have it just anybody i went to the the widest morning i i got dressed and uh went up to the fitness center i i got on one of the bikes and started riding the bike and as i rode the bike i was trying to multitask and i read uh uh got into the new issue of business week and there's just one one little squibble here in the uh it's in the uh executive summary on page five and it says the cost of health you know i'll just read it's real short it says in and what if congress doesn't come through with uh sweeping health care reforms that's the question he goes on to answer his annual health care costs for business will soar 166 percent over the next decade 29 000 per worker says the business roundtable that's even worse than the prior decade when cost shut up by 131 about an hour so after i'd read that uh article in the uh the business week i i was on the train i was on train heading down here and as we passed through newark delaware i looked out the left side of my window and i saw a chrysler plant that i would work for 29 years to keep open it's closed 4 000 people who work there not long ago don't have jobs anymore 12 miles up the road is a gm plan it's closed too it closed three months ago three thousand people who work there don't have jobs anymore either then eventually they may not have health care and it's not just big companies like gm and chrysler going bankrupt there's little companies middle sized companies all over this country they're finding it harder to compete and we need to do something about that a bunch of us did things during the recess where we had listening sessions telephone town hall meetings regular town hall meetings and one of my sessions i had a guy who said to me said you know we have the best health care coverage in in the world and i said uh not to be disagreeable sir but we don't we spend more money for health care than any nation on earth we don't get better outcomes and like senator stabenow has just said 14 000 people going to wake up today with health care coverage won't have it when they go to bed over 40 million people don't have any health care coverage we helped pay for them in places like the wilmington hospital that i went by this uh this morning we've got big companies left and right little companies going bankrupt unable to compete in in the world today and instead of uh trying to figure out what do we do about it too often around here we get caught up in really inflammatory issues that frankly don't contribute much to iranian the goal of the healthcare cost and extending coverage to people who don't have it and making us competitive in the world the death squads assertions of government takeover i'm not interested in that and i think my colleagues know that i wouldn't support that sort of thing issues like abortion bush is not provided for we don't fund abortions in in this legislation somehow saying that we're going to provide coverage to illegal aliens we do just the opposite in this legislation rather than focus on what divides why don't we focus on what unites us and there's plenty in this legislation and plenty that can be added to this legislation that i think will unite i just want to mention some of my colleagues get tired of me talking about being a recovering governor i am and i like to focus on what works and i just want to talk for a couple of minutes about things that actually work to rein in the growth of health care costs and provide better outcomes one of the questions i've been asked a lot this year is why can't we have the same kind of health care coverage that you have senator carper and i say well it's not a bad idea we have a federal employee health benefit plan you know what it really is is a large purchasing pool that eight million of us get to choose from and it's all private plans that we do we choose from our administrative costs three percent of premiums and if we can't get everybody to join that why don't we try to replicate and that's what you've done in creating the the exchanges either on a state-by-state basis or a regional basis maybe by doing on a national basis that works large purchasing pools and a bunch of people on this committee and i aren't on this person on aren't on this committee have been pushing for that for years what else works i went up to cleveland clinic a couple of weeks ago i shared with some of my colleagues what i saw and i gave up i've given all these speeches about the cleveland clinic i literally went to see if actually what they do is what i've been saying as it turns out it's the poo too married up pretty well they focus on primary care and it's not just cleveland clinton it's maya it's geisinger it's intermountain health it's kaiser permanente it's that big co-op in the senator senator cantwell state what's it called group health they all focus on the same thing they provide a great template for us they focus on primary care they focus on prevention and wellness they coordinate care they focus on managing chronic diseases they hold everybody there all their patients have electronic health records they've gotten rid of fee for service the doctor on salary they're basically in business doing the same thing the same way and they get better results they get it for less money what else works well competition can work and i a great example is medicare part d plan the prescription drug program we had a huge fight as some of you recall should we have a a public option in the medicare prescription drug program and what we said is if we end up with states that don't have any competition we'll provide that competition senator snow and i spent a lot of time talking about pushing for fallback plans and that kind of thing we've never had to use the fallback plan in this state in the medicare prescription drug program we have dozens of prescription benefit programs in every state patients like it seniors like it they've been under budget four years in a row what else works well we can do things about defensive medicine we've done it in my state it used to be if doctor is a doctor can't well senator can't well with my doctor i didn't like the uh the uh the work that she did and treating me i used to just go right into court and sewer i can't do that anymore i've got to go before a panel an expert and make my case before i can go into court and dozens of states have done that i like the idea of what they're doing up in the center establishing way in michigan at the university of michigan on sorry works that's a good idea and that there's something wrong i like the idea of trying health courts where the people who serve on the courts are actually doctors or or medical experts i like the idea of saying if somebody follows best practice guidelines that maybe what we should do is is provide them a safe harbor from lawsuits and what we're going to do we can't do it in this committee but i hope a lot of my colleagues democrat and republican who care about this issue who know that uh the fear for defensive medicine sort of feeds the fee for service conundrum that we're into that you'll join me and a number of our colleagues and say let's use the states as laboratories of democracy test what works in some of the states become informed by that and encourage them to be spread to other states reduce the cost of defensive medicine reduce the amount of time we spend in courtrooms on medical malpractice and improve health care outcomes i'm almost done mr chairman what else works we know if we incentivize people to take better care of themselves we can rein in the growth of health care costs a lot of people used to think that safeway was just a supermarket or a grocery chain as it turns out their healthcare delivery system has figured out how to incentivize people to take better care of themselves and they have flatlined their health care costs for 200 000 employees in the last four years it works for them it works in 30 states and there's a bunch of country companies that are doing the same thing and we can learn from them last point what works prescription medic medicines work they don't work for everybody they don't work for people who don't have the ability to to get the medicines they don't work for people actually get the medicines but don't take them and sometimes we've learned by mapping the human genome we've learned that not all of us is made the same god makes us differently some of us in medicine will help some of us it won't help the rest of us and what we have to be smart enough and the center wide and suggested that we do is figure out how to use mapping the human genome figure out which medicines are going to help us we'll spend money on those and which ones won't and we won't spend that money that that will work and it'll help save money last thing i want to say senator enzi's over there i see senator energy he's talking to senator roberts i want him just to look at me for a second uh senator anderson is one of my favorite people here and uh he and i sometimes talk about the 80 20 role explains why he and senator kenny were so successful in getting so much done in the health committee in in recent years so we agree on 80 percent of stuff 20 percent of we don't agree with talking about senator kennedy he said we just described decided to focus on the 80 we agree on we need to do that here and senator and enzi and i also won't try his presiding several years ago he was on the floor and he was talking about his core values he was talking about his core values and i listened to him talk about his core values and i said oh sound like my core values and pretty much here's here's what they are figuring out first of all figure out the right thing to do just do it don't do the easy thing don't do the expedient thing just do the right thing and that's what we're trying to do here second is treat other people the way we want to be treated put ourselves in the shoes the person doesn't have any health insurance coverage the doctors the nurses the companies that are paying for it the taxpayers that are paying for this stuff put ourselves in all their shoes as we debate this legislation number three if it isn't perfect make it better that applies to this legislation it also applies to our healthcare delivery system it isn't perfect we can make it one heck of a lot better the last thing is just just don't give up just don't give up and i left the why this morning the lady said to me mr chairman as i was leaving she said don't y'all start your markup today in the finance committee on health care reform and i said yes ma'am she said i want you to know i'm praying for you and uh i said well that's great and i i said i appreciate that we all appreciate that and i just want you to to keep praying and you know what she said to me she said i'm going to keep praying i want to make sure that you keep working so you make this fix this system and get it right and that's what we're going to do thank you

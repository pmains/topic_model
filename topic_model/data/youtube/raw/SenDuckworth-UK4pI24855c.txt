Thank You mr. chairman Deputy Minister ater wheeler as you know I'm very proud that my state is home to EPA's Region five office which features civil servants who are leaders in the fields of water quality Superfund cleanup and Great Lakes restoration I am however concerned that EPA Regional Administrator Cathy Stepp and other political appointees are working to undermine that important work an ATSDR report published last year indicated an elevated cancer risk in the community of Willowbrook Illinois as a result of being next to a facility that uses ethylene oxide a known carcinogen and at this point I do want to thank you for how accessible you have been to me and to Senator Durbin on this issue and numerous phone calls so that you personally got on meeting with us in person so thank you for how accessible you've been it's been a nice change from your predecessor however recently my office received alarming information alleging that senior political appointees instructed EPA personnel not to inspect any facilities in region 5 that emits ethylene oxide and then yesterday evening when we checked the EPA's own public enforcement tool the Eco tool we found that there has been no ethylene oxide inspection across the country in at least the last six months this disclosure is incredibly disappointing to me the EPA Office of Inspector General should immediately begin an independent investigation into this allegation that political appointees with an EPA are issuing orders to not conduct ethylene oxide inspections will you commit now to joining me and requesting that the EPA OIG initiate an investigation into this public health matter first center I'd like to talk to my staff and find out what is going on there this is news to me so I'd like to know whether or not it's it's accurate before before I go further with that I think we ran the check just yesterday evening after you and I have spoken well you at least commit to issuing a document retention order to all personnel in region 5 and promise to me the EPA will monitor all facilities in my state that emit this carcinogen I know that we are monitoring a number of facilities that that the release ethylene oxide not just in your region but across the country we're looking at all of them the Willowbrook facility that you mentioned we've had a couple of public meetings there where we've discussed the monitoring data with your with with the residents of the community and we're looking at the emissions of other facilities around the country I know that that is taking place whatwhat about issuing a document retention order to all personnel as I will be requesting an IG inspection there if there's an issue there certainly we would want those documents retained but not just for this but for anything we we maintain all of our documents thank you right before the holidays and the government shutdown you announced a release of the administration's long delayed lead action plan I was disappointed to see that this plan walks back earlier goes on eliminating lead exposure in fact the new plan has the objective to reduce children's exposure as opposed to eliminate their exposure in homes and child occupied facilities with lead-based hazards will you commit EPA to the goal of eliminating not just reducing but eliminating lead exposure in children it is certainly our goal to eliminate lead exposure in children and we do want to do that we're moving forward with a number of regulatory programs to accomplish that the lead dust rule that I mentioned earlier are letting copper rule this would be the first time in over 20 years and we're taking would take very seriously LED contamination at Superfund sites around the country thank you we immediately reinstate dr. Ruth ed so who led the office of Children's Health Protection and was abruptly put on leave I'm sorry what were you asking about dr. s will you reinstate her she is on investigative leave because of allegations by her employees and I can't go into more details in a public setting because of personnel issues but be happy to with with the through the oversight function of the committee to brief you I think we have to go through the chairman to do that I want to make sure that my general counsel is involved to go into more detail about the circumstances around that thank you and as somebody called leaks across town have mentioned the state of renewable fuse in this industry in this country is at a turning point and over the last six months we've seen more ethanol plants sowed I don't or closed than ever before meanwhile EPA is granting the world largest refining companies these so-called hardship waivers and my colleague senator Ernst brought this up the issue of these hardship waivers these companies are owning record profits billions with the be the CEOs of these companies have even pointed to the fact that they were able to obtain these hardship waivers on their earnings calls as contributing to their profitability you've promised to finalize a waiver for e15 blends by May 31st will you also promise that you will end this abuse of the hardship waivers by companies like Exxon or Chevron senator the the hardship waiver is based on the refinery itself not the refiner so it's based on the actual refinery and it doesn't matter who the parent company is there could be a hardship at a refinery and Oh what the with the what we want to make sure happens is that just because you're a large company if the refinery is not economical we don't want those shut down because of this program oftentimes these small refineries are located in Rocky Mountains and other areas where they're the only supplier of gasoline in their region so we have to base it according to both the statute and the regulations on the size of the refinery not the refiner the issue we have the Senators time is expired Thank You mr. chairman thank you

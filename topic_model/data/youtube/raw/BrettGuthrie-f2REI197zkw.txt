three thank you I think gentleman for yielding and I think thank you madam Speaker I rise today to bring attention to the consequences of the drug pricing bill HR 3 there is no doubt we must act to lower prescription drug prices for Americans and for Americans only pay their fair share however this bill is not the right path we often hear stories about the way that other countries pay for their drugs in the countries payment systems what you don't often hear about our stories about patients are unable to receive care and access to life-saving drugs because the limitations in their country for Louise Morehouse we have examples of how much fewer offered in these other countries but it's personal for example for Louis Morehouse as a teacher in England hope was in the reach when she enrolled in a trial for coup van a drug used to treat PKU a rare genetic metabolic disorder if left untreated the disease can result in mild to severe neurological issues when Louise was in the clinical trial for coup van she was able to eat and function like anyone else sadly Louise discovered after the trial that the drug that helped her live a more normal life was not covered by the United Kingdom's Health Service despite the agency's acknowledgment of the drugs efficacy as the drug is not covered by the NHS she no longer has access to this drug and has taken return to taking 80 pills a day in conjunction with a highly restrictive diet instead in the United States we have access to innovative drugs and the key word is access when people talk about HR 3 what they they want to say is that we can completely transform the way we pay for drugs and never talk about or never even knowledge the way we completely transform the way we receive and have access to drugs we know that the Congressional Budget Office there's other studies we could lose 100 different cures that are coming down the path so as Americans want relief from the prescription drug prices Americans also want access these innovative drugs President Carter is alive today because of access to one of these experimental drugs that are becoming lower costs and more affordable for everyone my point is that I don't have to be a choice we can have both they're going to have lower prices and not completely lose access to these drugs not lose access to the drugs and continue the great innovation that we have and that choice is HR 19 it's a bill that we'll be able to floor tomorrow get every bit of it is bipartisan every single piece of it as a Republican and a Democrat co-sponsor it is something we know the Senate will take up and the president will sign and give relief to the American people and continue to give access to the great innovations that we have I hope that we can take that bill up tomorrow and thank the gentleman for yielding and I'll yield back

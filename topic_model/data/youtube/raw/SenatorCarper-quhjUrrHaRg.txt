there's I think a lot of misunderstanding about what does term cap and trade actually means first time I ever heard of it was from the President Bush not George Bush George Eliot but to george herbert walker bush he proposed when he was president that would reduce the threat of acid rain which was especially prevalent in the northeastern us redo caused by the emission of sulfur dioxide from coal-fired utility plants and he said let's just put a cap on sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-fired utility plants and then over time gradually we do stacked at that cap set up a trading emissions trading system so that we can find the market forces would actually provide the most cost efficient way to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from from utility plants coal-fired Detroit plans turns out their work one of most effective environmental problems we've ever had in this country was the fight against acid rain and that we did it in a cost of cost-effective ways we've actually had some experience with this fair amount of experience in in York as well don't you see in Europe have you done some things wrong and we will learn from their mistakes

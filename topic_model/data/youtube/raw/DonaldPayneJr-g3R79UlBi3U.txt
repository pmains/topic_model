thank you Miss Kelly we appreciate your comments and in closing I'd like to thank you for co-hosting the special order on criminal justice reform accountability and diversity is through these special orders that we were able to speak directly to our constituents about the valuable work the Congressional Black Caucus does to reduce injustice and promote equality for all african-american communities our criminal justice and police systems in a state are in a state of crisis too often under these systems black lives are treated as though they don't matter we saw this last month when Baltimore's Freddie gray died in police custody from a brutal spine injury such tragedy tragedy zeroed trust between our communities and the police the problem is compounded by a wide range of factors from disturbing gaps in incarceration rates to racial disparities and sentencing we need we need a system that holds criminals accountable and protects law enforcement while at the same time ensuring the safe safety and equal treatment of all communities this includes implementing body cameras in order to promote transparency and accountability while deterring wrongdoing at the same time we need to make sure that law enforcement officers don't resort to discriminatory policing practices it is undeniable that racial profiling remains an ongoing crisis in our nation there is a clear and growing need to ensure robust and comprehensive federal commitment to end racial profiling by law enforcement agencies the end racial profiling act which I proudly support would do just that and it was constructed after at law in New Jersey authored by my uncle Assemblyman William pain which was one of the first the first racial profiling bill passed law passed in the United States is which I'm very proud of and took that idea and have brought in federal across real of course real accountability remains means that we will at times need independent investigations of police related deaths we're glad to see finally attorney general Lynch launched an investigation into the Baltimore Police Department with this with the stated goal of assisting police departments across the country in developing their practices in less than one month on the job attorney general Lynch is already making a difference and we thank her for that as we redirect as we reflect on the dire need for reform of our criminal justice system we need to advance the cause of equality in all contexts this means expanding diversity in the workforce in health and all aspects of life from the mailroom to the boardroom for manufacturing industries to the technology sector many of these challenges we face today are great but as a caucus we remain committed in solving them thank you and with that madam Speaker I yield back the balance of my time

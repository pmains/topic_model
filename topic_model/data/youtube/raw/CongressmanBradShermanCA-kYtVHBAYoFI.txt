this is democratic congressman brad Sherman of California he's a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee welcome sir to be with you nice to have you here should president elect Trump meet with Vladimir Putin ASAP I don't know about ASAP but obviously they should meet at some at some point it's an important country and what do you suppose the conversation will be like well there might be a private thank you but I don't think that'll be reported to the press but we have a host of issues to discuss with the Russians and whether it's Syria Ukraine the Baltic States etc etc you have both the Kremlin and the president-elect describing this this election hack investigation by US intelligence services a witch hunt although it seems that some members of trumps team now say that Russia was indeed behind the hacking so what does that say to you we've known Russia was behind the hacking for many months I'm surprised that there wasn't a reaction against Trump from his own base the only bit of new information now is that the intelligence services are confirming what everybody obviously new which was that not only was Russia behind the tax that was widely reported but that their purpose was to help Trump you look at what they revealed what affected it had the campaign when they revealed it and anybody who'd been in politics for a year or two would say that these leaks were designed to help Trump win Democrats were overconfident and didn't want to rock the boat didn't want to make as big a deal out of this as it was you know something some Democrats suspect Trump himself was was working in cahoots with Russia do you believe that Oh we'll never know i was i would think there's little reason for them to have done a highly dangerous strategy meeting the fact is that in the campaign Trump said things that would have heard him just a little bit with American voters but helped him with the electoral college votes that are controlled in Moscow and Moscow returned the favor the fact that I would assume they didn't do a secret meeting or a secret phone call doesn't change that okay but when you say Moscow control the electoral that's not true though that they don't but look this bit look the Hillary campaign made many errors Trump made many errors there were dozens of factors more important than this in the campaign but had these leaks not come out it's hard to think that Hillary wouldn't have gotten another hundred thousand votes in the Upper Midwest I want to ask you about something along the lines of another topic you know Meryl Streep in the Golden Globe speech did you hear it last night I heard it this morning you heard it this morning okay so she was upset that Donald Trump a seemingly poked fun at that disabled reporter during the primary right and Donald Trump said that you know what I didn't make fun of him that's just absolutely not true that's what he tweeted out this morning Kellyanne Conway said this morning on new day that we should not take Trump literally but she we should know what's in his heart how do you respond to that he made fun of a disabled reporter who had questioned him what was in his heart was a desire to counter-attack anybody who questioned him on any issue and to do so both with legitimate criticisms and mockery of a man's disability that was that's what is in our new president Saar but but but i think what Donald Trump is saying you know I didn't make fun of him and just believe me because you don't know what's in my heart does that make sense to you we will never know what is in his heart but we can judge his actions were he mocked a disabled reporter he mocked him mercilessly continuously and never apologized and if his heart pushes him in the other direction his heart doesn't seem to have much impact on his behavior congressman brad Sherman of California thanks for joining me this morning you're welcome still

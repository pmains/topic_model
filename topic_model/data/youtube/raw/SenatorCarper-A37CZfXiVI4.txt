hey to highlight some recent work that we've done on the Senate permanent Subcommittee on investigations that could help not hundreds not thousands not tens of thousands not hundreds of thousands but millions of Americans save some money while filing their federal income tax returns this year and in future years as the ranking member of the subcommittee called Femina Subcommittee on investigations in the Senate my staff and I work closely with a fellow named Rob Portman Ohio there's a chairman of our subcommittee and with his team if you put us all in a room together senator portman team Republicans are team democrat and wonder who who's who and whose side they're on now you wouldn't know one side from the other sort of like that's working together mr. president on the recycling issues with your team and mine but senator Portman and I study along with our staffing study big problems and big challenges facing America and Americans and we try to identify common-sense solutions in a truly bipartisan almost nonpartisan approach that is characterized the work of the subcommittee not just for a couple of years but for for decades for years I've heard the following question over and over again mr. president you probably have to back home but people in Delaware and I'm sure in your state ask this question why can't you all just work together in Washington and get something done oh that's what we do on our Subcommittee on permanent Subcommittee on investigations we work together and we get I think a lot done it's our bread and butter and I want to talk for a few minutes today about some of the work here on the Senate floor over the past year mr. president our subcommittee has examined a whole bunch of issues but one of those is issues relating to the IRS free file program and earlier this week we released a short staff memorandum laying out our findings over the next a couple of minutes I want to explain the genesis and the importance of the free file program the water subcommittee learned about it and some of the things that Congress and the IRS can do to improve the program and better serve taxpayers I'm surprised I don't know if I back your home state if you do town hall meetings my guess is you thought a bunch of them and I did a bunch of them when I was especially economies and hundreds hundreds of them and as governor and and even now and I used to when I was a congressman we used to every year do we only have three counties in my state you have a lot more in years mr. president but we would have what and what's every year my mother so before tax filing deadlines usually in March I would host townhall meetings in each of our counties and we would invite the IRS to come along with state division revenue to participate and we would offer the people of Delaware the opportunity to ask questions not just of me and my staff but of the IRS and the state division of revenues about tax returns that were being filed and it was it was something I love to do I love helping people like I know my are presiding officer does as well and there was a real chance to help people in a timely way if you take that idea and that was an idea for like the I'll say the 20th century a 20th century idea and a good idea but we have a 21st century idea and it's called a free file program and that's what I want to focus on now so some people might be asking well what in the heck is a free file program anyway and going back to 1998 I was governor then and I think our presiding officer might have been House member I'm not sure but Congress directed the the IRS to work with the tax preparation industry to create a way for Americans to file their taxes electronically and this is around the time that though in the first versions of search engines like Yahoo like Google or being developed and coming forward email addresses and web portals like America online we're rapidly expanding the availability of Internet services not just for homes but for schools and other places too and suddenly it was possible to do a whole lot of things on the internet for the first time including filing our taxes electronically Free File is the program that grew out of a mandate issued and taxpayers were first able to take advantage of the program in 2002 so my guess is the mandate to for come up from Congress to the IRS to make this program available was about two decades ago and the first time that the taxpayers were able to take advantage that was a couple years later in 2002 the program is really a partnership program is really a partnership between the IRS on the one hand and tax preparation companies like like H&R Block and Intuit to offer completes a free online tax preparation and filing service not to all Americans but to most the original target was sixty percent was the original goal original target and today it's available to about seventy percent of all Americans this year most taxpayers earning less than sixty nine thousand dollars can use free file to file their taxes for free that's why we call it free file I'll say that again this year most taxpayers earning less than sixty nine thousand dollars can use free file to file their taxes for free a lot of times when you hear somebody offer you something for nothing for free you say well I'm not sure I'd want to do that this is one that a whole bunch of tax payers about them hundred million of them in fact can take real advantages because according to the IRS over 100 million tax payers are eligible to use this program free file over 100 million tax payers can file their federal taxes for free and one might ask well how they do that all they got to do is to visit this website to get started and the website I'm looking to see where that website is listed I don't see it here may be something the back I don't think it's back there either but I'll just say here it is all you have to do is visit the website to get started on irs.gov forward slash free file that's it that's a mouthful a new IRS gov forward slash free and as look as I as much as I do it this it's as close there it is IRS dot-gov there we go IRS gov forward slash free file I'm blind so there it is and after my staff who prepared this for us thank you from there whoever clicks onto this address can can choose to visit the individual Free File website of one of the companies one of several companies offering this service and choose the one that works best for them it sounds pretty simple even to me but only a few million taxpayers out of a hundred million that are eligible only a few million used the program every year so clearly we can do better than this we started the honor subcommittee looking in the Free File about a year ago after reading news reports alleging that some of the companies participate in the program we're making it harder not easier for taxpayers to find their free file websites and this is important College sentence is important because very few taxpayers go directly to the IRS gov address that I mentioned right here website instead when most taxpayers are ready to file their taxes they use search engines like Google and they type in phrases like free online tax filing or free tax return for search terms like this yeah Google might return thousands maybe millions of results those results could oftentimes be confusing imagine that you're trying to get some information and we get thousands of ideas from you know searching on Google that can often be real confusing or just too much for a lot of us to try to wade through on top of that mr. president we were able to confirm that five of the twelve companies that participated in the free file program in tax year 2018 two years ago that include H&R Block into it tax Hawk Drake software and tax Slayer apparently took steps to actually prevent their free file websites from even appearing in search results so when someone searched on Google last year for free tax help they were likely likely to land on the website for one of the heavily advertised commercial tax filing products some of those commercial products have names that are similar to the names companies have given their free file offerings for example H&R Block has a commercial product called free online and Intuit has one called turbo tax free edition these names sound a lot like the names given to the IRS free file products but they are not the same in fact there is no guarantee that they will actually be free despite their names so I want to be clear mr. president there's nothing wrong with free file partner companies having their own successful commercial products and continuing to innovate nothing wrong with that and I'm told there are legitimate reasons someone might want to prevent a website from appearing in a Google search result however it's important that we make sure not to confuse taxpayers any more than they might already be confused when it comes to preparing their tax returns it's also imperative to senator portman his staff and my staff that the lowest income taxpayers are able to access the free filing services that Congress wanted to be sure we're available for them it's too easy for a taxpayer to click on a search result that looks like a free filing option and wind up being charged for extra services they didn't want and frankly didn't need in fact mr. president Treasury Inspector General for tax administration estimates that more than 14 million taxpayers who qualified for the free file program used commercial software offered by a Free File partner company and may have paid it from fee to file their 2018 federal tax return when do they not need to do so just think about that 14 million taxpayers could have filed their tax or federal tax returns completely free but instead ended up paying a fee and while it's entirely possible puzzle that some of those 14 million people knew they were using the commercial product and chose to pay more many simply didn't know they might have a better option well we have an obligation to make sure they know about it both Congress and the IRS need to do more to make certain the taxpayers who are eligible for a free product and want a free product don't end up paying for something they should not have to pay for it's that simple so how did this happen well we've learned that part of the blame belongs to the IRS which apparently is designed designated rather which apparently is designated only three full-time employees think about that for how many people we have in this country mr. president 300 million plus the IRS has designated only three full-time employees to work on Free File and I'm told to not conducted sufficient oversight over the program for years for example our Subcommittee on investigations learned that the IRS has not completed a customer satisfaction survey for the free file program since 2009 that's 11 years that's right since 2009 even though the Treasury Department's Inspector General for tax administration recommended greater use of customer satisfaction surveys not last year the year before that as far back as 2007 and despite Americans a growing tendency to use search engines like Google to navigate the Internet the IRS and it's free partner companies apparently never discuss online search practice until very recently this allowed individual companies to make their own choices about how their Free File websites could be accessed there's also the fact that the IRS has not had a marketing budget for a fee file program in more than six years when we asked IRS officials to explain the lack of marketing they told us a couple of things here's one of the things we heard they said well this is a quote it may have been an IRS budget decision as part of the broader reduction in spending the agency received over the last several years and it says as a part of the broader reduction in spending actually it was the broader reduction in appropriations the agency receives over the last several years the Treasury Inspector General for tax administration came to pretty much the same conclusion and here's what we got from the Inspector General the Treasury the IRS was trying to quote save money and be more efficient well mr. president we should make sure that we save American taxpayers money no doubt especially at a time when every dollar counts for a family and frankly for our government with that said what can Congress do what is our role here in the Senate in the house and the Congress and then they had the White House the executive branch of argument Treasury as senior members of the Finance Committee Senator Portman I have listened to former IRS Commissioner John Koskinen a great guy great leader and to the Government Accountability Office led by Gene Todaro a wonderful Controller General we listen to them lament the fact that for years for years Congress has appropriated the IRS with far less money than it needs to provide adequate tax enforcement and good customer service as well as to better ensure that all federal taxpayers are paying their fair share to fund our government and meet our many obligations despite a recent bump up and funding for the IRS in the past year since fiscal year 2010 it's over the last decade funding for the IRS overall has declined by 3.1 billion dollars after accounting for inflation while the number of individual taxpayers is increased by 13 million dollars that makes no sense to me and my guess is it doesn't make much sense to most people let's listen again funding for the IRS it's our job is to appropriate money among other things funding for the IRS overall is declined by over three billion dollars after accounting for inflation while the number of individual taxpayers who need to be served whose have questions to ask and tax taxes or returns to submit and that numbers gone up by 13 million people these IRS budget cuts have been paired both tax enforcement and taxpayer service operations for example reduced funding has led to a reduction in the number of employees assigned to answer telephone calls the inevitable result is fewer taxpayer calls answered longer wait times to get through to the IRS representative and a lot of needless frustrations from the people that we and the IRS are serving the people that sent us here to work for them and all of this was before the corona virus pandemic forced the IRS to send thousands of its employees home so as I prepare to wrap up here today mr. president let me say to all of our colleagues those that are gathered here and those that are not our colleagues both here in the Senate and in the house representatives the other end of this building while it's important we asked why the IRS did not do a better job of we're seeing the free file program and make clear that it must do more it's equally important that we in the legislative branch of government and in the administration this administration and future administrations provide the IRS with the tools and resources it needs to do the important job it does the last time the IRS had a marketing budget for the free file program it's been between $750,000 in 1.5 million dollars marketing the program annually to guys probably 200 over 100 million will set close to 200 million taxpayers that sounds like a lot of money but when you're talking about over 100 million taxpayers it doesn't go that far and while I'm sure that's a big I'm not sure that's a big enough budget mr. president given a large number of taxpayers seem to be unaware of Free File even a modest amount of fun would go a long way toward ensuring that millions of eligible taxpayers do not have to pay a dime to file their taxes online well colleagues my Safran mark my other colleagues all often hear me say the orc I think they're called aphorisms and one of my favorites is find out what works and do more of that think about that we'll find out what works do more that well mr. president we've found out on our subcommittee how we can strengthen and support this free file program let's do it lesson shall talk about it let's not just complain about it let's do it and let's begin by doing our part and provide this year and in the years that follow the IRS has resources and needs and were necessary the additional guidance it needs to make Free File work the way we intended it to work almost two decades ago another thing I'd like to say mr. president is in adversity lies opportunity think about that in adversity lies opportunity wished I could claim that as my own that's Einstein in the midst of the corona virus pandemic the filing deadline for taxpayers has been pushed back as we know to July 15 not April 15 a month or a month and a half ago but July 15 here's what that means it means we have taxpayers have we have more time to get the word out IRS has more time to get the word out to eligible Americans that they can file their taxes for free more time to get the word out through eligible Americans that they can file their taxes for free get the word out to home to tens of millions of American taxpayers I want to encourage all actual eligible taxpayers to visit irs.gov forward slash free file right here IRS gov forward slash free file to ensure that they have access to the free resources that are available to them and I'd also ask everyone to help spread the word talk to your friends talk to your family when you coop up at home and you can't go anyplace still lockdown or quarantine why what are you talking about we'll talk about free file you say here's a way we can maybe save some money and our friends could too instead of taking a different course so that's it I'll close up with this mr. president I like new movies and I know the presiding officer like the movies and one of my all-time favorite movies and Siddhartha colleague who's joined us from Alaska one of his all-time favorite movies talked about it many times is back to the future and the this is in a way back to the future like back when I first got to the house we used to do as I said before senator Sullivan senator Cruz came to fight you should talk about that the every year we do two in my every one County in Delaware there's only three counties we actually do a town hall meetings and we have folks in from the IRS and from the state division revenue actually help people file and prepare and file their taxes and we don't do that anymore but actually we have something that's even better a whole lot better and this is free for our program if the IRS has it available if people just knew about it I'll close with Lea these words I wish I could claim this as well but here I don't know who said this but maybe one of our smart if we had pages here I'd asked one of the pages to figure it out Greta everyone's saying if a tree falls in the forest and there's nobody there to hear it is there really a noise think about that the tree falls in the forest there's nobody there Eddie here is they're really annoyed well if we got a great program through the IRS said to tell people millions and millions of people filing taxes for free and they don't know about it is there really a benefit and they arguably not we can do something about that let's do it

we have a program that you helped us fund to the Air Force Research Lab and the American makes which is the additive manufacturing Institute in Youngstown Ohio and a partnership with the University of Dayton and Youngstown State University to help figure out how to 3d print parts for the Air Force this is obviously a very cutting edge program in this McCollum brought up capacity with our bricks and mortar also with energy savings I think this is a huge opportunity for us to save the taxpayer money save your your budget money and help bring our country into a new wave of innovation and in technological advancement that could spur whole new industries like the Defense Department has done so many different times over the course of its history so if you could talk a little bit about what your further plans are maybe in additive manufacturing to help with reducing costs and and where the Air Force wants to go with that if you could talk about that for a minute and then I have just a one quick follow-up question on writings so I'd like to just begin congressman by associating myself with everything you just said I mean we do think that there's great potential in this we intend to keep with it I can't give you more full details at this point but certainly could do so for the record God let me give you the the most excited person I have met yet about the concept of 3d printing was a spare for Special Operations aviator who is responsible for maintenance and places remote places on the African continent in the southwest Pacific places where we chase bad guys his idea is printing spare parts for airplanes of a 3d printer and he has already got the concept figured out how they're going to do it how much he thinks it will cost what he will be able to not pack into the load out that they carry how much weight that will save especially when they have to carry it from a location that where they can land a bigger airplane and then ruck it into a smaller location this guy can't wait for this to be proven to the point where he can put one into a some kind of big case and carry it in somewhere to use it to fix airplanes that come in and meet him on the ground I think do their mission this is an exciting technology and technologies like this or the lifeblood of a service that is born from technology we love this stuff great well thank you and mr. chairman I'd loved it take anybody from the committee would like to vacation in Youngstown Ohio to come see what's happening in the additive manufacturing space in the country

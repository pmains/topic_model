joining me now congressman tim ryan of ohio congressman do you think the government response has been adequate to this particular outbreak this particular potential outbreak well it seems it has been and we have some of the best uh public of officials some of the best public health experts i should say uh involved in this scenario we have the united states military going over there helping uh to try to set up camp and basically build public health infrastructure so this is a very difficult task and i find it very ironic that the very uh political party and politicians who are criticizing every single step every single move that's being made as i said some of the best public health officials in the world are the same people that voted to cut you know over 500 million dollars from the center for disease control budget over the last four or five years over 440 million dollars from the national institutes of health it could be doing potential research on on these kinds of issues to help solve these problems you know the cdc is about a billion dollars less in preparedness money than they had i think in back in 2002 so these folks are lobbying these criticisms at the administration and at the cdc they're the very ones that cut the budget sure and when i said a potential outbreak i was referring of course here in the united states of america we know there's a outbreak there in africa or west africa can we do more and what would you like that to be well i i think first of all beefing up uh the budget for the cdc and doing more research at nih and in partnership with the cdc to try to solve some of these problems we've got to rebuild our public health infrastructure here in the united states and it's not as easy as saying okay planes can't come in from from africa into the united states we'll just you know maybe build another wall and hope that that fixes the problem and it seems these simple solutions um don't work and michael the real issue here is there's been a disinvestment in the public health infrastructure in the united states you take any issue whether it's the infrastructure in the united states disinvestment from the public side and roads and bridges and airports water lines sewer lines combined sewer we need to rebuild the united states decimation of the public health infrastructure here in so many different ways as i mentioned the cuts at the cdc and the national institutes of health you also take the issues that we have with food daily we're seeing recalls whether it's beef or beef jerky just in the last couple of days there's food is getting recalled all the time we have three thousand people die a year for foodborne illnesses about 128 000 people go to the hospital because of it so all of these issues are signals to us as a public you know what are you gonna do with your big tax cut if you're in the top uh one percent uh if you get ebola you know right i think we need to reevaluate what we're doing here as a country and there are certain investments that we have to make and so i think beef up the cdc let's invest in the research and development let's rebuild our public health infrastructure all across our states and reinvest back in the united states in the other ways as i said roads and bridges and some of the other things that we have to do sure well the conservatives attacking president obama's response uh to the outbreak are all prospects for 2016. do you think that using a medical emergency for political gainsmanship well i you know it i i want to say no i can't get into their heads but it at every single turn no matter what the president says they're lobbying criticisms positioning themselves we see it in foreign policy it used to be politics end ends at the water's edge and we all get behind the president and support them you have this issue here it'd be nice to support the president for a major uh global public health initiative if they want to do something and be supportive look look for example michael with the the surgeon general nominee vic murphy november 2013 she was nominated we still don't have a surge in general because of the politics that these folks are playing in the united states senate kaboshing her nomination eminently qualified to hold the position so it does seem at every turn they're they're making criticisms of the president to score political points meanwhile we have a public a global public health crisis here right fox news host and former governor mike huckabee says he can't trust government response to ebola listen to this i'm feeling a little sick myself but it's not ebola i'm just sick of a government that i'm paying for telling me not to worry and just trust them i wish i could but if they repeatedly lie to me i just don't believe them anymore what's your reaction to that statement from a former government official well here you go this is this is the republican uh play they're they're one trick pony they cut these the budgets of these agencies like the center for disease control over 500 million dollars in the last four years they cut the nih budget by 440 some million dollars in the last four or five years and then they turn around say look they can't do their job you know this was the same issue when wall street collapsed they completely defunded the regulatory arm that was supposed to be watching wall street and then they turned around and said look the government doesn't work you know i think the american people are catching on here you can't touch cut the budget and then say boy they can't do the job you know and that's basically what they do and i think it's completely irresponsible from governor huckabee who who you know i think as a governor recognizes that the government and there are public investments that need to be made and he should understand that better than most but again he's making money and and scoring political points and and they'll get another book deal and he doesn't really care doesn't seem to care you know what the effects are to the american people or the public health of our some of our fellow global citizens in africa and around the world all right congressman tim ryan thank you so much for joining us here tonight

Thank You mr. Speaker I am an original co-sponsor of HR 642 a bill that would help the men and women in our armed services who are victims of sexual assaults get access to the care that they need sexual assault is not acceptable anywhere in our society it's not something many people like to talk about but it is a very real problem according to the Department of Defense 20,000 service members said they had experienced at least one incident of unwanted sexual contact in 2014 in my time as an emergency medicine physician I have seen the deep long-lasting and brutal psychological trauma that results from sexual assault and I know how critical it is that victims receive the treatment they need and perpetrators are brought to justice this bill takes much-needed steps to ensure that treatment options are more accessible for our veterans who are victims of sexual assault by helping to pay for travel expenses for those who need to see care outside of the VA system this is a medical need and moral imperative I urge all my colleagues to support HR 642 and ensure service members who are victims of sexual trauma receive the care they need I yield back the balance of my time gentleman storms

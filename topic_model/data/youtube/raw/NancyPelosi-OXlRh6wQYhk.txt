welcome back everybody my guest tonight spent four years as speaker of the house making her the highest ranking female politician in american history sorry queen latifah please welcome congresswoman nancy pelosi thanks for being back it's always good to have a formidable adversary to be talking to across the table all right we meet again my old nemesis hello my friend hello we are not so different you and i we both have our agendas let's talk about the last one you tried to push on my show the last time you were here we came to a meeting of the minds and you had something called the disclose act where you would try to get politicians to disclose all the donations to their uh to their associative pacs or 501c4s in return i said i would help you if you would get more people more members of congress to be part of my better know district series i upheld my end of the bargain you upheld your end of the bargain we proved that people can do things across town across the aisle what are you what what are you pushing tonight what nefarious northern california san francisco value are you pushing on the nation tonight tonight i'm pushing uh our agenda a middle-class jump start at the heart of it is when women succeed america succeeds okay that's implying no offense madam listen no no offense madam but that is implying that women are the middle class what about the men in the middle class haven't you just emasculated them no we're just getting we're getting to that but what we're saying is the best thing we can do to grow our middle classes is unleash the power of women equal pay for equal work raise the minimum wage affordable child care going on to men uh invest in education to keep america number one and and third keep jobs here in the u.s with good tax policy instead of sending overseas and build roads bridges infrastructure broadband in our country so that all americans can participate in our prosperity in an economy that works for everyone not just the privileged few okay we will get to the fact that you're engaging in class warfare in just a moment you just did it you just fired a shot across my bow you can't deny that all right how will you get it done though because nothing gets done in washington nothing gets done in washington right how can you possibly get this done what are you going to use do you have naked photos of john boehner doing something how could you possibly get because the republicans you got the mental image and if you do and if you do is the tan uniform no all right how could you possibly get it done win the election all we need are 17 votes to take back the house for the american people or for the democracy for them for issues that help them meet their needs but that would make you speaker of the house again probably somebody some democrat yeah yeah some so some democrat wearing a blue linen suit who cares who it is why would you ever want that job again john boehner is on the edge of a nervous breakdown he looks like he's going to burst into tears isn't that a hard job that's an incredibly hard job to hold isn't it well when we did we were able to pass the affordable care act we were able to reform wall street have wall street reform we're able to save millions of acres of of green acres in america good things about jobs about health care about education about working for the american people i didn't love being speaker but i liked getting the job done for the american people can you stick around for a moment more because we've got to take a little break but i want to talk to you about a couple other things all right all right we'll be right back with nancy pelosi please stick around we're here with representative nancy pelosi now uh before the break uh by the way is it is it speaker pelosi is it leader pelosi what should i call you nancy nancy okay uh i want to be respectful while i attack you for attacking the middle class okay no no i'm promoting the middle class okay what's that i forgot what was the name of the thing you're talking about class jumpstart okay when will you start jumping on the middle clock they're jumping for the middle class are you going to raise taxes on guys like me no we're people guys like me make millions of dollars a year are you going to raise taxes let's talk about this we what we have in our initiative is to stop giving tax breaks to corporations that shipped for shipping jobs overseas instead give tax breaks to keep good paying jobs you know i'm a corporation i'm a corporation that's attacking me yeah i'm a corporation and this entire show was written in malaysia and we'll go and we're going to grow we're going to build uh roads bridges broadband water systems by closing tax loopholes for special interest in the tax code let's talk about a couple other issues real quickly here immigration why do you think obama is encouraging all these children to come to the united states what's his plan what's his grift here you guys are going to register these eight-year-olds from guatemala to vote right you know i know you're a very devout catholic i wish you would read the bishops the catholic conference of bishops report they talk about the baby jesus being a refugee from violence as an example and they and they didn't have they didn't vote for the pharaoh in those days okay but the fact is this is a humanitarian crisis and and it needs a humanitarian response it also needs a response that says if you have a a well a legitimate claim for refugee status or or asylum that's one thing if not you're going back home but let's do that expeditiously and let's do it with respect for the dignity of each of these people so you launched uh middle class jumpstart is that what it calls jumpstarter middle class jump start last week uh um when will it be law well let me just say this while we were announcing it on steps of the capital waving the american flag about the middle class and all who aspired to it the republicans were inside with a hearing to sue the president of the united states for enforcing the law well that why why shouldn't you do that why they wanted the president to roll out the affordable care act you know as swiftly as they always have wanted what they wanted was 50 times they voted to repeal the affordable care act but they're talking process we're talking progress we're talking jobs they're talking uh lawsuits if the president is being a tyrant what choice do they have but to take him to court obama can always counter sue everyone in washington can get mobbed up with lawyers and will let judge judy decide the entire thing well thank you so much for joining me house democratic leader nancy pelosi we'll be right back you

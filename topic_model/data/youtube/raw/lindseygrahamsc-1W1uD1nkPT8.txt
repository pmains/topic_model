this time Republican lawmakers going straight to Secretary of State John Kerry demanding more information about Benghazi and there's more oversight chair committee aissa issuing subpoenas for State Department documents Senator Lindsey Graham joins us greetings sir good evening well for starters we've got tonight that Darryl ice congressman chair the committee am has sent a letter this time directly to the Secretary of State asking for information saying that they are with all the states withholding documents it does this have any impact does this even move the cause forward to get these documents well if our secretary Kerry I would cooperate with committee fully the only thing we ever learned about Benghazi the IRS the AP the subpoenas whistleblowers the media the Congress just pulling things out like pulling teeth so the subpoena is designed to get all the documents around who changed the talking points the hundred emails that were released by the White House lead up to the Saturday meeting there was a meeting in the White House saturday before Susan Rice came on the sunday shows on the sixteenth of sep tember were that at Debbie's meeting an interagency meeting with White House personnel present that led to the talking points being changed who was in that meeting and what did they talk about we still have no idea who was in that meeting and how the talking points got changed well you would think that surgery State Kerry Wood really jump on this for the simple reason is that you know is it he has nothing to do with this absolutely nothing Secretary of State in January and this is something that's a distraction for his department and he can sort of just you know very quickly put this behind of get the answers make everybody happy least visa V the State Department and move on well what do we want to know we want to know how the story have Benghazi got so distorted how Susan Rice came up with such a bizarre story disconnected with the facts why doesn't the White House give us the sep tember 12th memo from Beth Thomas where she told everybody in the White House in the State Department I just told the president Libya the was an al-qaida-inspired affiliated group attack the best joke consulate yeah Beth Jonesy I rock yeah why don't we why don't we have that at the end of the day what do we want to know we want to know how the story Benghazi got so distorted I want to hear from the survivors I've written secretary Kerry I've written the CIA please make available to the Congress and the American people those who survived the attack in Benghazi so they can tell us what happened and we can learn from this we're being stonewalled and I wish my Democratic colleagues will show a little interest in trying to find out what happened in Benghazi well the thing that I think has been effective against the Republican Party and Republican members are looking for this is the fact that they have surrendered a hundred pages of emails but what what's often not is it is what they haven't surrender it's a huge gap in time that's what you don't have and it's like you know you know if they want you just to go away just to give it you now they do say that they've given you 25,000 pages of documents have access to it is that true yeah I don't know how many pages are given us but nine months after the attack have you heard from one survivor why don't they make available the people live through this debacle call Benghazi why don't they tell us who was president for white house on Saturday who and who suggested the talking points be changed we don't know anything about what the President did that night is there no one you can subpoena in the government and ask them the simple question who is there who are the survivors and then go after the survivors yourself me can't you it's going to take it a Senate but in the house yeah they could you could you could do that and for the most transparent administration the house doing that that would be the simple way to get it I don't know why the commander in chief will not share with us the details of his leadership on sep tember of eleventh we know everything he did in the bin Laden raid we have photos of him watching television being an in-control on top of the situation commander in chief I don't even know when he went to bed I'm not going to stop until we hear from them survivors and the president accounts for his leadership before during and after all right with 30 seconds left Victoria Nuland who is a spokesperson at the State Department and serves you see her name surface a couple times right she has just been nominated for a new job do you intend to ask her all these questions that you're not you know in a will you get a chance to I should say and William yes and I won't be on the committee but she'll be asked she suggested that the original talking points by the CIA that said clearly it was a terrorist attack on ok al Qaeda affiliate and if they had been warned about previous attacks she pushed back because she didn't want the State Department to be blamed by Congress she said but she told me personally she has no idea who changed the talking points the last time she saw the talking points was on Friday night they got changed saturday at the White House who was at the White House what did they talk about and how did the talking points get changed that's what I want to know well senator thank you very much and I suggest you tell your friends on the house side of the hill to use subpoena is to get them to get someone who knows who are the survivors and just ask that person under oath lingard the survivors that would be the easy way to do it but yeah and secretary Kerry should make it easier for us all just by volunteering to have these people come forward senator thank you sir thank you

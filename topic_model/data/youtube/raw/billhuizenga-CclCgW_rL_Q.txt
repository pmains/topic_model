Michigan Thank You mr. chairman and I rise today this evening I guess to offer an amendment along with the gentlewoman my friend miss Hahn from California to ensure that the federal government meets its obligations to our ports our harbors and frankly to the American people just last year this body overwhelmingly passed the water resources reform and development act worn out by a vote of 412 24 and it was later than signed into law by President Obama warden includes a glide path to increase harbor maintenance funding to a level collected through the harbor maintenance trust fund tax directing Congress this fiscal year to spend sixty-nine percent of all the funds collected from the user fee of that harbor maintenance now that's just sixty-nine percent this year with a ten-year glide path and we're pleased that we're going to be able to use all of that funding for its intended purposes but while I was hoping to achieve full expenditure for the trust fund right away I was willing to compromise on this glide path as a step in the right direction unfortunately the water this the current version of the energy and water bill falls short of the mark by just over 36 million dollars I'd like to thank the chairman for working with us on a bipartisan I should say bicoastal way my west side of Michigan the west coast of michigan we've got the west coast of the country with California but the finding a bipartisan solution to hit the target and offset the costs by reducing spending elsewhere we can hit this war at a target and we believe that this will ensure 140 federally maintained commercial and recreational ports and harbors in the Great Lakes are adequately maintained these federal harbor channels like pentwater white lake ludington Muskegon Holland and grand haven in my district are the lifeblood of these very communities let's keep our promise to these communities and to the taxpayers who support this and allow their ports and harbors to be engines of economic growth and create jobs for American workers farmers and manufacturers again thank you for working with us mr. chairman and with that I reserve the balance of my time general reserve but

well good to be with you and um I want to hear from the president tonight and I know I'm not going to be disappointed that part of having a robust democracy is freedom for all and what we have seen is a republican attack on women and making US second-class citizens by denying the fundamentals of who gets to choose when and if to have children and taking politicians opinions and putting them in the place of our doctors our faith and our families needs what are you hearing from your constituents because it seems to me that the um that the Republicans have kind of misfired on this I mean there are a lot of people who are not just Democrats who are not just women that when jobs went down and and and this ability you know there were men and there were Republicans who were like I am used to these rights for my mother my sister my you know and I don't understand I I don't agree with them going away and as a result it appears this issue is more Universal there is such broad support with the American people they understand that Reproductive Rights are tied to their basic freedom and that's why we saw ballot questions in Kansas Montana Kentucky fail but it hasn't stopped House Republicans one of the first bills they put on the floor was further restrictions on women's right to reproductive Justice and now that 14 states have denied abortion care that is 18 million women who can't receive the care they need we are seeing those effects and very real life and death situations this has huge implications for Women's Health and for women's place and they're doubling down let me let me talk to Dr Hamlin here who one of those States is Mississippi you worked at Jackson's Women's Health Organization and you no longer can travel to give care to patients in Mississippi because of jobs tell me first of all what your reaction was to that what you're hearing from potential patients and now what you're doing to try and continue your work uh yeah I mean I think you know as she said it is you know all encompassing it's not just a lack of access to uh legal abortion but it's also you know it affects the uh Obstetricians there and how they can provide care to their patients um it affects how you manage a miscarriage um I mean it really affects you know all of Women's Health Care um and we know that wealthy women will just go where they need to go so it you know clearly is but for women who can't afford to go where they need to go um are there situations real life situations now where a miscarriage is not being where the mother's life is in danger because a miscarriage cannot be handled correctly or women uh who are in young girls who are victims of rape or for whatever reason need an abortion and cannot get one oh absolutely um and you know at what point is a woman's life at risk I mean they do have an exception for the risk to the mother but at what point is that is that you know does it have to be 50 does it have to be a potential risk um yes so women are getting inferior care as a result so you're going to continue your work how are you doing that um so I'm applying for a uh you know as the work I'm applying for a North Carolina license and I expect to get that you know within in the month as well as just being an advocate in Massachusetts to the extent I can as well as you know just spreading the word because I think a lot of people aren't aware of the dire situation appreciate the work you're doing Jen sockey has a question Jen uh thank you so much and Congressman Clark I wanted to ask you just about as you look ahead we've been talking a little bit about hecklers tonight and what we expect frankly a little bit from the other side of the aisle and I just wanted to ask you how all of you are going to handle that in the house chamber tonight if there are moments when Republicans are heckling only some of them or even not standing up where moments on moments where there are things that really the American people broadly support frankly like access to abortion care you know we're going to continue to be the the caucus the members of Congress that take this seriously we are on team American people and I think you can see from the chaos that was around um the speaker's race that we are going to be there we are going to continue to fight for women for Reproductive Justice for an economy that works for everyone and we are going to conduct ourselves with the seriousness of the challenges and opportunities facing the American people and we're going to let the other side do what they feel they need to do and I think you can see from the first five weeks of the majority that we have been seeing bills that are political stunts and not helping move the agenda forward and so tonight with my guest Dr Hamlin we are reminding people that this is the Republican House Majority that voted against codifying Roe that voted against access to birth control that voted against the right to safely travel across state lines to receive health care if that isn't chilling I don't know what is and we are going to continue to fight for great jobs lowering costs and saving our planet and making sure that freedom isn't an abstract but applies to every single family and woman in this country

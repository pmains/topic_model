friend from South Carolina for yielding time and Mr Speaker I just want to madam Speaker I apologize madam Speaker I want us to take a moment and reflect tonight reflect where our country has been and where our country's going you know I think about my grandparents who grew up in a home that didn't even have electricity didn't have running water and even my parents were young when they got electricity in their home matlin speaker it was just a hundred and fifty years ago when the main source of energy in this country was wood fuel we have come a long ways in this country we've seen a better way of life we've seen nicer things because of the technology and innovation that we've had in this country and our energy policy should be the same energy policy that got us to where we are today because we've got a bright future ahead and that energy policy is simply to provide the cleanest energy possible for the lowest cost possible we shouldn't discriminate against energy sources energy is energy it's it's carbon atoms it's hydrogen it's the energy that we have that we convert to things like electrical energy and just because one energy is viewed as dirtier than another energy doesn't mean that someday that energy can't be clean energy if we look at recent developments it wasn't long ago that natural gas was an experience in any expensive form of energy it wasn't an abundant supply but through technology we've been able to release vast amounts of natural gas across our country matter of fact we're seeing a lot of coal plants converted to natural gas not because of regulatory requirements but because of economic benefits of burning natural gas clean natural gas that we know the controlled technologies to very high combustion rates and also the ability to capture the the NOx or nitrous oxides that are released from burning natural gas it wasn't that long ago that we didn't think we had enough natural gas but because of great technology we can experience an environment here in the United States where our carbon emissions are actually dropping and we shouldn't punish one energy source over another energy source but we should strive to use technology to make energy as low cost and as clean as possible and we can do this whether it's renewables solar wind biomass all of those are valid sources of energy energy that we can hopefully learn how to capture it to distribute it in a manner that people can enjoy it all across the country and in a way that gives consumers reliable supplies at a low cost with this we will see our economy continue to grow we will see our quality of life improve and it's really not something that should be partisan or that we should argue about simply to provide clean energy at a low cost let's look at transportation fuel some are in favor of doing away with all fossil fuels and transportation so what would that do to our environment if we look at global emissions across the world the United States is responsible for 15% of carbon emissions throughout the world so if we looked at it that a little bit closer and break it down on transportation fuels transportation fuels account for 27% of carbon emissions in the United States so 27% of 15% it's only about 4% so if we did away with all gasoline all diesel fuels got rid of all combustion engines if we did away with jet fuel with ships if we took fossil fuels out of every four form of transportation in the United States it would wreak havoc on our economy it would wreak havoc on our way of life and it would only reduce global carbon emissions by around four percent there's a better smarter way to do that let's take the abundant energy that we have less apply our wonderful research facilities the great minds and innovators that we have in America we can figure out how to use all of our energy sources in a low-cost clean way and we can all continue to experience a brighter future ahead I want to thank my colleague for hosting this this time too not where we can hopefully get some of the the common sense and the facts about energy out on the table and just remember low cost and as clean as possible and that's a winning formula for American energy I yield back and I think the gentleman from Arkansas and

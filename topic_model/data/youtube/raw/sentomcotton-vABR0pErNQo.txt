let's bring in Republican senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas a member of the Senate armed services committee so okay that's the first time probably won't be the last what's going on it's good to be in studio with y'all you know North Korea oftentimes fire these missiles in a bid to extract concessions unfortunately Joe Biden because he has been so weak over the last two years has suggested to Kim Jong-un he might Grant those kind of concessions uh the answer to these provocations is as it always has been more defense spending more money for missile defense but liberal democrats for decades have opposed missile defense they'd rather lose leave us defenseless because they think it's too provocative to try to protect America from such Rogue dictators this happened on just about every day now and you get the alerts out of Seoul South Korea to get the alerts out of Tokyo Japan doesn't seem to be an end to this it only appears to be escalating yeah again I think Kim Jong-un like Vladimir Putin last year after the Afghanistan Fiasco has taken the measure of Joe Biden and thinks that if he keeps the pressure up that eventually he can receive concessions from from Joe Biden well the other thing is is that on yesterday we had Saudi Arabia letting us know in the U.S that they're on high alert after Intel that they have about an imminent Iranian attackers The Wall Street Journal headline and then they also go on to say Saudi said Tehran wants to distract from local protests and the National Security Council said the U.S is prepared to respond so are we prepared to respond and as part of that you know with these discussions with the Iranians why not any of these Snapback sanctions well I certainly hope so you know I write in my new book Only the Strong that progressives like Joe Biden and Barack Obama habitually side with our adversaries like Iran and they undermine our allies and partners countries like Israel and Saudi Arabia that's the maybe the simplest part of foreign policy is to stand with your friends and against your enemies but we've emboldened Iran for years under Barack Obama and Joe Biden by rewarding them with hundreds of billions of dollars of sanctions relief and negotiations and their nuclear program which is accelerating which is undermined competence in American leadership and the american-led security order in places like Saudi Arabia and Israel the problem is Iran is better equipped than they've ever been yeah I mean they have drones that they're selling to Russia right yes so why not the Snapback sanctions on them we should well one we should have never tried to re-enter the Iran nuclear deal uh even Joe Biden hasn't been able to achieve that though because the Iranians think they can keep getting a better deal from him because he's projected so much weakness and as we see now in Ukraine with the Iranian drones that Iran has supplied Russia Iran is capable of striking oil refineries in Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates which only is going to lead to higher prices here at home again this all gets back as I explained in my book Only the Strong to democratic presidents like Joe Biden and Barack Obama undermining our allies overseas while they support and Grant concessions to our adversaries another topic here sorry Dan it's just breaking right now from the White House Joe Biden is going to deliver a speech tonight from Capitol Hill sometime this evening I don't have a direct time uh that'll talk about democracy being under attack um the phrase is democracy is on the the ballot come November 8th next Tuesday I I know it's fresh but you're reading yeah well I I've heard a lot about Democrats worrying on threats to democracy I think Democrats are mostly worried about threats from democracy because in six days the American people are going to repudiate their ideological agenda um I think we're going to have a big victory when back both the house and the Senate because the American people are tired of worrying about how they're going to feed their kids and fill up their gas tank and Heat their homes and pay their rent and whether they can take their kids to a park or whether they have to worry about being the victims of crime that's the direct result of the Democrats ideological agenda and the American people are going to repudiate it and the Democrats are worried about their threats from democracy not threats to democracy who do you think his audience is tonight well since Congress is not in session we're not on the campaign Trail I don't know I mean maybe they're going to have to Rouse down all the homeless encampments uh around the capitol they spent a gazillion dollars on abortion ads and you do see in polls this uh question about are you concerned about threats to democracy which I think is a question that could go to either if you're a conservative or a liberal you might be concerned about threats to democracy but this seems like quite a Hail Mary pass yeah I mean you could say that I'm worried about Democrats undermining the legitimacy of the Supreme Court by trying to pack it and signaling out by name Supreme Court Justices that have been later targeted by left-wing Hitman for assassination um the the reason why I think the Democrats are focused on things like abortion or threats to democracy is they don't have anything else to say you're starting to see the early recriminations from Democrats saying well we should have had a more unified economic message well what would their message have been we spent trillions of dollars in caused this inflation or unifies crime message well let me ask you so they keep saying that Republicans want to cut Social Security and Medicare do you no of course not in fact the only party that's cut either one of those recently is the Democrats when they stole money from the Medicare trust fund to fund Obamacare this just goes back again to one of their old hearty lies about Republicans on the campaign Trail because they don't have anything else to say they don't have a message problem they have a reality problem sir thank you for your time you mentioned the book it's called Only the Strong

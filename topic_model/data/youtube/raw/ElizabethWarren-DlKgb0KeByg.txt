I'm running for president to put economic and political power back in the hands of the people that's why I launched my campaign in Lawrence Massachusetts and a textile mill where in 1912 a group of women workers were fed up with working conditions they said enough is enough lettuce strike and one on September 16th I'll be speaking in New York City to tell another story about people coming together to fight for big structural change the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory it was here in 1911 where a massive fire took the lives of workers mostly immigrant women the fire exposed corruption but these workers didn't stand on the sidelines they fought back they got organized they persisted and they changed the course of history Social Security unemployment insurance the abolition of child labor the minimum wage the right to join a union even the very existence of the weakened big structural change brought to you by women the Lawrence Mills in the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory these are stories about power our power what we can get done when we fight together today we face a crisis our government works for the rich and powerful millions of Americans no longer have a voice in our economy or our democracy I'm running for president because I believe we can put economic and political power in the hands of the people we've done it before we can do it again just have to fight for it [Music] [Applause]

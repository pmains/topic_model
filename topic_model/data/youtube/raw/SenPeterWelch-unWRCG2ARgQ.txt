MEMBER FROM VERMONT, ONE MINUTE. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN FROM VERMON IS   RECOGNIZED FOR ONE MINUTE. MR. WELCH: I THANK THE   GENTLEMAN. I HAVE A QUESTION TO MY  COLLEAGUES, WHAT DO YOU HAVE   AGAINST STUDENTS?  THIS TAX BILL MEANS IF AN  EMPLOYER PROVIDES TUITION  ASSISTANCE, THEY ARE GOING TO  HAVE TO PAY INCOME TAX ON THAT,  THE STUDENT WILL.  STUDENTS WHO BORROW MONEY TO GO  TO SCHOOL HAVE TO PAY INTEREST   ON THE LOAN. STUDENTS WHO WANT TO GET LOW   INTEREST RATES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY HIGHER INTEREST RATES   BECAUSE OF THE ELIMINATION OF  THE PRIVATE ACTIVITY BOND. THE SECOND QUESTION I HAVE IS  THIS.  WHAT DO YOU HAVE AGAINST   DEMOCRACY? THIS BILL WAS WRITTEN IN SECRET. THERE WERE NO PUBLIC HEARINGS ON THIS BILL. NOBODY HAD A CHANCE TO HAVE ANY  INPUT. THAT IS WHY IF YOU ASKED 435   MEMBERS OF THAT IS WHY IF YOU ASKED 435   MEMBERS OF CONGRESS DO THEY WANT TO RAISE TAXES ON STUDENTS THE   ANSWER FROM 435 MEMBERS WOULD BE NO.  BUT YOU HAVE RIGGED THIS BILL SO THAT WE HAVE LITERALLY NO  OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER A SINGLE  AMENDMENT. THAT IS WRONG. THIS BILL WAS WRITTEN BY AND FOR THE DONOR CLASS. LET'S DEFEAT THIS BIL

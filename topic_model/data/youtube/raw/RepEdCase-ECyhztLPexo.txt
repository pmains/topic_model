all good can you see me can you hear me perfectly thank you go ahead okay thank you so much uh president harvey and uh all of our association members and guests good morning and aloha and it's uh really great to be with you and and it's great to be home as you can tell i am home i don't usually get to wear an aloha shirt in washington dc and of course as you all know dc is a pretty crazy place right now and so uh for this week and maybe next uh depending on what the senate does today i get to escape dc and reground myself in some local perspective before going back to the zoo um you know your conference subject is so timely and frankly i'm really honored to be able to lead it off i i i i feel a great sense of responsibility in that because you're going to have such a great discussion over the next few days um and i want to just set some kind of the big picture um big picture concepts for my for my for my talk to you i mean i think we all know that um although we don't always think about it that our our hawaii's economic path was actually set generations ago three generations ago really in the post-war era and certainly in the post-statehood area and we have continued on that path throughout we have basically uh based that path around growth growth has been our mantra our motto um certainly as as agriculture was still uh surviving and thriving we wanted to grow agriculture we hope we can still do that certainly terrorism was a growth and remains a growth economy a construction uh defense military defense um government certainly grew uh during this period and our population grew although as we all know it's slowing down but it's still on a growth path uh so it's unlike many states on the on on the continent that that are not growing at this point but i think that's key question when you've already um asked in your in your opening remarks is you know can we sustain it and i think almost more importantly do we do we want to sustain this same economy uh going forward you know disruptive events and and and covet 19 certainly a giant of a disruptive event across our country in our state they at least offer the opportunity of perspective and reality and if we can do that choices uh because if we if we do take the perspective and the reality and accept that we have choices to make uh then we can decide whether we want to simply continue on the path of the last three generations or we want to redirect in some areas or redirect across the across the board um and you know frankly i and my observation as we hopefully are coming out of kovitz 19 so far the results of our of our internal examination of our of our past present and potential futures has been uh quite mixed i think we're at least asking some of the big questions and and you're asking those questions today and hopefully we can get into those with uh some of my presentation in the q a uh but frankly there's just such a strong temptation to drift back into the you know the status quo ante the pre-coveted world it's an almost irresistible poll as if people just um don't want to deviate from a path even if that path is not a not a sustainable one and so i think we all have to fight against this tendency just to kind of go back to pre-covet 19 i don't think that's going to be good for us now or or in our future so i i hope today to contin contribute to your to your uh meeting by a couple of areas first of all i just want to summarize our federal government's role throughout covet 19. i want to update you on the current debate in congress on two big infrastructure bills especially as they're related to hawaii i'd like to offer you some thoughts about what i think the federal government learned from covid19 and some of our choices at the federal government level and then finally i'd like to offer you some thoughts uh from from from from my perspective on the same thing for hawaii what did we learn in kovic 19 and what choices does it present then i want to take your q a as there is time and before i forget uh i do want to say and i'll i hope to remember to say it again at the end um for any further uh questions or comments or to get in touch with me or any needs case.house.gov is the fastest way into my office let's take first the federal government's role and recap that um as and after coven 19 started in earnest in march of 2020 i think we really had three roles at the federal government uh level uh first was uh whether and to what extent to set national standards for our covid response uh the second was to uh get the science of covid19 correct and and respond and accelerate the scientific research the scientific development that it was going to take to meet a scientific medical problem a pandemic and then third was of course to prop up collapsing economies state and county budgets communities and social safety nets across the entire country i would say in retrospect uh that our first uh our first two uh responses were were poor especially in the in the early going um i think we left too much variation up to the local uh state and county governments i think in hawaii we did the right things early on but much of our country did not do the right things from especially from a scientific perspective and that hurt our our stabilization and recovery from profit 19 and frankly still does hurt it so i don't think we did the right thing there i think that we marginalized the science you know we all know we were in the middle of a very difficult a political time it was a presidential election uh there was a lot of pulls on on on the science and and we we swept it under the rug unlike the um unlike many other countries um in the world who face up to the science of it and the results of that were not just academic they were tragic i i walked with congressman elliot on our national ball just a few days ago where there is a very very touching and compelling and emotional um demonstration of seven hundred thousand of our fellow citizens now dead one flag for each of the seven hundred thousand and i i simply had to ask myself the question um yes we lost 700 000 but how many of those 700 000 were lost not because of the inevitability of covet 19 but because of our response to covet 19 and i think the answer is way too many i think in the third area we were far better we passed on a bipartisan basis we cut through it all three massive emergency assistance bills and a number of smaller ones those bills in total totaled somewhere around 5.3 5.4 trillion dollars of federal emergency assistance throughout our country and world um and frankly that the money is although it is it is starting to you know come through the pipeline it is still coming through the pipeline and so it will probably approach 6 trillion by the end of the day um that money went i think we all know to many many parts of our of our economy and society it certainly went to businesses including especially small businesses throughout our country which were especially hard hit it certainly went to propping up unemployment uh insurance systems uh including here in hawaii where we had the highest unemployment rate in the entire country as you know direct stimulus payments uh to citizens uh two separate direct stimulus payments um propping up the social safety net across the board through various areas a state and county government assistance for them to use in relative discretionary approaches and finally just the healthcare and the science of covid19 as we saw our health care system completely overloaded and as we needed to accelerate uh the scientific uh response uh to covet 19 um i think sometimes we don't fully appreciate the magnitude of what what that was really all about consider for example uh and i and i serve on the house appropriations committee so my responsibility on that committee is to is to allocate all federal discretionary spending um every year on a fiscal year basis and so when i speak of discretionary spending i speak of all federal spending uh accepting out only spending that occurs automatically so for example that social security benefits veterans benefits of some others those are the largest but all federal discretionary spending is allocated every year and that total is 1.5 trillion dollars so 1.5 trillion dollars each year to our entire federal government including defense including education including health and human services including environmental protection totals 1.5 trillion and we spent in in you know 18 20 months now 5.3 trillion we're going up to 6 trillion so that's four federal fiscal years in one uh fiscal year is what we spent that's the magnitude of what we did and by the way um to to put a point on something that is very relevant from my perspective um that money was borrowed so we did not go out and increase you know taxes or reduce other federal spending this was an emergency and needed to be done everybody agreed it needed to be done but the consequence uh was 5.3 trillion going to 6 trillion of additional federal debt um our debt went up in 18 months from 23 trillion at the beginning of covid19 to 28 trillion plus now closing it on 29 trillion that is a real consequence of what we needed to do of course i believe we can all agree that this emergency assistance was indispensable to hawaii as it was to many many parts of our country but especially to our hawaii as we saw our tourism industry tank and and related industries have great difficulty that assistance has totaled somewhere in the range of 20 billion dollars to date that has been uh in coming into hawaii from the federal government the emergency assistance programs for for covet and again i want to contrast that to realize some sense of the magnitude of what uh what that meant if you consider that our state general fund budget so think discretionary for for rough comparison purposes um our general fund budget in 2021 was 8 billion then obviously we spent 2 and a half times that within a very short period of time if you consider that pre-covered tourism annual revenues were somewhere in the range of 18 billion dollars then we essentially supplanted that that number and actually far exceeded it because that's tourism spending not taxes on tourism it's spending and so it was a huge amount of money coming into hawaii to to supplement the loss of tourism and other uh dislocation from from kovid 19. we saw many of the same components who were which were quite successful here in hawaii those included for example i just focusing back on small business because we are a small business estate we saw somewhere in the range of 45 000 paycheck protection program loans for a total of about 3.8 billion dollars uh much of it now forgiven and the rest of it probably about to be forgiven i i walked through kapahulu and and kaimuki and and manoa in the last 48 hours talking to several small businesses virtually all of them had benefited from from the ppp that had been an incredible advantage to them and just making it through a very difficult time we also saw economic injury disaster loans at about 37 000 loans extended for about 2.2 billion dollars we obviously had one of the highest utilization rates on federal uh unemployment insurance supplementation in the entire country given our given our rate we also had a very high utilization of direct stimulus payments because of our own income mix here and finally our state and county governments got major assistance that pulled them through from a budget perspective they're still um they still have that money and they are obviously still making decisions uh about where best to utilize that so you know i think the bottom line here is that from a federal response to covet 19 although we did not do well in certain areas we certainly did well i believe in the economic um and other emergency assistance that we sent out throughout the country but that is all for now we are not planning at least at present any further uh major uh emergency assistance uh throughout throughout the country obviously if covet 19 tanks our country again we would have to look at that but that's not where we are in congress or in the administration right now and so kind of what else is out there on that we can look to from a federal government perspective um for hawaii and here i want to focus on the second part of really my my presentations to you which is um the the um two major infrastructure bills um that are uh before congress right now before um the washington uh federal government right now and that you read about uh daily in the papers as well as in the letters to the editor um and so i want to quickly summarize these to you because they are they are the victims of an incredible amount of this misinformation out there obviously they are high stakes bills people feel very strongly about both them on a macro basis on and on individual component basis and that that drives a lot of fear and anxiety and and wrong information deliberate and otherwise so here's what's actually happening and these bills obviously as if they pass and i think they will in some way shape or form they will have a major impact on our hawaii that we need to factor into our thinking going forward so these all start with president biden's so-called build back better agenda that he announced back earlier this year which really had two components to it um number one was what he referred to as the american jobs plan that was a multi-trillion dollar uh proposal really to to revitalize our crumbling physical infrastructure throughout our country so what you would think of is as a traditional infrastructure you know roads bridges ports sewer and water lines airports and on we know we have a major problem with that here in hawaii we can we can tell that any day of the week that we go driving or or otherwise encounter our infrastructure but beyond that it was also an investment in other infrastructure most relevantly for us here in hawaii broadband which is uh incomplete throughout much of our state and and our country uh beyond that there was also major investments in that proposal in climate resiliency which is a critical issue of course for us here so this was a huge proposal in and of itself but he had another component to his buildback better agenda and that was the american family's plan which is a 3.5 trillion quote unquote 3.5 trillion and i put it in quotes because the actual cost is hotly debated but as presented it was 3.5 trillion dollars in so-called social infrastructure so so areas that he focused on were for example extending free education in preschool as well as a higher education extending child tax credits that we had put in place during covet 19 expansion of the federal government's role in health care medical and family leave are really a litmus test issue uh set of issues in the social infrastructure sphere huge huge and complicated uh proposal so where does this all stand well the american jobs plan the physical infrastructure bill uh was hotly debated in congress in both the house and the senate with the president's participation and lo and behold in the middle of an incredibly divided and polarized washington um we actually agreed um to a bipartisan infrastructure plan the so-called bip as we refer to it in washington dc one trillion dollars invested in physical infrastructure the largest infrastructure investment in our history about 2 million jobs nationally new jobs bipartisan a demonstration that congress can actually work and for all of those reasons widely supported by the public 70 75 or more including here in hawaii and for our hawaii uh this would would mean somewhere in the range of two billion dollars of federal assistance uh towards our infrastructure needs which we desperately uh need some help with uh across the board as i think we would we would all acknowledge obviously not just uh the money coming into hawaii not just the infrastructure being fixed but very very good new jobs and translation benefits throughout our economy so i have fought to get this particular bill passed as soon as possible i fought as hard as i could i believe in it uh on a number of levels um unfortunately thus far it has been held up by some of my colleagues in congress who have mistakenly believed in my view that it is needed as quote unquote leverage to maximize the other measure and frankly are willing to risk passage of either or both of the bills and i think they're busy doing that and so it has now been delayed once again now we're supposed to deal with it at the end of this month i hope we do i hope we pass it and give it to the president so let's talk about the second the american family's plan um this has also been the subject of intense negotiations as we speak it's being negotiated every day i'm on the phone um every day with uh some set of colleagues and others uh to to to try to mold that bill to to a point that it will actually pass in a divided congress uh that that is you know at the end of the day you can you know yell and talk and scream all you want but will it pass congress and that takes the requisite number of votes to line up and from my practical perspective that's where we ought to aim what is the number of what is what is the what is the bill that we can pass that will that will actually pass congress there are several issues in this bill that are problematic that we're working through uh one is the total amount um the range of total amount appears to be somewhere between 1.5 trillion dollars and six trillion dollars that's a lot of trillions in between the two um is it going to be paid for by which we mean is it going to be borrowed money just as the emergency assistance i don't believe that we can borrow any further money with the exception of climate change where i'm willing to invest our national finances and climate change related urgencies but the rest of it i don't believe that i don't believe we can worsen our debt some of my colleagues disagree is it going to be universal or tailored to need um some of these programs are proposed as universal in that they apply uh whether you need them or not um i'm far more on the side of let's tailor them to actual need both because i think we can maximize the the programs to people in need if we do it that way and because i believe that in doing so we can actually maximize the total amount that is going to people in need without driving ourselves uh into debt and then finally of course once you well and if and once you accept those boundaries around the bill then what specific initiatives are going to be chosen of many worthy ones to actually focus on and so um these are all critical issues that we're working through for hawaii any number of these issues would have major impacts but kind of exactly what depends very much on the specifics i mean i think from my perspective the biggest potential area to achieve in the the american families plan is significant investment in in climate change related initiatives uh here in hawaii especially our essential transfer to renewable energy as we've committed to doing but certainly key investments as well in our communities of specific need um educational opportunity uh to those in need we certainly need that in hawaii but there's a lot of problems or potential problems for hawaii one would be if this bill contains massive new mandates on businesses including our small businesses then that is a problem for our small businesses and for our economy and then finally i would note that massive new debt if we go in that direction i believe definitely catches up with you in terms of higher inflation and higher interest rates and that's especially problematic to our to our local economy let me turn back now to um kind of what we learned i've commented on that a little bit and and what does it what does it offer in terms of the choices uh going forward well let me take the federal government first and give you five or six areas um i think first of all for those people that denied the pandemic was the pandemic i think we know that pandemics are in fact reality now um they they are international they are cross-border they don't care about countries they are sweeping they are widely um widely um you know consequential um and um they can recur and so um we were caught pretty flat-footed on this pandemic and we shouldn't be caught flat-footed on a pandemic again i don't think we can ignore science we ignored science at the beginning of this pandemic like i said earlier 700 000 dead how many would not be dead if we had made the right decisions at the very beginning it haunts me i think pandemics are national as i said earlier i think we left a little bit too much discretion to state and local governments again maybe we made some of the right decisions but many parts of our country didn't and frankly that was the cause uh or one of the causes of a longer pandemic than than needed and we we need to look no further than the rest of the world to see uh the countries of the world that took a more national response and and got through it a little bit better i think we saw incredible supply chain dependence now that shouldn't be a surprise to anybody who understands our international economy but to reduce it down to some of the key areas where we were dependent on china for major health care related equipment masks etc and to understand how exposed we were in that particular area certainly was a wake-up call in many of our industries one that we are trying to deal with from a policy perspective in washington today where we're trying to say to ourselves well which supply chains exactly do we want to unlink from the rest of the world especially adversaries and which are is it okay to continue to have that international um interaction i don't believe we can dealing from the entire world but i do think we should de-link from the perspective of especially uh difficult and problematic supply chains i think another one um that was was pretty obvious was that in a true national emergency our federal government is really the only place that we can look to to pull us through yes of course we have state and local governments that that have responsibilities communities business organizations we're all responsible for pulling ourselves through uh but the choices that we have are very limited and and in these times we need to make the right decisions at our federal government level because our federal government is really the only real option um and then finally i think i've said this five or seven times it's just a really bad idea to politicize a crisis i wish we hadn't done that let's turn to hawaii uh what did we learn here and what are our choices i could probably go on for some time in this category but i've just picked a few uh that that occurred to me um some obvious some not so obvious and and some that kind of have a mix of obviousness so let me take uh the obvious one first overdependence on tourism uh when you put all your eggs into one basket and when that basket is uh is is influenced at this extent for a pandemic then this is the result you get now i think we can all say that we can all acknowledge it but how do we re-engage it how do we re-engage tourism uh now um you're gonna spend a lot of time at your conference talking that through and i i think it's i think it's a completely relevant legitimate question for all that for us all to ask um do we simply return to this you know the seven decades of of tourism trajectory which which brought us to 10 million visitors a year and just keep going from there um you know do we take the opportunity to ask ourselves is there a better way to construct tourism both from a public support perspective and from a sustainability perspective um and as uh and as um has already been talked about a natural resource protection perspective um you know here's the fact um even before covet 19 uh public support for tourism at least the brand of tourism that has been practiced of late was plummeting public support was plummeting everybody was just getting sick of it um of over tourism and you know i guess i would call it um a brand of tourism that that was intrusive was extractive was disruptive was unsustainable uh tourism depends on public support that's what we market to the world it's not just our scenery it's us and if us are not happy that doesn't make for a very happy tourism um industry and that was manifested all over the place uh by by by by crowded um excluded uh natural resources and parks uh by by trash on our by trash on our you know highways and streets which we do too but i mean tourism con contributes to that uh by completely disruptive uh um you know air tour helicopters all over our state i mean we all have examples of it and so the question is that we just go back to that and so i'm going to just um you know posit another approach that takes some pretty tough choices but may be the way to go from my perspective so let's let's con consider a model of tourism going forward which is really designed uh to stabilize volume um increase uh demand as to supply and increase prices and maintain jobs and and and revenue production can we pull that off can we have our cake you need it too i i think we can come pretty close but it would take some pretty tough decisions for example i listed five or six here all of them tough any of them tough no new hotel and resort areas no reclassification of any more land for hotels and resorts no expansion of existing hotels and resort areas no expansion of room in existing hotel and resort areas if you have you know 2 000 you know rooms on a particular property and you want to rebuild it or renovate it you don't get to go to 2500 rooms it's 2 000 rooms true crackdowns on illegal vacation rentals which we haven't done yet promising signs but we need to get there and restrictions on existing legal so we don't expand uh the the pool of hotel rooms uh in our state especially in residential areas we don't build any more airport gates our airport gates are being built to to accommodate uh you know increased uh demand um that demand is generated by increased tourism not by us and so should we should we continue to accommodate an increased tourism model we could start to to to do that from our own infrastructure decisions can we use the hanama model by reserving more local time at our parks hanama has been very successful in instituting a reservation system and and uh really you know reserved time for for residents uh can we do that um elsewhere can we can we um set a maximum ceiling on availability of rental cars uh in in our state same basic common as airplane gates i think if we think through those kinds of areas we might come up with some surprising decisions for ourselves that might work but these are choices let me talk about one not so obvious um lesson of covid19 our defense presence saved our butts um now i haven't heard a whole bunch about that uh talked about but let's consider that even before covet 19 our military and our overall defense presence in hawaii was uh the second largest economic generator um in our state um somewhere and you know i've seen different figures on this and perhaps some of you can comment in more with more authority but somewhere between 10 and 20 um and translatable uh beyond the simple military and defense community itself whether it be whether it be actual military presence here through through you know payroll and investment or or uh defense contractors or um back to my appropriations committee where i serve on the subcommittee on military uh construction um actual physical investment for infrastructure uh here in hawaii during kofi 19 the military was our number one industry it was it was a consistent industry it was stable it didn't depend on the ups or downs of covet 19. it was insulated it was you know a sure thing i don't want to say sure sure thing but it was certainly better than uh terrorism or anything else we had um and i think we have a major choice here in hawaii because i've seen an alarming increase in and you know anti-defense uh comments are both nationally and and here in our hawaii and i and i and i and i say alarming because you know number one anybody that understands anything about kind of where the indo-pacific is going uh especially as to china understands that it's critical for our country to be present in the indo-pacific and that includes our well and i think it's our obligation to our country but also it is an economic issue for our hawaii you also we always talk about diversification uh well we are already a little diversified with with our defense spending and so we've got decisions to be made such as whether we will allow the military to continue key uh training ranges throughout our state um and we better we better make the right decisions on those uh uh to to um recognize the importance of the of the defense uh uh presence uh here in hawaii and then finally i would just mention a kind of a mixed area tele anything i call it um we all know that uh tele anything is with us tele education a little bit of a mixed result but uh can be solved and improved through broadband and increase the availability of resources telehealth a clear success during a covet 19. and then finally i would call tell a business tele-business is an interesting one because um it it means that people can live and work of course from their homes but what it does do also on the negative side is it internationalizes a a presence uh here in hawaii which of course uh leads to uh substantial increased competition for local you know housing and so there is a consequence there uh i don't think it's necessarily bad but i certainly do believe that one choice we have uh is to is to recognize that reality by by by clearly delineating between um residences that are primary residences and residences or you know people from elsewhere in the world that just want a second home or or want to be able to come down here and live and work for a few months every year i think that's a fair choice to make okay well i've gone on way too long so apologies i'm just going to wrap this i think from my perspectives these are just some of the lessons of covid19 i see and some of the choices that we face what's really important to me and i think to all of us is that number one we try to recognize and see these choices in a very very clear-eyed basis that we question uh whether we can do better coming out of covid19 that we correct course where we can or we should and that we we do realize that we have these choices because and i'm not the first one to say it but i always remember it the past is always already written but our future is not written we do have decisions to make that can chart that future anyway i look forward to continuing as your partner on capitol hill again to get into my office case.house.gov mahalo and i'm sure that i exhausted the time for q a but i'll do it anyway if you want thank you very much congressman yes we do have a couple of questions and actually that last point you made about broadband our first question is in regards to that an editorial in the wall street journal yesterday morning identifies an earlier program to expand broadband in hawaii as an example of extreme corruption for example the one run by sandwich isles communications does the broadband initiative contain new program initiatives likely to mitigate such corruption yes the answer to that is yes the sandwich isles example was was highly disturbing of course and and the people that were responsible i went to prison for it as they should have and i think it did expose a lack of adequate federal oversight of massive amounts of funding that that were going for these purposes now i will say that uh what sanhui trials did which was to try to link the the uh native hawaiian community in particular our hawaiian homelands was absolutely necessary and has changed the quality of life uh for for for native hawaiian communities and for our hawaiian homelands in particular so the idea of of that investment was was not wrong the implementation and oversight perspective uh was obviously flawed and there were consequences for that the broadband that is being proposed in our infrastructure bills is far greater uh than than the sandwich ielts model although that was large intended to reach a far greater number of folks throughout our state and our country is much more of a direct federal government investment in infrastructure so presumably the opportunities for oversight will be better but yes there are fraud decisions built into it but i i don't accept the wall street journal's premise that that because sandwich isles was was a disaster at the end of the day from uh from a fraud perspective that somehow uh federal government investment in broadband uh is similarly uh not advised sure thank you thank you and i have a question actually you mentioned within the american families plan we could maximize without driving ourselves into debt now the price tag is no doubt breathtaking but the income inequality that we see especially in hawaii is pretty stark when considering hawaii's most vulnerable families as well as our housing and healthlessness crisis which measures do you see as the most important for these vulnerable groups in hawaii well i would start by telling you saying to you that i think that we can have we can have it both ways uh so i don't accept the people that say we have a false choice between you know a large bill and and no debt i i don't accept that we have very clear options that we can pursue to generate uh revenues that can pay for the largest investments in our social infrastructure in our history so let's talk about you know scale of what we're talking about here this is not just once in 10 years not once in a generation this is ever and i think that uh we we can we can in fact afford uh from a debt and deficit perspective a bill in the range of say 2 trillion or so maybe maybe more it's not 3.5 and it's not 3.5 because the revenue is not available it's 3.5 because congress is not going to pass revenue generation generators at that level and it's also not advised for our economy to gen to take that much out of the economy from in my perspective so there's a limit to it but even within two trillion dollars you can actually uh you don't have to pick and choose between those programs but i will go back to this point that i made i think you do and you should pick and choose between need and not need uh so for example um if if um you know one of his proposals was a free community college for all well i don't i i don't agree with that i think that if if i have a choice between allocating uh resources to to community college assistance for those who cannot otherwise go to community college and those that can perfectly well go to community college i know which way i'm going on that and if i go on universal basis then i'm taking that money away from another program uh where there is equal need thank you appreciate that and just a couple more questions we'll get through these and then we'll let you off the care uh congressman you mentioned that you felt that the initial response at the beginning of the pandemic could have been better and that failure caused the loss of lives what specifically do you think we did wrong and how do you think we could have done better well i think i've tried to talk to that i think there was a real reluctance at the time at the federal gov the federal level to to federalize a a standard response especially focusing on science uh it was pretty clear to our to our to me to our medical community to the to the objective folks that that deal in pandemics what was going on what was needed um and had we had we had we developed at least some modicum of national standards at the time and said to all states no that's the way we need to go we're all linked we can't you know we can't stop things at the borders people cross borders and i think we would have been a lot better off i think there was also just a sheer marginalization of the science at the federal government level that that became very very political and that was tragic and i think that did cost lives i absolutely do believe that thank you and last question here we also have experienced significant supply chain disruption and it is currently reported that approximately half a million ships sit are waiting to enter ports in california what can be done to address the situation besides the workforce shortages specific to shipping would elimination or if possible a pause of the jones act have any impact specific to hawaii's shipping well i've fought this jones act battle for a long long time now so um i i think everybody i hope everybody knows where i stand on the jones act and i guess i would say well here's here's what happens uh when when you when you limit your supply of shipping to a landlocked um you know island state 2500 miles from the nearest supply point um and you and you say no nobody else can can uh you know function in that environment this is what you get uh so i'm very clear on on the the jones act contributing uh uh and being magnified in the middle of a covet 19 crisis because fundamentally the jones act causes all of the goods that we get here many of which have an international source to be sourced through the uh the continent and back here when it doesn't have to be that way so i'm i i think i'm pretty clear on that um in terms of um the the ships um it's very complicated what's going on in terms of our ports i will say that that um one of the issues is is a um the the basic infrastructure of our ports which goes back to that that uh that major infrastructure measure that i that i do support um that money would go to revitalizing uh ports that are simply not equipped to handle either the volume or the modern capacity of many of the ships that are transiting our world today and so that's been a real problem for them to just get the stuff off uh off the ships fast enough but there's also another problem that is not quite as focused on and that is that that our internal transportation supply chains in the united states are also uh a problem of catching up from a from a postcovid 19 world so we're talking about just you know trucks getting out on the highways i mean there's a whole chain of events that has led to you know as we all know uh shortages of cars are where they're buying them or renting them same thing has happened in kind of the national transportation network uh where where that has been disrupted uh and so um there's been a chain reaction of events that is that has caused this this build up on on the west coast uh ports um i think we can work our way through it but it sure would help if we got some infrastructure money out to start those parts um you know being um you know renovated so they can handle this kind of demand all right thank you so much congressman we really appreciate you taking the time to talk with our group today and wish you the very best in your travels and your time back in washington okay thank you so much a lot thank you for the tv camera and all of your fans uh quick uh history of rainbow driving so rainbow driving was started by my grandpa in 1961. now 60 years ago um after fighting in the war he learned how to cook actually for the army and the 100 battalion then came back and tried a couple different options here but settled on rainbow driving in october 2nd 1961. we've been here ever since um just serving the community you've been in this location this location since um for 60 years yeah i think i read that before that when he came back from the warhead he tried other restaurants yeah like on the on down in waikiki one in waikiki one in chinatown and just uh i think one was like a lease thing that fell out and the other one just didn't work out but kept trying yeah yeah they told them kapahulu uh wasn't gonna make be anything [Music] uh i don't know what how old i was but uh i'm older than 61.60 so there you go i'm not sure [Music] so he went back to okinawa for a little bit i mean came back right before the war your grandfather yeah so he's a keeper ebay is you born here and you went back went back and then came back he came back again yeah yeah and so his uh his grandparents came here remember what year um i don't remember yeah okay but emma beach must have been part of the sugar yeah the packaging yeah so okinawa is the heritage yep and how about that your great your grandmother uh she was also working out yeah so that that whole side is shimokina so we take we take great pride in that now do you do you run this for yourself i mean is that your your business yeah so i'm the only child you're the only child i'm the only child and i have no cousins so okay kind of always uniquely um all you yeah because family business is usually there's plenty yeah yeah but it just falls straight on to me yeah i went to a sumida watercress farm oh yeah a couple of um a couple of weeks ago okay same thing they're down to fourth generation now but very not very many kids along the way so it's a pretty small family stuff yeah you got to talk to them we have a family business center actually by put on by scheidler oh yeah and we have a next-gen section where we all talk about the struggles oh yeah yeah but uh not that complicated if you're the only one in that generation you don't have to it's a lot of pressure just a little bit just a little bit don't screw it up that's all there is but yeah it's a wonderful tradition and uh what time is it it's one 1 15 in the afternoon and the line is long you got stuff you got local you got tourists there a little bit of tourists yeah kind of died down after the summer how did you get through colder we we just did um we didn't have to shut down per se we went to take out only um but we tried to stay one step ahead of it we were all watching what was going on in the mainland and you know we had friends sewing mats you know when the first came out right everyone's looking for masks yeah did you take advantage of the uh 19 release funding like we we did the two rounds of tpp yeah how many employees here we have a 40 to 50 just depending on this location on this oh so you're able to keep them employed we kept we kept everyone employed we just shifted some responsibilities and some hours but everyone was fully employed kept medical and then you know we felt really lucky that we were able to survive that we didn't want to touch the restaurant revitalization or anything like that i've always said you know the federal stuff you'll take but if the state you know we want to leave it for some other people because we're pretty okay yeah yeah and were you able to get it forgiven uh working on the second one second first one's fine yeah first one but no thank you guys for all you guys to help us oh there are tens of thousands of businesses [Music] we tried to like get the mom and pops that was the hardest you know like some of like our friends and family that just didn't know we're like no it's very simple and they're like well i don't want to take a loan and we're like well yeah you know just explaining it to them and making sure they knew yeah but no thank you for that we really do all right [Music] right now you know we're just we're just waiting for things to return back and that's not any pressure for you guys to open everything it's just we're just patiently letting our tourists um see our dinings closed just cuz we just but we're surviving and we're just you know we always just take it day by day and just try and make well cool well thank you so much you don't mind for sure i won't scare them off [Music] thank you so much thank you thank you thank you today uh is kaimuki day it's community that i've loved for a long long time and i'm here with representative jackson sayama who is now representing kamuki and the state house of representative reptiyama aloha good likewise thanks so much for coming to our district i'm really happy to show you around uh hopefully you know we get to learn a few things about business owners and how we can better support them so yeah thanks for coming this actually happens because i reached out to rep sayama a couple of months ago and said hey let's let's do something together and we actually decided this is what we wanted to do is go check out time to keep together and talk story as people get through covenant and so we're going to go talk to a bunch of the business owners at kaimuki and see what we can find [Music] like i totally understand everyone is in the same house you know it's not a great situation no one predicted it no one caused it i you know i grew up just a few blocks from here and um yes this is my family property my dad always had plans for it or not nothing really ever and then um believe it or not you know he had a certain vision for it which was pretty in line with the community and he never really got the right offer and then as he got older it just i think became this project that was um just a little too much for him to handle but i'm grateful that it all works [Music] got free for steel yes yeah and you know actually they did one um the last one they did uh it was about five years or so ago and that was actually with the friends that they came here [Music] yeah yeah yeah there's some stuff in the theater area you guys just got to take all that out oh wow i think the main goal of your figure [Music] yeah yeah but then iconic [Music] that's not my intention at all don't worry about that i am that i'm definitely going to make that a priority [Music] that letter was just perfect um i could not have written it better myself you hit all the keys i wrote that letter i wrote it myself um in terms of uh the process why i figured i knew what the weak spot was i kind of went and talked about the weak spots a little bit what actually happened like i wasn't sure what to expect okay so uh every the post office gives you a contract and um after i wrote that letter oh i thought it was a letter everybody come together so fast um did the landlord do something different and the post office came back and said oh wow let's see if we can put this together yeah we all came together and said let's make this all work yeah in a sense the post office came back and said um are bad in the sense and said how can we make it right um what steps we have to take a b was extremely helpful to work with and they said you know what do we need to do and i said just send me the paperwork and i'll start signing and um the paperwork was there right away so the amb comes down on their rent demand and then the post office came up a little bit on what they contained yes and we all said it exactly and we all meet in the middle yeah cool yes so it all worked out quite well and um yeah uh within a year later within a day i'd say the usps was responding and then i had previously had many delays in terms of working with him throughout the reorganization a lot of good people working there but they're not sure where they're going to be in a week or two weeks where do you think the actual hangout occurred was it at the regional level no it was local or what i did i think probably said the local people probably said this is a mistake yes they did and they actually said let us go back and fight yeah and for a while they did and then they came back and said we fought our best and we can't make it happen at that point we were determined that this is over um it's not going to get fixed and a couple of local representatives came in and spoke and when we spoke to them they kind of agreed that it's going to be over and then we heard your office getting involved and i i've said well let's see what happens well i hate to tell you this but it doesn't always turn out this way for me sometimes it just does you know sometimes you just hit it just right and just at the right time say the right things and maybe people are thinking it to start with and maybe they maybe they've got some other issue they they want me to be with them on or whatever but in terms of the contracting office at the mainland level you know they initially said no nothing we're not going to increase at all and then after your letter they they were basically this is approved and it's exactly what it should be and you know it worked out i think that i think they didn't want to go through that analysis of of the higher costs in hawaii and uh so i think they were a little concerned that if they went through that analysis it would actually indicate the reality which is they should be increasing their amount sure across the board for contracting offices so i was just telling the crew i used to run the edible arrangements um i did that from 2006 to 2016 and um you know there was a new franchise here in hawaii and that was one of the things we had to bring forward to their attention was you have everything here you have a high price of real estate rent you have high cost of living you have a 20 hour full uh full-time full-time day mentor medical insurance everything here shipped in such as the produce and whatnot so it's definitely that thing but you have to keep this in mind that we have all the factors well some cities in the mainland they have one or two we have them all in one place and it does make doing you know uh business well i'm glad it turned out um yeah i'm happy for the community happy for you and we'll see how it goes well for me uh what most important is um when we originally took this place it was for a couple people looking for a full-time climate with medical benefits and that's basically why we're here my wife is a manager bank i'm retired air force i also teach i do other things but this was not our livelihood but it is for some of the employees here they have their medical i mean we have six and we have three on them and uh that was a big concern you have three on the medical um so three full full-timers so over 20 hours yes exactly yeah yeah so for them their medical and their livelihood is here so their benefits and and such and for them to lose that in the year of cohabit that would have been well that would have been the downfall that that was the the worst part of it and it's been a tough year for a couple of them as well and other um more personal issues for them as well it's been not a good year oh it was tough to break you're saying we're gonna that was hard all right good thanks for letting me drop by to just make a connection to the reality here now that i'm back from dc for a little while well thank you for wandering around manuel these are my old stomping grounds so it's uh i've mailed many things from here i ran i ran my entire all of my state legislative campaigns out of this i ran a uh a whole governor's campaign out of this post office and my first congressional campaign's out of here so awesome i've actually have some some sweat equity in here excellent excellent you guys are always welcome and your letter is hung proudly in our our window thank you so much people say what happened we say just read this this is what happened because we're absolutely determined that that would not have happened a miracle thank you for that okay thank you all right oh i know it's so nice to have it there still so you really did it great service to the community well i was uh some sometimes it works that didn't always work that way but sometimes it does so you've got to just keep on trying so i'm happy about it thank you very much okay thank you

thank you all for joining us on this wonderfully warm summer day a hundred degree heat index would be intimidating some for some but American women we have shown that we can take the heat congresswoman DeLauro informed me this morning that at the time of the Seneca Falls convention it was 90 degrees 90 degrees and no air conditioning inside so indeed we have withstood much more to make the ideals of our democracy a reality for America's mothers wives and daughters this week marks the 160 fifth anniversary of historic gathering of women who were committed to that singular purpose to ensure that every freedom every liberty and every right belongs to every American the Seneca Falls convention was the first women's rights convention our very Declaration of Independence is echoed in the declaration of sentiments at Seneca Falls we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal so now it is a necessity they said for women to demand equal station to which they are entitled that is why we the members of Congress that the house Democratic caucus are so proud to announce an economic agenda for women and families when women succeed America succeeds this agenda is about the future of America's families and the growth of America's economy when women earn equal pay we know that America's economy will prosper when women can have fairness and balance between work and family we know that Americans society will thrive it is about unleashing the power of our nation's women and in doing so strengthening the middle class the backbone of our democracy and when all succeed we know America succeeds our initiative on the 165 years of progress in Seneca Falls is we we today want to address the economic challenges facing America's women and families to do so we will hear from congresswoman rosa DeLauro you all know her to be an unsurpassed champion for women's economic agenda she is here with her guest rashonda young who will discuss our initiative for equal pay you all know of roses credentials I want to be sure you are aware of extraordinary credentials of congresswoman Donna Edwards a champion as chair of the Democratic working women's group she has been such a force such a force in the Congress on improving the economic situation for women with her guest Sonya DeRay is they will discuss women and life balance congresswoman Doris Matsui co-chair of that democratic women's working group another champion for women and an articulate spokesperson for women's prosperity with her guests saw Stephanie Brown and they will discuss the importance of affordable childcare bring us all together as a woman who was his made history as one of the few women to chair a full committee of the house congressman ed of Alaska as who is now the ranking Democrat on the Small Business Committee she will discuss the vital role played by women and small business owners in the interest of time I'm just asking to bring themselves on so that we can hear directly from them in an important economy of time and light of the weather but with full value for what their contribution means for women and now we're going to hear from congresswoman de la Rose guest rashonda young Thank You leader Pelosi my name is rashawn deyoung I'm operations manager for my family businesses alpha Express and alpha services in Waterloo Iowa Alf Express is a transportation company that hauls parts all across the United States and into Canada and alpha services is a maintenance contracting company that provides services for local companies and john deere facilities as well my dad started the businesses in 1989 I want to thank leader Pelosi and other representatives here for inviting me to join you and share perspective from our business when I decided to join my dad and the family businesses seven years ago I found out there was an issue with our paychecks we had a woman who had been with us for many years and she was the one who was keeping everything in order one day I found out she was only getting paid a little more than half of what her male counterparts were making I knew I had to do something about it for my dad and me to be able to work together and make our business into what he and I both envisioned it to be things had to change so when my concerns weren't quickly addressed I contacted our accountant and I raised our women's paid to be equal to those of our male counterparts and that was done without authorization I believe people should be paid according to the job they're doing and the value they bring to a company nothing more nothing less I refuse to allow myself or other women workers to be paid less than the value that we bring to our company because of our gender I love my dad dearly but he was 65 when I came to work with him and he had a very old school mentality about women and work it was something that he's had to struggle to get over but in the end he's got it the reason he got there was because he recognized that the women on our team were instrumental to keeping the business afloat it really would not survive without us I'm proud of the decisions we've made in our business and I'm committed to continuing to offer fair wages and equal pay for equal work this is about the values I hold as a small business woman it's about how we attract and keep good employees on our team and it's about how we build strong communities stronger families and stronger local economies in Waterloo Iowa and across the nation Thank You rashonda you said it all what a story good afternoon and thank you all for being here let me acknowledge leader Pelosi and all of my colleagues for their hard work and their leadership in helping to improve the lives of women and families across our country thank you to all of our guests who have come to share their personal stories the issue here is income Congress can make an important difference for women and families by working to raise their wages we need to pass Paycheck Fairness increase the minimum wage and provide women with education and training opportunities to further their careers women comprised forty percent of the country's breadwinners but the vast majority are low wage workers in single headed households women are more likely to be in poverty to file for bankruptcy and to have less retirement savings unmarried women single widowed divorced separated are the most economically insecure and fifty years after the Equal Pay Act women are still being paid only 77 cents on the dollar as compared to men for the same job that comes to an average real difference of eleven thousand dollars per year that is two years worth of groceries or over a year of rent and for women of color the disparity is even worse one key step forward is enacting the Paycheck Fairness Act to help ensure a simple principle same job same pay we also need to raise the minimum wage two or three workers making the minimum wage are women the minimum wage used to be equal to about half of average wages and at seven dollars and a quarter an hour it is now barely a third at this rate a mom with two kids could work full-time and still be well below the poverty line women are really struggling financially they are looking for an increase in the minimum wage and equal pay so that they can raise their income so that they can support their families and have a chance for a better life and third while women have recognized that education and training will help them to improve economically student debt has skyrocketed even eating up more and more of that monthly paycheck we need to support women's efforts to receive a better education and training opportunities to further their careers and to obtain better paying jobs for women to succeed for America to succeed we need an economic agenda that ensures women equal and rising pay and that supports them with training and education opportunities thank you let me now hand it over to Sonya derive of Somerville Massachusetts is going to share her story with all of you so thank you so much good afternoon I want to thank leader Pelosi for allowing me to be here today my name is Sonia dry and I'm from Somerville Massachusetts i'm a member of the group mom's rising and I'm a mom of two sons today mom rising and I'm a mom to great sons Kieran he's 14 years and Roshan he's 12 i'm here today to talk to you about the benefits of the family and medical leave act or FMLA last year the FMLA was instrumental in keeping my family afloat when my father broke his hip and required hip replacement surgery the FMLA allowed me to take a month off from work to help with his daily needs during his recovery from hip surgery I cooked for him I did laundry I talked with him a lot and I ran errands my dad needed help with his physical therapy and I was able to be there for him my sister's in need and nieces had been my father's primary caretakers but they needed a break and I stepped in but that's what families are supposed to do when when times get tough none of it would have been possible if it weren't for FMLA in reality it didn't just help my father get back on his feet it also helped bring my family together my presence meant my dad could stay in his own home instead of going to a nursing home this is better for my father's mental health as well as saved us money in the long term my sisters and I were there with a helping hand organizing his medicine helping him prepare meals helping him just do it the bathroom he would not have been able to stay independent if I hadn't been there today my father's healthy again he's still in his own home and thanks to FMLA my father is a dapper older man who goes to visit his neighbors and I'm a happy daughter a sister mom with job security but not everyone is so fortunate in my particular case I was able to use my accrued paid sick days for my family leave some people don't have that luxury they don't have paid sick days to cover their leave I know that it could be torture when you can't be there for someone you love when there is all or in need of help unfortunately that's the reality and most for most people in this country making family and medical leave and in particular paid family medical leave a requirement for all workers would go a long way to relieve the stress that so many families need during medical processes everyone should have benefits actually everyone should have the right to be to have paid family medical leave it's good for employers and employees since happy healthy workers make for a productive and fair workplace so thank you everyone Wow Sonia thank you so much for sharing your story every once in a while when I'm blown away by leader Pelosi and our colleagues have joined us here on the steps then we get to hear from a rashonda young and we hear from a Sonia dry and then we hear from Stephanie Brown and we are blown away even more because they represent so many women all across this country I'm really pleased to join our leaders here and our colleagues representative dallara didn't say this but her state is one among three in the nation in Connecticut to provide for paid sick leave and to my colleagues representative Matsui and Velazquez and other colleagues we're here to promote an agenda for women because when women succeed America truly does succeed Sonja's story is one that we really know all too well for 20 years now the Family and Medical Leave Act has enabled millions of women like Sonja to care for themselves or a loved one with peace and and the peace of mind that they wouldn't lose their job because they were taking care of their family responsibilities FMLA provides workers with up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to take care of themselves a newborn a newly adopted child orgy heard a family member with a serious injury or condition and it's been used over get this the Family and Medical Leave Act in 20 years has been used over 100 million times in 20 years and so while the law has been successful and it's been overwhelmingly popular among the public FMLA only provides unpaid leave and so today we want to outline an economic agenda that says that we can actually build on FMLA women make up over half of the workforce forty percent or primary breadwinners in their household and so many women had single-parent households and so that means that millions of women across our country are responsible for making significant or singular contributions to their family income and so these women are who are so deeply woven woven in the economic fabric of our country should also have the benefit of knowing that they would be able to take paid leave to provide a savings and it would provide a savings of a hundred and sixty billion dollars a year because productivity would be increased turnover would be decreased low-wage workers a majority of whom are women and by the way as Rosa said let's increase that minimum wage including tipped wages are not able to earn paid leave and have to work while they're ill or while a family members ill and so those paid sick days and it's estimated that more than a third of working women are not able to take that time off to care for themselves and their families and so Sonja's story in some ways is slightly unusual and so what we need to do is for women who are concerned about a work-life balance that really allows them to meet all of their responsibilities that should include paid sick leave and it's why we're meeting women like Sonia and they're here to address these concern the United States remains really one of the only developed nations that doesn't offer paid family and medical leave and so it's time for us to stand with women like Sonia to stand with the leaders in the Congress and provide an economic agenda that really does say when women succeed America succeeds and that has to include paid leave and now I'd like to introduce another one of these fabulous women stephanie brown to share with us her story hello my name is Stephanie Brown and I recently graduated from grand valley state university with a bachelor's degree in sociology however I was not your average college student I'm a mother to a forreal daughter named Mackenzie therefore I was considered a student parent I'm originally from Metro Detroit area in Michigan and I got pregnant shortly after i graduated high school in 2008 I was not going to let this challenge stop me from furthering my education I knew that I needed an education in order to land a decent job so I decided to attend community college for two years as soon as I completed my general requirements I made the decision of further my education at a university in the fall 2010 I transferred to Grand Valley State University and moved to Grand Rapids with my daughter Grand Rapids is two and a half hours away from my hometown and family so i knew i was going to need help with my daughter in order to attend school full-time while working Grand Valley was very helpful with directing me to their available resources for student parents they gave me a list of affordable apartments around campus and also gave me information on daycare centers in the area my daughter went to a quality and affordable daycare right on grand Valley's campus called the children's enrichment center the daycare also provided me with countless resources and created community community that made me feel very comfortable being a student parent the director even encouraged me to write an essay for a scholarship from the Women's Center on campus I was blessed to receive that scholarship and it helped me purchase my school supplies and books it if it was not for grand Valley's resources I would not have been able to work raise my daughter and received my bachelor's degree in five years because of my education I now hold a full-time position at st. John's da Blodgett as I direct care counselor and a children's shelter I know that I would not have been able to receive my education at the end the job I have now without the resources available at Grand Valley State University I am so grateful for my education and also for the quality of care and my child received in the process Thank You Stephanie for that truly inspiring story my name is Doris Matsui 0 from Sacramento California and I have been meeting with some extraordinary women in my district small business owners women and clean energy and cleantech and women working two jobs sometimes three jobs to support their families but no matter what their background no matter what we're talking about we always reach a point in our conversation any conversation where they say and then there was a time that I had to drop everything I was doing to pick up my kids you know when we talk about affordable reliable childcare women get it immediately every mother has had to face that frightening moment of uncertainty when one responsibility is pulling them in one direction and their duties as a mother are pulling them in another and you know it's just not mom's everyday this choice is faced by grand mothers and sisters and other women with children in their lives for too many women it may be the choice between a paycheck or a safe environment for their kids this is not a choice any mom should have to make and why affordable reliable child care is essential for the economic security of women the democratic women in the house understand this and we are here to elevate the issue of child care to give it the national attention it deserves we can do this by expanding the child care tax credit by defending Head Start programs and ensuring adequate pay and training for childcare workers we also challenged our colleagues in Congress to have the vision to invest in our children's future by enacting President Obama's preschool for all initiative quality preschool provides educational opportunities at a time when children's minds are rapidly expanding and it provides safe and reliable care or their mothers are work or school affordable reliable childcare will boost the economy by allowing working moms to participate more fully because when women succeed America succeeds I thank you my colleague for being here and I want to now hear from my colleague congresswoman Velazquez Thank You Doris and thank you madam leader rosa DeLauro my colleagues and all the special guests that are here as we have heard first time today women workers are a cornerstone of our economy when women have the tools to succeed America as a whole move forward I challenge anyone here that visit with a small business person and they will say to you that the biggest obstacle they have right now is lack of consumers work walking through the doors this is an economic agenda that empowers women as consumer but does much more and this is especially true in entrepreneurship women today on 17 million businesses in the United States and ninety percent of them are small businesses in fact in just ten years women owned enterprises have grown at double the rate of those owned by their male counterparts given the tools imagine imagine the potential that we hold here for job creation the agenda being promoted today will empower more women to go into business for themselves and create jobs in their communities expanding child care access gives more women freedom to launch and maintain a new business the truth is that no women should be put in the position of having to try to choose between starting a business and raising a child it is certainly challenging being a working mom but it is even more daunting to be a single mother trying to start your own company in fact female business owners spend six and a half hours more per week caring for children than male and tripping words granting women greater flexibility means more of them can pursue intrapreneurship while also caring for their families childcare isn't the only obstacle in that regard ensuring working women achieved pay equity can help more women pursue business ownership simply put when women make more they save more giving them resources to invest in a business but we shouldn't stop there we need to move from welfare to business ownership which is truly inspirational and a victory not just for those women but for the entire US economy likewise by investing in job training as this agenda promotes we can give more women skills they need to open businesses and also create a steady supply of skilled labor for women intrapreneurship to hire this art investment our nation must make in female entrepreneurship when women succeed America succeeds this agenda will help women from all walks of life it is about to the 20 year old graduating from college as we saw here the single working mom who wants more control in her life the new grant who left her country for a better future for their children and the suburban mother who doesn't want to choose between climbing the corporate ladder and raising a family the agenda we are laying out today sends a clear message to American working women we are on your side thank you well I thank everyone for participating today it's an honor to stand here with our colleagues male and female as well as representatives of some of the organizations who work with women in the workplace to advance the cause of women and families in our country we stand on the steps of the capital of the United States and I want to acknowledge of the presence and the endurance of our colleague Tammy Duckworth who has been standing with us this whole time a veteran a woman veteran who's a leadership has made us the home of the brave in the land of the free as well as Tulsi Gabbard another woman veteran who's in our caucus and she had to leave because we have action on the floor but Louise slaughter was here before and she as she represents the Senate Seneca Falls area in Congress and she has been a champion for what she calls uppity women in order and they're uppity pneus but I wanted to acknowledge her leadership in advancing the principles of Seneca Falls as they said we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal such is now the necessity for women to be an equal station to which they are entitled that's what we are here to do when women succeed America succeeds thank

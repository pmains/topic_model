mr. phonic five minutes Thank You mr. chairman this conversation we're having today it's October we should have had this conversation a year ago my questions will focus on the vetting process and the timeline and but broadly I want to start out and ask for each of your platforms starting with Twitter how many total accounts are BOTS or trolls not specific not specifically what we're referring to today regarding malign Russian influence but just generally how many millions of accounts are BOTS or trolls so we do regular audits and tests for that and determine that less than 5% four years have been false or spam accounts less than five percent of all users what number is that how many millions of users is that it's 5% of about 330 million okay Facebook how many of your accounts how many of your Facebook pages are inauthentic Facebook pages so we measure this question by by accounts and we disclose with our with our financial statements each quarter our current assessment will be providing an updated assessment in in a day or so when we file our 10-q it's a small percentage in the neighborhood of two percent and that would be how many million accounts or accounts yes well we have over two billion users so significant a lot mr. Walker from Google how many inauthentic accounts I know there were two referenced that were handed over to the committee but broadly how many inauthentic accounts the truth or were referenced had to do with advertising accounts so we have a continuing issue with trying to detect and deter fraudulent advertising on the system as you recognize we're not primarily a social network so our profile is somewhat different in this respect but it's a relatively small number I don't have in front of me but we happy to follow up thank you my next question is the vetting process mr. stretch you've talked about the ad content review process and I'm a fairly nimble Facebook Twitter and Google user I'm I'm the first person who sign up for Facebook probably on this committee when I was in college and I know typically when you open up a Facebook account it's fairly easy it's also easy to run ads is the is the automatic response to put up the ad and review it after the fact walk me through the specific ad content review how many eyes are on that what responsibilities do the add content reviewers have the app will be reviewed before it's run and it will based on its content perhaps based on its targeting it will either go fully through automated review if the if the content and the targeting is something that we believe our systems are adequate to address on their own so I'll give you an example nudity is something that's relatively easy it's prohibited and it's relatively easy for our systems to identify and prevent from running there are other policies that are more nuanced so for example the difference between an ad that might have a weapon and an ad that might have a weapon being brandished and that's a meaningful difference in our policies and so that one would be would undergo manual review but in either case review occurs prior to the ad running and the decision to not allow the ad to run or to take the ad down after the fact how quickly is that decision made that's probably a different answer for each of those two groups before it runs and after the fact so our reviewers have the ability to action material when they're looking at it the the really the question would be if the ad is already running and it gets reported for example from our user community if we miss something on the front end oftentimes users will report it as violating that drops it into a queue that then gets reviewed and again the reviewer can action the ad based on any policy violations the ads that were turned over to this committee this is a question for both mr. edge it from Twitter and for mr. stretch from Facebook what was the average amount of time from when the account was opened to when the decision was made to close down the account or shut down the ads what was that average amount of time how many months the at the the accounts ran from June 2015 to to 2017 so there was a length of time for the accounts in their entirety I don't have an average we'd be happy to do that sort of analysis and come back to you because that's an important question Election Day is a specific date to polls close at a specific time we live in a breakneck media environment today being able to identify and shut down down those ads quickly is incredibly important to solving this going into 2018 thank you at least I'm expired to mr. heck

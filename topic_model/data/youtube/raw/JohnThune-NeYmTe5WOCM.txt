thank you madam chair and ranking member bullsman for holding today's hearing to consider the nutrition programs in the farm bill I also want to thank our USDA panelists for appearing before the committee today and let me just if I can direct this Deputy under secretary Dean to you SNAP benefits are generally provided in one monthly allotment the data suggested correlation between the consumption of SNAP benefits and outcomes like academic performance for example Research indicates that student performance tapers the farther snap recipients get from the date of their SNAP benefit transfer so I'm reviewing whether Congress should look at how to provide States the authority to distribute SNAP benefits and two allotments per month for recipients who would like to receive their benefits and two installments instead of one lump sum payment and I believe this could help improve program outcomes by incentivizing healthy food purchases and boosting educational performance among recipients could also help us to Demand on grocery stores and make it harder for groceries price hikes that could be aligned with the dates of SNAP benefit distribution so the question is do you agree that program outcomes could improve as snap recipients of the option to receive split issuance rather than only once a month and and then any other ideas you would have for improving snap outcomes that you're talking about and I just want to flag that of course that was done before our adjustment to the Thrifty food plan where we now really are much more confident that the benefit will is adequate to purchase and cover the costs or supplement the costs of a healthy diet throughout the month so it'd be interesting to see what the issues are there you met you're flagging a provision of the law that Congress passed I believe it was in the 2008 farm bill to prohibit splitting issuance into more than one allotment I think the concern then there was the issue the impact on participants and stores the issue of potentially The increased cost of shopping particularly rural areas say if a household has to drive a long way to a store disrupting household budgets the cost of issuing twice States would be charged twice by their processors but um and potentially visit to emergency food but now with the benefit being a perhaps our current estimate of an adequate level um and if one could address some of those concerns Maybe by giving households the option to choose if there would uh it seems it feels it seems interesting to explore whether uh Shifting the issuance um uh I guess I guess my answer is I don't know I would want to talk more with your staff about it but the Congress did make the decision to prohibit it out of concern of what the impact on households would be so which I know is something you would want to address yeah and I think if we could would like to continue that discussion with you on that subject um both Congress and the executive branch have implemented processes to serve as checks and balances on federal spending your biography notes that you served as a budget Analyst at the Office of Management budget and given your experience I'm sure you understand the important role that OMB plays in overseeing the outlay of tax dollars so according to the government accountability office the the Thrifty food plan or tfp re-evaluation you oversaw allowed plan costs to increase Beyond inflation for the first time resulting in a 21 increase in SNAP benefits so I guess the question is what input did OMB provide is USDA made tfp changes that are expected to cost approximately 250 billion dollars more over 10 years of the reevaluation was done by a very technical team within USDA we did consult with OMB along the way um most of they and they did provide us some economic analysis support throughout but uh I'm not but I ultimately OMB was very supportive of the change again directed by Congress and it was the first adjustment in purchasing power for low-income households in over 45 years we I think they shared with us the um uh uh the confidence that this would put healthy food within reach for Millions more households and we're pleased with the impact it had on poverty so but they just to your point to to to uh confirm that they did sign off when be signed off on on that that was a technical term sir so uh we'd probably want to uh check in but we were we uh we absolutely uh were collaborated with them uh throughout the process so happy to get you the official official phrase that would be helpful because it's I mean it's a quarter of a trillion dollar increase um unilateral decision made by an agency it seems like they would you know obviously be want to be engaged in that as my time has expired uh Madam chair so thank you

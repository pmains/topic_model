new nbc news poll that shows that the tide appears to be turning on the idea of a public option in health care in fact more americans 47 percent now oppose a public option than favor it you see the numbers right there and 54 of americans are more concerned that the government will go too far in reforming the nation's health care system then it won't go far enough with me now live to talk about all this is congresswoman maxine waters of california congresswoman waters good to see you again thank you good to see you guys water so what do you make of this because the president certainly has put forth a meaningful amount of effort over the last several weeks including going to various parts of the country we saw him in new hampshire we saw him in colorado we saw him in montana but he seems to be losing uh the message war is it time to effectively retreat on the public option question and get through some kind of health care reform that perhaps doesn't include a public option absolutely absolutely not as a matter of fact the insurance companies got a head start and they got to jump on us they went up with their ads they did a great job of convincing many people that somehow the government was going to take over it was going to be too expensive it was not the thing to do and so they got a jump they got a head start but now we began to fight back and you will see those polls change because people don't know absolutely what a government option is what that means we've got to define it we've got to keep talking about it we've got to help the american people to understand that the insurance companies have basically taken advantage of the american people we have 47 million people without insurance but more than that the cost of end of the premiums have increased tremendously over the past several years more profits for the insurance companies the top 10 ceos of the insurance companies healthcare insurance are making over 10 million dollars a year so we've got to fix this broken system and i think that the american people will get the truth as we continue to talk about it but isn't the the message that has really not come through in this whole presentation of a health care reform bill the fact that we have to find a way to cut costs and that the public option is probably the most effective way to cut costs because of the competition it will present to the insurance companies that message do you agree has not come through absolutely we have not as i said the insurance companies through their ads and even those elected officials who were representing the insurance company interest got out of in front of us they have been able to undermine our efforts to describe a public option we've got to do a better job of explaining it waters if you uh look forward here are there republicans you spent a lot of time uh on capitol hill are there republicans that you think the president maybe has bypassed who could be part of a bipartisan solution in other words has he focused too much on the usual suspects and are there some unusual suspects maybe a retiring senator like mel martinez of florida or others who could be part of an unusual coalition well let me just say this if there's any president that's reached across the aisle and tried very hard to get support on this issue and other issues is this president president obama has been extremely forceful in trying to get support from the republicans they just are not coming around and it's not simply about health care uh reform in my opinion it's because it's a political issue with many of them they've decided this is the way to bring this president down they are being the loyal opposition on this issue because they are centered and focused on taking back the white house congressman waters final question we have about 30 seconds here but if president obama comes to you and other members of the democratic caucus over the next three or four weeks and says no one wants health care reform more than i do but the reality is i can't get it done with a public option i need to do it without a public option i'll come back to that later but i can't get it done without a public option will you and i need your vote will you vote to support him uh on that and will you vote for health care reform that does not include a public option what you have seen is an opportunity i mean a chance by the white house to basically kind of put that message out there and see what would happen and let me tell you what happened when they floated it what happened was that was a great pushback from the progressives in this party from the leadership of this party and i think they have seen very clearly that they must have a public option in order to get this bill passed and so no i am not going to fold on that i'm not going to give in i'm going to be very strong i'm going to work with the others who i think are in the majority in our caucus to make sure that we get a public option that's what we've got to have in order to create competition so that we can drive down the cost of health care insurance congressman waters thank you so much for joining us look forward to seeing you again soon thank you

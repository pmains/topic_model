they're king thank you and I want to just begin and thank my the chair and ranking for your strong statements at the beginning of this hearing about the problem on the border with the family separation I I have a particular feeling about this because I worked as a missionary in Honduras in 1980 and 81 and a lot of the kids and families who are coming to the southern where the United States are coming from Honduras and because I'm still very connected there I know why they're coming they live in neighborhoods in a very very poor country whose institutions have been completely corrupted by something in the ambit of this committee the sad reality of Americans desire to buy illegal drugs and if we buy illegal drugs that are manufactured in Mexico or Columbia as those drugs transit south-to-north the dollars that Americans pay to buy illegal drugs transit north to south and they go into these countries that are so poor and they corrupt Police Department's judiciary's they create gang wars and kids in these neighborhoods and towns like El Progreso where I worked they don't want to leave their country they don't to leave their home and their parents don't either but if you have to choose between your kid getting killed in the crossfire of a gun war or some chance that they might have a better life somewhere else you make that very very wrenching decision these Hondurans are Salvadorans or Guatemalans are coming to the border they generally come in one of two ways they come many not to break the law but to seek refuge under the laws of this country they're not lawbreakers they're they're trying to apply they may or may not be granted asylum or refugee status but they're trying to comply with American laws there should not be a penalty of separating families for trying to avail yourself of asylum laws of this country and yes some come and their parents bring them over the border illegally and that is a misdemeanor but nowhere else in our system in this country do we take children away from parents who are charged with a misdemeanor and so this policy that is a completely invented policy of this administration is just absolutely heartless a couple of days before Father's Day this article appeared in The New York Times Honduran man kills himself after being separated from family at US border crossed into the United States with a wife and a three-year-old and as they were separated was so distraught that he killed himself hung himself in his jail cell we talked about the effect upon children of the separation what about the effect upon parents losing their kids and so to Senator Murray and Senator Alexander who is now on the floor thank you for stating strongly the need that we should act in accord with our values and our laws and support families this is an important hearing but the urgent urgency of this issue compels a congressional urgency in providing a fix if the president won't do it we have to we're not the article two and a half ranch we don't have to wait around where the article one branch and we should act like it

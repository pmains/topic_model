for school I want to bring in congressman brad Sherman he is the former chairman of the Subcommittee on terrorism and a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee he has seen this threat that was emails Los Angeles schools he is also a congressman from California Congressman thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us can you tell me what you saw in the email can you be specific welder there are two issues here first the person making the threat claims to be the extremist Muslim just and there are reasons to doubt that there is in in in the whole text of the email there is a pornographic reference to a body part that this person claims to be a devout Muslim I don't think that that that's consistent there is certainly nothing the text of the email that shows that the person who wrote it has any particular understanding of Islam so this could be sent by an extremist jihadist but it could also be sent by someone with a gender the second issue is this person claims that they're going to you know they've prepared to take terrible action today at Beast some of the details lack credit on the threat black credibility a claim that he's got thirty two accomplices that's way beyond what Isis or even al Qaeda have have been able to put together in any western city a claim that they have nerve agent I'd be very surprised if if that part of the threat was true so um it may be there is some part of the threat that is true and acting in an abundance of caution makes a lot of sense baby this was sent by someone supports radical extremist john ism or maybe it was sent by somebody else so I want to be very clear on some of these extraordinary details congressman that you're sharing with us having seen this letter that the person claims to be an extremist Muslim jihadist there were pornographic references to a body part it contained in the email but it doesn't okay all right one reference and that the text does not indicate that this person has an understanding of Islam there's also a claim you said that the person and I don't know if these were your words or the words of the email that this person was going to take quote terrible action today were those your words or the emails words that's my words but they're highly consistent I mean he describes the various actions they were going to take claims to have 32 accomplices claims to have nerve agent those are extraordinary claims and at least I would suspect that some of the some of the claims that and and when you said it describes various actions they were going to take does it going but what actions other than mentioning that there are these accomplices and and nerve agent did he say I'm saying he I don't know if there's a name attached to the analogy is signed by a Islamic or or Arab name and I believe it's a male Dave that doesn't mean that this person is a male there's we don't know my part of this email is true what is false but there's a claim of bombs at backpacks there's a claim of nerve agent there's a claim of a gang 32 accomplices plus the offer so and some of those glandular you said claims of bombs bombs and backpacks innervation what was the last thing you said uh has having 32 accomplices all ready to take action are all planning to take action today congressman is absolutely astounding information to you or do you recall the name as you said it was an Arabic name or it sounded I i I've got to be careful as to as to what details should be should be revealed and I Lalibela now I respect that can I ask you this do you know I know you the congressman from California but do you know if this is the exact same email that the school superintendent in New York received they said it was generic what you're describing does not sound generic unless they will all have you sent to the only thing there is a reference to the LA Unified School District which may be why schools in Burbank beverly hills are open today and obviously if something simpler was sent to New York they would reference that particular school district so it's very specific to how we have a complicated system running schools in Los Angeles County and in most of this country as well where do you have a variety of local school districts and they walk across the street and you're in a different school district them this threat is aimed at the LA Unified stupid congressman Sherman I can't thank you enough for taking the time to share with us this extraordinary information the contents of the email that are at issue right now and have caused such a ripple effect throughout the Los Angeles little district congressman thank you for your time

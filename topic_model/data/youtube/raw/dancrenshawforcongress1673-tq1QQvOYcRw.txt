Oh a Navy SEAL served in Afghanistan so thank you so much for joining us Dan how are you doing thanks for having me we're doing well we're excited about tomorrow we're excited about the election it's been a wild day as you can imagine yeah you know where we've been answering a lot of questions but in the end this is this is about the election tomorrow this was about representing people the second district here in Texas I know you have kind of processed what was said in SNL but I'm sure you didn't know that you were gonna be the butt of that joke what was your first reaction before you intellectually process that we heard about it what was your reaction to it well the first reaction was definitely that wasn't really a funny joke it started off kind of strange and then you know it started off with me asking the question what kind of shows or programs is this guy watched that he's calling me a hit man and I anyway but then it just got ugly and in that that was a little off-putting to say the least now okay so in the SEAL Teams we make fun of each other a lot right and I told him my friend when you poke voted me I just I have some requests and one of those is that the joke is funny that it's witty that it's original all right and that it's that's not just tearing at your core just for what you look like and that's what this one did so it really wasn't a joke at all and I think that's the big disservice here it was not even funny but then I hear what you're saying that you know that the seals will make fun of each other but you guys have all been through things together I guess it's a lot different to take that joke from a fellow seal than from a guy sitting in New York who's never met you doesn't know anything about your experience have you heard anything from Pete yet an apology or anything from his people no no I have it and you're absolutely right it is very different when a fellow seal or friend or somebody who knows you has some good-natured humor with you then somebody who's never met you wants to do it on live TV to the entire nation so your instincts are right on that now he hasn't reached out I mean listen you know and I think I said this yesterday when I did that video with you guys should they apologize yeah they probably should am I going to demand and apology no I you know I do want us to get away from this culture of demanding on our hitting on our cell box and demanding apologies from people when they when they say bad things you know he's exposed who he is it is what it is if he apologizes I don't think it will be sincere I think it will be an empty apology they can do it if they want and and you know we'll be ready for that but but the answer you're quoted no they he is not Dan one of the things that struck me that nobody is talking about everybody has an axe to grind these days and everybody has an alliance and clearly SNL is is aligned more with the Democratic Party than the Republican Party they go after you know Republicans way more than they do Democrats so I'm wondering if you feel this was a partisan attack as well as a joke oh yeah I mean again your instincts are right on just objectively speaking I think they do lean to the far left and they're they're much more likely to attack Republican candidates I think if this said I think you know I think the outrage would be the same across the nation if they had done it to somebody on the left and rightfully so but they they did it to me and you know his comment right after what he said about me was well I have to appear fair so I'm going to talk about Cuomo you know and then that's you know it was pretty transparent and in the partisanship there so I think you're absolutely right you know you know the Beyonce song where she turns lemons into lemonade right yeah I'm just curious this has it I mean there are 435 people running for election in Congress and you now stand out among a small group because of what happened in SNL and in some ways there's a lot of sympathy coming your way because of it you pull in a Beyonce here I don't know if I phrase it that way I don't even know how I would pull a Beyonce is far more talented than I am but but yes you do have to make lemonade or lemons out of lemonade now I'm guessing up the saying you know it's not my favorite way to be put into the spotlight it's not ideal you know I want to be recognized for my ideas and and approach the government that I want to bring to Congress I want to be recognized for making the people of the second District proud to have somebody to have somebody Washington that yeah that they can be proud of that they can that they can look to and say he's part of the solution he's part of the problem what's your what's your take on better versus Cruz it looks like Cruz is gonna pull it out but I hate making predictions but that's what it looks like yeah this is a this is everyone's nervous about making predictions the day before because yeah I saw what happened two years ago people were making predictions so how have you seen any change in poll numbers in your in your campaign since since this happened on Saturday night it's it's frankly it's happened so fast that it would it would be difficult to measure that I feel pretty good about the election we've been campaigning hard for a year this is just you know this is the last 24 hours again we're in the spotlights on my favorite way to be in the spotlight but I you know people my voters will will not vote for me because of this they will vote for me because I've gone and seen them right I love retail politics I actually I go to restaurants I go to the beer gardens down the street and and I talk to people I go table the table I've been doing that for almost a year now it's been a lot of fun Michonne er to represent the people of the second District and I hope they choose me tomorrow okay all right look Dan thank you so much for the time really really appreciate it and thanks for talking to us yesterday as well thank you for

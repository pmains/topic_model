thank you very much for that report let's get some more in all of this with the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee congressman Adam Smith of washington state congressman thanks very much for joining us Thank You wolf but what's your response congressman to do that US troops have now come under fire from Isis terror forces in and around Mosul and that some American ships have been injured well it's not surprising I mean this was the plan that President Obama put in place they're going to have the local Iraqi forces be in the lead and then we have you know several thousand support troops there that are there to help train and advise but I mean the fight is fluid and they're not going to be able to stay completely out of it and I do think that the plan basically to roll back Isis in both Syria and Iraq is working they've lost an enormous amount of territory and I think that's important the role that US troops are playing there has thus far been successful and helpful what do you want more US troops deployed on the ground not only in Iraq but also in Syria it doesn't sound like it's necessary at the moment and again that the main point here is it has to be Iraqi forces or you know in Syria yeah we're working with the crew well put the Kurds in both Iraq and Syria it has to be led by the locals we are simply there to train advise and assist so I don't think we need to send any more troops I think we have a you know about the right amount and again but the fight has to be led by the Iraqis and you think the Iraqis can get the job done because it's what the least two years plus that the the the terrorist Isis forces have controlled the second largest city in iraq mosul we keep hearing the Iraqis are moving closer and closer to get the job done they still haven't done it yeah I don't think there's any guarantee now I mean what is a very large city they've taken significant portions of it and they have been making progress but looked at the lingering problem in Iraq is still the Baghdad government and whether or not it's going to be truly inclusive of the Sunni population in order to ultimately be successful against Isis the Sunnis in Iraq has to feel like they are part of our like the Baghdad government is supportive of them I mean that's what caused Isis to rise in the first place was when almalik you was the Prime Minister and they shut out Sunnis they threw them in jail they did not include them in the government and they made it clear they were going to be a sectarian Shia government and that's what drove the Sunnis into the arms of Isis and if Baghdad doesn't change they're going to continue to have those struggles and frankly there's nothing we can do about it and nothing we should do about it terms of sending our troops into a battle that they can't win that's a fair point congressman I like you to listen to what the White House press secretary Sean Spicer said today about safe havens for Syrian civilians in in Syrian civilians that's one of the presidents top foreign policy priorities we don't have the clip but I want I want your reaction that this is what the Trump administration was be so-called safe havens in Syria for refugees so they don't have to be sent out of Syria this is something we've talked about for a number of years since this conflict began and it's simply not as easy as it sounds because if you're going to create a safe haven that means you're going to have to have the military support in there necessary to keep not just Isis but also keep Assad in these Russian allies from attacking these areas and that means air power that means a significant commitment of US forces so I would be great obviously the the preference here is to make Syria safe enough so that the Syrians can return to their homes that's what we want I think the incoming president underestimates what it's going to take in the commitment of US forces to create those safe havens and are we prepared to do what we haven't done at this point which is to go toe-to-toe with the Assads regime and potentially with the Russians who are supporting him it's going to take more than just saying we're going to draw a line and say please stay out it's going to take an enormous commitment of money and military might to make it happen you know president said he wanted a plan to destroy and defeat Isis within 30 days it's been 30 days supposedly plan is going to be ready in the coming days we'll see meanwhile congressman a former Guantanamo prison inmate is believed to have carried out an Isis suicide attack in Mosul on Monday what can you tell us about that report we're showing our viewers some pictures of this former Gitmo prisoner he was captured in 2001 released in 2004 eventually would give it about a million british pounds offer for what he endured at Gitmo and now supposedly couple years ago he went through Turkey to Syria joined Isis and was engaged in this suicide bombing attack against Iraqi forces in which he was killed what else can you tell us about this why I think those are basically the facts I think the most important thing here are the dates that you mentioned 2001 was when he was picked up 2004 was when he was released and that both the points of two problems one we were not at all careful about you know who we rounded up and put in there and nor were we that careful about who we let go this is a conflict that we had that the British government over I forget how many there was some number of inmates there that were British citizens and they wanted them released so back in 2004 that was done yeah a lot of people take that statistic and say oh my goodness look at all of the you know wanton Oh inmates that President Obama released but all of those the President Obama released were carefully vetted and determined to be not a threat be releasable back in the early part of the Bush administration it was more chaotic and look I understand that you know after 911 you know when the Afghan war started when the Iraq war started there was a lot of chaos and uncertainty and I think this particular inmate reflects that chaos and uncertainty certainly and having let him go the way he was let go when he clearly was still a threat yes he was all right thanks very much Congress

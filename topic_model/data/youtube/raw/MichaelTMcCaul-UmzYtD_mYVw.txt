I want to thank chairman McCaul fur is initiative with this bill and his persistence and reintroducing it and especially his patients today and I recognize it now for five minutes I think the Chairman and dr. Chang when we say thank you for your service on the CSI as Commission to the nation and to the University of Texas in Austin and miss benzyl i agree with you our adversaries removing forward moving ahead they're attacking our federal agencies every day in support and building a record and support of this legislation I see this bill doing several things applying NIST standards to the federal government it provides bolsters research and development in this area a private sector university federal task force education and awareness piece and procurement standards within the federal government and I'd like to go through each of you and you could tell me how you believe if you do that this legislation will advance the cause for enhancing a cybersecurity for this nation mr. Barrett I I would give a very brief on so which is um well maybe not quite separation in general philosophically we think that cybersecurity does dr. Chang said it's a wicked problem and as such there is probably no single bill that could be passed that will on its own materially change the trend line but on the other hand the sort of lack of a grand unification theory shouldn't stop us from doing good work and this bill would definitely appear to be falling into that place where it does no harm and it also does good work in the specific areas is chosen it's very good point i think asserted on the speaker's cyber security task force and our first axiom was to do no harm by legislation so i appreciate you saying that dr. Chang thank you so I in advance of reading the bill if I could have picked two things that are critical to improving the nation's cyber security posture it would be research and development and workforce development and so this legislation to me is just you know just right on target relative to addressing the top two problems i guess i would add as i mentioned in my spoken testimony the notion that we need to be patient about this you know this the it is i guess it would be great if we could sort of plant a forest and all of all the trees turn into something that result in wonderful research but we this legit legislation as important in that is at least planting of few trees it allows us to plant some few things that will you know grow into the future I ruchira it to be sitting here 10 years from now 20 years from now we're still saying that we actually don't understand causes we don't understand solutions we don't understand countermeasures and this legislation i believe begins planting a few trees thank you and thanks for making the point about the cyber workforce in the federal government i think that's very important as well miss ben zone yeah thank you for the opportunity and thank you for your perseverance in this area I agree with my colleagues there is no one answer it's a very difficult field but I was quite very impressed to see this particular bill in two areas that I would call out and one is the technology transfer recognition of the difficulty of that problem and I have worked in a number of different public-private partnerships over the years I was a part of the peak his committee back in the early 2000s I see that the opportunity here to do some real planning around university kinds of partnerships and bringing the university's into it so it's a three try part aspect is very exciting in the bill the other one is in the science of cybersecurity and understanding that there's a need for research and development kinds of test beds and experimentation that's called out in the bill for experimental science I think technology transfer an experimental cybersecurity have a chance to be fundamentally changing and of course the education and training are important to let me thank the witnesses for your expertise and for appearing here today mr. chairman thank you for allowing me to participate in this here and even though I don't sit on the subcommittee and I look forward to the markup and hopefully overwhelmingly passage of the bill and signed into law by the president thank you

thank you mr russell once more man how impressive is that i feel like you're the lebron james of secondary and primary school teaching so uh just hats off to you uh as that said um dr goldhamer um okay you say that five months is the average for children with dyslexia versus an average of two months for all students what if you just compare students uh who are lower socioeconomic class versus higher socioeconomic class what is the difference in math progression uh in that spread if you will well actually it's the the comparison was not for dislike students with disabilities i'm sorry i should i should have been lower socioeconomic class lower socioeconomic versus higher socioeconomic if you just compare those two without the overall average what is the difference oh the the difference is you know and and these are are round about um but but roughly you know five five five five and a half months behind for um students in high poverty schools um versus you know more like a month and a half to two months in for students that are in low poverty schools but did you but in a low poverty school that is a mix of students that are those children who are both from poorer families as well as those who are richer it's just that the average is that the students are richer were you able to differentiate again between students who come from a census tract of high poverty versus a census tract of low poverty in in our study we couldn't um differentiate at the the individual school level based on poverty okay let me let me stop you there because i have limited time this wall creates a very compelling case that children with disability disability or disability in general are particularly vulnerable did any of your research look at the impact upon children with now i will go to dyslexia but just pick learning disability in general versus those who did not have a learning disability again i don't want to rely on our research but i've read a lot of research by other researchers and um the answer is that more vulnerable students were clearly made worse off by the pandemic it's not clear that that's solely about what was going on in the schools as i i think you mentioned in your opening remarks um some of this may be about what was happening in the homes from folks from different backgrounds too did you track and you're um we've talked about the 8.1 percent of children leaving public schools but we've seen an uptick of about 240 000 of children going into charter schools and uh and anecdotally there's been increased enrollment in private and parochial schools did your data track the migration of such students no that was not uh the focus of our work and and miss tucker did in your experience in connecticut have you tracked i i don't know of the fallen enrollment in in in public schools in connecticut uh but assuming that there was some decrease in enrollment did you track what percent of those students who are no longer in public school are either in a charter a private or parochial school thank you senator for the question we have a really robust data system that allows us to do data tracking of our students specifically we've looked to see when we did an assessment in the previous year basically how students did based on their learning models we've looked uh our our enrollments are down and also now coming back up and we're able to disaggregate i don't have those specific numbers for you but we're able to disaggregate our data and we're able to tell how all those student groups are performing and to the point that was made earlier certainly they were all impacted or student with disabilities and i know it's a concern of yours we're disproportionately impacted why it's an area and a student group that we're working very hard to address those needs but but specifically were you able to track whether or not the children who disenrolled from a public school subsequently enrolled in a charter i don't know if you have charters assuming that you do a charter a private or religious school we i don't have that level of data i did okay let me stop let me stop you there um i happen to know that the people who literally wrote the book on dyslexia doctor and dr sheawoods are in yale um and one in five children are affected by dyslexia so um i don't know if you scream first the first part of the question is if you scream for dyslexia and secondly do you have specific data as regards how those children did during the kind of remote learning period subsequent to the remote learning period did they fall further behind than their peers independently of their income level of the family so we've looked at the student with disabilities we can disaggregate i don't have the information specifically for students identified with dyslexia but those are student with disabilities in general uh certainly were disproportionately impacted and and do you do does connecticut screen and then subsequently test to confirm if somebody is dyslexic do you confer do you um screen children for dyslexia that is occurring i it is an area of concern for us this past session an office of dyslexia and reading disabilities was placed by our legislature in our office to really get closer to those issues to work with also higher education make sure that our teachers okay i'm sorry she's about to rein me in okay uh and and and do you can you tell me what percent of your students have been identified as dyslexic i don't have that specific number for you but we'll get that to you i suspect there'll be a second round so i've healed

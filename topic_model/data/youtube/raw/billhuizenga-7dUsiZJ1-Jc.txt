congressman highs ago about shock which to the second we have some other issues first yes well it's been just more than a week since the United States Navy SEAL successfully took out Osama bin Laden yes his death has been all around DC and really all around the world and this discussion of whether those photos of his dead body should be released to questions surrounding our nation's security so joining us this morning again representative bill highs ago with more on just really what's been going on in Congress since bin Laden's death good to see you man yeah good to see you as well yeah I'm sorry I should have done a little shopping yeah I had my camera ain't no running man like music I don't even know that more serious things out of course all the talk about Osama bin Laden your thoughts now the president has said hey we're not going to show the photos what are your thoughts yeah actually I think it was probably a prudent move to to do that that we needed to have the proof in case there was anybody whether it was in the Western world or the Arab world saying no it really wasn't him and that we had those question marks out there but you've had his family come forward you've had the al Qaeda organization itself come forward and say yes it was him so I don't see the purpose I don't see what good comes out of it so I support that now I did ask however I did ask mike rogers who is the chairman of the Intelligence Committee he's the one that took pete Hoekstra splice he's from michigan also i said mike is it him right are we sure we got them and he said no there's no doubt you know both the DNA and the photographic and then the family this was last week so then the families and those kinds of things were starting to to pop up so yeah we we know it's him now I think a lot of people are wondering okay if Pakistan had this compound for the past five years and bin Laden was staying there how did they not know about this and did they not hey do anything about it or be alert their so-called ally the United States so we could come in and help them out well it's pretty clear to me that Pakistan is fractionalized I mean it just there is there's a lot of different opinions and you've got a lot of division both within the government and then the ISI which is their security organization and and that's that part is is coming to a head I think and we're gonna have to have some very uncomfortable conversations with with the Pakistani government and we should all right this is a not acceptable and we got to figure out what's going on let's talk about gas prices here at home everybody's hurting yeah and anything coming through Washington that is going to help yeah there you know there's a couple of things and I feel it too you know natalie and I've got five young kids and until they make a Prius that can fit the seven of us we're we're driving a yukon XL we can always give away so many can you know that's right and and you know I 60 bucks to fill up my little Taurus and it's it's very expensive and and obviously everybody feels it and typically when you see gasps take that kind of jump where does that where does that come out of it comes out of your grocery money and so an people are definitely feeling the pinch so what are we doing about it now one there is some limited things that we can do on a front of short term and most of it is more of a long-term thing and everybody says oh well if you do the permits and you start drilling it's going to be three or five years before we have it well guess what if we had done this three or flat five years ago you know we would be in a much different place so we've got to increase our domestic exploration and we can do it safely technology is kept up you know Canada which is our largest oil importer has tar sands or oil sands they call it up in Saskatchewan and in the prayers we have the exact same thing in the Dakotas in Pennsylvania and you tell a lot of other places they're using a technology called fracking where they go in and basically crack it apart and pull it up but we've got the federal government and EPA specifically standing in the way of a lot of those permits same thing with with Gulf exploration one of the reasons why we were out so deep is we've had to p a really limiting how close we could be into the shore and we believe it'd be safer in shallower waters we wouldn't have some of those other issues that we had with the deep sea horizon for example and then you know so that that's that's the domestic side we have to then also make sure that we are being smart how are we conserving everybody's getting a lot smarter how we're driving around and how we're using our vehicles and then then the third thing is something that we really don't it's tough to get your arms around but oil is bought and traded with one currency the US dollar around the world we've inflated our dollar and that has artificially driven up the price of oil and so what that means is we've got to get our spending under control we've got to get our monetary policy under control and just that alone you know no consumption additional consumption no additional exploration we can drive the price down if we just show some fiscal restraint so all right feel good to see you as always plain so ya see this weekend though at the tool time yes we'll be in there Saturday good thanks right thank you it is 750 from managing migraines you you

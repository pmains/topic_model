madam Speaker I rise to raise the concerns of Floridians and Georgians who still await a supplemental appropriation from the Congress every other major storm and disaster received a supplemental appropriation but for some reason victims of hurricane Michael remain waiting the air force expecting an appropriation began the process of rebuilding Tyndall Air Force Base and this morning the Air Force put out news that they have run out of onm funds what does this mean it means that as of this morning we have deferred 61 required facility projects at bases in 18 states across our country and means that on May 1st we will stop work on Tyndall Air Force Base failing to meet our obligations to rebuild it means that on May 15th the Air Force will cut aircraft repairs potentially endangering our pilot safety when flying and limiting their training capacity ultimately it means that on September 1st we will cut 18,000 training flying hours this is unacceptable in the current global environment we must act now to ensure that the men and women serving in the Air Force are furnished with the tools to accomplish their missions this is our job as the Congress and we need to do it immediately with only three legislative days remaining before the Easter break I yield back

the chair now recognizes the gentleman from Michigan mr. Mellon are Thank You mr. chairman and thank you for continuing to stay with us on this I just wanted to follow up on some questions about the ditches that we were talking about and do you have Mississippi come my favorite well you know I I think your goal was clarity but I think there is a lot of confusion out there and you know I guess the question I have is do you anticipate that a farmer a business or a local government would not face legal action for not applying for a federal permit because they believed their ditches were exempt so in other words if someone believes sincerely that their ditches it exempt will they not face legal action or what at some point the EPA rule differently well people are expected to know that that if there is a question they should ask but APA and the Army Corps are not in the business of going around in as you're implying and chasing people for this it really is a matter of trying to provide clarity the farmers and ranchers I know care about drinking water as much as I do they're not interested in polluting or destroying their interested in maintaining that for their own benefit and their own kids so this isn't a opportunity to do anything more than give them more tools and more certainty and in the process will continue to work as it's always worked would you be willing to clarify that in statute because what you're telling me today is your interpretation of the rule and someday someone else will be in your position many people throughout the country will be implementing this rule and will have different opinions on that and even though you say they won't be chasing people around there is an enforcement obligation that actually does lead them to chasing people around and so my question is would you be willing to clarify that in statute so there's no ambiguity on that I I I don't know what I'm clarify hissar all I'm telling you is how the current system works which is people are obligated to ask when there is when there is a concern in it's a marginal call this supposed to know they have to protect those waters we've made it as clear as we possibly can what water should be protected they should use that judgment ask if they're uncertain and everything will be okay well I'm going to continue to try and work with you on this because I think our goal is clarity but there is a lot of confusion out there and when there's a lot of confusion it's going to result in a lot of unintended consequences for costs for people and legal interpretations consultant fees so one of the things we're doing which which might be of interest to not happy happy to work with you on it is we're trying to develop a question and answer for folks that are asking questions so that it's it's it's available to them and it helps guide them if there's lack of clarity okay we will never get one hundred percent clear but i think we tried to get as far along as we could in making it as clear as possible so they can do their business without concern okay thank you

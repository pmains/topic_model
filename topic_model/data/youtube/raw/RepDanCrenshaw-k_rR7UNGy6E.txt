thank you madam chair always always great to be with you as well wish you could be with all you in d.c um but you know i guess that's a small benefit of this uh surgery yeah you can't go to dc for six weeks um but i do miss you guys um mr secretary thank you uh thank you for being with us i want to follow up on dr burgess's questioning on uh the situation with texas in our 11 15 waiver and i want to drill down as to as to why this happened so this was a a long-standing waiver the extension of which was rejected by by a career staffer at cms who was temporarily head of cms it doesn't seem likely that they just took it upon themselves to reject that waiver who told them to do that carson uh i wish you well and get back to dc although i i imagine you're not missing not being in dc and getting to stay in your home state but uh on the question of the waiver uh again i think it's important to recognize that texas still has its way its waiver it continues in force nothing has changed what we're talking about is an extension of 10 years that was added to the existing waiver without public comment and without notice and that was that's extraordinary when you think about it given that it was a 10-year waiver not a five-year or shorter waiver and it you're talking about billions of dollars and so what cms is doing is what you would expect cms to do is we're we're trying to make sure that we're transparent and we show accountability because we have to make sure we're following the law and we're working with uh your leadership in the state and along with your delegation try to make sure that as texas moves forward if it wants to continue the waiver we're going to be working with you to make sure we can see that happen okay so it had your full approval to to revoke that waiver that was approved by the previous submit or revoke that extension that was approved by the previous administration had the white house approval your approval it wasn't some staffer that went rogue well i i can guarantee you that there is a not a staffer that's going rogue but remember much of much of the work that was done uh was done before i was confirmed but what i will tell you is i concur with the actions that were taken by cms in in looking closely and working with texas to look closely at the waiver that they've asked for as an extension again they're existing we understand there might be disagreements on the interpretation of the powers under kovitt right they approved it in a fast-track way under cope that that's what happened your administration disagrees with that interpretation so be it but but to but to revoke an entire waiver which has a massive effect for the for the future of texas programs i mean it it it puts us into a very difficult situation because our entire system is is predicated on this particular waiver um and it's a long-standing waiver too you know it's yes it's an extension of a long-standing waiver this isn't some extreme thing what is extreme is revoking an extension which has never been done before so you know if you have it you have a procedural issue with it i get that but to take such such an extreme action as a result is is really hard for protections to understand and can you commit right now that if they resubmit uh that it'll get approved well we're we're closely working with texas to make sure if they wish to resubmit they can but uh congressman i i would have to say that anytime you're talking about getting an extension two years in advance uh and using covid as the reason why you had to do it without giving americans a chance to know know about it or to comment that's to me is a stretch i all i know is that we we have to abide by the law at hhs and at cms we have to be transparent in the way we do it all we're asking is that texas participate with us to make sure that that transparency is there i mean they applied for it under the letter of the law if they resubmit can you guarantee that that that it will be approved if they resubmit it according to the law as they already did if and when texas resubmits we will look at that according to the law and we'll go through the process that provides for notice and comment so we can make sure that we get the input of all stakeholders to make sure that whatever texas does complies with the law and as a support of those who are going to be impacted my last question you seem to indicate earlier that you actually do not support or do not recognize the statute on partial birth abortions can we answer that more clearly now yes or no do you recognize the statute uh that outlaws partial birth abortions so uh again trying to be as clear as i can on this there are procedures that are used in providing women with the health care they need including when they have uh really that's a very clear statute mr secretary please don't waver on this the congress the supreme court has already has already spoken on this particular statute do you recognize it yes or no well i certainly recognize what the supreme court has said and we will abide by what the supreme court requires and we're going to make sure that we protect women's rights to health care the gentleman's time has expired we thank you for these questions uh and um heal and be well um the chair is now pleased to recognize

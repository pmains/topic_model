so today we struck a deal on the u.s. MCA and let me be clear I am still going to support it it's too important of a trade deal to pass up however I need you to know something you need to understand what the Democrats viewed as a negotiating win get this so a fundamental part of the u.s. MCA as it was originally negotiated was patent protection okay specifically with biological drugs made in the u.s. in the u.s. patents last for 12 years okay under the previous NAFTA deal those protections only went out to five years in Canada and Mexico which meant they could copy our drugs and give their own citizens cheaper drug prices at the expense of Americans when we renegotiated the u.s. MCA we extended that to ten years which means that it was good for Americans all Americans not just the ones making the drugs but for the people who actually buying them okay because we were no longer paying for Canadians and Mexicans to get cheaper copycat drugs in the recent negotiation the Democrats didn't like that and instead they renegotiated it to be zero years we no longer have protections for our companies making cutting-edge drugs it means that in Mexico and Canada now they can simply copy those drugs it doesn't have to go through the FDA and Mexican citizens and Canadian citizens can get access to the drugs that American companies have spent money putting research and development in what is this do to our drug crisis it increases our drug prices it's great for Canadians and Mexicans and it's great for you if you happen to be traveling to Mexico or Canada and you want a copycat drug that hasn't been vetted by the FDA but that doesn't apply to most people okay you have to know that the Democrats consider this a win it's not a win for America again I'm still gonna vote for the US MCA the deal is too big not to but I want you to know that Ruth about what Democrats considered a win in negotiations

Thank You secretary Perry yesterday I sent you a letter on current Yucca Mountain activities and expenditures and an update on expenditures that would be associated with a restarted Yucca Mountain licensing proceeding it's important that my constituents have an accurate understanding of the balances of the accounts for nuclear waste disposal and what expenditures are being made in regards to Yucca Mountain the absence of congressional direction would you commit to giving this letter your attention and providing a quick response within the next two weeks I've literally just have it in my hand this morning and I'm gonna review it and give you as timely a response as possible so thank you thank you your budget recommends spending a hundred twenty million to bring high-level nuclear waste in Nevada and prior to your confirmation you were asked about Yucca Mountain and you stated to this committee in writing that quote I cannot at this time make an assessment about the time and costs associated with the yucca project but I am committed to learning more about the project and helping to resolve this national problem I want to focus on the first part of your answer which is the timing costs in regards to costs are you aware of the last year in which the Department of Energy completed a total system lifecycle lifecycle cost assessment for Yucca Mountain I am not let me tell you what's 2008 more than a decade ago are you aware of the detailed estimates this report included on the total costs for Yucca Mountain I'm not okay in 2007 dollars about 96 billion and it has not been adjusted for inflation are you aware that this report also indicates the Department of Energy will need thirteen point five billion again in 2007 dollars and ten years just to obtain a construction authorization and license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission I take your word for it senator thank you one of the many yet to be addressed concerns regarding engineering safety and cost pertains to do ease design for titanium drip shields that are supposed to sit over each of the thousands of waste canisters in yucca mountains underground tunnels to keep out corroding water no plan has been made to design these structures no pay for has been determined which is particularly crucial considering the amount of material required has been said to exhaust the nation's supply of titanium and no plan has been made on how to install the shields this unacceptable state of affairs was detailed by former NRC commissioner Victor Galinski and a bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Journal article in November 2014 has any such consideration like this been made senator I would tell you that in the decade that's passed since that report that you're making reference to that a lot of technologies changed and I don't want to Department of Energy done a consideration or analysis based on that to put cost associated with it no okay and if you're going to make a budget request to restart licensing for a facility that requires such expensive innovative engineering wouldn't it be more appropriate to lay all of these considerations before Congress before asking for more money I think what we're asking senator is that these dollars are for the the the licensing side that the NRC's working on and and for our for our operational side of it just to cover the cost of that it's not to to be looking at the the structural issues that are that are involved there that may or may not be so in that regard Department of Energy feel confident in the current license application for Yucca Mountain or would it need to submit a new application for changes I think we would be going forward with the licensing process as the law requires us to and you know I think is the revolutional cost associated with it not that I'm aware of with the environmental impact statements for the project require any updates I would suggest it probably wouldn't does the Department of Energy even have a final design for the facility no so why should Congress agree to appropriate any funds without answers to any of these questions well I think this issue has been on the table for a long time and and Congress has you know Congress funds of a number of things without having a final plan done so that this is nothing out of the ordinary this is basically I appreciate that comment but I disagree I'm sitting here in Congress and I want a final plan I want to know how the money is being spent I want an analysis I want an assessment I think it's irresponsible not to ask those questions to ask for that information and it's your job to provide that information so I'm looking for it in the future if we're gonna go down this path and we've had this conversation station before III think you need to come up with concrete answers and an assessment and it costs affiliated with it for many things that are happening right now with Department of Energy and I don't and I just agree with some of the comments you've made and have concerns and echo some of the concerns with my colleagues with respect to the budget cuts that are being that are occurring and being requested for the Department of Energy and the impact it's going to have in Nevada as well thank you I noticed my time is up

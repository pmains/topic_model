with us now we've got the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia and Senator you know it's interesting the president's talking about the media the the the idiots in the media a lot of those actually work at Rupert Murdoch backed media outlets and I guess Donald Trump is calling Rupert Murdoch an idiot I guess Donald Trump is calling Rupert Murdoch the purveyor of fake news because you even had the Wall Street Journal Fox News the New York Post attacking the president for being Putin's Patsy for being Putin's poodle I think one of the most surprising things and I want to get your reaction see if you agree with The Wall Street Journal editorial page that Congress needs to implement a containment policy not only for Vladimir Putin but for Donald Trump well Joe I agree and there are a number of us who warned about this we said why would you send in Donald Trump who prides himself on not doing any preparation against a trained KGB agent 18 years as leader of his country he would come in prepped and I was terrified and I think this may have what happened is Putin will come in with facts with details he would might have come in with a map of Ukraine and Syria and he Trump got played he got played for a fool and he embarrassed our country and frankly embarrassed lots of my colleagues across the board Democrats Republicans alike so we are going to need to figure out ways to put some constraints we've we took some actions this past week past two weeks reinforcements for NATO that didn't do much in terms of Trump's approach to NATO we sent our message saying no way you're gonna turn over American diplomats to Russian officials that was unanimous but I'd say that builds upon our Senate intelligence committees work that has reinforced the intelligence community's conclusion that not only did the Russians intervene in our elections but they intervene to help Trump and hurt Clinton and that unanimous agreement from our Senate Intel committee has also been reinforced by Facebook by Twitter by Google who've all acknowledged Russians misused their platforms so wonder why mr. Trump continues to be willing to kind of kowtow to this autocrat does he not understand that our allies in Europe are not only defense allies but we're allies in democracies in terms of belief in a free press one-person one-vote open society all things that frankly Putin stands against and it scares the Dickens out of me that it seems like Trump continual continues to side with Putin and of course in that press conference again the Donald Trump was talking about how tough he was with standing next to Vladimir Putin but the fact was that he undercut his intelligence community he said that he didn't think that Vladimir had no reason to believe that Vladimir Putin had interfered with the 2016 elections and that's something that again going back to media outlet that seen as an ally of Donald Trump Rupert Murdoch's New York Post attacked him for taking a quote see no evil approach I think I think it's a fair characterization because there were no shades of gray here this was a very weak performance by Donald Trump kowtow to a Russian leader I mean think about this in a historical context if John F Kennedy had said and accepted an accreta Nikita Khrushchev then Soviet leaders allegation that there were no missiles in Cuba the country in the world been very different if Ronald Reagan had said to then Soviet leader you know Gorbachev hey keep the wall you figure out when you want to reform your own country our world would be very different America is where it's at because for the last 75 years America has been the leader of the West standing up to Soviet and then Russian aggression that all in many ways disappeared this past Monday gentleman like my question for you senator Ward John Hammond hey my question is twofold first is the first fold is what does it say to you that given what President Trump now says about his grudging acceptance of the intelligence community's assessment of what happened in 2016 that he is now in the same week turned around and offered not punishment but a reward to Vladimir Putin by giving him a summit in Washington DC and second what can we do to find out what else those two leaders talked about in the two hours without anybody else but interpreters present let's take both those what I think it's outrageous that the president is rewarding Putin with another meeting before the election particularly since Dan coats and other intelligence community leaders and for that matter the social media platforms have indicated the Russians will be back they were successful in 2016 in terms of sowing disarray in our electoral process and the fact that in a normal administration with this kind of threat for example there'd be somebody in the White House designated on election security there would be somebody designated to work better with social media companies to make sure that we're protected against the kind of misinformation and disinformation that's not happening we're trying to do that in a bipartisan way out of our Senate Intel committee but that's a huge ongoing concern and then the notion that that he was willing to or wasn't going to at least think about the idea of turning over an American diplomat to Russian authorities it's just you don't need to think about that that's a straight out no unacceptable particularly when we the work that Bob Muller is done with the 12 Russian agents Russian spies GRU agents that we've got documentation on those individuals yes we need to pursue them I'm not sure that Putin's gonna actually turn them over to us but it is a warning signal that the Russians were successful in 2016 and every indication is they'll be back in 2018 and my feeling is again this president's getting played senator it's Jonathan Lemire let's follow up on Jon's point here on there's a lot of concerns about what the president may have said in this private meeting with Hooten the only other people there were interpreters there's been an idea suggested that a subpoena may be issued to these translators to get them to testify as to what they heard but you know that of course is not their skillset it's a real-time thing they're translating is they're not taking notes they're not necessarily the most reliable witnesses I want to get your tape why do you think that would be effective you know is it appropriate and what sort of precedent might it set going forward for future one-on-one summits between not just this president but future presidents and other leaders which is something that happens from time to time no you're right there have been one-on-one meetings between Russian leaders and American presidents in the past but generally those American presidents go in prep prepared they have their teams they think about the meetings with advance warning and I think there is a yes if the translator can testify or present their their version of what's happened I think we need to get that because this is such an extraordinary case I also think we need a readout from Mike Pompeo from John Huntsman from other members of the president's team who were there again I feel somewhat bad for some of the intelligence community leaders all who've accepted that Russian intervened like dan coates and the CIA director and the FBI director the NSA director but then this president constantly undercuts them by his behavior and performance not only in Helsinki but what's equally embarrassing his performance after the fact senator Donny Deutsch nice to chat with you in the backdrop they don't know if anybody could see it you're at the opportunity 2020 conference democratic leaders getting together the kind of shape where the party's going in 2020 we were talking about messaging earlier I have a concern when I see the kind of the frontrunner presidential faces the Bernie Sanders the Elizabeth Warren's what happened in one of the New York congressional districts that there's going to be a tendency for the party there are really lean hard hard hard left which i think is an electoral mistake I love your thoughts on where you see this going and what 2020 is trying to do well Donny I think that we need to get out of this false choice of red vs. blue or left versus right I think our politics in the insecurity that Donald Trump has played so well upon is because people are uncertain about the future globalization technology automation I think the Democrats have got to be willing to lean into the future those issues are not going away the Democrats that'll be the party that says we want to give everybody in this country an opportunity to earn earn a good life and so that means we need to address not only why Trump is bad and I think people disagree with Trump I think they agree with democratic values in terms of immigration in terms of fairness but I think we also have an economic theory that says yes we have to address economic inequality and there are ways we can do that through the government there's also ways we can do it in terms of rewarding businesses that look for long-term value rather than simply short-term ransom we need to look at a tax code that says if you buy a computer that's an asset you invest in a human being that's a cost so we ought to think business and government action together I think we got to look at economic insecurity which i think is one of the great unspoken questions nobody's gonna work for the same job for 35 years the way my dad did yet we had a social contract that basically said the only way you're gonna get benefits is if you work full-time 1/3 of the American workforce today doesn't work full-time they work part-time independent contractors gig workers we need a new social contract that basically is built upon portable benefits and finally we need to realize there's a crisis of opportunity in this country parts of this country New York Boston San Francisco they're doing great but something is wrong when 75% of all the venture capital goes to three states Massachusetts California and New York and when less than 1% of the venture capital I used to be a venture capitalist goes to African Americans that is going to present a crisis of opportunity we've got wide swaths of prosperity but 2,000 of the 3,000 counties in America have not seen a net job increase in the last ten years Democrats ought to be about spreading that opportunity economic and security yes taking on economic inequality but it's going to take a forward leaning and frankly pro-growth agenda that's going to do that and I might add along the way something I've spent a lot of time on recently these questions around national security America just spent seven hundred and thirteen billion dollars on our defense budgets largest-ever Russia spends six to seven billion I sometimes wonder are we buying the world's best 20th century military in terms of planes tanks trucks when we've seen that conflict in the 21st century particularly with near pure adversaries like Russia and China there are peers already in the realm of cyber in this information in distant permission we need a national security agenda for the 21st century all right Senator Mark Warner as always thank you for being with us we appreciate it

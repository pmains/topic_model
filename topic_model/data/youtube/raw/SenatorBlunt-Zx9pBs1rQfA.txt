let me say first of all a remarkable event at the being recognized at the white house today to have two middle eastern countries be the first two countries in decades i think since jordan decades ago recognized israel to recognize israel to begin to have economic and travel exchanges between their country and israel on a normal daily basis i think from the point of view the president it shows his willingness to think totally outside of the box and from the point of view of the two governments involved both bahrain and the uae a real effort to find out how to reach out and become more tolerant as societies i think it is a significant point forward in what can and will and is happening in the middle east and i want to be grateful to the president's leadership and what the state department and others have done in our country but what israel what the uae and what bahrain have done being recognized today a really significant development and on the vaccine front the testing front the therapeutics front we'll be having a hearing tomorrow in the appropriations committee that i chair with admiral jawah with bob dr catlin from hhs dr redfield from cdc and the questions will be what is the plan to distribute vaccine when we get it are we in fact on track to have tens of millions of easy to take and quick response test by october and what is the the uh the determination as to how we'll prioritize who gets that the vaccine first and i think what we're going to see is a fully vetted absolute fda commitment to a vaccine that people can be secure in we're going to then have that vaccine earlier than we would have otherwise because of its early investment in the vaccines we think are most likely to be approved and of course we'll only go forward with vaccines that are approved but they'll be available months earlier than they otherwise would have been we're going to ask all of those questions tomorrow i think the news here is good but part of the job of the congress is continue to insist on timetables and deadlines and specific information as to what we're going to do and when we're going to do it and how quickly we'll be able to follow up on delivering new tests new therapeutics or the vaccines when we have them

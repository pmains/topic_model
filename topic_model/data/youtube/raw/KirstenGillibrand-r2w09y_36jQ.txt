you put out this tweet that we need to abolish the Electoral College I know that you're supporting an amendment to do that but the argument against it is that big states would have a whole lot more influence than small states are you worried about that no and there's a lot of ways that big big states and small states balance power in fact every state has two senators it doesn't matter if they only have six hundred thousand people or 20 million people like New York State you have the same two senators so you have a very significant influence in legislation and governing and making sure your state has full representation but in terms of my presidential campaign I intend to campaign everywhere the rural areas the suburban areas and the cities I will go to the places that no one else bothers to go to and that's what I've already done I've been in the north country in New Hampshire I've been in the rural areas in Iowa I've been to Michigan already at Nevada already and I will continue to do that because the truth is you aren't going to be President of the entire United States you must represent everyone but I do believe our Constitution is rooted in the notion it's one person one vote and for the outcomes of our election not to reflect actually the number of votes received by candidates it seems really misplaced so I think we need to look at the electoral college and we need to reform it and I really believe it should be one person one vote

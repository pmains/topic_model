i'm joined now by kentucky senator rand paul senator thank you very much for being here tonight you know i mean brianna taylor was not the the subject of an investigation when these detectives came to the apartment she was with her boyfriend they had been looking into possible drug connections with her former boyfriend who lived several miles away what how does this decision sit with you tonight senator well you know i've been a long time advocate of getting rid of no knock raids i know in your lead up to this they say it wasn't necessarily a no knock raid however it's a high risk raid going in after midnight looking for possession of drugs and i think it's not worth losing the life of a police officer or someone inside the house so i'm just not in favor of doing this in in search of drug possession i don't think it's worse the the loss of life with regard to louisville though i'm kind of saddened to see the fires i hope we can begin to heal on this i've been calling for weeks for the national guard to be out i think the governor has not taken that seriously i hope there will be enough national guard to prevent the destruction downtown in louisville it's a great city and i hope i hope it doesn't catch on fire more than what we see so far i mean the way that the attorney general daniel cameron laid out the findings and it's worth reiterating that this is the decision of the grand jury this is not the decision of the attorney general they investigated they brought forth the information before this grand jury the fbi also did an investigation and those findings were made available to this grand jury but what do you say to people in louisville tonight who are upset with what even led up to them being at that apartment and feel that it was a situation that got out of control and that there's nothing being done to fix that i know you've tried to address that but what would you say that take to them tonight to these people who are obviously very upset i think this was a bad situation where we put police into a bad situation and also the people on the other side of the door beyond a tailor and her boyfriend in a bad situation the best way to do this is to reform the law so louisville has banned no knock grades now they're looking at how this warrant was obtained i've introduced federal legislation also to get rid of no knock raids to try to prevent some tragedy like this from happening again so i think we are responding in a way the specific details you know i can't judge guilt or innocence and ultimately this isn't the end this is the beginning a jury will have to decide that but those details are best left to a jury without politicians and everybody else weighing in on guilt or innocence but i don't want this to happen again and i am working hard to try to make sure either federal law or local law prevents us from happening well we remember when you were accosted by protesters in the street who wanted you to chant her name and they were obviously not aware of the work that you had been doing on behalf of these no knock grades on the brianna taylor act which you which you initiated um i want to ask you a little bit about kovid and the hearings on the hill today which you were part of this is an exchange that you had with dr fauci how could we possibly be jumping up and down and saying oh governor cuomo did a great job he had the worst death rate in the world no you misconstrued that senator and you've done that repetitively in the past because they are looking at the guidelines that we have put together or they've developed enough community immunity i challenge that uh senator because this happens with senator rand all the time that in new york it's about 22 percent if you believe 22 is hurt immunity i believe you're alone in that so uh you went after him on the subject of governor cuomo and the record in new york which i think a lot of new yorkers can understand um you also went after him on this question as a doctor on how you know how what percentage does connote uh hurt immunity and you guys went back and forth on it tell me about that well the facts are the facts from the john hopkins website which is esteemed and people say as these are the facts the highest death rate in the world is in new york seventeen hundred deaths per million the u.s average about five hundred the average and are actually about six hundred now the average in sweden about five seventy but on the question of herd immunity their dismisses a dismissive of this but i'm sending over to dr fauci so he can read a little bit on this in science magazine in august three mathematicians came out with a the idea that because an infection transmis transmission of infections and immunity seem to be concentrated in younger people they tend to catch this faster and be more active and out in public more that it actually skews the formulas on herd immunity and would allow herd immunity at a much lower rate the other thing from the john hopkins website you see is new york's having no new incidents and no new deaths now he wants to say oh it's because everybody's washing their hands i don't believe that i think they were washing their hands in april we still had all these deaths so there's something going on and i can't say with certainty but over the next couple of months if there is no significant surge again without a vaccine in new york it will look like herd immunity that's what it looks like in sweden right now and it looks like this around the world when people have had a significant surge they're not getting a second surge and there are mathematicians who have looked at the formula on herd immunity in the august edition of science journal and they actually say you know what herd immunity may come much lower than some of these experts think i think it's fascinating and i think only time will really tell i did read that study as well before i let you go can you give us your thoughts on the hunter biden investigation that was there was a preliminary report on the findings and it didn't seem to find anything that connected him to anything illegal well i don't know i think riding on air force two and doing business is illegal i think that is against the law and probably a felony i think it's illegal to take money from a russian politician's wife three and a half million dollars was it reported accurately i think the only way to determine the actual legality of this is to have it referred to the department of justice so i'm going to send the report over i don't know if the whole committee will vote for it but i'm sending the report uh tomorrow to the department of justice and we're asking for a criminal referral we want to see that if there's a criminal investigation that's justified here's this evidence look at it and then you're the lawyers for the government you decide if you have enough to prosecute but i think we should refer this for a criminal criminal investigation all right we gotta leave it there senator thank you for coming on tonight good to see you sir

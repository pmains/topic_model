representative andrew clyde george's 9th congressional district thanks for joining us oh thank you andrew it's always good to be with another andrew aye yes sir when obama's own economic adviser we're talking barack obama now right we're not talking donald trump george bush george h.w bush any conservative that we can we can pin this on obama's former economic adviser says the economy is about to take a downturn should we listen to him well i'll tell you i think he's telling the truth because as we can see eight point three percent inflation uh as uh the other host said is uh the highest in 40 years that's serious that's really going to impact people's pocketbooks i mean we are seeing almost 700 a month impact on the average american citizen that's over 8 000 a year that they are losing um in their paychecks you know so this is very very very serious and president biden i don't think either he doesn't get it all right mentally but really i think that uh what's happening here is he is trying to distract the american people and trying to tell them it's just really not that big of a deal and uh if you deny a problem then maybe you can make it go away because people will then be looking at something else but this is a serious problem for the american people you know believe it or not i'm going to agree with some of the left-wing media sites like the week and the atlantic and the new yorker magazine to say republicans and democrats are not talking about the same issues going into the midterms and then eventually the next presidential election they're talking about threats to democracy and women losing abortion rights women didn't lose abortion rights abortion went to the states where i'm sure in california they're going to have abortion on demand without apology as they say conservatives seem to be more concerned about the open border and inflation and i would have to imagine those two things that are front and center and affecting everyone every day no matter where they are are more important issues and republicans seem to be winning on those issues absolutely republicans are winning on those issues because those are the issues that american people care about i mean things like like what the democrats are talking about um those are simple distractions that is not what the american people want our government leaders to be working on they want us to work on reducing inflation securing our nation ensuring we have we have a strong border because if you don't have border security you don't have national security now all these things are what our our american citizens want us to be working on you know lowering energy prices uh increasing um domestic supply of fossil fuels i mean these things affect everyday americans lives not what the democrats are trying to push right now you know biden and the democrats are still in utter denial that the shutting down of pipelines and the rescinding of land leases for new exploration and new drilling permits coupled with the coveted lockdowns that caused the supply chain crisis are the reason why we have this all put together they keep blaming putin they keep blaming trump they're blaming capitalism on some level even though biden says he's a capitalist i don't know about that but they're in total denial that their policies have anything to do with this and before you before you say anything we didn't have any of this with republicans in charge and president trump right you're exactly right i mean the the one the the one person they're not blaming is the one in the mirror because the one in the mirror is in the blind administration is what has caused this problem their direct policies are are have caused the crisis after crisis after crisis that we're seeing here in america i mean whether it's the border crisis whether it's the energy crisis whether it's rapid crime uh inflation all of these things are affecting american citizens and they know that i think that's what's going to drive folks to the polls in november i think that's why we're going to see um the republicans take the majority in november and the democrats are simply going to um reap the reward of what they have done and what their policies have created and that is mayhem for the american people how long because inflation leads to stagflation which leads to a recession or as larry summers says a downturn i mean how much longer does biden dubai than the democrats think we could sustain this well we're already in a recession i mean we've had two quarters of negative growth already i think we're going to have a third quarter of negative growth so we are it's going to be quarter after quarter i think we're going to be in a recession um or continue to be in a recession and and the democrats don't have answers they do not have a plan we as republicans we have a plan to take us out of this recession to get our economy back on track you know to to build a nation that is secure again uh an economy that's free excuse me an economy that's strong and and that government is accountable can a republican majority force the president's hand on energy uh yes we can and we can do it through the power of the purse through article one uh power of the constitution we in the house can do that where the senate cannot really do it but we in the house can which is why it's so very important that we take back the majority in november because we're going to be the firewall just real quick 30 seconds do you fear that biden and the democrats are so committed to this that they'll just ride out a government shutdown because they know the media is still going to blame debt republicans no matter what happens well the media is always going to be on their side andrew i mean it has all it it's it's a double down for them and um uh they're not going to change their policies and and they're just gonna they're gonna try and drive us toward big government socialism which is their intent and they're not gonna let anything especially the truth get in the way all right representative andrew clyde thank you so much for joining us thank you andrew appreciate

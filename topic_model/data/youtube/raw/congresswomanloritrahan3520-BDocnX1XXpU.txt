hi how are you i'm laurie trahan and this is i'm grace and caroline we hope you're doing well uh and we thought we would commemorate an honor earth day today by reading the lorax by dr seuss okay let's start okay yeah at the far end of town where the grickle grass grows and the wind smells slow and sour when it blows and no birds ever sing accepting old crows is the street of the lifted lorax and deep in the grickle grass some people say if you look deep enough you can still see today where the lorax once stood just as long as it could before somebody lifted the lorax away what was the lorax and why was it there and why was it lifted and taken somewhere from the far end of town where the brickell grass grows the old one slur still lives here ask him he knows you won't see the once-ler don't knock at his door he stays in the lurkham on top of his store he lurks in his lure thumb cold under the roof where he makes his own clothes out of myth muffler move and on special dank midnight in august he peaks out of the shutters and sometimes he speaks and tells how the lorix was lifted away he'll tell you perhaps if you're willing to pay on the end of a rope he lets down a tin pail and you have to toss in 15 cents and a nail in the shell of a great great great grandfather's snail then he pulls up the pail makes the most careful count to see if you've paid him the proper amount then he hides what you paid him away in his snub his secret strange hole in his grubless glove then he grunts i will call you by whisper my phone for the secrets i tell you are for your ears alone karen you're almost up here slow down slips the whisper my phone to your ear and the old one slurs whispers are not very clear since they have come since they have to come down through a snargily hose and he sounds as if he had smallish bees up his nose now i'll tell you he says with his teeth sounding gray how the lorax got lifted and taken away it all started way back such a long long time back way back in the days when the grass was still green and the pond was still wet and the clouds were still clean this is one of our favorite pages and the song of the swamy swans rang out in space one morning i came to this glorious place and i first saw the trees oh the truffula trees the bright colored tufts of the truffula trees mile after mile in the fresh morning breeze and under the trees i saw brown bar bazoo brown bar balloons frisking about in their barbalou suits as they played in the shade and ate truffle fruits from the rippleless pond came the comfortable sound of the humming fish humming while splashing around but those trees oh those trees those truffula trees all my life i'd been searching for trees such as these the touch of their tufts was much softer than silk and they had the sweet smell of fresh butterfly milk i felt a great leaping of joy in my heart i knew just what i'd do i'd unload my cart good job in no time at all i had built a small shop then i chopped down a truffle a tree with one chop and with great skillful skill and with great speedy speed i took the soft top and i knitted a knead look the instant i finished i heard a gazump i looked i saw something pop out of the stump of the tree i chopped out it was sort of a man describe him that's hard i don't know if i can he was shortish and oldish and brownish and mossy and he spoke with a voice that was sharpish and bossy the lorax yes oh you're almost up my love mr he said with a sawdusty steez i am the lorax i speak for the trees i speak for the trees for the trees have no tongues and i'm asking you sir at the top of my lungs he was very upset and he shouted and puffed what's that thing you've made out of my truffle a tuft look lorax i said there's no cause for alarm i chopped just one tree i am doing no harm i'm being quite useful this thing is at the need a needs to find something that all people need it's a shirt it's a sock it's a glove it's a hat but it has other uses yes far beyond that you can use it for carpets for pillows for sheets or curtains or covers for bicycle seats the lorax said sir you are crazy with greed there is no one on earth who would buy that full need but the very next minute i proved he was wrong for just at that minute a chap came along and he thought that the knee that i had knitted was great he happily bought it for 398. i laughed at the lorax you poor stupid guy you never can tell what some people will buy all right ready i repeat cried the lorax i speak for the trees i'm busy i told him shut up if you please it's a bad word i rushed across the room and in no time at all built a radio phone i put in a quick call i called my brothers and uncles and aunts and i said listen here here's a wonderful chance for the whole once-ler family to get mighty rich get over here fast take the road to north niche turn left at weehawken sharp right at salt stitch [Music] and in no time at all in the factory i built the whole onceler family was working full tilt we were all knitting needs just as busy as bees to the sound of the chopping of truffula trees all right you ready okay then oh baby oh how my business did grow now chopping one tree at a time was too slow so i quickly invented my super ax hacker which whacked off four truffle of trees at one smacker we were making these four times as fast as before and that lorax well he didn't show up anymore i think he knocked on my new office door he snapped i'm the lorax who speaks for the trees which you seem to be chopping as fast as you please but i'm also in charge of the brown barbalous who played in the shade in their barbaloot suits and happily lived leading truffle eating truffle of fruits now thanks to your hacking my trees to the ground there's not enough truffle of fruit to go around and my poor barbaloots are all getting the crummies because they have gas and no food in their tummies they love living here but i can't let them stay they'll have to find food and i hope that they may good luck boys he cried and he sent them away i the one slur i the one i the one felt sad as i watched them all go but business is business and business must grow regardless of crummies and tummies you know i meant no harm i most truly did not but i had to grow bigger so bigger i got i biggered my factory i biggered my roads i biggered my wagons i biggered the loads of the needs i shipped out i was shipping them forth to the south to the east to the west to the north i went right on bigger rings selling more things and i biggered my money which everyone needs then again he came back i was fixing some pipes when oh when that old nuisance lorax came back with more gripes i am the lorax he coughed and he whipped he sneezed and he snuffled he snargled he sniffed one slur he cried with a crefless croak onceler you're making such smogula smoke my poor swami swans why they can't sing a note no one can sing who has smog in his throat and so said the lorax please spread my cough they cannot live here so i'm sending them off where will they go i don't hopefully know they may have to fly for a month or a year to escape from the smog you've smogged up around here what's more snap the as dander was up let me say a few words about gluppity glop your machinery chugs on day and night without stop making gluppity glove and sloppity shlop and what do you do with this leftover goo i'll show you you dirty old once-ler man you you wanna come back to us maybe for the end you're glumping the pond with a humming fish hummed no more can they hum for their gills are all gummed so i'm sending them off oh their future is dreary they'll walk on their fins and get woefully wary and search them in search of some water that isn't so smeary and then i got mad i got terribly mad i yelled at the lorax now listen here dad all you do is yap yap and say bad bad bad bad well i have my right sir and i'm telling you i intend to go on doing just what i do and for your information you lorax i'm figuring on biggering on biggering on biggering and biggering turning more truffula trees into things which everyone everyone everyone needs this is you and then at that very moment we heard a loud whack from outside the fields came a sickening smack of an axe on a tree then we heard the tree fall the very last truffle tree of the mom no more trees no more needs no more work to be done so in no time my uncles and aunts everyone all waved me goodbye they jumped into my cars and drove away under the smoke smuggled stars now all that was left neat the bad smelling sky was my big empty factory the lorax and eye sure the lorax said nothing just gave me a glance just gave me a very sad sad backward glance as he lifted himself by the seat of his pants and i'll never forget the grim look on his face when he hasn't passed it pasted himself and took leave to his pla to this place through a whole small without leaving a trace and all of the lorax left here in this mess was a small pile of rocks with one word unless whatever that meant well i just couldn't guess that was long long ago but each day since that day i've sat here and worried and worried away through the years while my buildings have fallen apart i've worried about it with all of my heart but now said the says the once-ler now that you're here the word of the lord seems perfectly clear unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot nothing is going to get better it's not so catch calls the one slur he lets something fall it's a truffle seed it's the last one of all you're in charge of the last of the truffula seeds and truffle trees are what everyone needs plant a new truffula treat it with care give it clean water and feed it fresh air grow a forest protect it from axes that hack then the lorax and all of his friends may come back that's the end well we care a lot and i know you do too so please remember with everything else going on on today earth day we have to care for our earth for our air for our water for our trees for all the beautiful things right now that are giving us great comfort uh while we say it at home and stay in place but thank you thanks for joining us i will see you again soon caroline can you wave happy happy happy day happy earth day

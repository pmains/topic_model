a memorial day we pause to thank our US veterans for all they've given our nation we cannot praise them enough we cannot provide them with enough and we cannot promise enough to reassure that their service will never be forgotten we have celebrated Memorial Day for more than a century so civilians can reflect on the sacrifices that have been made by veterans and their families over the years in many wars the commemoration began after the Civil War when Americans wanted to come together for a day of reflection a day to restore the dignity of those who had died so brutally a day to underscore the contributions of the Fallen so please join me today in continuing that tradition we must remember reflect and pay tribute with our families friends neighbors and colleagues let's fly our flags sing our national anthem and share stories of courage and honor this day and every day let us never forget to thank our veterans and their families for keeping us safe keeping us free and keeping the Stars and Stripes waving proudly thank you so much

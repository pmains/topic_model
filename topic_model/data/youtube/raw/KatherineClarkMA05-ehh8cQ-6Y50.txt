i'd like to begin by thanking you and the library of congress specifically for correcting its catalog entry on the armenian genocide to recognize that that was in fact a genocide and i stood in solidarity with armenian armenian americans in my district to commemorate the 107th anniversary of this atrocity just three days ago and i cannot tell you how important it is that the world's largest library uh is now a proactive partner in promoting the truth about the 1.5 million armenian lives lost in the early 20th century so we're deeply grateful to you for that work

the Justice Department has sent a letter to robert muller ahead of his testimony to the House Judiciary and Intel committees the DOJ is warning Muller that his testimony this is a quote must remain within the boundaries of your public report because matters within the scope of your investigation were covered by executive privilege well let's talk about that now congressman McCarran bass is here who serves on the House Judiciary Committee congresswoman thank you I appreciate you joining us you're gonna be questioning robert muller on wednesday in reaction to this letter from the DOJ well I think it has been consistent I think it was is just a method of intimidating Muller but you know that the AG did that from the very beginning as soon as the report came out remember how he completely misrepresented it he had his press conference he said six times it exonerated the president there was no collusion when the first page of the report says they weren't even looking at collusion so I just see it as an intimidation tactic okay all right so the you're not concerned that he won't be able to tell you things that he should be able to tell you because of this letter you don't think this letter is intimidating a witness in any way I do think I think it's meant to intimidate Muller but I hope that Muller will do the right thing I mean he said that he wasn't going to go outside of the bounds of his report and frankly his report is a devastating report so even if he just helps to provide context to the report I think that's going to be very valuable to the American people okay give us a general sense of the questions you want to ask are you gonna ask sure well you know in my committee we're looking at obstruction of justice there's probably far well first of all the report gives you ten explicit examples of obstruction of justice we probably won't get to all ten we will be looking at some of them I'm particularly interested in what went on with McGann the White House Counsel where you know he was essentially asked to lie to cover up I mean the president just person after person I think the only thing that saved him is the fact that the people that he tried to get to commit crimes refused to do so but one of the things that's pointed out you can still obstruct justice if you don't if you're if you it doesn't if you're not follow through with it you can still commit a crime and I believe that we will show that the President did that the Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler spoke to Fox News yesterday watch this congresswoman joy I think there is very substantial well the report presents very substantial evidence that the president is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors and we have to present the or that Mullah present those facts to the American people and then see where we go from there because the administration must be held accountable and no president can be can be above the law Nadler has openly advocated an impeachment inquiry for the president for for some time do you think Mullis testimony can move the needle on impeachment well I think it will move the needle in terms of educating the American public and that might change polling a little bit I don't know that it moves the needle on our process here in the house we have several committees that are all involved in different aspects of the oversight and investigation and I think if and when we move toward impeachment everybody needs to be on the same page that is not the case currently I also want to ask your thoughts on the president's comments on race today watch this congresswoman I had my best numbers recently and it's because of the economy and what I've done for the african-american when you look at the African Americans are doing better than they've ever done in our country that we're creating numbers look at the poverty numbers look at so many different look at the unemployment numbers the best they've ever had no we have fantastic relationships with the African American community I think you'll see that certainly you're going to see that in 2020 who is he talking about and why won't he just leave us alone maybe two African Americans that he talked to complimented him today but you know I mean it's just absolutely ridiculous I don't know what relationship he has with the black community but one thing we know because we've witnessed it for over 900 days now he lies pathologically and I say pepopepa logically because there is no sense in him I don't know if he just doesn't care he forgets his lies but ridiculous to say that there's no racial tension when he is the chief proponent of racial tension hmm let's talk about the squad okay he continues to attack the squad but he calls him racist calling them young inexperienced not very smart does it seem like he's making it clear that this is a battle that he wants to keep fighting oh absolutely I think that they have given up on trying to demonize Pelosi she has shown that she is smarter than him can deal with him so now he's targeting these four women you know two of the women are members of the Congressional Black Caucus and I'm concerned absolutely for all four of them because when he attacks them he he puts their lives in danger and we've already had violence committed toward committed toward members of Congress he puts them at risk for their very lives I do think though that he does it for two reasons I think the for women frankly intimidate him I think also that whenever he needs to change the subject he throws a racial bomb and you know we saw him do that during the campaign but that was when it was just rhetoric this man has power now so his racial bombs are backed up with horrific policies that negatively impact communities of color Congressman bass thank you so much we'll be watching on Wednesday during the testimony thank you so much thank you we'll be right back

uh Bob good is telling me that there are 10 hard no votes on McCarthy true or false been a number that have come out um there have been a number that have come out and um and publicly stated that they're not going to vote for Kevin McCarthy but I think we'll have to actually see how many that is on January the 3rd what does your instinct say congressman I I didn't hear you John okay what what do your instincts say instinctively do you think McCarthy can get there can he get the 218 can he make enough deals what does your instinct say well I'll tell you that negotiations are still going on right now and uh and we're seeing um uh a lot of hesitation from the Republican conference and as a result uh well third John uh you know I don't predict the future but um uh I'll tell you that it's going to be hard for uh leader McCarthy right now but um not I couldn't actually tell you are you one of the no votes now well uh I will tell you that uh you'll know that on June January we're we're still having negotiations good answer good answer Congressman okay the good fair fair enough you know I have to ask the question I'll take your answer on face value I already know what the answer is but uh I just had to ask it okay um tell me what are your what are you I'm sorry Bob I'm sorry Andrew what are your conference goals for the 118th Congress your goals well my goals well I'll tell you that I want to hold the Biden admin accountable and I'm I'm really thrilled that uh that we can do that through oversight I think that um President Biden's Financial dealings will be the prime target uh we have um uh hard evidence of financial issues that he's got especially when it comes to foreign countries we know that there have been at least 150 foreign that have been issued by various banks in this country over the financial dealings of the entire Biden family whether that's Jim Biden or Hunter Biden and we're going to investigate those we have two right now but we believe we're going to get the other 148 suspicious activity reports you know this is so concerning because I have a president that can potentially be influenced by foreign powers because of foreign business dealings you know President Biden and these investigations are directly about President Biden um because if his financial dealing compromised him or how much they've compromised him really then um then we need to know that because this this goes back to a national security risk for our country if a foreign government is able to to coerce him or blackmail him or something like that influenced him their position because of my Financial dealings that he's had then we've got a serious problem in this country and we have to know that the American people have to know that how compromised is Joe Biden that's the main question that we're going to investigate and that's our priority and on oversight so from a public relations standpoint you know that the fake news is going to be hammering you guys saying that no one cares it doesn't matter you need to focus on things that are important kitchen table issues that's taking your eye off the ball he didn't do anything right the fake news is already mounting the defense now they they you guys haven't even even started are you guys going to be able to stand up to that amount of public pressure well John I'll tell you that the fake news has never been on our side they have always come down uh on the side of the liberal left I firmly believe that they are a a arm of the Democrat Party so I believe we'll be able to stand up to uh whatever they have to say because we have truth on our side and truth will prevail over uh or over Democrat talking points and we're going to bring the truth to the American people and the American people get to decide not the left-wing media that simply has an agenda that's what they have and all of their news or really its opinion in my all of their opinion drives that agenda so uh we're going to stand up to it John absolutely we are Congress McLeod Marjorie Taylor green the other day announced um in one of the Committees that she's on that she's calling for an audit of every dime that went to Ukraine extensively uh to help them in their war effort now we're finding out allegedly that some of significant portion of the money that we gave to the Ukraine to get to the front was put in their Sovereign fund fund and invested into uh this uh crypto fraud company FTX that then turned around and gave money to the Democratic party in the Democratic candidates so it was almost allegedly it almost seems like a spinning money laundering scheme back to the Democrats that's what it appears right now allegedly this hasn't been proven to some people but either way the money's not supposed to go in their Sovereign fund to make investments it's supposed to go for armaments on the front what is the depth of the audit for the money that went to Ukraine that um oversighted visions congressman well I'll tell you that back in July of last year we had an ndaa where I introduced an amendment uh that amendment was too clearly a Inspector General specifically for Ukraine Aid and the Democrats shot that that down they voted it down in the rules committee and uh you know I'm all about making sure that every dime that we send to Ukraine um has oh it has oh and is accountable to the American people because we need to know where that money went which is why I I joined Marjory Taylor Green in this resolution and why I submitted this amendment to the National Defense authorization act and I think it's so absolutely important um that we have uh this kind of accountability and when you have 38 million dollars for at least that's what we know of right now that went to Ukraine and got funneled back through FTX you know to Democrat initiatives here in the United States that's incredibly concerning and you know you can look and see why you know why are the Democrats so interested in getting money sent over to Ukraine well when some of it comes back to them now you know the real motive foreign it's unbelievable when you uh when we do the money Trail to see what happened with this this money how do you see the continual funding of Ukraine going now with the Republican Congress obviously Biden has uh some authority to just be sending money but we've never really had a vote on this in Congress right I mean it's just kind of the money just see billions of billions of dollars keep flowing there what's going to be the procedure in the Republican house you know the president asked for seven more uh well the president just asked for 37 billion dollars more to go to Ukraine and I think he's going to have a tough time now the Democrats are still in charge of the house so they could they could you know push this through with Democrat vote but I don't think that they have that they'll have the votes necessarily on the Democrat side um it's certainly not something that I I would support um I think that's uh it's a waste of money I mean we have an open Southern border right now and we're more concerned about Ukraine's Sovereign borders than we're concerned about our Sovereign borders and that's a big mistake that's a policy um you know blunder by the bind Administration Congressman Andrew Clyde I want to thank you for being with us the Monday before Thanksgiving I wish you Happy Thanksgiving to you and your family and I want to thank you for coming on our show

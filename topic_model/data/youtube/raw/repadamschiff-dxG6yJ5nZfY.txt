  ON RUSSIAN OIL AND GAS.  HE ANNOUNCED FURTHER SANCTIONS  ON RUSSIA.  JOINING US NOW IN STUDIO TO  DISCUSS THE WAR IS THE CHAIR OF  THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE  COMMITTEE, CONGRESS MEMBER ADAM  SCHIFF.  THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.  >> GREAT TO BE HERE.  >> DIFFICULT TIMES THIS WEEK.  YOUR HOUSE INTELLIGENCE  COMMITTEE SAID A BIPARTISAN  LETTER TO THE DIRECTOR OF  NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND IN  THE U ENCOURAGED HER TO  CONTINUE PROVIDING INTELLIGENCE  TO UKRAINE AND ITS ALLIES.  YOU ALSO ASKED FOR A  DECLASSIFICATION OF INFORMATION  RELATED TO RUSSIA'S PLANNED FOR  ACTUAL WAR CRIMES OR  ATROCITIES.  WHAT ARE YOU HOPING FOR AND  THAT DECLASSIFIED INFORMATION?  >> THE ADMINISTRATION HAS USED  INTELLIGENCE DECLASSIFICATION  IN IMPORTANT WAYS.  FIRST BY INTELLIGENCE BEFORE  THE WAR TO PUT THE WORLD ON  NOTICE TO WHAT THE RUSSIANS  WERE PLANNING.  THAT HELP US BUILD SANCTIONS.  AND THEN DISCUSSING  INTELLIGENCE ABOUT RUSSIAN  FALSE FLAG OPERATIONS AND THEIR  POTENTIAL USE OF CHEMICAL  WEAPONS.  WE TOLD THE RUSSIANS WE KNOW  WHAT YOU ARE PLANNING.  AND TO USE HER INTELLIGENCE TO  HELP BUILD THE CASE ON WAR  CRIMES RITA COULD BE ANOTHER  IMPORTANT USE IF WE CAN  DECLASSIFY INFORMATION SHOWING  THE DELIBERATE ATTACK OF  CIVILIANS.  THEN SOME OF THESE WAR  CRIMINALS CAN BE HELD  ACCOUNTABLE.  >> SECRETARY OF STATE ANTONY  BLINKEN HAS SAID THIS WEEK THE  GOVERNMENT, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT  HAS DETERMINED SOME MEMBERS OF  THE RUSSIAN MILITARY HAVE  COMMITTED WAR CRIMES.  WHAT DOES THAT DESIGNATION  MEAN?  >> IT MEANS THEY CAN BE HELD  PERSONALLY LIABLE.  BY A INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL  COURT OR OTHER TRIBUNAL.  IT WOULD EXPOSE THEM TO  SANCTIONS UNDER THE Mc NITSCHKE  ACT WHERE THEY CAN FACE  FINANCIAL SANCTIONS, TRAVEL  SANCTIONS, AND OTHER COSTS OF  THEIR WAR CRIMES.  AND ULTIMATELY IF THE EVIDENCE  GOES BACK TO PUT ORDERING  INDISCRIMINATE BOMBING AND  OTHER WAR CRIMES, HE CAN ALSO  BE HELD RESPONSIBLE.  >> WHAT YOU THINK OF THAT?  DO YOU THINK PRESIDENT PUTIN  HAS COMMITTED WAR CRIMES?  >> I DO.  I THINK HE IS A WAR CRIMINAL.  EDDIE IS PUT ONTO SAM'S.  SHE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT IS  GOING ON.  THIS IS NAKED AGGRESSION ON HIS  PART.  HIS DESIRE TO BE THE NEXT PETER  THE GREAT.  AND THE FACT IS HE HAS NO  RESPECT FOR HUMAN LIFE.  >> THERE IS ALSO NOW A VERY  CREDIBLE EVIDENCE FROM THE  INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY THAT  RUSSIANS MAY BE PLANNING TO USE  CHEMICAL WEAPONS.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN SAID THIS  WEEK IF THAT HAPPENS THE U.S.  WOULD RESPOND IN KIND.  I'M CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR THOUGHTS  ON THIS.  ABOUT THE U.S. PERHAPS NOT  DIRECTLY DEPLOYING CHEMICAL  WEAPONS BUT ASSISTING ANOTHER  COUNTRY TO ENGAGE IN CHEMICAL  WARFARE.  DO YOU HAVE ANY QUALMS ABOUT  THAT?  >> I HEARD THE PRESIDENT MAKE  REMARKS IN MY IMMEDIATE  REACTION WAS, I'M SURE HE DOES  NOT MEAN THAT WE WILL RESPOND  WITH THE USE OF CHEMICAL  WEAPONS.  OR BY SUPPORTING UKRAINE TO USE  CHEMICAL WEAPONS.  THEY DO NOT POSSESS THEM TO  BEGIN WITH.  I THINK HE MEANS WE WILL  RESPOND PROPORTIONATELY.  WE WILL FIGURE OUT WHAT WAY WE  CAN HELP UKRAINE RESPOND AND  HOW WE CAN RESPOND WITH  ECONOMIC AND OTHER SANCTIONS.  THE PRESIDENT NOW IS DISCUSSING  WITH NATO WHAT THOSE  REPERCUSSION SHOULD BE.  THE RUSSIANS HAVE USED CHEMICAL  WEAPONS IN PEACETIME.  THEY HAVE POISONED PEOPLE ON  FOREIGN SOIL.  THEY ASSISTED -- WHEN HE USED  CHEMICAL WEAPONS.  THEY ARE NOT ADVERSE TO DOING  IT AND WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED.  >> APART FROM THAT WARFARE,  WHAT ASSISTANCE SHOULD WE STILL  BE OFFERING?  PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS SAID OVER  AND OVER AGAIN WE ARE NOT GOING  TO BE HELPING TO ENFORCE A NO- FLY ZONE OVER UKRAINE.  WE HAD FORMER SENATOR BARBARA  BOXER ON THE SHOW.  ND SHE SAID IF WE PUT U.S.  MILITARY BOOTS ON THE GROUND IN  UKRAINE WE ARE ESSENTIALLY  GOING INTO WORLD WAR III.  BEYOND THE HUMANITARIAN  ASSISTANCE WE HAVE OFFERED SO  FAR, BEYOND THE MILITARY  ASSISTANCE, WHAT ELSE SHOULD  AMERICA OR COULD AMERICAS TO BE  DOING?  >> I THINK WE CAN DO A LOT MORE  OF WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING.  WE HAVE PROVIDED ANTITANK  MUNITIONS.  WE HAVE PROVIDED ANTIAIRCRAFT  WEAPONS AND SYSTEMS.  WE STARTED PROVIDING OUR  DRONES.  THOSE CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE.  WHAT THE UKRAINIANS MOST NEED  OUR THINK THEY DON'T NEED TO BE  TRAINED ON.  THINGS THEY COULD BE MAKE  IMMEDIATE USE ON.  I WOULD STILL LIKE THEM TO GET  THOSE POLISH MAGS BUT I THINK  THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT TO DRAW  THE LINE ON A NO-FLY ZONE.  I THINK THAT WOULD GET US INTO  A SHOOTING FOR MORE WITH RUSSIA  IN ORDER TO IMPOSE A NEW WISE  AND WE WOULD HAVE TO SHOOT DOWN  AIR DEFENSE SYSTEMS WITHIN  RUSSIA AND RUSSIAN AIRCRAFT.  THAT WOULD BE A DRAMATIC  ESCALATION.?  I KNOW YOU SPENT TIME IN THE  UKRAINE YOURSELF SO ENSURE  PERSONALLY THIS IS HARD TO SEE.  >> IT IS.  I'VE BEEN THERE A COUPLE TIMES.  I WAS THERE DURING THE  REVOLUTION OF DIGNITARY.  THEY WERE SEEKING TO THROW OUT  A PROGRAM ONE AUTOCRAT AND  ULTIMATELY SUCCEEDED.  I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR  THEM.  STOMACH TURNING TO POLITICS  ERE.  RECENTLY THE WASHINGTON POST  REPORTED HOUSE MINORITY LEADER  KEVIN McCARTHY SAID HE WOULD  STRIP YOU OF YOUR POST AS CHAIR  OF THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE  COMMITTEE.  SHOULD THE REPUBLICANS REGAIN  MAJORITY IN THE MIDTERMS.  HE ACCUSED YOU OF POLITICIZING  THE PANEL.  I'M GUESSING YOU HAVE A THING  OR TWO TO SAY ABOUT THAT.  >> YES.  THAT IS RICH COMING FROM THE  GUY WHO APPOINTED DEVIN NUNES  TO THE PANEL.  AND ALSO PUSH FOR A BENGHAZI  SELECT COMMITTEE BECAUSE HE  SAID HE WANTED TO TAKE DOWN  HILLARY'S NUMBERS.  HER POLL NUMBERS.  THERE IS NO ONE WHO I THINK HAS  BEEN MORE DESTRUCTIVE  POLITICALLY THAN KEVIN  McCARTHY.  HE IS SEEKING TO APPEASE THE  MARJORIE TAYLOR GREEN, PAUL  GOES-R, FOR THEM HAVING THEIR  COMMITTEE STRIPPED ASIDE.  IN THE GLORIFICATION OF  VIOLENCE AGAINST OTHER MEMBERS  OF CONGRESS.  THIS IS HIS WAY OF SAYING, I  WILL PAY BACK.  AND IT REFLECTS HOW WEAK A HOLD  HE HAS ON THE REPUBLICAN  CONFERENCE THAT HE HAS TO DO  THE BIDDING UNDER HIS MOST  EXTREME MEMBERS.  >> LET'S TURN TO ANOTHER PIECE  OF NEWS YOU MADE.  YOU TOOK HIM THIS WEEK AT THE  CITIZENS UNITED DECISION.  THIS WAS BACK IN 2010.  SUPREME COURT CASE IN WHICH THE  JUSTICES RULED CORPORATIONS AND  UNIONS WERE PERMITTED TO GIVE  UNLIMITED CAMPAIGN  CONTRIBUTIONS BECAUSE IT WAS AN  EXPRESSION OF FREE SPEECH.  BUT THAT IS LED TO A LOT OF  MONEY BEING MOVED AROUND OVER  THE SYSTEM IN THE LAST SEVERAL  YEARS.  YOUR AMENDMENT WOULD  ESSENTIALLY OVERTURN CITIZENS  UNITED.  COULD YOU TELL US ABOUT THE  AMENDMENT AND WHAT THEY WOULD  DO?  >> WHO DO A COUPLE THINGS.  IT WOULD OVERTURN CITIZENS  UNITED BUT IT WOULD GO BACK TO  ACASE THREE OR FOUR DECADES  AGO, A POSTWAR GATE WHERE THE  SUPREME COURT STRUCK DOWN  WATERGATE REFORMS THAT LIMITED  INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURES.  CITIZENS UNITED MADE THAT FAR  WORSE.  SO THIS WOULD OVERTURN THAT  LINE OF DECISIONS TO ALLOW  CONGRESS ONCE AGAIN TO PUT  LIMITS ON EXPENDITURES OF  MONEY.  GET RID OF THE DARK MONEY, BIG  CORPORATE SPENDING IN  ELECTIONS.  I THINK IT IS PROBABLY THE MOST  IMPORTANT CONSTITUTIONAL BEFORE  WE CAN HAVE.  ATTACKING THE POLLUTION OF THE

madam speaker i thank the gentleman for yielding and i thank him for his tireless have efforts on behalf of america's workers for his attempts to bring to the floor a bipartisan transportation bill as has been the custom in our house and as we do have the opportunity to do uh by taking up the senate bill the bill in the senate has bipartisan support 74 plus one who was absent but supporting the bill 75 members of the senate support that legislation it is bipartisan it creates jobs and it should be it is worthy of our support it has this co-sponsorship of the chair and the ranking member of the committee from chairwoman barbara boxer to ranking member senator inhofe a wide array of political of philosophical thinking all of it coming together around a bipartisan initiative american people have a right to know why while the republicans in the senate the democrats in the senate the president of the united states the house democrats all support this bipartisan bill why the republicans in the house are odd man out every calls to mine when they were odd person out on the payroll tax cut in december when all the other parties had come together in a bipartisan way but what is dangerous about what is happening here today is that this initiative this kick the can down the road this my way or no highway bill attitude is costing jobs and i'll i'm sure that they have been reviewed 41 000 in north carolina 4 500 in illinois 4 000 in maryland the list goes on and on just because of the delay and the uncertainty that is injected into the system this costs the payer more small businesses suffer because they cannot proceed with contracts in the rest to go forward and it is a job loser as i mentioned so this is this has nothing to recommend it except to be explained by the fact that the republicans can't even bring their own transportation bill to the fore and pass it their own transportation bill is not a good bill but at least it would take us to conference they can't vote for their own bill i don't know how that happens that they make have a bill that they can't support but in addition to not being able to support their own bill and it's interesting that the budget and transportation are on the floor at the same time they have this bill and in the budget that they're going to be voting on today they have cut transportation funding in half from 90 billion dollars to 46 billion dollars that's 44 billion dollars worth of jobs promotion of commerce uh improving the quality of life of the american people building the infrastructure of america and that means uh road fast mass transit all the rest of that 40 to cut that in half oh and by the way give a tax break of over 300 000 to the wealthiest people in america wealthy people get off fine middle class people pay small businesses pay the taxpayer pays job seekers and workers pay the price so i think it's really important to understand what the bipartisan national national governors association has said a string of short-term extensions will only increase uncertainty for state and local governments and the private sector and so again i i the house back to its bipartisanship on this legislation the distinguished chairman mr mica has been part of that bipartisanship in the past now they come up with a bill that the republican secretary of transportation says is a job loser and is dangerous to public safety the worst bill he's seen in his 35 years of public service and he's his public service has been in this field and again departing from bipartisanship so i urge my colleagues to not aid and abet the republicans of going down this path that is not a good one but to urge them to bring up the senate bill who can go to the president's desk today putting people back to work immediately i urge my colleagues to vote no and i yield back the balance of my time generally yields back the gentleman from florida is ready

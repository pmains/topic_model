- On election night, we made
it to the runoff by 155 votes, 155. We did it because of
motivated volunteers like you. Now, I'm asking you to really
take hold of that mission, and that's why we've launched Mission 155. I'm asking you right now
to pledge to at least two of the following. Knock on 155 doors, make 155 calls, send 155 neighbor-to-neighbor cards, or donate $155. You taking charge of this
will help ensure that we win by a lot more than 155 on May 22nd. Now, respond with 155 to this text, and we'll get you all set up. I hope you will accept this mission.

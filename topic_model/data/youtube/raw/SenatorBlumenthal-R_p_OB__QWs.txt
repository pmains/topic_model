i would like to join others of my colleagues in thanking and commending the majority leader senator reid for his tireless and relentless work in extraordinarily difficult circumstances he has been a model for me as a new member of the senate in leading this body and many of my other democratic colleagues and the leadership and some of our republican colleagues as well senator johnny isakson for example georgia who spoke to this chamber yesterday morning and who demonstrated his determination as others on the other side of the aisle have done to work together in reaching an agreement as the majority leader said just moments ago the word of the day must be cooperation and compromise it is the word that we are hearing from countless americans and my fellow citizens of connecticut day after day we want you to get the job done put aside the partisan differences america is speaking with one voice and washington must listen you know i am new to washington i haven't been here for long i've just marked my first six months in the united states senate but i understand more and more why my fellow connecticut citizens and americans are so frustrated and often appalled by what goes on here this situation is outrageous we have an impending crisis self-created and devastating possible wounds self-inflicted and washington has been dead like deadlocked there is a glimmer of hope a reason to be cautiously optimistic the solution is in sight but still work to be done and washington needs to end the gridlock the straight jacket that has been self-imposed and to take action to protect citizens from financial catastrophe our nation really is at a crossroads and we need to rein in spending cut the debt in the deficit make the tough choices necessary to get our fiscal house in order and we need to do it now the fiscal news in the last few days the anemic and fragile measures of recovery show more than ever why we need now certainty that ending this deadlock will produce uncertainty is the enemy it's the enemy for businesses that are deciding whether to hire for banks wanting to loan money to those businesses for larger corporations sitting on mountains of cash waiting to invest and create jobs jobs and our economy are the main reasons to make these tough choices literally today to make these tough choices now we have a historic moment and we must seize it and we cannot keep kicking these decisions down the road families in connecticut and across the country make these tough choices every day and they rightfully expect nothing less from us tough choices are necessary to help get our debt and our deficit under control i've heard as late as this morning sunday morning from hundreds of connecticut residents who are frustrated and appalled at what is going on here what they see in washington d.c bernice from tallinn connecticut she can't believe we don't have an agreement and she's worried she won't receive her social security check next month and jane from west hartford she's wondering why we're protecting sweetheart deals instead of ensuring social security is protected and strengthened and rod from new milford he just wants us to compromise and to get something done to end this nightmare i agree with them and hundreds of others from connecticut around the country who want to make sure that those troops in afghanistan are paid that their families are taken care of and i thank the citizens of connecticut for calling or writing to me i agree that the immediate solution and agree with them is not only to raise the debt ceiling but also to cut spending as the read proposal makes clear dollar for dollar to match every increase in that debt ceiling without tax increases none without any cuts in medicare or social security none those basic principles in the read proposal are what should be embodied in what the outcome is of this debate the markets need a real solution not a short-term fix to demonstrate that we're committed to achieving real results in cutting spending and from hampden in connecticut makes this point powerfully she just called yesterday to say a short-term plan would not provide the certainty the markets are desperately seeking and i agree no sure short-term plan can provide that kind of certainty it risks a credit rating downgrade and ensures that we will be back here in another six months and as much as we may criticize the rating agency and i have been one to criticize them most vehemently as an attorney general of my state of connecticut and now as a member of this body we must deal with that reality at this moment and take action down the road to address the need for reform credit rating and agencies downgrades seem abstract and intangible but they are hugely consequential a downgrade in our credit rating would likely cause in effect an automatic tax increase in the form of higher interest rates for every american who has a mortgage a car loan a student debt or a credit card and the american people deserve better coming together compromise is essential now majority leader reed has proposed a solution that meets all of the criteria that house republicans have demanded for weeks it doesn't raise taxes or revenues it includes enough spending to meet the debt ceiling increase dollar for dollar and it includes spending cuts that are the same the very same as our republican colleagues our friends across the aisle have previously voted for and supported over these past weeks and most importantly senator reid's plan makes tough spending cuts but doesn't balance the budget on the backs of our seniors or our most vulnerable it protects vital programs and does not make cuts to benefits to medical care and social security and i can pledge again as i have repeatedly that i will oppose cuts in medicare or social security time and again democrats have shown that we are willing to compromise to avert catastrophe and default unfortunately at every turn republicans in the house have blocked any chance for progress and continue to put us in a very dangerous path i am hopeful that the deadline will produce a compromise that the talks will be productive but today's filibuster of our efforts to prevent a default is indeed unprecedented as my colleague the distinguished very distinguished senator from maryland has pointed out just a few moments ago on the floor since march of 1962 congress has raised the debt limit 74 times 18 times under president reagan during george bush's administration congress passed five stand-alone debt limit increases without a filibuster or delay and until today until this point debt limit increases were routine usually passed by a simple 51 vote majority without the procedural hurdles that my republican colleagues are using today they need to come to the table and hopefully they will continue to be at the table to work with us to find a compromise for the good of the country and the good of our economic recovery so i hope that my republican colleagues will join us in achieving that result for the sake of millions of connecticut families who are watching and listening as are hundreds of millions of americans and for the sake of our economy moving in the right direction it is about jobs jobs jobs the certainty that our economy needs at this point in its history affordable interest rates to move our economy forward

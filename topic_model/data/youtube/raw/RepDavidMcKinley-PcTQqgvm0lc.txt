Thank You congressman for your leadership on this matter according to Tom Miller the West Virginia representative to the National Volunteer Fire Council ninety-five percent of all fire departments in West Virginia are staffed by volunteers to pay for their training their equipment their operating costs these men and women are forced to raise money through bake sales pancake breakfast steak dinners and standing in the street humbly at stoplights holding their boots out asking people to put money in those boots and now these financially strapped fire departments have been told that they may have to pay health care costs mr. Miller has projected that the added cost a pain for this health care for these volunteers will force some departments to close your doors close their doors putting families and businesses at risk mr. speaker cutting emergency services upon which rural America depends is clearly an unintended consequence of Obamacare therefore we must exempt our volunteer emergency responders from this additional cost by bringing this bill to the floor as soon as possible I yield back the balance of my time thank the gentleman from West Virginia yield my time to the gentleman from Pennsylvania mr. Thompson

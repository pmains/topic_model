gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for one minute I thank my friend madam Speaker I rise in strong opposition to the so-called protect life act our first priorities now here must be helping to foster job creation and support middle class families we're 280 days into this Congress without passing without even having a jobs plan from the majority instead the Republicans have chosen to continue their radical assault on women's health and health care in the guise of preventing the use of federal funds to pay for abortion procedures this bill is as unnecessary as it is offensive and inhumane the bill would penalize private insurers who offer comprehensive plans allow hospitals to refuse life-saving care to women would prevent access to birth control including providing emergency contraception to sexual assault survivors instead of debating how to put Americans back to work the majority party is spending our time on socially divisive bills that are going nowhere I yield back my time back

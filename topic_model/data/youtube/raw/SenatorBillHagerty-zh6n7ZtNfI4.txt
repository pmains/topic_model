a senator from tennessee i rise today to discuss my serious concerns about the judgment and the temperament of an omni column call the controversial nominee to be the under secretary of defense for policy the third highest position in our department of defense on april the 13th 2021 i along with 17 other senators wrote to fbi director christopher wray requesting an investigation into whether call had improperly disclosed classified information we also asked the majority leader not to advance calls nomination on the floor until the fbi completed his investigation yet here we stand the 18 senators who signed these letters include senators who sit on the senate judiciary committee the senate intelligence committee and the senate armed services committee as senators the constitution charges us with providing advice and consent and so i stand here today because the senate deserves to have these questions answered so that we may properly discharge our duties i fear my democratic colleagues want to force this nominee through before we know all the facts facts which may be incredibly damning to his nomination here's what we do know as a u.s government employee with a top secret security clearance colin call assigned to classified information non-disclosure agreement in fact he likely signed many of them during his tenure in government this document binds government employees in perpetuity to protect classified information under u.s laws regulations and executive orders these classified information non-disclosure agreements don't come with footnotes they don't come with fine print that says you're only obligated to protect classified information when it's a president you like or when it's a president that belongs to the political party you agree with mr call signed this document to protect classified information in perpetuity period yet rather than uphold the oath that he took to his nation and to his government call decided to recklessly disclose sensitive information to score political points on twitter some of the information that call appears to have leaked internal deliberations of the national security council is of a category even senators and senate staff with the highest security clearances are almost always denied access in december of 2017 call publicly bragged that he confirmed the disclosure to the media of classified planning for military options in north korea with quote multiple sources inside the administration you can see right here his tweet there's a contingent at the white house that believes a limited strike is viable and the u.s can control escalation by threatening regime change if kim jong-un retaliates this is incredible and continuing on that same thread he says i've heard this separately from multiple sources inside the administration in other words if the intelligence services of north korea china russia iran and other adversaries were working to corroborate the accuracy of this leaked information call saved them the trouble by working with quote multiple sources inside the administration to confirm this leaked classified information publicly no less let me put this in a personal perspective when call tweeted these leaks in december of 2017 i was serving as u.s ambassador to japan this was at a time when north korea had launched two intercontinental ballistic missiles over japan and they'd also detonated a thermonuclear warhead putting the lives of my family my fellow american diplomats and more than 50 000 active duty u.s military and their families all of us living within range of north korea in harm's way at a time when tensions couldn't have been higher colin call was willing to expose vital information to north korea and risk american lives all of this just to score political points reckless i say in february in march of 2017 call leaked details about a classified national security council meeting on counter-terrorism operations in yemen that he quote confirmed with four separate staffers in the room here's his message talking about yemen quoting the deputy national security council director kt mcfarland saying saddle up this is a direct quote from a meeting that should have been the existence of this meeting should be classified and certainly anything that was said to this during this meeting here it is on twitter and then he follows up by saying that he's confirmed with four separate staffers in the room in short call used social media and other forums to leak classified information to brag about his ability to get u.s government employees to confirm with him the veracity of leaked classified information whoever holds the third highest position at dod must be someone who completely understands and appreciates the important nature of sensitive information and is dedicated to safeguarding it yet rather than respect the responsibility that came with his access to sensitive material call recklessly shared this privileged information on twitter for the world to see merely to scratch a political partisan itch if we let this nominee slide through under these conditions what message does it send to other ambitious national security types doesn't it say that leaking classified information for political reasons will be rewarded doesn't it encourage further disclosure of classified information doesn't it play right into our adversaries hands by showing that our internal political divisions can be exploited to obtain the most sensitive information that our government keeps as my senate colleagues and i explained in our letter to fbi director ray the under secretary of defense for policy plays a key role in matters crucial to america's national security and should be held by a person of sound judgment and temperament someone who understands and respects the need to safeguard classified information and to keep national security affairs distinct and separate from partisan political activities calls growing record of apparent mishandling of classified information and his evasive response regarding this issue fall far short of the standard required for holding one of our nation's top national security positions by apparently soliciting or otherwise receiving classified information from u s government officials serving in national security roles and repeatedly posting such information on social media call demonstrated disregard for security protocols that are designed to protect our national security interests call has shown that he's unfit to serve and his nomination should not move forward until the fbi has completed the investigation requested by me and 17 of my senate colleagues i hope that all of my colleagues want to see answers to these important questions as well as as well before we begin to advance this nomination madam president i yield the floor and suggest absence of a quorum

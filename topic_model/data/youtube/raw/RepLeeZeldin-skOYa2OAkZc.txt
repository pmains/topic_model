I recently received an email from Mary and Gunther amritsar from st. James in which they discussed the protecting our communities from gang violence act and urged me to get it passed and implemented ASAP my legislation revokes the naturalization of those involved in gang activity prior to or within 10 years of becoming naturalized the United States naturalization is a privilege not a right and those who have had this privilege bestowed upon them must respect and uphold the laws of our land our communities have witnessed a much violence and brutality at the hands of ms-13 and other gangs from the vicious machete attack of four young men and central islip to the childhood best friends brutally murdered by ms-13 in Brentwood our community has witnessed the indiscriminate brutality of gang violence firsthand every level of government has a role to play in combating the rise of ms-13 and other gangs and we must crack down on the aspects of our nation's broken immigration system and other policies that have allowed ms-13 and other gangs to take hold in our communities and stay there

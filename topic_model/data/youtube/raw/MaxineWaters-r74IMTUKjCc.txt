all week long we have shown you the heartbreaking stories of how the people of Haiti are suffering even though we've donated hundreds of millions of dollars to help as a result there is growing distrust in the government and even in the charitable organizations David Ono is following the money trail and he joins us now we've been studying this for quite some time now and our figures show that Southern California has donated 62 and a half million dollars to help Haiti and that's just the top eight charities the actual amount is far above that that's why people are angry we spent that much yet still see these pictures of suffering have we even taken advantage of here's what we found six months after the earthquake we never expected to see scenes like this people's spirits broken their hope has turned to anger and distrust the government like money because what they do they took the money try to blend in American people you look like you never did nothing so you think Americans are giving money to your government but the government's not helping you guys with the money they're keeping the money correct that's exactly I think there's something to some of that as a matter of fact there is no system for accounting for all of the donations that come in from all over the world US Congress when Maxine Waters has made several trips to Haiti and seen the suffering in person she says is a terrible lack of transparency with the Haitian government as a result she says our government needs to take a stronger approach we want you to show us how you receive this money how you dispense this money who's in charge of doing it and how it gets out to the people because we've just gone through the camps and they're not getting it we're gonna have to get tougher five point three billion dollars has been pledged to the Haitian government by the world's countries only 2% of that has been given could distrust play a role even the u.s. hasn't paid but there's another huge category of money and that's where you probably follow charitable donations like the Red Cross UNICEF Doctors Without Borders these organizations have received 1.3 billion dollars and there are a lot of them the best count anyone has is over nine hundred and thirty organizations inside of Haiti responding to the disaster imagine attempting to coordinate nine hundred and thirty different organizations via Skype Sandra's Chimel fennec director of the Charity Raider is an expert on nonprofits and understands the complications she says the situation in Haiti is extremely complicated take for instance the reason aid groups are no longer giving food to the hungry it's because the Haitian government asked them to stop the reason for this is if you import a lot of food and you give it away for free you put a lot of people out of work you put the food importers you put the distribution you put the shopkeepers out of work and pretty soon you've got a lot more people who are now desperate for aid as well Haiti's unemployment rate is around 90% how do you get money to buy food while some organizations like Doctors Without Borders have spent almost every penny donated to help Haitians other organizations like the Red Cross haven't even spent half and here's their explanation we're talking about spending roughly two hundred million dollars over the next year in areas like that transitional housing that we described so we're lining up the material in the labor now what we need is the proper land from the government to start building land maybe the biggest reason for this humanitarian catastrophe only a handful of rich families own most of the land in Haiti they don't want indigent people living on it and so far the nation government has not come up with a solution as a result one and a half million people are trapped in these camps and continue to suffer another infuriating fact there are warehouses filled with food goods and medical supplies already in Haiti but have it arrived in January right after the quake because of the lack of coordination between the relief organizations and the government it's just sitting there and that blender is costing lives as a preacher leads a prayer service the pediatric ward of Bernard Merv's hospital in port-au-prince tucked away in a crib against the wall is this little girl weeks ago she developed an infection on the brain a simple dose of antibiotics would have saved her doctors couldn't find any even though there were warehouses filled with them the infection spread and now does nothing anyone can do to save her but the bottom line is Haiti still needs a lot of help charities would love for you to continue to support them and they will do all they can to help the suffering once the land issues are settled a tremendous amount of money will be needed to help people rebuild if you go to our website abc7 comm you'll find a link connecting you to a clearinghouse of charities that way you can make your own decision on if and to whom you want to donate but there's a lot of frustration out there still it is frustrating to see those pictures to know that so many people have given and the people are still suffering that is really hard to deal with yeah it's a tough problem and of course we're gonna stay on top of it and people the media myself will all revisit the situation we'll give you updates but it's a very complicated situation that's going to take years to fix powerful series of a course David thanks

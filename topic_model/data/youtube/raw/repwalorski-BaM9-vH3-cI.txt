a couple of months ago the irs commissioner came before the same subcommittee i highlighted concerns around the mail backlog at the irs processing centers around the country at that time there were close to three million pieces of unopened mail as i understand that that figure has been reduced now to about 1.3 million pieces which i applaud the irs's efforts to address this issue during the pandemic however i continue to hear from folks back home who are being directly impacted by the male backlog so this remains a matter of deep concern for me particularly as we go into the 2020 filing season so over the past over the course of the past year my case workers and i have heard stories from hoosiers in my district who are facing financial difficulty due to the pandemic but they've yet to receive the tax refund that they're owed so these are folks who need their refunds urgently and can't afford delays they need swift action so they can continue really to put food on the table and provide for their families the male backlog has no doubt also caused significant challenges for the organization represented by all of our witnesses as well i want to just take a second to highlight the vita program and the tax counseling for the elderly the tce program which over the years have both served as critical tools for many qualifying individuals who are looking for tax filing assistance at no cost to themselves these vital programs have become all the more critical during the pandemic so i remain ready to work with all the organizations that we have here today to ensure that american taxpayers can quickly and fairly resolve their issues related to the irs and the other federal agencies but i have a question for all of you if you could just uh chime in here quickly um so are your volunteers trained to deal with taxpayers who have questions about their 2019 tax return or have they yet to receive their tax refund and then can you just explain and touch on some of the challenges you've had in kind of navigating this issue making sure that everybody's trained for the questions coming in uh miss lee um villanueva can we just start with you and just kind of go down yeah so our volunteers are trained every year on the tax code for the for that year's return that they're going to be preparing and they also pass the irs certification test at the advanced level and um we do and we do know that there are probably a number of taxpayers who were not able to file their 2019 return so we are anticipating that there will be a number of those returns that need to be completed along with the 2020 return so the way our program works is that if the volunteer was certified in that tax year so if they have been a volunteer for us for both the 2019 tax return and the 2020 then they can prepare both of those returns and um and yes we do we are seeing these have been hearing also about people who did have to pay on file tapes with paper that there still is a backlog of some of those being possible can the rest of you weigh in um certainly i'll i'll weigh in um actually my own brother never received his 2019 refund um and so i i recently just went through this with him um and helped him navigate the systems of calling the irs and scheduling appointment and so on and so forth and i would say our volunteers are trained this is the type of information um that we regularly share with our network partners so that they can communicate with the uh um with their volunteers so they're well versed in helping people navigate the irs um so there are two very common things that we we encourage them to do one is call the irs to try to schedule an appointment with the local taxpayer assistance center and then if all of us fail so we um we encourage strong partnership with with the taxpayer advocate service and local litc's who can also help and provide those resources as well can i interrupt miss thompson can i ask you another question while i have you really quickly will prosperity now and the other similar uh vita sites be able to serve the same number of taxpayers as in prior years even though there's fewer sites and volunteers we are anticipating an increase in demand and in a decrease in capacity this year just because of the diff the nuances of the multiple service delivery options and so uh we're hedging our bets i would say um and not quite sure whether we'll be able to to resume operations at the prior year filing suzanne level gotcha i thank all of you out of time thanks mr chairman i yield back

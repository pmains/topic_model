WAS PREPARED TO FIGHT AND DIE  IN A CIVIL WAR.  >> RAY CORTOPASSI: TONIGHT, A  WGN EXCLUSIVE, A MAN WITHOUT A  PARTY. WE'RE GOING ONE ON ONE  WITH ILLINOIS REPUBLICAN  CONGRESSMAN ADAM KINZINGER  STANCE AGAINST FORMER  PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS LEFT HIM  ALIENATED FROM THE GOP. AND AS  BEN BRADLEE REPORTS.  >> DINA BAIR: WHILE KINZINGER  MAY BE UNPOPULAR IN SOME  CIRCLES, HE IS UNDETERRED IN  HIS MISSION.  >> IN 2011, HE WAS A DARLING  OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, A  NEWLY ELECTED FRESH FACED  MILITARY VET JUST BACK FROM  IRAQ WHO STARTS WAS ON THE  RISE. THIS IS FAR BEYOND ME.  THIS IS BIGGER THAN ME. AND  THIS IS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF  OUR COUNTRY. A DECADE LATER TO  TOO MANY REPUBLICANS, THE  DARLING WAS NOW A DEMON, A  CONGRESSMAN WHO COMMITTED THE  CARDINAL SINE OF THE NEW GOP  SPEAKING EVIL OF THE PARTY'S  PROFIT. DONALD J TRUMP. HAS  THERE EVER BEEN A MOMENT IN  THIS PROCESS WHERE YOU'RE  LIKE?  >> KRAFT, WHAT I DO EVERY  TODAY.  >> WE'VE GOT CONGRESSMAN  KINZINGER AT THE MORRIS,  ILLINOIS AIRPORT. THIS  NATIONAL GUARD PILOT.  >> AVIATION IS AN ANCHOR AND  AN ESCAPE. HE'S NEEDED BOTH  LATELY TO MANY REPUBLICANS. HE  IS THE FACE OF CRUTCHER E FOR  TURNING ON TRUMP. I BECAME THE  GUY BECAUSE THERE'S NOBODY  ELSE. A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGHT BE  SURPRISED TO LEARN YOU  ACTUALLY VOTED FOR TRUMP.  YEAH. SECOND TIME. YEAH. WHY  SOME THE ONLY PERSON IN  AMERICA THAT DIDN'T VOTE FOR  HIM AND 16 THAT DID IN 20?  >> I MEAN, THE TRUTH IS IT WAS  FOR ME, IT WAS A COWARDICE. SO  I DIDN'T VOTE FOR HIM IN 16  AND REALLY FOR 4 YEARS, I PAID  THE PRICE FOR THAT EVERY TIME.  >> I DID AN EVENT. I WENT  ANYWHERE. PEOPLE REMEMBER THAT  I DIDN'T VOTE FOR HIM. AND SO  IN 2020 CAME AROUND, I JUST  WAS LOOKING AT I GO, I DON'T  WANT TO DEAL WITH THIS AGAIN.  HE'S NOT GOING TO WIN  ILLINOIS. AND AND SO VOTED FOR  HIM. IT WAS IT'S A REGRET IT  IF I GO BACK IN TIME.  CERTAINLY I WOULDN'T DO THAT.  KINZINGER HAS NOW BEEN BRANDED  A RHINO, A REPUBLICAN IN NAME  ONLY.  >> BEN BRADLEY: BUT THE  REALITY IS HE ACTUALLY VOTED  WITH TRUMP MORE THAN 90% OF  THE TIME PROOF TO HIM. HIS  PARTY CARED MORE ABOUT A  PERSON AND POLICY. THE TRUTH  IS.  >> THIS PARTY IS INVASION OF  THE BODY SNATCHERS. IT'S NOT  THE PARTY THAT I EVER JOINED.  IT'S AROUND A PERSON AND IT'S  KIND OF CREEPY TO BE HONEST  WITH YOU.  >> THIS IS AN EMBARRASSMENT TO  OUR COUNTRY. WE WERE GETTING  READY TO WIN THIS ELECTION.  FRANKLY, WE DID WIN THIS  ELECTION.  >> BEN BRADLEY: KINZINGER SAYS  HIS FINAL BREAKING POINT CAME  ON ELECTION NIGHT, 2020 WHEN  PRESIDENT TRUMP PUSHED FOR AN  EARLY END OF THE VOTE COUNT  WHILE HE WAS AHEAD. BUT I  CERTAINLY DIDN'T THINK I'D BE  ALONE. THEN CAME JANUARY 6TH.  THERE WAS NO TURNING HE  ACCEPTED A SPOT ON THE  COMMITTEE INVESTIGATING THE  ATTACK AND PRESIDENT TRUMP'S  EFFORTS TO STAY IN POWER.  MAYBE THERE WASN'T GOING TO BE  A TIDAL WAVE OF PEOPLE TO COME  OVER. BUT I CERTAINLY DIDN'T  THINK I'D BE ALONE BECAUSE WE  TALK ABOUT DEMOCRACY. WE TALK  ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION  PARTICULAR REPUBLICAN PARTY  LOVES TALK ABOUT CONSTITUTION.  OPENLY VIOLATING IT. NOW,  WHILE DEMOCRATS HAVE PRAISED  THE INDEPENDENCE OF KINZINGER  AND THE FEW OTHER REPUBLICANS  WHO STOOD UP TO TRUMP'S LIES  IN SOME CASES. THEY'VE ALSO  BEEN WORKING TO UNDERMINE THEM  IN MICHIGAN, ILLINOIS, AND  ELSEWHERE. THEY'VE SPENT  MILLIONS PROMOTING TRUMP  BACKED CANDIDATES IN  REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES ON THE  THEORY THEY BE EASIER FOR  DEMOCRATS TO BEAT IN THE  GENERAL ELECTION.  >> WHEN GOVERNOR PRITZKER  SPENDS TENS OF MILLIONS OF HIS  OWN MONEY TO PROMOTE TRUTH OR  AN ELECTION DENY OR AND THAT  GUY WINS. AND THAT GUY COULD  BECOME GOVERNOR OF ILLINOIS.  WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED  IN PENNSYLVANIA, LOOK ABOUT  PETER MEIJER WHERE THEY'RE  SPENDING MONEY, LITERALLY  DONOR MONEY TO PROMOTE THESE  CANDIDATES THAT DON'T BELIEVE  IN DEMOCRACY. AND THEN YET  COME AND TELL ME THAT WE'RE OF  ALL THE GOOD REPUBLICANS GONE.  THAT DOES GET A LITTLE  FRUSTRATING. I'LL TELL YOU.  >> BEN BRADLEY: IT WAS  ILLINOIS DEMOCRAT WHO DREW THE  MAP THAT CUT KIDS IN YEAR OUT  OF HIS OWN DISTRICT. THE FINAL  WAVE IN A POLITICAL TSUNAMI  THAT IS WASHING ADAM KINZINGER  OUT OF CONGRESS. SO I THINK  TRUMP HIMSELF WILSON WILL BE  LESS AND LESS OF A FORCE EVERY  DAY. MY CONCERN IS TRUMPISM  HAS BEEN LEARNED AND THERE ARE  PEOPLE THAT WILL USE TRUMPISM.  NOW TO MAINTAIN POWER. BUT  WHEN YOU LEAVE CONGRESS HERE  IN JUST A FEW MONTHS IN THE  TRUMPERS, KINZINGER WAR, HIS  TRUMP ONE. YES, YEAH. IT ONE  IN THE SHORT TERM, AT LEAST  LOOK, I MEAN, THERE'S NO  THERE'S NO USE AND PRETENDING  THAT SOMEHOW I'VE SCORED SOME  MAJOR VICTORY AND SAVE THE  PARTY 6 TERMS 12 YEARS. BUT  HE'S ONLY 44 YEARS OLD. IS  THIS THE END? KINZINGER ADMITS  IT'S A BIT OF A GAMBLE. IT  SEEMS TO ME LIKE THE BET  YOU'VE PLACED IS. EITHER THE  PENDULUM IS GOING TO SWING  BACK AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE  PRESIDENT. THE UNITED STATES  MONDAY WE'RE GOING TO BE  SITTING AT THIS AIRPORT,  HAVING FUN FLYING PLANES. YOU  KNOW, PEOPLE WAKE UP.  >> THERE MAY BE AN OPPORTUNITY  TO COME BACK IF THEY DON'T.  >> I KNOW I'VE DONE WHAT I CAN  DO THAT. AND THAT TAKES US  BACK TO AN INTERVIEW WITH  C-SPAN. THE NEWLY MINTED  CONGRESSMAN DID ON JANUARY 5TH  OF 2011. I DON'T HAVE KIDS  YET, BUT I WILL SOMEDAY AND  I'M VERY CONCERNED. PASSION  ABOUT LEAVING THE COUNTRY  THAT'S FAR BETTER THAN WHEN I  HEARD IT. IT'S A VERY ACTUALLY  HARD PLAN TO FLY. MUCH HAS  CHANGED IN THE DOZEN YEARS  SINCE THAT INTERVIEW AND  KINZINGER SAYS IT HAS CHANGED  HIM. JUST HAD A KID.  >> AND I KNOW ONE THING. I  KNOW THAT REGARDLESS OF WHAT  HAPPENS WHEN HE READS ABOUT  THIS TIME IN HIS PROUD AS WE  PROUD OF HIS DIDN'T GET I KNOW  THAT, YOU KNOW, SOME POINT HE  IS GOING TO BE PROUD TO BE A  KINZINGER AND I'VE A LOT OF  COLLEAGUES WITH YOUNG KIDS  THAT CAN'T SAY THE SAME THING  AND I WOULD WANT TO BE IN  THEIR POSITION.  >> BEN BRADLEY: KINZINGER  PASSED UP A RUN FOR GOVERNOR  BUT DOES NOT RULE OUT RUNNING  FOR PRESIDENT ONE DAY. IT ALSO  LIKE TO SEE MORE THAN 2 VIABLE  POLITICAL PARTIES IN THE  UNITED STATES. HE SAID MANY  AMERICANS

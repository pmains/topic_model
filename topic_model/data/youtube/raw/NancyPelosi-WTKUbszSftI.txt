gentleman is recognized for five minutes thank you you know this is a this is a crazy debate that we're having here right now because you know the Riggins they keep saying to the Democrats well what's the plan and so we say to the Republicans well what's your plan your plan just seems to be saying to Grandma and Grandpa that they're taking too much the did they really they're taken America for a ride and we have to cut Medicare their health care is too good and Grandma and Grandpa they didn't do enough for America and so the Democrats we turn around and we say hey how about looking at it this way how about before you go after grandma and her Medicare card how about you say to Warren Buffett hey how about not taking those extra tax breaks to Warren Buffett and the Republicans say oh we can't take away any tax breaks from Warren Buffett and all the other Multi multi millionaires and billionaires because they've contributed so much for America we don't want to touch their money even though that would give us hundreds of billions of dollars and then we say to them well how about prescription drugs how about we negotiate the price for prescription drugs for Medicare the way we do with the VA that would save about a quarter of a trillion dollars over a ten-year period they say oh that would be unfair to the drug companies we can't touch them either then we say to them well you know the war in Iraq the war in Afghanistan it's winding down now how maybe we can look at the defense budget and save a few billion dollars there before we ask grandma to sacrifice on the health care that she gets from Medicare and the Republicans say up we can't do that either we can we can't look at any cuts in the defense budget that would be much too hard for on those defense contractors and so then we say to them well how about the oil industry at least the oil industry the 40 billion dollars in tax breaks which they're going to get over the next 10 years I mean do it does anyone in America really believe the day need tax breaks in order to have an incentive to go out and drill for when people are paying 33 fifty four dollars a gallon at the pump but the Republicans say no you can't touch the oil companies either you've got to give big tax breaks to the oil industry as well even as they're tipping Grandma and Grandpa upside down at the pump when they're coming in to put in there unleaded for dal a gallon gasoline self syrup by the way for Grandma and Grandpa at the pump so what do they do instead what they do is they put an oil rig on top of the Medicare card so that the oil industry can drill into grandma's Medicare and pull out the funding in order to provide the tax breaks for big oil for Warren Buffett for the prescription drug industry for the war in Iraq and a run it's all off a grandma she's the one we've targeted the person responsible for all of the wasteful spending in the United States it's all grandma's fault let's cut Medicare she didn't do enough to build our country through the 30s to 40s or 50s and the 60s it's all on grandma so this drill rig that they are building into the pocketbooks of grandma in order to find that funding that's what their plan is all about it's an oil pipeline into the pocketbooks of the seniors they want to cut checkups for Grandma while they cut checks for the oil companies they want to cut health care to Grandma and give wealth care to big oil companies and to billionaires and to prescription drug companies their plan is big tax breaks for big oil and tough breaks for Grandma and for the seniors in our country and the CEO of Chevron he says it's an American on American to think about increasing taxes on the oil industry like you want to know what I say to him it's unbelievable that you could make that argument but even more unbelievable that the looking party would accept that argument and cut Medicare for Grandma to to privatize it to hand it over to the insurance industry increase the cost by six thousand dollars per year for their costs even as they say Warren Buffett the oil companies the big drug companies of the the arms contractors don't worry we're going to protect your programs it's just grandma that's on the cutting block so ladies and gentlemen this is a debate of historical dimensions and until the Republicans come forward with a plan which they don't have in order to make Medicare solvent by raising the revenues out of these other areas from millionaires you know from the oil industry and from others do not expect us to say to Grandma it's your fault it's not her fault she built this country she deserves this benefit and we should not be cutting it this Republican plan to end Medicare is just something that wants to turn it over to the insurance industry vote no gentlemen the Republican plan gentleman from New York

what I have a couple questions here from folks responding to to some of the propaganda that I put out and I said when I put up not really pop again there hopefully useful information but maybe one question in a couple of comments that we've received first of all a question from Jennifer Jennifer rights to say hoping for a country that tries to work together for the better of all instead of fueling hatred and focusing on differences what kind of American do you want to be first of all I wanted to say Jennifer I I'm Tom Carper and I approve your message that sir I trained as a leader groups Boy Scout silver patoka that navy rotc me children aged 70 I always trained to be a leader and a leader who believes that our role is to be a servant our job is to serve not be served leaders should be humble not haughty we should appeal to people's better instincts leaves their purveyors of ho preso leaders should Wow keep out of step when everyone else is marching to the wrong tune we kind of live I or relieved by our examples not do as I say but rather do as I do leaders should always be interested in was the right thing to do not the easy thing to do leaders should focus on the Golden Rule treat other people the way we want to be treated leaders should focus on excellent remit commitment excellence in everything we do and when leaders know the right they shouldn't give up if you sure we're sure right we know we're right we just shouldn't give it up doesn't mean shouldn't listen to other ideas or take input from a broad range of folks and views but those are that's the way the kind of leader I was raised to be trained to be for 23 years as a naval flight officer and my church and all of the kind of had great mentors and so forth so I just described the kind of leader I ought to be and I strive to be I hope I am hmm here's a comment from Duncan and this is a comment on the president's final state of the in your dress which I was privileged to to a 20 to watch and to be right there Duncan rights and he said he loved it he loved the President's speech he said he would have a like to hear more about community focus groups like the Wilmington JC's but you can't get everything actually part of it what the the fourth part of the president's actually focused on citizen involvement I was privileged when I a young man to be a woman can JC and was happy to get to know people and working in ways outside of elective office to try to make our community better and so one of the things the president focused on he says I can't do this by myself and I said basically all of us in there and the house representatives act that evening said you can't either man it just can't be focused in government but we need everybody to help lift our country and to help us continue to be a great nation and I'm reminded of something actually happened to me I was went to Detroit Auto Show back in the early part of january then going for many years della was built more cars trucks and vans per capita than any other state and I was always going to the Auto Show to try to make sure if you're the Chrysler and GM didn't close and and when I was governed they almost did and so I still go to the Detroit Auto Show trying to convince people in building cars trucks being in our state but I when I was a Detroit Auto Show earlier this month I stopped to the restroom and I was leaving the restroom and there was a gentleman was a janitor and his cart with his mop and all this stuff I ready to go into the the restroom and cleaned up and I said who I said I was just wondering the Detroit Auto Show an open you'd said thousands of people are teeming with with people's a huge complex I said to him I said two janitors what did the restrooms here so clean like who keeps his mess room so clean and he smiled and said well I do and I said we're doing a great job I just want to thank you for for that and he said well it's my job and this is what I I do and I try to do it really well he said you know everybody's got a job everybody's got a job and we all need to do our jobs well and you know I've thought about that we all have a job to do we have jobs we get paid for our we have jobs and we like parents or whatever grandparents did we don't really get paid for acceptance I kicking them maybe but we all have an obligation to make Delaware other places a better place in which to live and to work in to raise our family so let's so let's keep that in mind we all have that job let's not lose sight of that thank you here's a comment from John and John ways senator Carper you're a closing comments at the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce dinner were inspiring I think the president's speech gave me hope that in the midst of all the master suite can indeed find that pony tell the story it's a Chamber of Commerce dinner back in early January that one is a little boy my sister I born in West Virginia we go back to West Virginia and in summertime and other times the year just every Stacy our cousins and visit and we visit our grandparents my mom's dad and mom lived on a piece of Lane I don't really pharma kind if they had a chickens and stuff like that and the next door neighbor's a coal miner mr. meadors and mr. Meadowes would go to work in the coal mines in the morning and afternoon he come home at the end of the day face black with cold and clean up and then he'd go milk his cow and he would invite my sister might help make his milk is cow and the cow I had a little shed that the cow would like live in Owen like or weather was bad or whatever hang out and we would help milked a cow and and there was like a big pile of manure that would be like stacked up but next to the cowshed and so matters when I would let my sister know what's under that big pile of manure was under there and here at kennison you say oh there's a pony under there's a pony over there and sometimes when when were faced with adversity and you think oh this is like a big pile of manure I think back to my childhood and that's a somewhere there is a big there's a pony who's got to be a pony in there Albert Einstein said it more I guess elegantly when he said in adversity lies opportunity and for us what we faced with the merger of a Down DuPont potential loss of thousands of good good job excellent jobs question is how do we find that pony how do we find the the opportunity in that diversity and it's there and it is there because we have thousands several thousands of people who they're like they have phd's doctors the researchers their scientists or engineers and they have great ideas they know about business saying a lot of them have ideas that they want to turn into a business and as they look at this change in there career path there's a chance for us to help them to start their own businesses be successful and there's any another exam exam pulse in Delaware that's happened one example is a WL Gore company guy named Bill Gore used to work for Devon took that his ideas and went out and started a huge international company l WL Gore we have another good example in sight pharmaceutical company that has sprung out of people used to work pretty pot Paul fleet led by Paul Friedman and they weren't often to start inside just about 20 people over in Stein Haskell and then the Experimental Station now in their corporate headquarters that big that and their R&D activities got 600 people working in in in Delaware in northern Delaware just outside of the city of Wilmington and that I think they're going to keep on ongoing so and there's other examples besides those but universitylives opportunity and I responsibility here is to make sure that the people well-trained well-educated great careers great job experience who might want to be entrepreneurs and start their own companies that we provide for them a nurturing environment good space clean lab spaces needed access to capital ability to to raise money helping training and I work for us and just holding their hands and let them know if we love them and that we want them to be successful in and try to make sure that that happens

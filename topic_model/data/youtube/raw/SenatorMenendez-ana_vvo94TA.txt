CHINA UPSET ABOUT HER VISIT, AS  TAIWAN ISSE-GOVERNED, BUT  CHINA CLAIMS IT'S RT OF HER  TERRITORY. SOMEONE WHO OFTEN TRAVELS TO  TAIWAN AS CHAIR OF THE SENATE  FOREIGNELATIONS COMMITTEES  SENATOR BOB MENENDEZ. THIS MORNING, HE WROTE AN OP-ED  IN "THE NEW YORK TIMES" ABOUT A  NEW BIPARTISAN BILL FOCUSING ON  THE U.S. STRATEGY TOWARDS TAIWAN SAYING THAT, QUOTE, AS CHINA  CHLENGES US ACROSS EVERY  DIMENSION OF NATIONAL CURITY,  MILITARILY, ECONOMICALLY, AND  DIPLOMATICALLY, AND ON VALUES,  WE ARE LAYING OUT A NEW V VISIO  THAT ENSURES O COUNTRY IS  POSITIONED TO DEFEND TAIWAN FOR  DECADES TO COME. NEJERSEY SENOR BOBENENDEZ  JOINS US TS MORNING. SENATOR, ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO  SEE YOU. IN THAT OP-ED, YOU SAID, THERE  NEEDS TO BE CHANGES IN HOW THE  U.S. SUPPORTS TAIWAN. IN WHAT WAY? >> LL, GOOD TO BE WITH YOU,  JOSE. LOOK, I THINK THAT IT HA BEEN  DECADES SINCE T TAIWAN  RELATIONS A WAS PASSED, WHICH  IS BASICALLY -- SPEAKSO OUR  RELATIONSHIP WITH TAIWAN. AND THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT  REALITIES TODAY. CHINA'S ECONOMY IS MUCH BIGGER  THAN IT WAS THEM. CHINA'S ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL,  AND MILITARY MIGHT IS MUCH  DIFFERENT AND MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN IT WAS THEN. SO, SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE  SEEK TO DO IS TO UP THE POSTURE  OF OUR DEFENSE COOPERATION WITH  TAIWAN, PARCULARLY A IT  RELATES T SALES TO TAIWAN, OF  THE TYPE OF EQUIPMENT THEY WILL  NEED TO SIMPLY DEFEND  THEMSELVES, TO ENGE IN SENNG A CLEAR MESSAGE TO THE CHINESE  THAT IF THEYTTACK UNOVOKED  TAIWAN, THAT THEY WILL  ULTIMATELY BE PISHING  SANCTIONS THAT WILL COME AS A  RESULT OF THAT. TO ENGAGE WITH TAIWAN MORE  SOPHISCATEDEDLY IN ECONOMIC  AND CULTURAL TERMS. AND TOORK WITH TAIWAN TO HAVE  ITS RIGHTFUL PLACE IN  INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIO, LIKE E WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION,  FOR EXAMPLE. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE  ELEMENTS OF WHAT WE SEEK TO  UPDATE THE TAIWANELATIONS ACT. >> SENATOR, MEANWHILE, THE.S.  JUST TOOK OUT THE LEADER OF CADE IN A DRONETRIKE IN  AFGHANISTAN. HOW SIGNIFICANTAS THIS STRIKE? >> IT WAS VERY SIGNIFICANT, FOR  VARIOUS REASONS. NUMBER ONE, AL ZWAIRI HAS MET  HIS MAKER AND HE WAS THE HEAOF AL QAEDA. AND IT SENDS THE MESSAGE, JUST  BECAUSE YOU ARE IN AFGHANISTAN,  YOU ARE NOT BEYOND OUR REACH OR  ANYWHERE ELSE. AND THREE, ITENENDS A MESSAGE TO THE TALIBAN, YOU SAID TO  PRESIDENT TRUMP WHEN YOU MADE A  DEAL WITH HIM, YOU WILL NOT  PERMIT AL QAEDA TO HAVE A  STRONGHOLD IN AFGHANISTAN. WELL, YOU HAD THE HEAD OF AL  QAEDA THERE. SO YOU HAV VIOLATED YOUR  AGREEMENTS WITH THE UNITED  STATES AND TT HAS  CONSEQUENCES. SO IT HAS MANY DIFFERENT  DIMENSIONS AND I THINK IT IS AN  ENORMOUS STRIKE AND INCREDIBLY  IMPORTANT. AND I GIVE THE BIDEN  ADMINISTRATION ENORMOU CREDIT  FOR TAKING IT AND FOR T MANNER IN WHICH THEY DID IT. >> AND SENATOR, I WANT TO TURN  TO ISSUES HERE AT HOME. ST NIGHT, THE SENATE FINALLY  PASSED A BILL THAT WOULD HELP VETERANS SICKENED BECAUSE OF  EXPORE TO BURN PITS, AFTER  DAYS OF LAY. I KNOWOU HAVE BEEN VERY STRONG AND SUPPORTIVE OF THIS. WHATOES IT MEAN THAT THIS BILL IS NOW HEADING TO THE  PRESIDENT'S DESK? >> WELL, FOR OVER 3.5 MILLI  AMERICAN VETERANS, WHO SERVE  THEIR COUNTRY FAITHFULLY, AND  WHARE SICK AS A RESULT OF THE  NEGLIGENCE INHICH WE OPERATED  WITH THESE PISH PITS, THE  TOXIC SUBSTANCES THAT THESE  SOLDIERS INHALED, A NOW ARE  SICK WITH WHAT H HAVE BEEN DENI  ASSISTANCE TO, THIS IS A NEW DAY FOR THEM. IN TERMS OF MAKING IT RIG BY THEM. AND AS I ALWAYSSAY, ARARATEFUL  NATION NOT ONLY MARCHES IN A  MEMORIAL DAY PARADE OR GOES TO  VETERANS DAY OBSERVANCE, A  GRATEFUL NATION TAKES CARE OF  OUR SOLDIERS WHEN TY COME BACK FROM BATTLE, AND HOW WE TAKE  CARE OF THEIR HEAH CARE AND  DISABILITIES AND LOVED ONES FOR  THOSE WHO COMMIT THE ULTIMATE  SACRIFICE. I'M GLAD THAT REPUBLICANS  FINALLY CAME TO TIR SENSES. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN LAW  ALREADY. I DON'T KNOW WHY SO MANY OF THEM ITCHED AFTER THEY ORIGINALLY  PRESSURE OF OUR VETERANS AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE W SAID, DO  RIT BY OUR VETERANS, THAT WENT OUT TODAY AND I'M GLAD TO SEE  IT'S ON ITS WAY TO THE  PRESIDENT'S SK. >> SENATOR, DEMOCRA HAVE  ACCUSED REPUBLICANSF HOLDING  UP THAT BILL I RETALIATION FOR  THE TAX, HEALTH CARE, AND  CLIMATE CHANGE DEAL ANNOUNCED  LAST WEEK EARLIER THISWEEK, YOU ACTUALLY  TWEETED ABOUT THAT YOU SAID, REPUBLICANS WILL NOW  LIKELY TRY TO DIVIDE DEMOCRATS BY INTRODUCING AMENDMENTS ON  IMMIGRATION AND BORDER SECURITY. YOU'VE ALSO SPOKEN ABOUT THE  NEED FOR DEMOCRATSO STAY FIRM  AND UTED ON THIS. W? >> WELL, LOOK, THE  RECONCILIATION ACT DOES A LOT OF GOOD THINGS. FOR EXAMPLE, IT ULTIMATELY WILL  REDUCE FOR 1.6 MILLION SENIORS  IN NEW JERSEY AND 62 TO 65  MILLION SENIORS ACROSS THE  COUNTRY, THE COST OF  PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, INCLUDING  PROVISIONS THAT I OTE, WHICH  CREATES A CAP FOR SENIORS FOR OUT--POCKET EXPENSES AND A  SMOOTHING PROVISIONOAKE SURE TO THE EXTENT THEY DO HAVE TO  PAY FOR ANY OF IT, THEY CAN DO  IT OVER A PERIOD OF TIME, SO  THEY'R NOT SHOCKED BY PRICES. IT WILL DEAL WITH THE  EXTENTIAL THREAT OF CLIMATE  CHANGE. WE SEE THAT IN KENTUCKY, WITH  THE FLOODS. YOU SEE IT OUT WEST WITH THE  WILDFIRES. YOU SEET IN THE NORTHEAST, IN  THE PASS WITH EVENTS LIKE  SUPERSTORM SANDY. SO THAT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. AND IT WILL CREAT A LOT OF  GREAT JO. BUT THE WAY TO SLAY THAT  FLATION REDUCTION A IS TO  HAVE EXTRAOUS PROVISIONS  OPTED, INCLUDING MIGRATIONS, PROVISIONS. SO WHILE THIS IS NOT A PERFECT BILL, I WOULD HE LIKED TO VE SEEN SALT IN IT, TO HELP MIDDLE  CLASS TAXPAYERS GET RELIEF. I CERTAINLY CANNOT SUPPORT IT IF EXANEOUS PROVISIONS COULD  ADOPT IT, PARTULARLY  PEJORATIVE IMMIGRATION  PROVISIONS. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE  HEALTH, WELFARE, AND SECURITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. >> SENATOR BOB MENENDEZ, IT'S

uh the images as I expressed earlier the image is horrified Us in terms of what they suggest and what they conjure up in terms of not only our nation's history but unfortunately the fact that that page of History has not been turned entirely but I will not prejudge the facts I do not in any way want to impair the Integrity of the investigative process the images were horrifying our nation's history I'm sorry what all that was in response to a border patrol agent trying to stop a Haitian illegal immigrant from coming into the country joining me now congressman from Louisiana Mike Johnson joins me Congressman the fact that the DHS secretary knew that all that was a lie before he got up and gave that press conference how in the world does this human being still have a job that's a great question you know on the house Judiciary Committee we have uh addressed this with him under oath on a couple of occasions uh there's a number along lists now a Litany of uh offenses that he has been engaged in since he took office and this is among the most egregious we know now because of emails that have surfaced that he knew hours before that press conference that the narrative about the whipping by the border patrol agents was false he knew it and he decided to stand out there in front of those cameras in those microphones and lie to to repeat the narrative that he knew was false and to slander the border patrol if the man had any dignity at all he'd be asking for forgiveness over that and if the media had any dignity they'd be demanding an answer from him on why he lied to them but we're not seeing any of that so when we get the gavels back after this election cycle you'll see accountability finally for this secretary I continue to hear I'm not putting words in your mouth at all but I continue to hear from Congressman that I know and talk to that whenever the subject of impeachment comes up that mayork is maybe in very very very deep trouble for things that you just pointed out is that what you're hearing or or is that what you're doing well listen I I've been clear I've been on the record uh when he was in front of us last April I told him he'd only been on the job for a few months and we could tell that he was either uh ill-equipped for the job or he was intentionally engaging in for example opening the border and Define openly defined Federal immigration laws that's a serious problem and I told him while he was sitting in front of us in a viral video that he needed to dust off his resume because we would be in charge again and if the Biden Administration and the president did not take care of this problem then we would have to we have an obligation the people are losing their faith in these institutions because of leaders like this and I think he's just an egregious failure I'm glad you brought up losing faith in institutions because it's something we talk about a lot it's not that they're losing it they've lost it the FBI itself doj itself when people half the country at least when they hear these letters now they roll their eyes or they sneer at these things Congressman that's how nation's end if you don't trust your institutions anymore how do you get trust back because they don't seem interested in earning my trust back or anyone's trust back well they're not and and the the persons and the the so-called leaders who don't have that interest have to be replaced they have to be removed the American people have to see that there is accountability and and we're ensuring that that's going to happen if the Republicans retake the majority in this election cycle and I believe we will and in our Judiciary Committee we have a broad jurisdiction over the Department of Justice and the FBI and we're tracking them you know we've sent over a hundred letters requesting information and and details on some of these uh crazy decisions they've made and they've not been responsive at all so just a couple of days ago Jim Jordan and I he'll be the chairman of the Judiciary Committee I'll be the chair of the Constitution subcommittee uh we sent a a notice to uh the the Attorney General himself Merrick Garland and told him to preserve those records because we will have hearings the American people will see this and we're going to ensure accountability we have to because the people will not be able to have faith in their institutions again unless we do this okay now I've been asking people in your position this question because I'm really genuinely curious you haul these people out there for hearings and I'm glad you are I'm glad you and Congressman Jordan are doing that the FBI is going to do I know you know this what they've always done sorry we can't comment on an ongoing investigation or it's well I'm not sure about that I'll get back to you there are never any answers in these things so fast forwarding to that moment then what do you do because something has to be done from there yeah well we we're making a commitment to follow the truth where it leads um Congress has certain Authority Under the Constitution um the death penalty so to speak that the nuclear option is impeachment the Democrats have cheapened that because they used it for partisan political purposes we're talking about restoring the rule of law we're talking about making sure that our public officials are accountable and so you're not going to see us back down from that we'll follow the truth wherever it leads and if it leads to an impeachable offenses we'll we'll pursue that as well we'll send that over to the Senate and see what happens if we have a republican majority in the Senate um you know that's where the trial will be held and we'll see what happens but I think that some of these officials I think mayorkas I think even Merrick Garland if they're held to account and they see that we're serious and the heat is turned up appropriately I think some of these these people may resign I expect mayork is would and we'll have to see what happens which brings us to speaking of impeachment it brings us to Joe Biden no I'm not I I obviously don't want the next Republican Congress to spend every waking moment impeaching everyone in the bide Administration but I distinctly remember Donald Trump being impeached for what was called quid pro quo and we now find out today that Joe Biden despicably told OPEC not to cut oil production until after the midterms now and then he's threatening them by the way since they didn't now that sounds an awful lot like an impeachable defense or offense if we're going off precedent here does it not well it would under the Democrat standard for sure I I served on the impeachment defense team twice for president Trump because they were it was completely baseless of course openly partisan uh exercise and and we were on record many times saying that's not what impeachment is for but when you when you have offenses like this that are so egregious and so in your face um again we have to follow the truth where it leads this energy policy from the bite Administration is absolutely astounding I mean they they have sold out to this climate agenda and they care not what pain it inflicts upon the American people they're going hat in hand begging OPEC increased production to meet our demand and our need here and when they don't do it it's as if uh you know that they've uh they personally offended the president or something by the way the Democrats measures to get back at Saudi Arabia for this are crazy they're talking about uh putting an embargo on arm sales the Saudis oh well that would hurt uh U.S defense contractors and deny them the revenue when the Saudis would just buy the arms from someone else some some uh you know other entity or some other Nation they're talking about pulling troops out of Saudi Arabia the small U.S forces that we have there but they're critical to maintain stability and prevent aggression from Iran so they just have no answers and and their policy is is just insane and it's causing great pain to the American people and I think that's one of the big reasons that we're going to have a legitimate Red Wave election on November 8th Congressman I appreciate it come back soon thank you appreciate it

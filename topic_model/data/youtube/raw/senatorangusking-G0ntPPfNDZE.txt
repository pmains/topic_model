independent senator angus King of Maine he serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee which is investigating Russian election interference if you don't mind I'd like to get a twofer today I want to talk about this news about the emails and its implications but I want to talk to you about what we're hearing will be the latest offer from the Republicans on health care and how it squares with your reckoning of what is needed to pass but let's start with this the emails what do they mean to you well I think Chris we got to sort of step back I'm not going to be an armchair prosecutor I'm going to leave that to Robert Mahler whether laws were broken and and solicitation of information doing all of that kind of thing I what I want to talk about is the larger sort of policy implications there there's one thing that we know that happened it's very well established I think everyone understands and recognizes that except perhaps some people in the White House and that is the Russians did try to interfere in our elections in 2016 this this email confirms that in a rather mundane way it sort of matter-of-factly says yeah we're going to give you some information based on the Russians effort to help mr. Trump I mean that that's one more confirmation but what we don't know and what most of the investigations up here are focusing on is whether there was some kind of coordination or cooperation between the Trump campaign and the Russians we've been told for six months or a year now that there was no such thing never happened no no involvement whatsoever this confirms that there was an opportunity to help with this salacious material about mrs. Clinton and then the question is what happened and that meeting is important everybody's been saying well you know nothing really happened they talked about adoption let's be clear the the lawyer that they were talking to her mission isn't about adoption it's about getting rid of sanctions and that's what the Russians want and that's what they wanted so the question is what did happen in that meeting and what happened subsequent to the meeting and were there further relationships connections coordination and that's what we don't know this revelation is certainly an important piece of evidence it doesn't define the case it doesn't end the case but it's just one more piece of what we're trying to dig into and understand well it is certainly proof that the president is wrong the characterize your efforts as witch-hunt because his own son was targeted by the efforts of Russia as part of what you're investigating secondly in no small irony the Kremlin is getting out in front of this situation in defending the president saying there's nothing to this email chain and the meeting and saying we just heard from their foreign minister just moments ago that there is not one single fact that shows that Russia interfered in the election your response well the first response is to look at the report of the intelligence community on January 6 and again back in last October before the election that details the evidence of Russian interference in our election there's no doubt about that I have to laugh I I said this once before hearing what the Lavrov said this morning reminds me of obi-wan Kenobi outside of the cantina in the first in the first Star Wars these are not the droids you're looking for remember that and you know there's nothing to see here that's just that's nonsense and what do you expect them to say so I don't put much credibility in what they're going to tell us but then the issue about a witch-hunt this isn't a witch-hunt this is an attack on our country and a very serious one and what I'm focused on is how do we prevent it from happening again their pattern in Europe in other places is too this is a continuous ongoing program of of disinformation and undermining basically democratic regimes they did it in France they did it in Holland they're doing it right now in Germany and we really need to understand exactly what they did how they did it and then start talking about how do we protect ourselves because they're going to be back in 2018 and 2020 I don't have any doubt of that and again as you know the president often watches this show and as we've been saying often this morning he understand why he calls it a witch-hunt we understand why every time he hears interference he hears illegitimate you know meaning about his election but that's not what this is about and hopefully seeing what the Russians tried to do to his son will empower him to put his arms around that investigation that you're doing and get to the bottom of it and make our elections safer so health care we do understand that there's going to be a new offer from the GOP that they want to get this through what do you make of the urgency and what do you make of the talk of what this bill will be comprised of them well I haven't really heard any anything resembling details let alone you know the the overall structure of it I know what they put on the floor a couple of weeks ago was terrible but here we are again Chris with with something developed literally in secret I know many Republicans that don't know what's in it and so here it's going to come out I mean maybe tomorrow there'll be a Congressional Budget Office analysis on Monday maybe and then they're talking about a vote next week I mean why not slow down and do it you know in the normal course of business have a hearing get some information let experts from around the country from hospitals from physicians from advocates for people that want to fix it whatever the whatever the point of view is let's get some information this place doesn't work well when a few people put something together behind closed doors and then spring it on the rest of us it's just that's just not the way the process is supposed to work in short of details I heard a philosophical argument made by a Republican on the show recently that I want your response to he said you know we have to figure out what we can afford and we're spending too much we can't keep spending it so we're going to spend what we can and that's all and my counter-argument was but you're taking a lot of money out of the system and giving it in tax breaks to people you could argue don't need it as much as the people you'd be giving that money to and the health care plan which are the neediest who are on Medicaid what is your point about the philosophy of we're spending too much we must spend less and that's what it is about well he's absolutely right we are spending too much we pay more by a factor of just about two we pay almost twice as much per capita for health care in this country as anybody else in the world our outcomes aren't that much better in fact in many cases they're worse so there is an absolutely there's a problem of spending and I think that's the basic issue that we really need to be talking about rather than who pays whether it's Medicare Medicaid anthem or whoever but his solution that he proposed to you is so we're just going to stop spending it on the federal level what that really means is those costs which aren't going to go away are going to be shifted over to the states or to the individuals who are going to lose their coverage I don't think that's a solution to just say well it costs too much and therefore we're not going to pay it anymore that doesn't make the costs disappear it just shifting them to somebody else and as you said it's about a trillion under the original bill that we saw a couple of weeks ago it was a I think 1.1 trillion dollars over ten years out of the medical system you can't do that without hurting people so let's do this senator when we get the details to the extent that they are released why don't you come back on and we can go through what you think this is addresses in terms of costs what it doesn't and what would be better absolutely I'd be glad to and you know one of the places I would start Chris is with the prescription drug prices right we're paying more than anybody else in the world and and it just doesn't make any sense so there are lots of places where I think we need to talk about reforming the system in terms of the cost I'd be glad to come back and talk about Thank You senator appreciate it

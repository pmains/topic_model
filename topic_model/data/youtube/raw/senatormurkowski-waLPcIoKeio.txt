i've come to the floor uh this morning to recognize and commemorate the 45th anniversary of the first oil moving through the trans-alaska pipeline system we actually reached that milepost on monday so i'm here to speak this morning about what this 800 mile long pipeline continues to mean for alaska our nation and and really the world itself taps trans alaska pipeline it is truly a modern marvel it's the backbone of my home state's economy it supports great jobs for alaska it helps generate critical revenues for our state it ensures that our energy is transported safely and it really is a vital component of america's energy security but i think it's kind of nice as we reflect on on on decades past to appreciate some of the history behind the transalaska pipeline because for a period of time there was a question of whether or not this extraordinary energy infrastructure would be built at all after oil was discovered in prude bay there was there was vigorous debate as to how we were going to move this resource how are we going to transport it some wanted to use trucks or tankers others others actually thought that massive jets would be the way to go there were some who wanted to build an overland pipeline across canada that would have been about a 3200 mile line in length but thankfully it was an all alaska pipeline route that prevailed so when you look at at the map of alaska and where our pipeline sits today it it truly does just bisect the entire state of alaska from prudo to valdez at tidewater is an 800 mile line thankfully an all-alaska pipeline route was the one that ultimately prevailed over all of the alternatives that were considered congress authorized it in 1973 an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis of authorization there is an interesting side story about it's actually not a side story it's pretty pivotal in terms of of whether or not this this transalaska pipeline actually came into being but it was a tiv tie breaking vote cast by spiro agnew that really helped to to facilitate the line because it effectively determined that there would be no further litigation about the line moving forward the pre-construction process for taps lasted for about six years mostly concurrent with the final passage of its authorization act and as part of that the federal task force on alaskan oil development this is a is a group that we should probably be bringing back they completed a six volume environmental impact statement so a six volume eis and that eis along with congress's decision to shield taps from litigation again this tie-breaking vote that i've i've alluded to it allowed the construction to begin and so it did several companies joined together to form a joint venture to call it alieska and uh they set forth to build and to operate the line and alieska ultimately acquired 515 federal permits along with more than 832 from the state of alaska in order to proceed now at that time taps was the largest private construction project of its kind it had a price tag of more than eight billion dollars in october of 1975 more than 28 000 people were working to make it a reality and together they turned over one hundred thousand pieces of 40 to 60 foot pipe in a 48 inch diameter that runs from again from pluto to valdez in the south central part of our state i have i've had many opportunities to show visitors our our our trans alaska pipeline you look at it from the air it's just this silver ribbon again that bisects the state you look at it from from the ground and again truly truly an engineering marvel now i saw an old criticism that taps was quote an engineer's nightmare and uh the the occupant of the of the chair here might be interested in this given your background but in reality it is a testament truly to world-class engineering and the genius the creativity and the pioneering spirit of all who worked on it taps crosses three mountain ranges including atigan pass in the brooks range that has an elevation of 4739 feet it reaches a grade of 55 degrees at thompson pass in the chugach range it crosses more than 530 streams and rivers it accommodates some 507 animal crossings and it operates at temperatures ranging from 95 degrees above zero to 80 degrees below zero and that's not counting the wind chill factor and when you're talking about alaska of course you've got to account for seismic activity so taps engineers also had to account for that you've got mountain ranges you've got extreme weather you've got animals wildlife that you have to accommodate you have the rivers the streams but you also have to accommodate seismic hazard the pipeline crosses three fault lines including the denali fault in that area engineers built the pipeline on slider beams with teflon shoes so if you if you look at these supports here these vertical support pillars here and the the the slider beams are on teflon shoes that allow the pipeline to move laterally up to 20 feet up to 20 feet laterally and up to 5 feet vertically so this pipeline can absorb the give and take and the hard shake of a significant earthquake and it's pretty important that the engineers worked this into this extraordinary infrastructure we had a magnitude 7.9 earthquake that struck in 2002 right on that denali fault the pipeline handled it well it remained intact and it did exactly what the engineers designed it to do it moved back and forth on the on these lateral supports it moved up and down and it allowed that that pipeline that piece of of steel pipeline to have the flex that it needed to avoid any any issues the trans alaska pipeline system was built in just over three years this was between 1974 and 1977. i was a a young person growing up in fairbanks at the time and that was a that was a there was a time and place of great energy and intensity as we were involved in this extraordinary um oil oil construction boom and the men and women who were working on the project at that time had had this saying they said they just didn't know that it couldn't be done and they not only met their goal of first oil moving through the pipeline by july 1 1977 they beat it by 10 days and the rest they say is history over the past 45 years taps has not just been a pipeline not just not just oil pipeline infrastructure it has become alaska's economic lifeline i say it's like the the artery for our our state it has helped us create jobs to the point where our oil and gas industry either employs or supports about one-third of alaska's workforce it has generated billions of dollars in revenues for our state for everything from roads and schools to essential services taps has allowed us to grow and well to create and now grow our permanent fund this permanent fund is has really turned our oil resources into an enduring source of prosperity for alaskans we we not only have a permanent fund but spun off from that permanent front and the investment on those earnings are dividends that are returned to each and every alaskan in in the state if you lived in alaska from 1982 when they first started the dividends until today you would have received nearly forty five thousand dollars in annual dividends that go to offset the high cost of living in a high cost state like alaska um this year alaskans are set to to receive a pretty hefty uh permanent fund dividend more than three thousand dollars more so it has been it has been an economic benefit most certainly to alaskans it's also enabled us to keep our state tax burden low we have no income tax in the state we have no statewide sales tax we have the lowest gas tax in the country as the economist scott goldsmith has noted revenues from taps also enable us to keep taxes on other industries like our tourism our fisheries it allows us to keep those taxes lower than they might otherwise be but really from day one taps has strengthened our energy security and when i talk about energy security i'm referring not just to the security of those of us in alaska but to our nation's energy security it helped tide america over during the 1979 oil crisis it's insulated us from opec and opec plus and lessened our dependence on nations who do not share our interests and it has dramatically reduced the dollars that go overseas to purchase oil it certainly provided reliable and affordable energy for tens of millions of americans up and down the west coast because it's the west coast that that alaskan oil is primarily directed but it is hard it is hard to imagine alaska without taps without the transalaska pipeline system it's hard also to imagine the consequences that america would have faced without the 18.4 billion barrels of oil that it has now safely moved over these past 45 years and i think it's no exaggeration to say that well we built a pipeline that pipeline has helped us build our state and in the midst of all of this something that the folks at alieska pipeline are very very proud of alieska has accrued a remarkable safety record from 2017 through 2020 the company reported a total of just 5.1 barrels of oil as as spilled and yet over that same time period from 2017 to 2020 more than 733 million barrels of oil has moved through taps so not not one in every one million gallons not one in every 10 million gallons not even one in every 100 million gallons was spilled during this time period that's a pretty darn good record and that's something that alieska can be proud of and i think it speaks to the kind of company that it is and at its core the reason why taps has been successful are its people they they focus on safety first there are more than 700 people who work directly for alieska on the north slope at the pump stations and at its anchorage control center and in valdez and you're probably not going to find a more dedicated group they just so committed to their mission and it certainly makes me proud to know that about 95 percent of those who work at alieska are alaskans taps is an economic engine for our state but as we are standing here in 2022 celebrating its 45th anniversary fact of the matter is this pipeline faces a real challenge tap's technical capacity is two million barrels per day we have achieved that years ago but right now right now pipeline is moving just a quarter of that they're moving about 500 000 barrels a day and so what that means mr president is that the line is about quarters empty and that that can create some difficult operational challenges and we've had we've had many of the briefings about what it means when you have a pipeline that isn't completely full the throughput moves slower and when you have hot oil coming out of the ground in an arctic environment moving 800 miles through a cold piece of of of steel if it doesn't move quickly and it is allowed to cool down it can build up waxy build up on the inside that needs to be scrubbed and clean we call it pigging it's just an operational thing we that alieska deals with it but it it is it is is something that is an issue when when you have less than full throughput it moves differently and so when you're going up mountain ranges and down the other side now what happens as as as you see that pipeline which is designed to to to to flex when you don't have your full operational capacity and aliaska has been working to work through some of these challenges and they've been doing a good job but in fairness this is not alieska's fault here if you want to know why taps is a quarter full you can probably look to some people in this chamber some who have been serving in this chamber before you can look down the street to pennsylvania avenue at the current administration as well as some who preceded the biden administration we have the resources alaska has the resources to fill taps up what we have lacked what we have lacked is access to our lands access to our leases and access to the permits to help make this a reality and and this is despite various presidents telling alaskans that look you're going to be able to develop your resources they say it and the promises are broken over and over and over again and it continues to this day the biden administration is breaking the law by refusing to carry out the oil and gas program that congress mandated for the non-wilderness 1002 area we did that in the 2017 law millions of acres in our national petroleum reserve being taken off the table with this administration through effectively administration whim and one of the best projects within the petroleum reserve right now we're dealing with some red tape here but effectively the excuse is that more studies need to be done these are studies that have been done already we're being told you got to do them again but mr president with gas prices averaging more than five dollars a gallon across the nation it sure would be nice to fill up the trans-alaska pipeline not only gives us more product domestically would certainly help us us in alaska we'd have more jobs for alaskans we'd have more revenues to help us improve the quality of life in in every community in our state help offset the very high fuel costs in our state we we averaged five dollars and above a long time before many in the lower 48 here but we would also be bringing less foreign oil to the west coast including california where imports have risen in almost almost direct proportion to our production decline so as you're seeing less oil coming out of alaska to the west coast particularly california they're getting it from somewhere and they're bringing it in they're importing that and whether it is it is from countries that don't like us and don't really care about how uh how what their environmental track record or or their human rights issues get it from there we would also have an alternative to russia which continues to sell its energy and bring in billions of dollars a day to finance its bloody war against ukraine and then across the nation across the nation you could anticipate that prices would be lower at the pump which would reduce the pain that families and businesses are experiencing and mr president i know i know that it's not there's not a a dial on this on this extraordinary um uh energy security asset where we can just ramp it up but this is an important discussion to be having again in context of of what value the transalaska pipeline what value the oil resources in alaska can contribute to our country and when when you have in place policies that say it's not important to keep this thing full even though alaska you have the resources to keep it full when you say it's not important and you you put in place pressures and obstacles and barriers to increase production you're going to see that you're going to see that impact what happens in this country to our supply so right now we're all reading about it we're all watching the news um there's a lot that president biden is saying this is what we're going to do to bring down your gas prices but i'll go on record to suggest that a full full tax would do a heck of a lot more to reduce gas prices than many of the other suggestions out there like like price gouging probes and and suspension of the federal gas tax uh that the proposal to hand out gas cards these these are these are temporary almost momentary blips that might make somebody feel okay for a month or two because maybe i get a few cents more off the price at the pump if we have a three-month federal gas tax holiday like president biden is suggesting but you know it's not right to to to put in place i mean you can call it a gimmick um but are you addressing are you addressing the the the fundamentals of supply and demand if you just say for a few months here we're going to take the pressure off you so you won't be so mad well people are going to continue to be so mad if it doesn't it doesn't help alleviate the problem if it doesn't help address the pain that american families are feeling mr president it's pretty simple out here we need supply we need supply to keep up with the rising demand and the falling output from around the world and this is where we need to wake up because it's not as if we don't have options it's not as if we don't have the supply alaska has the supply right in the vicinity of a world-class pipeline that has room for an additional 1.5 million barrels per day so it just it's beyond me it's just beyond me why anyone why anyone would contemplate oil from iran or venezuela or other members of opec plus over a state like alaska it's just it's just beyond me and yet that is what we hear that is what we hear from the president that's what we hear from the administration that somehow we've got it we've got to we've got to get this resource and it's going to have to come from somewhere so we're going to go asking we're going to go asking outside of our country we're going to go to iran venezuela president's going to make a trip to saudi arabia and yet they're not asking alaska to do more in fact they're not only not asking they continue to put up impediments and barriers for us to do more and that justifies logic it degrades it degrades the environment it makes the world a more dangerous place every time we look to other countries for sources that we need knowing full well that we have a better environmental record here we have we have the ability to make us less vulnerable less energy insecure and yet we're not we're not taking advantage of that mr president there's a section on alieska's website and it's entitled memories and mile posts with historical information about taps and i would suggest that it's well worth visiting and recognizing what an incredible asset this pipeline has been since first oil was moved through it on june 20th of 1977 45 years is a is a good long time but even as we thank all who have made taps such a resounding success i would encourage all of you maybe you mark your calendars for june 20 uh of 2027 that will be the 50th anniversary i would hope that we can all be honest and realistic about our global energy needs in the meantime and ensure significantly greater throughput is running through that pipeline when we reach the next mile post that would be good for alaskans that would be good for the country i think it would be good and important for the world and we know the men and women who operate taps at alieska and their contractors will ensure that every last molecule moves safely through it so with that mr president i thank you and i yield the floor

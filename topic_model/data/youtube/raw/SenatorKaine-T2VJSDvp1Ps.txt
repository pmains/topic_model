senator okay Thank You mr. chair and thank you to the witnesses this is very hard because diplomacy with an adversary with an enemy is hard diplomacy with a friend can be hard but diplomacy with an enemy President Truman when he proposed to spend billions of dollars to rebuild the economy of Germany after they had done two wars against the US in 25 years that was hard and there were objections there were no votes President Kennedy nuclear-test-ban treaty with the Soviet Union during the Bay of Pigs they were negotiating that was hard it was controversial and there were no votes diplomacy with an adversary is hard diplomacy with an adversary is often necessary this is a deal that in my review produces a dramatically better position for about 15 years than the status quo before negotiations started when you started the negotiations right before Iran had a program that was 19,000 centrifuges and growing you've knocked it back to 6,000 12,000 kilograms of enriched uranium enough for multiple weapons you've knocked it back to 300 an enrichment level twenty percent and climbing you've knocked it back to three point six seven percent a heavy-water plutonium facility at Iraq they're dismantling it they were on a path where they had a huge program and it was growing for 15 years this deal with the inspections mechanisms etc produces a dramatically better status quo for the United States for regional allies for the world my question is about after your 15 secretary Moniz various provisions start to come off the certain elements of the program certain inspections begin your 8 10 your 15 the 300 kilogram cap comes off when you get to your 25 here's how i read this deal the deal basically is iran commits in the first paragraph of the agreement under no circumstances will Iran ever seek to develop purchase or acquire nuclear weapons they've agreed to all the NPT obligations going forward and they've agreed that any nuclear program will be completely civil in nature they make that commitment what we have to determine if they would cheat would be the intelligence that we have the knowledge we've gained through 25 years of enhanced inspections and the ongoing inspections under the NPT especially the Additional Protocol is that level of knowledge sufficient at year 25 and thereafter to detect if Iran tries to violate this deal and acquire nuclear weapons well I think it certainly puts us in a far stronger position that we would be otherwise and and I think the risks on their part would be enormous to try to break their their their commitments and I think you put your finger on a very important thing which I think our intelligence community would would support we should not forget the tremendous knowledge of the program what they're doing where they're doing it over 25 years we will have a lot of indicators to really amplify our national means that's a good segue to the question I want to ask secretary Kerry which is about alternatives you talked to Senator Murphy about them I think there were those who objected to the negotiations starting in november of 2013 they were against that diplomatic beginning if we could go back to that status quo seems to me that the status quo then was we had sanctions they were punishing around hurting their economy but they were racing ahead on their nuclear program we were hurting their economy but the nuclear program 19,000 centrifuges in climbing 12,000 kilograms and climbing and richmond percentage climbing iraq heavy water moving ahead if we just had lived with that status quo it seems to me one of two things was going to happen either they were going to eventually capitulate because of the sanctions or they were going to get a nuclear weapon there were two there were two odds I don't know and I'm not going to ask you to assign odds to those two things but there was a significant risk the program had you not started diplomacy they were going to get a nuclear weapon and you have four stalled that so that was one alternative we do nothing but that status quo was a dangerous one where their program was rocketing ahead let me mention another alternative because it's been mentioned by members of this body after the framework was announced on April to a member of this body who has been allowed an influential voice in this issue said bombing Iran to end their program would only take a few days mr. secretary you've been at war do you find that to be a realistic statement well it's a I find it to be a factual statement in the sense that it would only take a few days but I don't find it to be a realistic statement in terms of a policy because the implications of that if you are not at the end of your rope in other words it is not last resort would be extraordinarily complicated for the United States if we were to do that that's an alternative if we were to do that right now would we have international support for that not on your life no way it and would we have an international legal basis for doing it we were in Israel in January number of us met with Israeli intelligence officials who said they have concluded that Iran is trying to get to a threshold but that ron has not yet made a decision to pursue and acquire nuclear weapons if we were to initiate a war against Iran when they had not yet made that decision would there be an international basis for a war no and furthermore we'd be proceeding without any of our allies which is not a not a small consequence let me flip it around on you because I want to talk about credible military threat if this deal is done and if Iran confirms to the entire global community in the UN Iran reaffirms that under no circumstances will around ever seek develop or acquire any nuclear weapons they pledged that to the world we're all in agreement and then they break toward a nuclear weapon would we be more likely to have the support of international partners if we want to take military action to stop them from doing what they pledged not to do absolutely would we have a greater legal basis to justify taking military action to stop them from doing what they have pledged not to do yes and would we have because of an inspections regime plus existing intelligence a lot more knowledge about how to target military action increasing the credibility of our military threat yes I don't have any other questions mr. chair

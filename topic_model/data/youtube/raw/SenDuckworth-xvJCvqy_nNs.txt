I think there we go for convening this important conversation like to our witnesses you are leading the way and I thank you all for being here in Illinois we have several communities that have committed to is transitioning to 100% clean energy Chicago our nation's third largest city is committed to transitioning to 100% clean renewable energy for all buildings by 2035 and to 100% renewable electric bus fleet by 2040 although there's not much good news to report in the area of climate change to the extent that we can it is that scores of leaders in local and state governments like you are taking action thank you for not waiting for the fence mayor bottoms in your testimony you shared that low-income residents and residents of color are the most vulnerable to impacts from our changing climate including flooding and extreme heat to address to address this you have prioritized reducing energy and transportation costs with these communities as well as sought out new pathways to economic opportunity in a new clean economy in the Senate here I have co-founded the economic the environmental justice caucus and it's certainly something that I am I'm looking very closely at can you please share with us what policies have been the most impactful for you and addressing these issues and if there any federal tools in particular that you've used so we can actually make stronger to help places like Atlanta and Chicago to achieve their climate action goes so for example are there like any plans of federal action that we could implement that would help you and are there any tools that you're already using that our federal tools that we could perhaps make even stronger and more readily available yes and thank you and I'll be happy to share a few that we are already making use of in Atlanta the National Renewable Energy Lab we are going to them for resources also I mentioned earlier the assistance from Rockefeller Foundation and Bloomberg philanthropies particularly with the Rockefeller Foundation and helping to create our resilience framework and also helping not just Atlanta but cities across the country putting in in place a chief resilience officer the green link group so has assisted the city of Atlanta in creating our clean energy scenario tool the Department of Energy's Clean Energy for low-income communities accelerator toolkit has also been helpful and also just even having the discussion around the upcoming census has been an opportunity for us to integrate this conversation and speaking especially with our underserved and often undercounted communities why a Census count matters because obviously it's helpful to us to get additional federal funding in our underserved communities are there any particular federal grant programs or anything like that that you've used that you can think of you mentioned the Department of Energy has their packet is there anything else like that that's not a not-for-profit but it's a federal program that we hear on this side of the diets might be able to help with I think again going back to the clean energy assistance and as we are having this conversation in our communities and helping communities our underserved residents with their energy bills and also to help convert some of our housing that we are are working to create an affordable housing pipeline in the city of Atlanta we have a goal of creating and preserving 20,000 units of affordable housing in the city of Atlanta by 2026 assistance in that program as we undergo construction and redevelopment of those homes to help us make sure that they have sustainable and clean energy would be tremendously helpful thank you mayor Peduto like the spew city Southern Illinois has played a major part in powering our country especially with our coal miners in as far south and I fear that these communities will be left behind despite their contributions our nation if we don't give them specific prioritizations as we consider plans to affect climate change this will truly happen and you mentioned the need for a Marshall Plan for the Midwest could you describe broadly the policies you would like to see included in such a plan absolutely I am you know being from western Pennsylvania growing up there my entire life I saw this is my area die I saw City come back slowly but the areas around Pittsburgh just like in other areas and the Rust Belt haven't come back and when we have the conversation a couple of years ago we basically told people who had given their lives of working to build America that they could become coders it was tone-deaf these are people who have that opportunity want to be a part of it you want to turn a coal miner and do an environmentalist put a paycheck in his hand give them the opportunity to see where that would be if we start to look at just one industry right now in the United States we have 300 electric buses China has 421 thousand we're losing the industry we should be making those buses here they should be employing people from Detroit they should be made and being exported around the world and we should be using the technology out of the University in Michigan and others to be able to create batteries that can be able to hold a charge the longer than anywhere else there is an entire new economy being born but we're not investing in it so a specific plan would address those types of technologies that would help to reduce our carbon footprint while putting us on a competitive advantage against the rest of the world in providing tax breaks into those areas that have been left behind geographically to locate in those areas and employ those people thank you

let's bring in congressman adam schiff who represents the 28th district and is the chairman of the house intelligence committee and great to have you in the studio for the first time in a year and a half good to see you it is great to be seeing you in three dimensions it's awesome i know no weird zoom delays uh so all right so let's begin with this the the the pentagon's move today and this push for vaccines what more should be done should there be more vaccine mandates how do we get this thing done well i'm glad to hear the news uh in terms of the pentagon and that's probably a really good place to start because there's a long history tradition practice of frankly requiring service members to get all kinds of vaccinations so it won't come as a culture shock and the military is a big part of our population so that's going to help but also federal employees making it really important essential for people to get vaccinations or they'll have to go through constant testing people want to travel as part of work they're going to have to get vaccinated and i think once the fda makes formal approval so it's not just an emergency approval i'm hoping a lot of private employers and others will follow suit that's the only way we're going to really put this pandemic behind us and of course on the other side there's a lot of people who say it's a government overreach today in fact we had health care workers protesting outside of local hospitals they're upset about california's mandate for health care workers they call it medical tyranny what do you say to one woman who said that we lose this fight we lose our country well i would say look people have a right to take risks for themselves they don't have a right to expose other people to risks and so on the house floor for example the house physician recommended that we go back to wearing masks there are i i guess the last estimate is half of my republican colleagues in the house will not get vaccinated or have not been vaccinated they're making a judgment about spreading the virus to those of us who have been vaccinated who might bring it home to their kids who can't get vaccinated well they shouldn't be able to put our kids at risk and or their neighbors or their friends and so we all have a social responsibility and at a time when around the world people are desperate to get the vaccine um we shouldn't be complaining that we have it and ought to make use of it we've seen a lot of hesitancy with republicans versus democrats but we also have seen a lot of hesitancy in the african-american community specifically with much lower vaccination rates how do you do that how do you fix that because that's not just a republican issue that's the democratic base no and look i mean there are a lot of people who are vaccine hesitant and it's not a political issue for them some have been exposed to bad information online uh just plain flat-out wrong information other are concerned that they might have a reaction to the vaccine the only antidote to that is pushing out good information and in the black community look there's a real sinister history of vaccination in the black community that was designed for really illicit purposes so i can understand the hesitancy we need to overcome that and the good news is we're starting to overcome that so vaccination rates in the black community are going up compared to other communities and the disparity is decreasing the other part of the good news is that on the whole as this delta variant has surged people are getting the message and we're seeing requests for vaccination now go up pretty substantially yeah in california vaccination appointments have increased almost 50 percent in the last few weeks so that is significant progress there i'm curious because you spent a lot of time of course in washington dc in our nation's capital because you have to how often are you on the ground mingling with your constituents locally and what are you hearing from them as it relates to the coronavirus pandemic you know it's been wonderful frankly to be able to see my constituents again during much of the pandemic i only got to see them when i was doing food deliveries and what i'm hearing from them is i think being reflected around the country which is those who are vaccinated are becoming increasingly intolerant of those who are not or refuse to be or refuse to wear a mask and take precautions and so the divide seems to be hardening to some degree but if if we're ever really going to be able to put this behind us we're going to have to get to that kind of hurt immunity which means we're going to need to get vaccinated and i'm glad to see vaccination rates finally going up so let's talk about another big issue the house is out of session this week the senate is not the senate about to pass this massive bipartisan infrastructure bill one of the biggest pieces of bipartisan legislation we've seen in years it now goes to the house do you have the votes to pass it in the house what's next um we will have the votes to pass it if it's accompanied by a human infrastructure bill that is that this is a two-step process one is focused on roads and bridges and highways what we consider traditional infrastructure the other is focused on early childhood education on helping kids afford college on investing in the human infrastructure expanding the child tax credit for families and we don't have the votes to pass either without the other but we do have the votes to pass both together and so the first step i think is very positive but it's not the end of the process are you worried that you'll pass both and that the senate won't pass the other one won't pass the human infrastructure um well i am worried about it because we're going to clearly get the bipartisan physical infrastructure bill and we need the senate to produce the human infrastructure bill because i'm confident we can get the votes in the house to do both the senate is more in doubt well yes it is a bipartisan bill but there on the other side allow me to the gop and republicans will say there's a lot of democratic pork in there it's going to add to the deficit it's going to make people more dependent on the government and you say well in terms of the the bipartisan package that is on the verge of passage that has a lot of republican buy-in to it the human infrastructure bill doesn't have much republican buy into it and all i can say is this is a different priority of the parties when the republicans were controlling everything they spent 2.2 trillion dollars we didn't have on a tax cut for very wealthy families and corporations we're choosing to invest a similar amount in child early childhood education and helping kids pay for college and helping lift people out of poverty and helping working families it's so it's a different priority for our party what i'm proud of frankly but it does mean that it's going to be a tough legislative process still to come where are we in the house when it comes to the hearing into the insurrection will the panel call on president trump former president trump to testify we will get an update more with congressman adam schiff next [Music] we're back with congressman adam schiff the chair of the house intelligence committee and a member of the january sixth commission yeah we just heard the first hearings wrapped up last month not long ago at all we heard from four officers during the first set of hearings so what is next we've been in the process of trying to figure out okay what's our next hearing going to be the first one was really powerful we want to match you with another powerful hearing but there's a lot of work to be done in the interim we're ramping up our staffing ideally we would get documents that we can ask the witnesses about for our subsequent hearings and those subpoenas and requests for information need to go out so we're still very early on we feel like we're building the plane as we're flying it when we looked at the 911 commission it was months before they had their first hearing we've only been together as a committee for weeks so we're already ahead of the game but we have a lot more work to do is president trump going to testify i don't know the chairman hasn't made that decision yet we are obviously talking about how do we get information about what the former president knew what others in the administration knew before january 6 about the presence for example of white nationalist groups of the propensity for violence that day what was going on in the white house during the attack why wasn't the national guard called in earlier lots of questions we have about what was going on in the white house and he may very well be a relevant witness is there interest in calling kevin mccarthy jim jordan other members of congress who were in communication with president trump that day and what would the legal precedent be for doing that there's a lot of interest in that and they certainly appear to be pertinent in the case of ken mccarthy he spoke with the president while the attack was going on uh and told colleagues republican colleagues about that conversation and how the former president uh purportedly said well clearly those people or something that effect care more about the election then you do mccarthy uh something along those lines so we want to get to the bottom of just what exactly was said uh and jordan has said that he was in communication with the president also um and uh in terms of precedent there is a precedent in the russia investigation we had two members one democrat republican deposed in that investigation no they did so voluntarily and there's a big question mark of course as to whether these people like mccarthy will be voluntary witnesses or not if you quickly if you had to guesstimate when the next hearings would be how soon i think that we're not likely to be able to do one another hearing during august so the earliest would be september but it will all depend on the availability of witnesses and whether we get the information uh that we need to prepare for it before then and at least you guys are getting along behind the scenes uh you know we are i think everybody on the committee is you know determined to get to the truth make it non-partisan fact-based and write a comprehensive report all right congressman adam schiff thank you so much for coming in thank you again

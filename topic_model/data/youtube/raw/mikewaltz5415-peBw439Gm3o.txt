to congressman mike walsh the florida republican kind enough to join us now of congress and first on the economy and everything else we'll know for sure on thursday uh whether we're in a recession or not depending on what that second quarter gdp number is i'm sure many of your constituents and others have been indicating via these surveys they already feel we are how are they reacting to the numbers we're getting yeah neil you can't spend you can't hide uh from the gas pump and it underlines and underscores every aspect of our economy everything has to be transported everything has to be delivered somewhere and until biden is willing to take on the progressives when it comes to our domestic energy policy they're going to keep flailing around at this issue and they are going to feel it when it comes to the ballot box in november so you don't buy what they're saying that it's already working they're opening up the strategic petroleum reserve and uh pushing uh in that regard has sent gas prices down nearly 40 days running we're over the worst of it things are getting better uh that's yeah i didn't buy it when they said that right i didn't buy it when they said inflation was transitory last year and i don't buy this kind of nibbling around on the margins of the fundamental issue is that we have gone from 13 million barrels a day to 11 million barrels a day in u.s exports just since last year and geopolitically we should be flooding the zone especially in europe with cleaner american liquefied natural gas and as long as gas prices stay as high as they are putin will have as much as he needs to continue his war machine instead of funding dictatorships and looking for their oil and gas let's fund uh and and let's support american oil and gas and we will solve all kinds of problems killing you know multiple birds with one stone um to just belabor this point with one other question i'm curious what you make of the russians now uh they've sort of reopened the spigot through gazcom their their state-controlled energy company uh but providing a lot less natural gas to europe than in the past and the europeans already considering uh you know rationing that out and urging member countries and their residents to curtail uh use by up to 15 percent i know it's apples and oranges congressman but do you see that kind of thing coming here yeah well i mean there's a lot of differences there neil but i think what the you know what the russians are doing is keeping just enough going to europe uh while they shift their supplies to india or they shift their exports to both india and china china's up over 50 just in the last year and are filling that void uh as quickly as they can in terms of of european markets the thing i'm worried about and we just met with uh president zielinski in ukraine that he's worried about is europe's in the middle of a heat wave right now when they get to winter uh that's when it's really going to get critical and the europeans are already way under delivering what they promised zelinski in terms of military aid when they're in that kind of critical energy situation they're gonna they're gonna dial it back even further uh and and that means putin's the winner you know you mentioned president zelinski you met with him um now we know from the russian foreign minister uh one of their goals is to take him out of power um they left it open-ended how they could do that but that he doesn't deserve to be the ukrainian leader what did you make of that well they've been trying it through political manipulation now for some time and when that didn't work i think that's one of the key reasons you saw this military invasion remember their initial strategy was a quick decapitation of the zielinski government a quick seizure of keeve and then and then bringing ukraine under russia as a vassal state obviously that didn't work zielinski deserves all the credit we can give for his leadership in rallying not just the ukrainian people but i think all of uh all of the world to their fight for freedom but he is incredibly afraid that the the bide administration will settle with the lines as they are and that means that all putin is going to do is hit a pause button refit his military and he'll be right back at it again zielinski is is just incredibly concerned the administration is helping him play for a tie or helping him not lose so badly rather than giving him what he needs to win in the time that he needs it which is now um you were mentioning china sir and i'd be remiss if i didn't mention this dust up over whether nancy pelosi can go ahead to taiwan as she wants a number of you your republican colleagues that maybe you are among them uh says that she should go the chinese are apoplectic about it i don't think she should i don't know what president biden's view is on it but he's been pretty quiet about it how do you feel about her going to taiwan oh i think she should absolutely go it's rare that i show any kind of support for any policy of nancy pelosi but in this one we don't let the chinese communist party dictate where our elected leaders visit uh and and you know both when and where in terms of supporting our allies and the second thing neil is what does that send what kind of message that send if she doesn't go if she allows the bully to win and biden allows them to win to the japanese the south koreans the indians australians and all of our other allies if we won't even visit taiwan what message does that send in terms of defending taiwan and defending uh freedom around the world congressman wallsap thank you very much and for your service to this country that's where people forget that but i certainly do not congressman mike waltz uh of the state of florida in the meantime you want to let you know a little bit more about how the

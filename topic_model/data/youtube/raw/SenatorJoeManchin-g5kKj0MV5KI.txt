i'm involved with the nicholas county senior center and in october 2019 we received the bill for a fine of 1080 dollars to cause an income tax return had been filed late and i got in touch with senator manson's office called that office and with the help that was abated and we got the notices that we did not owe anything then july the 19th this summer 2021 we get a bill from internal revenue service for the same issue but it was 25 3692.25 so then again i got in touch with senator manchin and with his staff they saved us almost 4 800 which we've used will use to buy food to feed the citizens here in nicholas county so it's really helpful that we got that money

what is this all about this is about are we going to be guided by decades of science from thousands of respected scientists oh or not this is about are we going to seize the opportunity that's inherent in the adversity we face the challenges that we face at home and around the world or not this is about are we going to get serious about ending our addiction to oil a lot of which here in our country is in places like the Gulf of Mexico and some of a thousands of feet below the surface of the water or not this is about are we going to stop sending literally tens maybe hundreds of billions of our dollars every year to the places around the world that are unstable non-democratic propping up tyrants like tyrants who lead countries like Iran and like Venezuela or not this is about are we going to continue sending troops to places like gorap or or other places around the world would happen to have a lot of oil and we want to make sure that that there is access to to that oil or not and this is about whether or not we're going to jumpstart our economy at a time in our nation's history when literally millions of young people are graduating from colleges and universities graduating from high schools wondering if they're going to have the kind of opportunity find a job and provide for themselves and their families someday provide a good life better than one that they have inherited from their parents that is what this is about now we have heard I've heard and I know my colleagues have heard learning from hundreds thousands of scientists from all over this country to give us give us their advice and what are they telling us among the things that they're telling us is that the earth is growing warmer they're telling us that we are part of the cause they're telling us to do something about it they're saying to us if we won't do something about it at least let e PA do the job that they've been told by the supreme court that they've got to do under the Clean Air Act among the things that they've got to do under the Clean Air Act is to as senator Feinstein alluded to provide for ratcheting up the fuel efficiencies of our cars trucks and vans up to about 34 miles per gallon by when t16 the effect of doing that will take something like 50 million cars trucks and vans off the road by 2030 that's the kind of thing EPA needs to do if we will let them who are the the scientists that we're hearing from who are they I don't know them all we've heard from a couple of thousand I know a couple of them real well though and their names are Lonnie and Ellen Thompson the professors at the University my undergraduate alma mater and they spent a lot of the last 20 25 years running something called the the polar Polar Research Center at Ohio State they've also spent a lot of the last 25 years going around the world climbing up by some of the tallest mountains and there were a lot of along the equator where are they snow caps give them the opportunity to take ice core samples and the those snow caps over time have actually begun to disappear largely disappear but the ice core samples that they still have frozen at the campus of Ohio State University give us an opportunity to go back in time and as we go back in time to look back as much as a hunt a million years to look like a million years and what do we see then we see over that million years different levels of carbon in our air sometimes it's high sometimes it's low they have correlated doctors Thompson dr. I call him Thompson twins but dr. dr. and dr. Thompson have actually correlated the increases in carbon with increases in temperature over time the decreases in carbon in the atmosphere with the decreases in in temperature they are correlated they're positively correlated and the the dr. dr. Thompson say we ought to do something about it we ought to act on that science and I believe they're absolutely right they also have we've also heard from our scientists around the country that the ten hottest years in all the years we've been around is a country keeping records ten to the ten hottest years the last 20 years within the last 20 years and in an effort to compel our government to take action all kinds of campaigns have been launched why you heard one of them hear from us I think senator Feinstein talking about drought fertile farmland turns into desert polar bears don't have ice to float on we see endangered species disappear movies are made about the extreme weather that's going to flow out of change I'm going to leave with other people to pursue those particular agendas or example I want to focus on a couple of I'm more familiar with one is Delaware where I live and the other is Florida when my parents live for the last thirty years of their life this is Delaware outline here in in black and if the melting that's going on in the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets continue and it will continue over the next hundred years or more this will no longer be Delaware the green area right here will be Delaware people won't go to a row with beach to the to the beach anymore or Bethany Beach you're doing Beach they'll be looking for a beach up here and in Dover they won't be going to NASCAR races in Dover I like to did a couple of weeks ago they'll be going to sailboat regarded and Dover that's where we'll be ocean view down here which doesn't have an ocean view will be under the ocean you won't have a view of the ocean they'll be under the ocean and how about Florida let's take a look at Florida I'm going to look at Florida if there's one meter rise in NC level and we're going to look at the Florida with with about a six meter ride my parents lived in there clear water just just around here on st. Peters a beer gun Tampa the place where they used to live largely underwater largely underwater they lived about a half-mile from the Gulf pretty much underwater look down here at South Florida go to South Beach when we have a meter of sea rise you won't find it it'll be underwater let's look at six what happens with six meters of sea rise the red part here is the parts of Florida that are basically underwater most of the people live in Florida live in the parts here that are in red where they going to live well they can I guess come in a little bit but they sure won't be living in the area to turn red because they would otherwise be under water there's a saying that all politics is local and that's been true for a long time and it's still true for a long time the highest point of land in Delaware is a bridge and when we got a couple of feet of the feet of sea level rise are the outline of our state changes dramatically the quality of life in the state is underwater changes dramatically as well the same is true of Florida a bunch of other or coastal states what do we need to do what we need to do is unleash market forces what we need to do is put millions of people to work doing what building new nuclear power plants finding ways to take carbon dioxide coming off of coal-fired plants turn into concrete aggregate that we can use to build roads highways bridges in this country to build buildings in this country to take the co2 coming off of coal-fired plant and turning into biofuels what do we need to do we need to deploy off our shores off of Rehoboth Beach windmill farm we need to deploy windmill farms from North Carolina we're presiding officers from all the way up to Maine we need to take that out electricity that we're generating from the wind and use that to power vehicles like the Chevrolet Volt is going to be launched this fall like the Fisker Karma in Neenah they're going to be launched in in a year or so built in in Delaware they get a hundred miles per gallon what do we need to do we need to make sure that the cars trucks and vans of GM and Chrysler prepared to build 44 miles per gallon that when they build them somebody will be there to buy them my clothes were the words were friends of a friend of Senator boxer an eminent climatologist Stephen Stills Stephen sales used to say used to say he wrote the song great song and said something's happening here just what it is ain't exactly clear well it's clear to me it's clear to me that our planet is getting warmer and it's clear to me that our great challenges that poses for all of us but inherent in those challenges or great opportunities as well the thing that we've got to do is seize those opportunities to seize the day thank you very much madam president

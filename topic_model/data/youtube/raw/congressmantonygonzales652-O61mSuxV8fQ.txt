joining me now is lawmaker and navy veteran who is inside of that very briefing republican congressman tony gonzalez of texas congressman thank you for being with us you probably can't share much from that briefing but as you watch the president in his briefing just a second ago how did what he said strike you compare to what you've been hearing today yeah i can't get into the details but i can give you the overall sentiment is two things one in a bipartisan manner we all agree that every american needs to come home that's one and two we need to not look at any arbitrary deadlines whenever that date is that date is we can't put guardrails on that we have to go to all parts of afghanistan in order to do that look afghanistan is very personal to me i served five years in afghanistan it's very personal to many of us that serve there in a corresponding capacity and an ngo capacity this is the part that the administration doesn't understand what happens in afghanistan directly impacts the region the world and back home here in the united states i think americans have that exact same sentiment they feel like what they're hearing in these briefing rooms has nothing to do with the reality on the ground and i think they're seeing that around this august 31st deadline you said that should be out the window because that's not the objective and yet in this briefing just a few minutes ago the president reiterated we're going to get it all done by august 31st is there any planet on which that happens there is not and look there is a disconnect between the war fighters and the president and and his messaging it's complete uh chaos up there this is what i'm hearing on the ground and i'll remind you many of our offices many of our congressional offices have basically turn into operational offices mine included so on the ground this is what i'm hearing i'm hearing the state department is telling uh afghan interpreters to stay in place right no don't make it to kabul stay in place what i'm telling folks is you need to get out as soon as possible whether that's to pakistan whether that's elsewhere you need to get out as soon as possible because this situation is only going to get worse it's going to only going to spiral as time goes on but there's mixed messages and the president has it wrong congressman maybe the biggest mixed message in my opinion is the idea that we're not going to trust a word the taliban says but we're going to work with them to get people out again reporting on the ground is telling us they're not letting afghans who we want to get out even get into the airport at this point what has to happen realistically to make sure that we can keep our commitment to get every last american and ally out of afghanistan look you have the taliban that literally after they took over kabul were yelling death to americans in the street nothing has changed in 20 years and to think all of a sudden that they're going to be welcoming partners they're not and we can't treat them as such what we have to do is we have to be firm and we have to be bold and we have to ensure every american gets out no matter the cost no matter what part of afghanistan that they're at also our afghan partners you know the other thing is what happens in afghanistan impacts the world what worries me is our southern border is wide open as this chaos continues to expand you're going to see terrorism spread throughout the globe the last thing any of us want to see is anot another 911 due to this administration's debacle at this withdrawal congressman really quickly we have a number of evacuees from afghanistan who will be coming to the united states non-citizens the president talked about screening them to make sure they're not a threat do you have any confidence that we're going to be able to keep that commitment to make sure the u.s isn't threatened or are you concerned about the screening process right now yeah no i am very concerned on it matter of fact fort bliss in el paso texas is going to be one of those locations and i will be visiting fort bliss on friday and saturday to see it firsthand one of the parts of congress is the oversight and compliance is to see that we have to make sure every person is vetted completely but we also have to stand with our afghan allies those that have fought alongside us for decades we have to make sure that they get out safely that their lives are not in jeopardy but they have to be vetted congressman really quickly i just have to ask you your office is working on helping people get out of afghanistan what is the what are the messages you're getting what are you seeing on the ground when it comes to being able to help get folks out of there literally my phone has been blowing up non-stop acro all hours of the night with people essentially begging for their lives you know trying to fight and scratch and claw in order to make their way out and we've been working with them like in a very operational uh capacity to help them get out to the nearest location in many cases i mean afghanistan is very corrupt so in many cases they have to have enough resources in order to pay off these different checkpoints to try to get to where they need to be right now we're telling people get out as soon as possible do not do not uh hunker down because things are only going to get worse congressman thank you for picking up those phone calls godspeed and everything you're doing we appreciate it congressman gonzalez thank you god bless you well

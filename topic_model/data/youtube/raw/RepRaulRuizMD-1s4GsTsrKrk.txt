i know that you represent one of these rural areas in southern california how is congress planning on helping deliver the vaccine to areas such as yours and the constituents that you represent well maria the the bad news is that we are going into the eye of the storm this is a war and this is the last great bloody battle in order to get us over the hump uh this is the climax per se and right around the corner the first quarter of next year is when we're going to start to see these vaccines so congress has allocated billions of dollars for the research and development of these vaccines congress has also allocated billions of dollars for helping hospitals and clinics but like the previous physician said is that we work in a failed system this system has failed rural minority poor underserved communities and that's why we have health disparities not only in chronic illness but now in the death of this program 19. so we cannot just rely on a system that has already failed we have to think innovatively we have to know that the logistics and the access to clinics to personnel who are able to administer the vaccine needs to be beefed up so we need to continue to to fund programs that will be able to go door-to-door that will be able to vaccinate at the workplace for example farm workers uh and different food uh logistic chain production locations at schools at churches and other locations you know we we need to and and i've been focusing on this issue for several months now writing to the national academy of sciences to the nih to the administration about having a health equity public health approach to vaccine distribution and administration in order so that that people that are working with infected individuals get them first then other high risk individuals and let's not kid ourselves we have essential workers who are high risk essential workers and we have essential workers who are low risk essential workers we need to determine which are high risk and make sure they get them first those are the people that are in contact in grocery stores and other locations because of their work with other people so we need a health equity public health approach which is the right approach in order to help stop the spread of this virus

mr. Silvani recognized for five minutes thank you very thank you very much mr. chairman and good morning everyone in preparing for today's hearing I read the editorial series in the Star Tribune that miss Birkin bag and that highlighted the very poor condition of bia schools in Minnesota the title of this year's two struck me separate and unequal it is of course a reference to the milestone supreme court decision bound was in versus Board of Education which filed a separate by definition cannot be equal when it comes to how we educate our children so separating one group of children from another leads to inequality perpetuates inequality the situation is of the situation of neglected and inadequate be high school facilities which Gao recorded for us in Minnesota and elsewhere Montana North Dakota the Mexico Peru step we have school facilities in my district and other murder Either said another aus insular areas eighteen hundred and sixty-six that are also substandard the office of insular affairs at interior commissioned the Army Corps of Engineers a few years ago to rank these facilities by hazard both the students and since federal funding for school repairs in the areas have been allocated based on our core rankings of course we could use more money to get the job done more quickly I understand chairman Kline and other members represent a soda have requested more funding this year for BIA schools and I hope they're successful and I hope these funds are used in a systematic prioritized way I would like to point out another connection between vis schools and schools in my district and that is the way that title 18 grants in elementary and secondary education tax are allocated funding for bie students and students from water code the outlying areas the Northern Marianas american samoa guam and the US Virgin Islands is separated out from all other title a funding dia and yahoo outlying schools receive one percent of the total title 1 funds and then the Secretary of Education decides how to divide that money between be ing Island schools and that system as reported in bie students getting about twice as much as students in my district we're having a hearing today about how bad off BIA schools are and they are when it comes to school buildings but when it comes to federal funds to help run the schools well I have to speak up for students in my district or getting the short end of the stick the problem goes back to the headline is start treatment separate and unequal when we separate one group of students from another inequality arises and that is the case of title one funding instead of trading bie students the students in the outlying areas the same way we treat students in the state instead of basing funding from the number student surf and on where the Duke students come from low-income household the elementary and secondary education act as a set aside they call it for my students and set aside is just another way of sending saying separate and separate at the Supreme Court route is not equal the house has yet to act on the authorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and I'm well aware that there's nothing in the bill that chairman Kline is recorded that would end this separate but unequal idle one a funding for Native American children in the BIA schools and for the indigenous and that where student popular in schools in my district but up to the house axon you see a whisk you have an opportunity to change this unequal practice and I split on chairman Kline to rip his consider my proposal and today's hearing is just one more opportunity to remind us all that we do change title one of ESEA we will continue to have students four separate not equal and at this time it's terminal i would like to you time to my colleague from northern Minnesota mr. Nolan who is a strong champion for this issue in Congress was recognized

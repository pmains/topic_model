as my tenure in Congress comes to a close I've taken time to reflect on how I've changed how the country's changed and how the world has changed and throughout my time serving on and then chairing the Middle East North African Global counterterrorism subcommittee the one constant has been changed some of these changes have been challenging and heartbreaking the loss of life during points of high tension between Israel and Hamas sparked by Hamas rockets launched at civilians the humanitarian catastrophes during the conflicts in Syria Yemen Iraq and Libya some of which continued to this day the near escalation into open conflict between U.S and Iran and of course the covid-19 pandemic but in many moments too the change has signified hope and progress from the spirit of democracy and freedom during the Arab Spring to the signing of the Abraham Accords when the U.S sponsored Abraham Accords were signed in September 2020 we could not have realized the incredible and cascading impact that it would have on the region and on Israel's relations with its neighbors I was incredibly proud to have been on the White House lawn when the Abraham Accords were signed a momentous occasion and one of the highlights of my time in Congress the Abraham Accords made official what had been covert security ties between nominal enemies and set the stage for full-fledged Partnerships on issues related to security and business the environment Innovation tourism and so much more Egypt and Jordan formally recognized Israel in 1979 and 1994 respectively and there I want to take a moment to recognize what hasn't changed that's the importance of this piece and it should never be taken for granted nor should the immense leadership that it took on all sides to make peace possible Jordan and Egypt continue to be important partners of the United States and Israel and are vital to the security and prosperity of the entire region it remains abundantly clear that there is a commitment to continuing to advance these new relationships for the greater good of the region I know that the Biden Administration is committed to pursuing new normalization agreements and that many of us stand ready to help them succeed just as many of us Democrats and Republicans alike supported the agreements when they were signed by the Trump Administration normalization between Israel and Arab states is not a substitute for peace between Israel and the Palestinians however nor have we claimed it to be rather these new ties present an opportunity to work together with regional Partners to strengthen the Palestinian economy and continue to invest in people-to-people ties that help break down barriers and create Pathways to Lasting peace I've been a staunch supporter of Anita M Lowe Middle East partnership for peace act and been so proud to witness the Deep relationships that Palestinians and Israelis have built together and I'm eager to see what more can be done alongside our partners in the region it is clear that these strength and ties have ushered in a new era of opportunity for regional security cooperation especially as the U.S Israel and our Arab Partners in the Middle East share a common adversary in Iran Iran has made its intentions to destabilize the region and wipe Israel off the map clear since before I came to Congress when I arrived here we were negotiating the toughest sanctions ever imposed on Iran that was more than a decade ago and today Iran enriches uranium to 60 percent something the iaea director General says only countries intent on building nuclear weapons do to this day Iran Remains the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism and continues to support the terrorist proxy groups throughout the region these groups which Iran gives hundreds of millions of dollars to every year have been responsible for the bombings of the U.S Marine Barracks and Embassy in Lebanon the attacks on the Israeli Embassy and emea Jewish Center in Argentina the rocket barrages from Gaza that killed countless Israeli and Palestinian civilians and too many other terrorist attacks to list and they have amassed more than 150 000 Rockets Hezbollah has in South Lebanon all pointed at Israel what's more the Iranian regime abuses the human rights of its own citizens and continues to wrongfully detain Americans for political gain cmachenbacher namazi Murad tabaz and Ahmad sharghi are Americans currently being held in Iran and my constituent Bob Levinson was the longest held American hostage in history believed to have died in captivity in Iran a clear message must be sent to the regime that its practice of unjustly detaining Americans for political purposes is unacceptable and that the regime will be held accountable and punished for this illegal and barbaric Behavior Iran must immediately release all current wrongful detainees provide closure to the Levinson family on what happened to Bob and commit to finally ending this horrific practice once and for all Frozen Iranian assets should go directly to victims and their families to fund damages won in U.S courts from the Iranian regime and Iranian assets should replenish the already established U.S victims of state-sponsored terrorism fund so as the International Community is negotiated with Iran to re-enter the jcpoa in recent months Iran's malicious and dangerous Behavior has continued throughout the Middle East now just this week Iran's president raisi denied Israel's right to exist on American television denied the reality of the Holocaust right AC who is under U.S sanctions for in his involvement in the 1988 systematic Slaughter of thousands of political prisoners in Iran and other human rights abuses is currently in New York to attend the U.N General Assembly I support the Biden administration's commitment as reaffirmed in the Jerusalem declaration to never allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon and to use all elements of our national power to ensure that outcome and as we review any potential deal there are three fundamental questions that must be answered first if a nuclear agreement is reached now what is the path forward to a longer and stronger deal that addresses other aspects of Iran's malign behavior and never allows them to possess a bomb second on balance does greater insight into Iran's nuclear program and dramatically reduce enriched uranium in Iran outweigh the immediate impact a deal would have on Israel are partners and U.S troops as billions of dollars start flowing directly to the irgc to be used for greater and more lethal attacks and three as Iran sits with so much enriched uranium today what is the plan with our allies right now to stop Iran from having nuclear weapons with or without a deal support for any deal must at a minimum depend upon satisfactory answers to these three open questions these questions Arise at a time when Iran continues to pose an existential threat to the international nuclear non-proliferation movement as it inhibits the iaea's monitoring capabilities and continues to violate its Safeguard obligations while rapidly advancing its dangerous nuclear program this amplifies my concerns about how any nuclear deal can be verifiable and enforceable but even as Iran continues its violent destabilizing Behavior the United States continues standing with our Ally Israel and working alongside our partners across the Middle East to strengthen our Collective defenses and invest in progress I'm proud to have devoted my seven terms in Congress to strengthening the U.S Israel relationship in building diverse coalitions that support that relationship I'm grateful to former chair of the house Foreign Affairs committee Howard Berman who immediately upon my arrival in Congress allowed me to work with my colleagues to help impose biting sanctions on Iran together with my friend and colleague former HVAC chairwoman Ileana Ross Layton has secured the passage of the U.S Israel strategic Partnership Act in the U.S Israel security assistance authorization Act to dramatically expand cooperation between Israel and the United States these pieces of legislation passed with robust bipartisan support which reflects the long-standing commitment to the US's relationship and of ensuring Israel's security this is an exciting time in the Middle East the Abraham of course have Rewritten the geopolitical environment and a more Cooperative era has begun Israel's transitioned from European command descentcom's area of responsibility is an important Cornerstone of this new era and it's already provided new opportunities for multilateral cooperation aiming to strengthen Regional security especially against the shared threat of Iranian drones ballistic missiles and iranian-sponsored Terror last October an American b-1b strategic bomber flew over key Maritime choke points in the Middle East I mean ongoing tensions with Iran with jets from Bahrain Egypt Israel and Saudi Arabia alongside it Israel participated in the international Maritime exercise which is a massive american-led Naval exercise that included Abraham Accord countries as well as several countries Israel does not have formal ties with and then in the Eastern Mediterranean Israel's growing cooperation with Greece and Cyprus has contributed to Greater stability and opportunity seamless military interoperability between U.S Israel and our partners in the region is of utmost importance to strengthening and expanding security coordination and as Israel's relationship in the region grow so too do the opportunities for this crucial security coordination I'm eager to hear from our Witnesses today about the current security landscape across the Middle East what momentum exists to strengthen Collective defenses what a regional security architecture could look like and how these efforts will best counter our shared threats and I want to close by saying just a few more brief words of thanks

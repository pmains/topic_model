you for your warm opening it's a really a pleasure to be here and moderate this session of esteemed guests so esteemed easily politicians that you've seen how hesitant they weigh when we ask them to stand up to your applause we are not used to this kind of respect in our country as as you know usually at least I was brought up on that legend when you put for Jews in one room you get 10 different opinions bearing in mind the perception of J Street amongst the Israeli politicians especially from the center to the right I have a feeling that this afternoon will get four different opinions and even that is only because our friend lullaby juggler is a Muslim and we are about to begin and session will go as I'll ask each and every one of guests here to come up to the podium and give opening remarks and then we'll have a discussion back down on the stage a professor member of knesset avisha brotherman please begin your presentation on correcting Israel's past toward fair economy and just society we're anxious to hear thank you very much mr. ugh my distinguished colleagues friends lalasa miata at the learners not speaker mark Takai la la you may we say everything is a collected fine thank you my distinguished colleagues friends i am still to be here with all the young students here i'm experiencing again my life as president of ben gurion university power to you and to the older ones because again the energy level here is exciting and I think it's very meaningful thank you I am 64 I was born general 1590 48 so if you know in story I'm four months Palestinian I was born during British Palestine and the rest Israeli I am proud to be in Israeli my parents came in 36 and 38 I lost five of my uncle's three of my grandparents in the Holocaust and we really build a very impressive country and indeed we can sing the prices and yesterday we are we so creative with leading the world in startups we have such incredible culture in spite of all we created strong army and impressive economy however if we only look at the half full glass and forget the half-empty glass who are in a danger that this great accomplishment can go to a very dangerous path who threaten which will threaten our survival the fall I want to come back to the purpose of Zionism and I say that my good friend olive as a joke what is the question of Zionism penguin went to the Prophet board is concept from his I animals and after the Holocaust yes we wanted in Israel to create a place for the Jews that will be sustainable but that will be here at moffitt a light unto the nation and the question today is our six million Jews to be 789 our sustainable proposition among billion and half Muslims 300 hundred fifty million Arabs in a world of India and China and Russians are when America is some on the decline and we're 30 years for now seventy percent of the children in school in Israel are either Jewish Jewish without the dogs or other Muslims l today we have to make decision do want to fulfill the prophecy of penguin and the prophet or to disperse into can't own life States and I think we have an option and I start on one word on the partition of the holy land but I'll come to the key economics the quranic of justice that is missing in your land but is also missing in our land one thing i want to make things as one president said in Washington perfectly clear I'm not distinguish a neural like my friend general michna I was only lieutenant in the army but when in 1967 I finish my platoon commander calls in the desert and was sent after the wall to Gaza Bengali on our greatest leader a pill on the radio and said we have to return back the West Bank and Gaza all the generals at the time machete on in the rest laughs this old man they say was senile wave 100 heels of empire six seals was 73 then we on a nice Cole wanted to do so we made a mistake you cannot go back in time but it's clear today that we have to partition da Leland as soon as possible because otherwise and UL that will have one nation west of the Jordan River with majority Arab all we want allow rights for the Arab boss proposition unacceptable before you pass help us the security of Israel and survival the poisel position is partition of the Holy Land for the sake of the Jews but I want to go to economics the Prime Minister and the finance means they are saying that the economy is the best in the world yes our GNP per capita is impressing yes I inflation is low yes the ratio of debt to GMP satisfactory a nice and I'm an employment light is only five percent but this is not only economics I give an example when I play basketball when I was 20 years old people ask me brother man can you describe yourself i say 62 and 90 kilo a 78 kilograms today when I describe myself I say six to 90 kilograms however my blood pressure is hundred and thirty and eighty who spins I have problem with the cholesterol no color story is fine but prostate I have to check economy is not only that and Israel today is the most unequal society in the Western world with the exception of you we competing but when you look at the prices in miami in Washington in New York compared to Tel Aviv beer-sheva or Jerusalem our purchasing power is so much loyal so we are being given you secondary education 11 when I grew up with in first in the world in mathematics today in the best students we are the lowest in the Western Wall I don't speak about average student under in the south wall there are apps students statistically speaking I'll dolor among the lowest in the south wall and the Haredi don't study at all the basics of English mathematics and the rest third we talk about unemployment but our participation rate in the labor force is the lowest in the developing countries because the ultra-orthodox male don't work and we make constraint of some of the other population therefore I want to outline in bull of 30 second each what should be economic of justice that I oppose Netanyahu Netanyahu 11 from the Republican right the CEO of trickle-down theory which you cut taxes to the rich and the filter down to the rest of the society he never happen in any country in the world and I'm an economist and it doesn't happen in Israel point number one the ultra-orthodox penguin released for under the Shipibo hell firm going to the army and for work yes until bacon came to power and 75 the participation rate in the labor force of Orthodox Jewish male was seventy-five percent like secular Mel's like other me today it's forty percent this is heresy Maimonides the greater I'd say that if you don't work because you are not forced not to walk you have no place in Grenada in afterlife it's a mistake of all the coalition from regular until today the wilted rose f to go to work and immediately because otherwise not only the secular and the rest of us won't carry them they will be destroyed and the time has come and the time is now when it comes to the other population and I was minister of minorities Robin was the only leader that gave down a population Israel respect they gave them also resources and my good friend r ellipse was with him and I was in the University with him and the outcome was tremendous support of dollar population we did too much I tried as a minister to move in that direction but then unfortunately Netanyahu listen to Lieberman and here we have the other population that is a source not only for equality for human point of view or security point of view the economic loss of Israel is calling for the participation of the Arab label and the autos label and it have to be changed and to have to be changed now it's important enough to be done said education you know I served in Washington jugan Ronald Reagan that by the way what a dragon was the most Keynesian president he expended the budget moles and President Obama you should know that about that and one and Reagan say policy is personnel and our education system have to be changed we have to increase the salary of teachers give the best now teachers and headmasters let for every retirement thousands of teachers that are inept obsolete and become again what we are doing stay where the Miss Powell to education and not only to manipulators of banks or brokers of illusions and he'll I can't watch they'd main issue are we reform our system we have defunct political system we don't we in this country we have the best and the brightest and the most mall they don't arrive in politics my young son I have a young saeng in high school and he came to me last even say father why are you in politics politics by the way is the most despised position in Israel even last week it came he say you shaming me and the family go back and do something else and I told him the only reason I mean politics is because of you I you know I'm 64 I've many used to do but I can do many other things if we don't change the calls the way you'll use saying Jay's through the way you say in Israel for justice and changing policies you'll join you too and my sister and my wife sister are 30 years in LA therefore the time for action is now to change our political system that is the fact we have to create a system in which our primary system have to be reformed so that young people that are in the social protest that serious people whose experience not only muffins come at the time that is the most complicated maybe in human history and in Israel and serve the nation weed again to create a serving delete that is so much missing today at the top of his rail and here I come to my conclusion why I am optimistic I am optimistic for three reasons one my mother people talked yesterday about models or them to say something about that my mother Sarah was a kindergarten teacher and she taught me always be optimistic otherwise you get also all depression so it's better to be optimistic second I walk all over the world in a fall continent I never met in my life like in Israel young people and mature people that are mobile that are courageous that are smart and this group that doesn't filter to the top of big business to the top of politics to the top of the sports team because of the social protest there is a new consciousness and the fall I believe that the change is coming and I'll sum it with my greatest mentor in life the greatest Jewish teacher in my book rabbi ll my mentor in economics is rabbi ll that have three principles emaina nearly meanly bhushan he lets me manny villar chava Mathai if I'm not for myself wish for me private enterprises business responsibilities even that things look like they're hopeless but then if I am only for myself who am i if there is no family there's no country there's no people there is no planet it's only me and me and my money and my grid and my power then the world is finished and the rule of action if not now then when I believe the time has come to a major change because of the social protest because of the awareness in America in the world and awareness in Israel we are marching on a new white rod and yes it includes what is the group j street it includes you and includes the groups in israel that want to have transformational change god bless you and thank you very much thank you Thank you Thank You professor weatherman for these inspiring words and I now I'd like to

lehem valero well done thank you a lab to daba I'm proud to call upon the have a gallon member of method who will talk to us about the Israeli democracy and the threats it faces ladies and gentlemen dear friends I moved and excited to be speaking to you for the first time this great assembly is clear evidence that the reason need for a different voice a humanistic liberal and progressive voice in the Jewish community in the United States and in Israel friends two months ago I was elected to be the head of Merit the social democratic left-wing human rights and peace party in Israel thank you Mavericks was the first zionist party to raise the flag for two-state solution and advanced it in many years before it became a consensus but today I want to talk about the anti-democratic campaign that is presently taking place in Israel and that's why I believe that this conference is taking place at a critical time the struggle that is currently taking place over Israel character is no longer being waged between the right wing and the left wing or even between supporters of great Israel vs. supporters of land for peace today the struggle in Israel is being engaged between a camp that is committed to democracy and the anti-democracy camp that is willing to sacrifice Israel on the altar of a Masonic vision we are fighting against those who are prepared to sacrifice the ideas of universally entitlement human rights and of justice for the purpose of controlling the territories through the operation and occupation of millions of Palestinians they are willing to do so at the cost of the loathing at the State of Israel Democratic character the reality imposed by Israel in the occupied territories controlled by Israel for over 40 years has diffused through the green line into the State of Israel oppressing millions of people for such a long period of time is first of all abusive towards the Palestinians but it also gradually Awards the democratic system in Israel because of the occupation women 10 separate legal system for different ethnicities in the territories those who think a country can create these practices and not having them affect its regular legal system are delusional the occupation promotes flawed and unacceptable more standard that legitimize racism persecution and lawlessness friends let us then call it like it is it is the occupation that under mais Israeli democracy it is the occupation that led Israel to diplomatic isolation it is the occupation that hampers Israel economic growth and development the masses of Israelis who took to the streets during last summer social protest wanted to restore the lost welfare state that Israel took pride in the reality is that Israel does support a welfare state but it is a Saddler welfare state and our tax money supporting the settlements and the occupation regime more and more I want to share with you my personal experience as a member of the current Knesset and to talk about how the effect of the occupation are being manifested in the Knesset the Israeli Parliament those who find it legitimate to persecute Palestinians and to deny them of their basic rights now find it acceptable to do the same to Israel's Arab citizens they now see no problem in persecuting civil rights organizations and anyone in the Israeli left simply because they oppose the government I am sure that you have read about the law prohibiting the boycott of settlement products about the makati law likes denying funding from human rights and Geo's about they're piling attempts to undermine the authority of the Supreme Court and about the attempts to limit freedom of the press all these were laws that when acting during the current Knesset in the time in the timeframe of pleasure in the last two years about two years today in Israel it is a government that has no problem passing laws whose purpose is the silencing of the critical voices and protests it is the government obsessed with Dell delegitimizing the political opposition and this government which has trampled on the basic democratic rules of the game is now moving from perspect for perspect for persecuting the opposition to undermining the democratic process as a whole these attempts to change the Democratic rules of the game meant to serve the party in power steam from unwillingness to come to terms with the shattered vision of Greater Israel so what now I believe that democracy in equal rights cannot coexist with the occupation of another people I believe that we need to talk about ourselves our struggle for democracy and the character of the State of Israel I believe that in Israel we still have a strong drum democratic base will have a foundation of protected basic rights and an active legal system and civil society and I believe that the recent anti-democratic epidemic will stimulate the immune system of the State of Israel and that the Democratic antibodies will now fight back and restore justice and basic freedoms I see merit spearheading this struggle we're fighting to block those government initiatives and we are oublie obligated to protecting democracy into restoring immoral and just Israel friends in this struggle j street and its supporters are our key partners you are the two friends of israel you must allow the fair right that dangerous ultra conservative elements in the United States and in Israel to rubber-stamp a process that is a strategic than the danger to Israel's very existence Israel's far right the current Israeli government all those for whom the Land of Israel is more important than the State of Israel they won't blind loyalty without criticism but a true friend must tell the truth continuing the Occupational and dangers our existence and the stores our moral character a true friend must say Israel must remain democratic friends we need you on our side in this struggle we need your voice our voice to be heard out loud history is being made right now now is the time to act thank you very much thank you as ahava and as a real military man i'ma meets knives on the podium now and he'll talk about Israel security challenges and the urgent need for peace please remember thank you very much and a good afternoon first of all I would like to share with your news from Jerusalem if you didn't hear are the supreme court as a court of justice rejected the compromise of evacuation of the McCrone settlement and as Prime Minister begin said many years ago there are judges in jerusalem and i think that the Supreme Court is the gardening wall of Israel democracy and we should praise for them to be successful as they were in the past so this is very good news I am very privileged to be here with you today in this annual convention I wish Jay Street organization was invented many many years ago we were waiting for such an organization to take role and to show that there is not only one approach to be pro-israeli and we are all Israelis responsible for our country and we wish that such an organization J Street will increase these members and I must admit that it is very touching to see so many youth and young adults I don't believe I don't believe that there is any other Jewish organization that succeed to generate to attract so many use to the Israeli calls and it this is wonderful and I'm saluting to you J Street staff and members and organization for succeeding so much now it is unbelievable that in the period that we live nobody is talking about peace there is no peace camp in Israel there is no party in Israel that is running from the Prime Minister e as an alternative to Netanyahu that use the flag of arrangements agreements with our neighbors with the Palestinians it is unbelievable that a government do not and doing nothing with trying to promote and to go back to the negotiation table in order to reach an agreement between us and the Palestinians I want to say maybe this is the bottom line of my my speech is that the continuous the continuation of occupation is extremely risky for the State of Israel and I'm speaking from a security point of view I would like to take you to understand that the vital interest of the state of israel is to finish the occupation from a military point of view from the fence point of view it is an interest not just because we are more right than the Palestinians it is very important not just because we were robbed for so many years and what we have done to the Palestinians this is not the question this is not the question also whether we are returning territories since 67 under our occupation it is an interest of the state of israel and I'm speaking only from this point of view and the real question for the future is how can we guarantee the ability the capability the future capability of the State of Israel to protect its citizens to keep its independence and to be a Jewish a democratic state there are a lot of threats around us terror by a nanny state organizations terror by states around Israel terrible state very far away from Israel of course they a threat of launching missiles rockets from Gaza Strip from a thousand Lebanon and of course from Iran but also a threat of delegitimizing the State of Israel in the free world pressure boycotting the State of Israel and I don't have to tell you that it is an issue today here in the United States in Maine on universities and colleges and all over the world I'm suspecting that we will face in the future conflict with the United States coordination maybe reassessment as we experienced in the past and this is a threat to the possibility to defend the State of Israel and of course the absence of national consensus inside Israel about what we should do most Israelis as it was said already yesterday do believe that we have to separate ourselves from the Palestinians but most of those Israelis don't believe that there is a politician leadership that is ready and able to do it in the future so what is the response to this a threat well first of all I want to touch the issue of defensible borders I want to remind everybody that in 67 we gained the most the greatest victory from what then haven't called a schvitz borders and it was the biggest and the greatest victory ever the six-day war only six years later from the borders of 73 which were the most defendable borders that you can imagine we were standing against attack from two or three fronts and the survivors of Israel wasn't steak so what I want to say is that today there is no defensible borders in the Middle East the dimensions the density in this area we can't look for and we cannot see it in the future as a defensible borders defensible borders means recognized borders recognized border by our neighbors and by the international a world arrangement security arrangements very important in the future and security arrangements means that Israel will not be under attack from the 67 borders now when I'm speaking about the future negotiations with the Palestinians it seems to me that it will not be able to achieve what the Geneva agreement was about a overall agreement is not in touch but what we can have is a discussion negotiation on two elements borders which is so important and as I said security arrangements so to sum up what I said for a long term Israel will not be able to protect it itself without agreements with our neighbors two-state solution is the only available solution there is no other solutions those who are talking about one state for two nations are talking about Arab another Arab country as well as a democracy and as a Jewish state will not survive under the idea of one state for two nations so the only solution available is partition and it is two states for two people as I said before no natural borders in the Middle East and it is a vital vital interest for Israel that to reach such such an agreement unfortunately I am not so optimistic that the current government is as the wheel as a capability and the ability to go ahead I hope that together we can look into the future and do all what is needed in order to protect the State of Israel in order to defend our democracy and in order to let our children and when children live in a secure Israel thank you very much thank you thank you a mom ladies and gentlemen please accept my profound and sincere apologies I misled you I promised you four different opinions hahaha and we heard more of the same opinion with various nuances and my questions my question my first question to you is how do we widen the perception we are convincing the convince the people in this whole agree with you you agree with each other but the vast majority of the people in Israel voted the other way and if election to be held soon they'll vote the very same way again professor Barbra man would you like to start how do we widen this perception thank you near first I think there are two elements to that a the left and the center left in Israel is partly to blame for that as well because many of the people including a development town some of the poor people essentially a what one minute sure we hear you on the phone who show me Mottram chatham in the blame the no matter where the loch nesa it's not the knesset the Lord Nestor oh well the shuttle please essentially I are starting to understand that they're economically deprived and every problem but many of them are not very liberal are more conservative in the views therefore somehow the approach to get them is to be border kinder to them in a sense to listen to their some conservative point of view the second thing is that I contrary to nail I believe the game is not over until it's over like Yogi Berra said and we'll have election for Kadima on Tuesday and Netanyahu now feels is in the heights and part of the issue is the pool leadership of the Palestinians as well it takes 24 tango so the phone while most Israelis really wants to go for the partition on the other side there is a problem what I can say let's broaden the conversation let's continue to walk on that let's include segments that were not in the center left because I believe on the economic font most people are deprived by Netanyahu policies and still vote for him if we include an increase the conversation I think we have a chance it really takes 24 tango you said but it seems that we are dancing on the floor and there are other people who seem to clean it for us all the time in a dancing on our own and no one sees the other people zahava a we were cheering a Stav Shaffir yesterday he who had a wonderful speech but still the Israeli people did not go out to the streets because they are transparent people next to them as almost all said and we are on top of them and they are succumbed to us the people of Israel went out to the street in vast quantities vast numbers we had even the Equality of the number here in in the United States because of the price of a cottage can isn't it's pointless are we can we afford this now a-rod it's really very frustrating I must be the mate most of the Israelis went to the street in order to protest against the price of the cottage well you know it's more than that of course but I think what's what happened in the last few years that people in Israel they really don't pay attention anymore of what's going on behind the wall you know behind the world they didn't see Palestinians for so many years you know they they get to the feeling and they were convinced for many years that there is no chance there is no partner there is no chance to do a peace agreement with the Palestinians and let's talk about economy let's talk about a social ride a live defender question the big question with the Palestinian I think it's a mistake and I think also it was a mistake not talking about the issue with the Palestinians during the last time but you did not not very easy kinda politicians did not okay the politicians were hesitant so let me raise the issue so let me talk on behalf of merits my party I think that there is a mistake not to put the connection between the social issues and they problem the biggest problem of Israel there is a connection and we and we pay the price you know because a as I talk to know there is a welfare state it's in the settlement you should go to the settlements and to see their houses we are paying millions of millions of millions of dollars in order to how do you say little psychotic a bush in order to maintain the settlement in order to maintain the occupation so there is a price and the price is they the cost of day of the Saudi ha the rent of day of the apartments the price of the quarters so we are paying the price and those leaders that are trying to divide to make a distinction between the social situation and a diplomatic situation and the situation the Palestinians they are cheating the Israeli do you get the translation so my question to you is what should the Palestinians do in order to change the equation okay we understand now that we have to explain to the Israeli people but what should the Palestinians do in order to become apparent and not transparent should there refer to violence again avant OU t lo getting the bevery I'll ask it in in in in in Hebrew game ashal a Shiite ah ma

Rob the holla holla okay Sheila Shalom Bakary Varma falasteen the ease majority for peace within the Palestinian people I'm um it's now do you agree to that I fully agree to what was said with my colleagues I said already that I'm not so optimistic because I don't see any alternative evolving alternative political alternative in Israel to Benjamin Netanyahu what we should do is first of all as other said let people understand the connection between between security and secure the country and the social issues we never meant much ways two flags one of them is security arrangements policy with our neighbors and the other one is social security if I would have been rude i would have said that maybe this is why you were not elected to lead the Labour Party now because this is not electability that's right therefore i'm not so optimistic as i said in the beginning but i think that in israel today there are many movements of youth and young adults that are taking responsibility and you know there are some movements that encourage their followers to sign to a party to be party members because most Israelis are not members in parties to be member of a party to influence parties from the inside it's very important secondly I think that US policy probably after the current election the coming elections is very important and i hope that president obama after being elected in november it has to be will put his hands on the issue unfortunately i'm not sure that we can do it alone we have to have our allies they also are supporting the israeli issue to be and to be a force in this arena in order to push sides to negotiate and to reach and really some sense of discontent next to me a wish I believe I'll tell you i think if we wait for American president to force a solution we have to walk wait for the Messiah because I don't see even if President Obama is elected again it's we have to do that and my hope about change is the following it's basically there if you define in the polls today the center left and the right we are lacking the difference may be between 18 and 20 seats so essentially ten seats from one side to the other will change how can we win the election the center left by higher participation rate as general mention our intent if the people that came to the street you know a seat in the parliament is about 33 near 35,000 people so basically if many of the people the young people that don't vote they'll give seven seats to Kadima to avada two methods etc and then rallied the Arabs participation rate is very low fifty percent if they increase it to 60-some percent and vote for our party for labor for marriage Kadima you can have 12 seats and that will change the election and italia will be partly easier easier sell for my media perspective i can definitely easier said than that i say oh oh that that's the full part of the glass the empty part of the glass is wishful thinking how do you know and I must add me that I don't think that we have the luxury to be depressed so I'm optimistic although it's very difficult I'm optimistic and the thing that you're driving optimistically towards the wall God you want going to change my my beliefs be and you know I think that in the end people will understand that you can't talk only about social justice justice without talking about freedom and it's connected and if you're still will say it and will say I don't know it's very hard believe me it's very hard not to be in the consensus and to keep talking about occupation about violations of human rights about the need to make peace it's very hard you know because because people prefer you know let them eat them easiest thing but I I agree with mr. bronfman with a professor bra Vermont let me let me just help you analyze the optimism just remind me let's say in 92 elections how many seats did merits her okay we got in 92 12 seats and how many okay now we got you know now before I was a lack now we got we have only three seats in the Knesset only three and why you were there there were four but but let me but let me say like this am I you should help in English they looked at go on how do you say it's not fair it's not fair it can be changed and I believe that those supporters of the Peace Camp in Israel the supporters of democracy and human rights will change the atmosphere in Israel and that's why I'm ah I'm optimistic we are going to be there it's not a fairy foul to say it's not it's not faith nothing it's a choice of the people I'm um thank you I'm um you were you were suggesting that President Obama might help us or impose something on us on that point i want to put into the conversation an idea that was raised by a member of the club a Peter Reinhart on an op-ed in the New York Times few days ago and he's suggesting that American jury should boycott settlements for all what it means maybe maybe maybe this is part of the way that people who think that things should be made the other way around maybe this is part of the deal of how to impose a solution maybe if the people of Israel do not understand the good words maybe they'll understand it through the pockets what is where you think about it suggestion I'm not sure that it is a helpful I don't think that jewish communities in united states will share such an opinion there are you know from the right and the left j street a park and so thanks God as a pack steel and they and unfortunately I don't think that it is helpful but the window of opportunities in the Middle East have a timetable and time is against us against the moderate Arab countries in the region and therefore just a minute let me let me finish and therefore I am worried I'm scared that we are risking the State of Israel if we are not taking a face in our hands ok we so so I get it will we will get there a just now but at this point I want to add a rally Majella into the conversation again and ask him about this idea of boycotting settlements a rally by shelli shelli he bringin haha da la creme it mahalo wat u del zotto bridge yah hi mohit nakuru yo estaba con UD baraha condom asylum a mother tranza today Annie Baker o- remote I'm against all boycotts in principle gamma Marta's Oh Cheryl aha no se naked Israel bicol recession academia avatar boot I've said it even in the context of boycotting Israel in the academics Allah like the hilarity mashallah Shalom but settlements are the obstacle for peace well our loyal column latet lehem siku lam shiflett Patera vilakazi cotton and we cannot give them a chance to keep on thriving and strengthen them rellahan sahara me hardly me know this is why it's a very special boycott al de varville amitabh Lovato the home actually Shalom on something that we do not accept and which is an obstacle for peace so I'm you sound like a real Jewish politician visit yes or no actually like a rabbi Nina schmale borrowed my odd and his mom I'm very clear he fell I mean sniper or me odd Ali naked ha remote Allah hi raha Israeli I'm again Medina I'm against any boycott on Israel on easily society in the Israeli state z harem Nico Dottie naked amateur Lisa Lopes is ethnically oh this is a pinpointed boycott against the obstacle for peace so my interpretation is yes baba please i want to draw distinction between boca de State of Israel that of course I oppose it I'm against it and boycott the settlement policy and I I want to tell you something of the personal level that more than two decades more than 20 years i balk at settlement products when I when I go to the super I don't buy settlement problem on the political level I want to share with you that i put a bill that remarks they set the products that were that were that they are from the settlements and I think that we don't have to be so afraid you see and and also i can understand i'm talking us and israeli not as an American so I'm talking from my responsibility to the Israeli society I think that people should know that there is a price for ongoing day the settlement you know for own blog the occupation people in the settlement they should know that there is a price now they feel great they have their houses they have their money they have the budget and we are paying the price and it's important to put on the table the discourse it's not the island people says it's not efficient it's not going to change the situation it might be but putting the the question of boycotting the settlement on the table it's important in order to talk about the price that we are as an Israeli society paying for having the settlement for more than 14 years be sure the path twell is paved with great intentions I for one think that this is both ineffective way and general meeting articulate and second since many of the people here are very leavened understand all the distinctions what happened in Israel for most people in the world they don't understand that so the minute you start to boycott settlement we boycott of Israel I saw that when i was watching serbia i have no idea what takes place the fall for me the policy is very clear we should get now and have pressure and do everything we can to go to the 67 border whose modification put the pressure fight for that but i think this life of approach is ineffective and eventually also will be harming for the State of Israel therefore with all the good intention i oppose it talking about the israeli-palestinian conflict we were talking about Israeli politics and this weekend before we came before we came in the talk on easily media was that Netanyahu is going to have early elections today he actually announced that he is not going to call early elections and elections is going to be on time which is November 2 2013 now I think yeah the election date is November 2013 but since you know the budget won't pass so the election will be a lot closer so you are still on sun on friday that was the event of the pretext for for food for the discussion it might be earlier but not nonetheless a what what will be the issues in the next elections when it comes i would it be the israeli-palestinian conflict would that be on the table I'll tell you my point of view in two words to migrate the soul but it's to today to the United States and allocations are used to say about Israel that Israel have no foreign policy only domestic policy today sometimes it may look also for America so I'm afraid that will be too much discussion all the time about the Iranian crisis etc said there about conflict but I think that what happened in the social protest it's not about just cottage cheese it's not about that young social worker doctors teachers are realizing that in 20 years they won't be able to afford apartment or sustainable income the undercurrent that Israel if it continues and only advocate expanding of the defense budget over time will break down this very society this issue will come in the election and I'm sure other people will try to speak only on Iran sort of we'll do everything in our outlaws in addition to the Iranian issue and i have my point of view on Iran if you ask later that we have to blink boss the social issue and the partition of the Holy Land issue was have to come to that Jade who I layer a duck in the room a duck is the computa near duck or a lame duck what duck is it a mammoth now why is Netanyahu so and has this mosaic feeling towards Iran or against Iran Radha an attorney always wrote the first right wing leader that is using threats as a way to control and to gain the attraction of the people a Sean did it in 2003 elections when he be with the Iraqis issues and frightened the people of Israel from non conventional missiles that will come from Iraq to Israel so Netanyahu first of all understand that he have to threaten and to make the people afraid and when the people are afraid they don't look around on the main issues and that's what I'm doing secondly by the way Netanyahu is the only leader from the right wing till now only Prime Minister that elected prime minister and didn't change his mind all the others once they were sitting on the chair of the prime ministry understood what is the vital interest of the state of israel Netanyahu is the only one maybe we should send into an optometrist we should send him away and no matter where it's very difficult Arad to predict 18 months from now let's wait to see what will be the outcome of kadema elections then the elections United States then we didn't speak about Iran yet and attack a spare another penis poking like dark I mean yeah like that's very good bye so it's good news not to speak only about Iran the nuclear option but 18 months is a lot of time and still time to try our best in order to bring to the table the issue of the palestinian-israeli conflict we are sitting here with a cutter of very moderate Israeli politicians and I want to ask you is Iran a real threat on Israel is containing Iran an option and if not what a visual Berman we'll start with you I'll be very clear clearly run is a sweat and the Prime Minister put it forward of course we have the military option but I think there are many military strategies that oppose now for military action towards Iran I want to add the economic strategic one you see the price of oil today is about hundred and five it was under than 307 the world is in the greatest crisis that can turn into the Great Depression unemployment in spain in unemployment increases beyond twenty percent and among the use its fifty percent Europe is and average which either the you old split or not if the price of oil will jump above 200 I single be tremendous scales unemployment from even a threat of great depression including a great damage to the economy of the world now the question is that sanction walk or not it depends in Cuba sanction did not sanctions didn't work economic sanctions because of the fact that many country evaded them in South Africa they did walk I salute President Obama the European Union for the effective sanctions with the Swift that right now most of the monetary transaction of Iran are not around you have to go back to barter all to the Mafia way to take certain suitcases cash therefore I oppose military action now in Iran also from this reason because the outcome of military action now can put the world in such economic health and the finger will be pointed toward Israel and maybe the Jews so let's President Obama let's new opinion do a job and who should be for a while quiet first of all I must admit I'm very concerned of the idea that Iran is going to have nuclear weapons and i heard mr. Netanyahu says that Iran is an Israeli problem and I want to say that Iran is nothing is not only an Israeli problem it's the problem of the global world first of all and then you know I had the mr. Netanyahu using such a cynical a language talking about the Holocaust in order to frighten the Israeli public of the idea that Iran might have nuclear weapons and and I know that the use of such cynical language meant to draw attention from our real problem the only problem of us is the Palestinian problems that's why using the issue of Iran and and don't want to diminish the issue of Iran and to to to say that it's not a problem it's really a problem but our problem is to try to reach agreement with the Palestinians and mr. Netanyahu doesn't want to deal with the issue of the Palestinians ali madad la is the Iran issue a pretext for Netanyahu not to deal with the Palestinians hyeme banette Binyamin Netanyahu schtum Eschbach lava irani caity lotz que de la fere heated odna still suha israeli-palestinian Zen whole mode it's very true they came at kollam Allah hit this rail melted the whole Israeli system almost all the Israeli system claimed so zebra ha me ha no se ha meaty they said 30 men ojala SE falasteen this is escaping from the real issue which is the Palestinian issue I was obras maneet gelato ello que lleva no se wanna say a velocity but it's only a temporary run away because it is not the remedy because the real issue is the Palestinian issue a dirty ogre mhmm nesic lea el sheet metal MJ movie lotta no se ba alam been commissioned de suerte helic mauve allaha below mid-willamette netanel actually harmed Israel when he creates the image that Israel is leading the world and not being part of a world operation Anna raagam you deem tame it I'm know that you Ronnie who sick sick cool V sakana llama frauds Lisa odia litera Shalom the Iranian issue the Iranian nuclear issue is a threat to the whole region to South Saudi Arabia into the axis of peace Iran Lawson ha ha kamata emberia hop RCT Attica Alamy frats valued akula V gamma you mean moving I'm afraid sir percival only my frats ROV Iran is still hoping to rebuild the old persian empire all along the Persian Gulf tengo de let me tell you a personal story telling you to a couple of years ago my daughter Sheila's is his name for her name funny enough she calls me and she asks me daddy how many nuclear bombs do we have she was 12 then you know I swallowed my what ever had in my mouth and I asked her what why are you asking that so she said the boys here I'm sitting with the boys and they say we have two hundred nuclear bombs is that possible so you know I'm an experienced journalist I tell her according to foreign sources indeed we have two hundred nuclear heads and then she says so if we have two hundred nuclear head why are we so worried that the Iranians might have one what would you've answered her grey listen I think she is great your daughter really Cizikas she got a wonderful education you should go get it yeah she was was after perfectly what I usually say in in that respect I I used to quote pervez musharraf who is not the Righteous among the Nations but still he was a president of Pakistan and a very close ally for the United States for many years and it was in Davos in 2005 I think he was asked in a news conference day what about the war between you and India and he said and I'm quoting from memory but he said since we have the bomb and they have the bomb it seems that war has become a bit out of fashion what about deterrence wasn't the world much well structured when we had the Iron Curtain during the Cold War I'm not talking about the well-being of the human beings but the structure of the world order wasn't it much better we shall tell you a story since you talked about your daughter well you were talking about your mother's I have my son and my son and my son you see I joined the walbank in 76 under present McNamara and when I left the bank I was the only one when I was president I bought you already retired present McNamara to Israel he was his only visit we spent time in Beersheva and he articulated very clearly in Beersheva because he was the architect of the idea that the people that right now at the time hold nuclear power will create a nuclear Club that will be intact and won't allow other members to come in well McNamara is not animals as it was a very wise man and I'll tell you I'm not talking about Iran but if I have to focus mr. Arad then I know that economic forecasting makes astrology looks good essentially in 10 years you'll see many countries in the world that may have nuclear arms it can be Brazil it can be others the issue today for the world is not we have nuclear powers because it's biological and chemical warfare you can destroy the world the issue is can we raise our consciousness to understand that we are one on the planet which we continue is the same philosophy that we are different than the others the consuming monkey and the killer marquee will kill itself and that's what my also connect tomorrow so time is running very fast when you're having fun so I had fun i hope you did too so thank you all for listening to us thank you for being with us and we call off this session thank you and good luck with your very well done job thank you you

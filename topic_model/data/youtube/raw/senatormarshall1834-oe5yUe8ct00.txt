just yesterday we learned that in the month of may our border patrol encountered an unprecedented 239 000 migrants at the southern border the highest monthly total in dh history and now thanks to our inhumane open border policies every state is now a border state in my home state of kansas a person dies most every day from fentanyl poisoning nationwide over 200 people are dying daily from fentanyl the numbers on the rise and this is now an epidemic just last week in kansas city authorities seized 15 000 counterfeit pills laced with fentanyl chair murray in your state of washington five people are dying per day from drug overdose and ranking member burr in your state nine north carolinians are dying every day from drug overdose i don't have to remind people on this committee our panel the fentanyl precursors are made in china then the chinese worked with the cartels to process it into a lethal fentanyl often lacing other opioids marijuana meth adderall xanax amongst others and all across the nation a counterfeit oxycodone pills like the ones behind me are now actually laced with fentanyl and unfortunately just one pill can kill in the case of one young student in shawnee kansas it only took half of a fake percocet pill to take his life dr wolinski my colleague senator hagerty from the great state of tennessee has introduced a bill that would expand title 42 expedited removal authority to combat the drug overdose epidemic resulting from drug smuggling across our southern border dr walinsky i'd like to ask you yes or no would you commit to expanding the title 42 authority to turn back migrants to combat this prolific drug smuggling across the u.s mexico border in an effort to stop the flow and the epidemic of fentanyl that is killing americans every day thank you senator i'd like to just back up and say that cdc is a public health agency not an immigration agency and the question of title 42 is a public health policy the question of title 42 that was posed to me is is there a public health emergency that should bar people from coming into the united states we now have as of april 1st when i when i comment on this we now have the tools the tests the vaccines um and the therapeutics that are available our hospitals are not full everyone and most people in this room are not wearing a mask there is no longer public health emergency so dr i appreciate that but i hope you realize that that fentanyl poisoning is killing more individuals ages 18 to 45 than cova 19 so for the same reasons that you instituted title 42 for covid why wouldn't you consider instituting it for for fentanyl poisoning as well as would you commit yes or no to tracking this similarly the way you did for coven to the larger immigration question i turned things back to you and congress to address the larger immigration question as a public health emergency for covet which is what title 42 was put up to do there was no longer a need do you deny that there's an epidemic of fentanyl poisoning across this country i do not thank you i

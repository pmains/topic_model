earlier today senator Tim Cain met with teachers and staff at Harrisonburg high school his visit coincided the same week ken cuccinelli released his education policy calling for more schooling options for children at failing public schools when asked about this Tim Cain says the focus should instead be on the classroom synthesis Cain was met with a big applause the Harrisonburg high school this morning right now he says the key to improving education is focusing on each individual student he says more focus needs to be put on early childhood development to find out about any learning disabilities also he says there should be more awareness about options besides College since he says nowadays college just isn't for everyone kane says both of these things can be accomplished in public schools my preferred option is within the public school framework to to create more choice by giving students more paths to success as we look at policies like the standards of learning or No Child Left Behind make sure that we're focusing on individual kids straights giving students choices so that they can pick their own career path within the public school framework I think makes no sense on top of the event in harrisonburg Cain stopped at the Rockingham County Fair as well as Fishburne military school in waynesboro to talk with people in that area

TIME LINE BACKED UP BY U.S.  INTELLIGENCE AS WELL. JOINED BY ADAM SCHIFF, CHAIRMAN  OF HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. CHAIRMAN SCHIFF, I'M WONDERING  WHAT THE LATEST INFORMATION YOU  HAVE TONIGHT ABOUT RUSSIAN TROOP MOVEMENT IN AND AROUND UKRAINE  AND THE PLAN FOR U.S., NATO, AND THEIR ALLIES IN THE REGION. >> THE RUSSIANS HAVE AMASSED, I  THINK, ALL THE FORCES THEY NEED  TO FULLY INVADE THE COUNTRY. THEY'VE ALREADY BEGUN THAT  INVASION. BUT THEY COULD VERY QUICKLY MOVE TO THE UKRAINIAN CAPITAL OF  KYIV. YOU KNOW, THE UKRAINIANS WILL  PUT UP RESISTANCE, BUT THEY'LL  BE OVERWHELMED BY THE STRENGTH  OF RUSSIAN FORCES. WHERE I THINK IT'S GOING TO GET  REALLY UGLY FOR THE RUSSIANS IS  OVERTIME, AS THE UKRAINIANS ARE  LIKELY TO MOUNT AN INSURGENCY  CAMPAIGN AGAINST THEM. BUT THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED. THEY HAVE STARTED WHAT WE WOULD  EXPECT IN TERMS OF RUSSIAN TRADE CRAFT MOVING INTO UKRAINE TO  PREPARE THE BATTLEFIELD, CYBER  ATTACKS, FLOODING SOCIAL MEDIA  WITH RUSSIAN PROPAGANDA TO  UNDERMINE CONFIDENCE IN UKRAINE. SO, THEY'RE DOING WHAT WE WOULD  EXPECT FOR A MORE FULSOME  INVASION. >> WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE  FUTURE OF EUROPE, FOR -- I MEAN, FOR THE INTERNATIONAL ORDER? >> WELL, IT DEPENDS ON WHETHER  WE AND OUR NATO ALLIES STICK  TOGETHER AND EMBARK ON AN EVEN  MORE SEVERE SET OF SANCTIONS,  WHICH I FULLY BELIEVE AND EXPECT THAT WE WILL AT THE MUNICH  CONFERENCE I ATTENDED WITH THE  SPEAKER. THERE WAS A HIGH DEGREE OF  SOLIDARITY AMONG OUR NATO  ALLIES. IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE REALLY  PUNITIVE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CONTINUE  TO PROVIDE UKRAINE WITH WEAPONS. THE REST OF THE WORLD IS  WATCHING, CHINA WITH AN EYE  TOWARD WHETHER IT CAN GET AWAY  WITH INVADING TAIWAN. THE CONSEQUENCES GLOBALLY, THE  CONSEQUENCES TO THE  INTERNATIONAL RULE SPACE ORDER  COULD NOT BE HIGHER, WHICH IS  WHY WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE IF  PUTIN GOES FORWARD WITH THIS  INVASION MORE FULLY THAN HE HAS  ALREADY THAT THE COSTS TO PUTIN  AND RUSSIA ARE JUST CRIPPLING. >> I TALKED TO FORMER SECRETARY  WILLIAM COHEN, AND HE SAID HE  THOUGHT ALL THE SANCTIONS THAT  WE HAVE AT OUR DISPOSAL, THE  U.S. AND EUROPE HAS AT THEIR  DISPOSAL, SHOULD BE PUT INTO  PLACE NOW. DO YOU AGREE? >> LOOK, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT  ALL PUT INTO PLACE ASAP, BOTH  BECAUSE I THINK IT'S NECESSARY. BUT I DON'T SEE THE POINT IN  WAITING IF WE COULD GET OUR  ALLIES TO COME ALONG WITH US. I THINK THAT ESSENTIALLY PUTIN  HAS MADE UP HIS MIND AND WE  OUGHT TO AGAIN THOSE AS SOON AS  POSSIBLE. I WOULD LEAN IN, I THINK  SECRETARY COHEN WOULD, AND MOVE  TO IMPROVE AND IMPLEMENT THE  MOST SEVERE SANCTIONS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. >> WHAT WOULD THE MOST SEVERE  SANCTION BE? >> WELL, YOU KNOW, IT WOULD BE A PERMANENT END TO THE NORD STREAM PIPELINE. AND I THINK WE'RE ALREADY WELL  ON THE WAY TO THAT. SLD BE SANCTIONING NOT JUST THE  FIFTH LARGEST BANK AND OTHER  BANKS, BUT THE LARGEST BANKS IN  RUSSIA. IT WOULD BE SEPARATING THEM FROM THE SWIFT SYSTEM OF FINANCIAL  TRANSACTIONS, REALLY CRIPPLING  THEIR ABILITY TO DO BUSINESS  WITH THE WEST. IT WOULD BE EXPANDING FROM THE  LIST OF OLIGARCHS WE GO AFTER. IT WOULD BE DEPRIVING THEM OF  TECHNOLOGY THEY NEED TO USE IN  THEIR DEFENSE SYSTEMS. AND I THINK IMPORTANTLY, GOING  BEYOND THE NORD STREAM PIPELINE  TO DIVERSIFYING ENERGY SOURCES  FOR EUROPE SO THAT WE CAN  ESSENTIALLY SHUT OFF RUSSIAN  SALES OF GAS, THEIR REAL SOURCE  OF WEALTH

thank you Matt president today today we lost an American hero though the last of a line of heroes that I will explain a moment Ohio native Lieutenant Colonel Richard Cole he was the last of the fabled Doolittle Raiders in spring of 1942 the nation was reeling from Pearl Harbor 80 Americans embarked on a mission many thought impossible they knew the dangers they knew many of them would not come home the Raiders showed America in the world that the US and Allied forces could win the war it was considered a turning point in the news coverage and in people's minds like my dad the Doolittle Raiders came from a generation that spoke proudly of service to their country they rarely drew attention or talked much about their own courage they sought no recognition but oh how they earned it it was an honor to help award the Congressional Gold Medal to the Doolittle Raiders in Washington four years ago a long time coming and so deserved if we leave at that time there were five Doolittle Raiders left and today after the death of mr. Cole there are none I'm so glad that Nicole was able to live to receive that metal as a handful of others were these men are no longer with it's it's all the more important we continue to tell their story my heart goes out to the families and friends of Lieutenant Colonel Cole in all the Raiders and I want to thank the do Little Tokyo Raiders Association for keeping that memory alive

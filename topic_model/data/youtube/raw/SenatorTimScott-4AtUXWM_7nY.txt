foreign [Music] ERS are not trending in a good direction for the country and the FED is scheduled to meet again this week and what could be another roller coaster but without the up part of the ride here to break down the numbers and how this impacts All of Us South Carolina Senator Tim Scott let me first of all Senator say happy birthday to you and my mom y'all share a birthday tomorrow I went to the Dollar General to try to get you both a really nice gift this afternoon uh inflation has made everything way more than a dollar so I left uh whatever happened to inflation kind of cooling down a little bit uh number one since Biden's taken office inflation has been up 17 straight months in a row that is really bad news for people living paycheck to paycheck the truth is that Biden's inflation equals a pay cut for Americans all across the country and because of that they're making fewer trips to the Dollar General between three out of four Americans say in the last six months because of inflation they have experienced a financial hardship times are hard because Biden continues to spend money we don't have all right so if I'm a viewer at home or somebody has been following the news they know that Congress passed this thing called the inflation reduction act do you think that it was really the 401K reduction act because those really are going down they're right about that retirement savings is going down how do you get away with misnaming something like that how do you get away with that you know Trey they have a habit on the left of misnaming everything the covid relief package 1.9 trillion dollars the only thing missing in coveted relief was coveted relief one percent for vaccines the inflation acceleration Act is what it should have been named because with 740 billion dollars of spending creating 87 000 new positions for the IRS to hunt through your accounts to see if you're a tax cheat or not especially those under 200 000 it is the most ridiculous name of a bill since the covid Relief act so the truth of the matter is that the Democrats hope you believe what they say and not what you see at the gas pump or your electric bill or your food bill but trust them they will bring your inflation down by doing the exact same thing that cost it over spending it is ridiculous Dollar General needs help all right you're someone we look to for straight talk but also for a little bit of hope uh so is there I mean what can we do to get inflation down is there anything that Congress can do do we just have to fight through this cycle what can be done to get it down well the the FED is trying to bring inflation down by raising uh the interest rates while you raise the interest rates you push the economy closer to a recession that does slow spending unfortunately the most powerful tool we have is winning elections the truth is if we can win back the majority in the house when back the majority of the Senate we can turn the spigot off and when we turn that spigot off inflation will go down because it's cause of inflation is in fact overspending because this Administration loves spending money we don't have buying things we don't need impressing people who are simply unimpressed so the fastest way for us to turn to spigot off is to win elections we must win elections it's one of the reasons why I've been traveling our home state in South Carolina trying to make sure that the voters know that I'm serious about being their Senator and so I've been in Florence Myrtle Beach Columbia Anderson now I'm going to Greenville Spartanburg and across the state I want to make sure that I tell my voters I am serious about being their Senator but at the same time I'm traveling the country trying to make sure that we win these midterms I'm in Iowa Nebraska Wisconsin Ohio coming up soon Tennessee this Friday coming I want to go all over this country while traveling my state because we have to win elections starting with the house and then gaining momentum and winning back the Senate as well I'm exhausted just hearing your travel schedule because I know when you're in South Carolina you you work all the time so I I'm I'm exhausted all right we got about 30 seconds other than inflation what are the top three issues you're hearing voters talk about as you travel our state and the country the overall economy would be number one inflation's number two number three is gas prices and number four crime crime is devastating our most most marginalized communities and it can be stopped we have to stop pretending you can defund the police we need to refund the police amen Tim Scott the birthday boy uh happy birthday I'll talk to you soon thanks RJ have a good one

Every May, we celebrate Asian Pacific American Heritage Month and recognize the many contributions that Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have made to our nation. I'm honored to represent the largest, most diverse and fastest-growing AAPI community. In the state of Nevada, there is Chinatown Plaza on the west side, and the emerging Filipino district on the east side. In between, we enjoy Koreatown, Vietnamese and Thai restaurants and shops offering treats and goods from most of the Asian countries. Clearly, Southern Nevada's AAPI community is thriving and contributing to the cultural diversity and economic vitality of the region. I'm proud to serve as a member of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, as we work to strengthen the bonds between the United States and the nations of Asia. I'm also the co-chair of the Bipartisan Sri Lanka caucus, and as a private citizen and a member of Congress, I have enjoyed visiting many Asian countries including India, Myanmar, Thailand, Taiwan Indonesia, Nepal Cambodia, Japan, South Korea, Guam, East Timor, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan, and I look forward to traveling to others this month. We not only celebrate the numerous contributions Asian and Pacific Island Americans have made to the arts, to our food scene, to business, science, education, sports, and politics, but we also recognize the important role the community makes to our continued success as a nation. So as we mark Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, let us remember that the United States is a nation of immigrants, and we are a stronger country because of that. So please invite me, to your events during this exciting month and if you're in Washington, don't hesitate to stop by and say hello. Thank you so much.

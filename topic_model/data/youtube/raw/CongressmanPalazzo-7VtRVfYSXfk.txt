you must Thank You mr. chairman gentlemen thank you all for being here today I want to thank you for your service to our nation also coming here taking time out of your busy schedules to lend us your expertise on the amphibious force structure and to answer some of our questions also want to thank your families for their sacrifices i know that's sometimes overlooked and forgotten um I think it's pretty clear to everybody in this room into Congress that our intent is to find the LPD 28 or an additional LPD 17 class ship this committee authorized eight hundred million dollars in multi-year procurement I think the Senate author is authorizing committee did 650 in the Senate Appropriations Committee did 800 billion so it's absolutely clear the intent is that Congress wants the the twelve ship in the LPD 17 class I think it's extremely important as well and all the Commandant has expressed a huge amount of interest calling you know these ships the Swiss Army knives of the fleet and they're capable of doing multiple things and you not only just projecting force but serving as a deterrent also being able to provide humanitarian assistance evacuation as the list goes on so general Paxton and could you kind of elaborate and in your view what what has the Marine Corps what are the amphibious assault assets today and what do you think they're going to need moving forward thank you sir then again great colleagues here beside us so there's a good work amongst the Navy Marine Corps team on the way ahead in this particular case we happen to be the ones who are trying to articulate the requirements in order to do that power projection knowing full well and i'll come back to this at the end that we have some fiscal and constraints and caps there and i'll defer to secretary of staff lee to articulate what this means in terms of the overall shipbuilding program in terms of requirements as i tried to allude to in the comments 38 amphibious ships is the stressing case for the simultaneity of two operations plans we talked about that in a more class by the environment but that represents the assault de chillon of two expeditionary brigades which is what we need for again to operation plans what we understand though is in a day-to-day environment it's the it's the currency and the simultaneity of the demands from the five geographic come out and commanders that stress our force in a day-to-day basis so sir see if I can answer both of those there is a hard fast requirement for 38 ships to do the tube saltash lon requirement we agreed at least in paper and as recently as 2009 that we can live within fiscal constraints for 33 built into that the math of that equation is a ninety percent availability of the ships that there's always ten percent that are in maintenance we struggle under the existing number of ships today and the Navy despite great work is always challenged to get ships into the maintenance cycle so as we have things go on around the world in Yemen in Libya in Syria in the hurricanes and tornadoes and super typhoons and hainan in the Pacific we are repeatedly asked to respond to those we write we are ready to do that but it breaks the maintenance cycle and that's what stresses the force when we responded last November to super typhoon damiana in the Philippines we were we had Marines from the third Marine Expeditionary Brigade on be 22 s and n routes of the Philippines and somewhere between five and six hours but it took us several weeks to get two ships out of the maintenance cycle out there and I want to be on the record that ammo Harris and Admiral Thomas did great work to get them out of the yards and get them down there but there are two others we couldn't get there and we knew by doing that though we're going to break the maintenance cycle for those ships and that would further degrade their responsiveness of the 31st MEU in the western Pacific area so that's yet another case just as the special purpose magda f and the move to Juba earlier that just shows the word that case there the position now where the not only the paucity in numbers but the maintenance requirements in an aging fleet stresses the use of that and consequently the Navy Marine team who is forward deployed and ready to do things as always challenged to get there fast enough to stay long enough and to be able to reset so that we can get the ships back in the main I have another question but I'll probably run over my time if he tries to answer alright well general Paxton the recent navy 30 years shipbuilding plan discusses the building of the lxr what capabilities do you need in this ship to best support the Marine Corps mission yeah thank you sir when we tried to articulate requirements and I'm sure all the members of the committee given you a great experience and your fine support for us understand there's five finger prints a lift so we're looking about the number of individual Marines you can put on a ship with their personal equipment that's fingerprint number one we're looking at vehicle spots to get rolling stock on and off the ship we're looking at Cuban square for those vehicles and for cargo and then most importantly we're looking for deck spots for aviation for a rotary wing aircraft and then well deck spots for connectors and ship to shore movers well it's a whether it's an aav or else EUL keck we're trying to balance all five fingerprints of those lifts and the secretary stack Lee said earlier we have great design records from previous ships and we understand the trade space between a flight deck a well deck and number of people but how we maximize those five capabilities how we do it within existing cost constraints is the challenge for all of us so as the Marine Corps will try to articulate what we actually need given changes in technology to get there there's the Marines and their equipment ashore we are trying to hold down the weight of our vehicles but the weight of vehicles continues to increase we're trying to hold down the size of the aircraft but the wingspan continues to increase as we get great capabilities from our v-22s we're now trying to make sure the v-22 like the ch-46 is detachment capable which means you have an independent maintenance capability with them so all of these create stressors on the design of the ship and we're trying to make sure that the ability to project launch recover and sustain the force can be done within the design capability of the ship and the costs that were afforded are the monies that were given so doing this within the challenge of Virginia and Ohio class replacement and everything even as Marines we understand the challenge the department is under so we are grateful for the support that you show but I thought the fur here to Secretary of staff like we know that we're probably going to need more money to be honest with you above Toa to make sure the amphibious ship portfolio can sustain while we're doing submarines and surface class combatants so thank you sir we thank the gentleman for his questions as times expired i think this subcommittee recognizes that that funding for the LPD would not have been in there without his hard work and also the gentleman from virginia chairman readiness subcommittee who both work very very hard to make sure that was done the

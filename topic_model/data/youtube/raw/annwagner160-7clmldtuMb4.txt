Thank You mr. speaker and I thank the gentleman for yielding if we indeed defeat the previous question we will allow consideration of HR 962 the born alive abortion survivors Protection Act I introduced this legislation because the Constitution clearly states that all persons born in this country are entitled to life liberty and equal protection under the law the Constitution does not put age limits on those who are entitled to life I am horrified mr. speaker that many in the United States Senate many Democrats flagrantly violated the United States Constitution last night and voted down the born alive act embracing in fact infanticide pro-abortion politicians used to say life begins at birth now it's more unclear than ever when they believe that life actually begins or whether they even believe that living and breathing human beings should be protected under the law but I would like to commend three Democrats in fact senators bob casey joe Manchin and Doug Jones who defended the basic rights of new newborn children and voted for my legislation last evening in the United States Senate I introduced this legislation because it is just common sense I am shocked that there are prominent American legislators who believe in denying babies life-saving medical care when they are born as a mother a grandmother a legislator and an advocate who came to Congress to serve as a voice for the voiceless I believe that life begins at conception and that is wrong to kill a child no matter how many weeks old he or she may be but I am grieved to find that I now must defend something that I never thought we would have to fight for life-saving care for babies born alive in response to radical legislators who are promoting not just late term abortions but infanticide it is essential that we come together to protect children so today I am here to ask know Mr Speaker I am here to implore my colleagues the right to right the wrong that the Senate has committed and defeat the previous question and at least allow the debate to support HR 962 the born alive act here in the people's house mr. speaker this should not be a partisan issue Congress must never stop fighting to ensure that every single newborn baby in the United States of America receives life-saving care no matter their sex or their race or ethnicity or whether or not they are wanted and cuddled and wrapped into that first warm hug that they deserve the born alive Act is the simplest vote any of us can take do you support babies receiving life-saving care after they are born or would you deny these innocent children that care and allow them to be left to die and discarded this is bipartisan legislation mr. speaker last year six of my Democrat colleagues join me in voting for the born alive Act and I hope that we will bring this bill to the floor for debate so that many more of my colleagues can go on the record and vote to stand with America's mothers and children I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question and I yield back the balance of my time jeanna over from the

the federal government is tasked with coordinating the response of coronavirus I think it's fair to say they have been behind the curve of it but of course it is local governments that are going to have to make a ton of extremely important decisions in the days and weeks to come about how to balance taking steps to reduce transmission with the potential for big economic disruption I'm joined now by California Democratic congressman Karen bass was a former physician's assistant and clinical instructor at the University of Southern California and Democrat Eric Garcetti the mayor of Los Angeles great to have you both we saw this Ebola crisis years ago in which New York City had a confirmed case because a doctor who came back and the mayor and that city's Public Health System was immediately had to perform at a very high level what what are your preparations like how are you and and the folks in this city thinking about this what's one of the preparations now I mean we have the fourth busiest airport in the world the busiest seaport in all of the Americas and so that monitoring and that work is already ongoing as we prepare for what we know will be landfall here not a couple cases in Southern California as folks are home and they're well but when we look at this right now we're trying to just underscore that this is everybody's responsibility it's not just a public health department and we have a great county public health department here we have the plans in place but the chaos that breaks out when people suddenly don't go to work don't go to school when we see a cluster or a vector we have to be really smart about this for instance one area that I'm concerned about is senior health facilities senior care facilities as we've seen in Washington State don't have the vents that you have in a hospital have essentially medical personnel but they don't have the protective equipment and so whatever we can get from the federal government and assistance of that I think we're very close here to declaring states of emergency as well to expect to not because we want people to panic on the cases but because we have to be prepared for the federal assistance that comes with that we've already seen five counties do that in the state of California and it's gonna be very important for us to know that this is something in our own workplaces and our own homes that we have to take personal responsibility there's a real question about training for healthcare workers one of the things we saw in HoN in China was that hospitals and healthcare workers became essentially vectors for infection particularly early on before they were getting trained how do you deal with that how do you think about someone who was a healthcare worker yourself well that you absolutely have to move into education immediately and I remember the Ebola crisis I was in Washington DC there and I think one of the big thing that's missing on a federal level is that this is an international issue and so what President Obama did was he went out and rallied the world and he viewed it from the point of view that if it's not contained in the world and certainly it's going to come to the United States but first and foremost it's the education that has to take place with the healthcare workers and if you remember when Ebola hit Texas remember the nurses that were infected were infected because the education didn't happen fast enough so internationalizing it and then education for the health care that's at the level of sort of oversight and and funding which of the two things Congress is talking about now I know the administration requests have been several billion dollars I think Democrats had said they looking at 15 billion something that magnitude what is what is your sense of the back-and-forth between Democrats in Congress and the administration on that well you know we have an administration that views unfortunately everything from the lens of himself personally and so he's viewing this politically he didn't want to really admit that all of that was needed remember he said as soon as it gets warmer we don't have to worry about it it's gonna go away but with an administration who has lied to us on a daily basis for three and a half years this is when you need to trust the government the most one of the problems that happened in Ebola it actually continues to happen today is that some of the countries where people are infected they don't have the confidence in the government so then they don't pay attention to the instruction in fact the one big lesson now of this is that governments that repress information and try to tamp it down end up with the worst outbreaks that's it I'm gonna try that early on and Iran Iran right now is in really bad straits we don't have the actual numbers because we can't trust their data so that's precisely what happened there I mean that is the lesson right if you're not clear and transparent with people if people can't trust the government and if they try to sort of get away with happy talk as a lot of oppressive regimes want to do then you end up with okay can I give you an example I mean one of the things that's happening is everybody's running out and buying masks and that's what's needed and they're buying so many masks that the places that actually need the office which are in hospitals you know there is an absence and you know you have health care workers right now I think the main hospitals are well prepared for this remember we have a whole still network of smaller hospitals community clinics places where immigrant communities communities of color go lower-income folks go and that's not getting down to that level that's where the federal government could make a huge difference with helping us there's also question about testing I mean there's fears people have there was a sort of viral case of a guy that came back from China had a fever went and got a test in Miami got a bill for several thousand dollars there's other people who were evacuated out of China by the US government who now have build getting built there's a real I mean what do you say to people to Angelenos about who are like I don't want to get tests it's gonna cost me money or I don't want to take days off work because I have a old-fashioned I think the federal government should foot the bill for this this is about protecting it's not there we will step up at the local level and do that but hopefully we'll get those reimbursements and we want to encourage people also to look I mean in Japan in Korea you have been people who have drive-through testing you have mobile testing this is the kind of thing we can do so everybody doesn't rest of these hospitals and further spread the disease when it comes one of the problems is there not enough tests I heard they were sending a couple of thousand tests out there need to be hundreds of thousands of tests and the other thing that I worry about coming from White House is talking about a vaccine vaccines take years to happen so misleading people to think that that's gonna come soon it's a real problem quickly you're both voters here Jesse tomorrow you have your candidate your three national co-chairs for Joe Biden and that was early on helped us raise the minimum wage make Community College free was out there on the climate before anybody I knew and so I think that this city is grateful for what he has done and even with an extraordinary number of folks that are talented he is the guy who can unify us and he's the guy who can win congressman I don't think even doors you want to make some news right now I have not endorsed and I will just say that ever is the nominee I am going to be there with metals and whistles [Music]

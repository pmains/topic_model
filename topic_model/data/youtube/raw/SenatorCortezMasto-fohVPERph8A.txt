Thank You mr. chairman and ranking member this is a great conversation let me just first of all say this I'm from Nevada was the former attorney general there for eight years thank you to the Polaris Project you are instrumental in my state in helping us address this issue which I look at as human trafficking really breaking it down to labor trafficking and then sex trafficking and then further different types underneath and in Nevada we really focused on the domestic side of human trafficking so thank you for what you do thank you to the trucking Association because of your help and support our Nevada trucking association has an incredible program to educate our truckers and went through every single truck stop in Nevada with our trucking association to educate and talk about how we address this issue in human trafficking and before I forget let me ask a couple of questions the hotline is instrumental I agree we do not have enough data collected nationally there is data locally the Vice units I know in Southern Nevada our Vice unit collects that and has been over ten years so that has helped us but we don't have enough of it nationally the hotline is a great help and you're absolutely right one of your partners that I think is key are the attorneys general because of the work through the attorneys general and that data that we've collected you give that back to the states and we do something with it the hotline calls that you get though are not necessarily victims though they could be from anyone and they don't necessarily always pan out as a human trafficking incident but we want to make sure people know about is that correct that's absolutely correct right and in the state of Nevada not only did we work to pass state law to make sure that the hotline is located in many of our buildings many of our task forces many of our groups are working under the same premise that the hotline is key so we should use that at a national level and promote it everywhere we go so thank you for that so it's a space that I've worked in for a number of years and we still have work to be done one is on the demand side which we really need to focus on and so I appreciate the Chairman I heard that you're looking at addressing this potentially I would love to work with you on that but the other is the training and this is this is sort of my pet peeve the training is absolutely necessary and there's different types of training however I know working with victims not every not every victim of particularly of sex trafficking realizes their victim and then there's a level of trust and the training we provide to a first responder versus a training we provide to somebody in the trucking association or in our airports it's going to be different and there is always this talk about we need to fund training we need to promote it but we don't talk about what the training should be what it should look like and because of it there are so many people that want to help but I don't know if we're doing the right by those victims and the responders and identifying this so what I would like to see and I'm curious about your thoughts on this is to have some sort of national standardized training model or a center of excellence where we can actually bring people together to figure out the type of training that is necessary for the type of human trafficking we see and then send them back to their states or wherever where they're providing that type of training that is specific I'm curious your thoughts on whether that is needed or not sure thank you for the question and I'd love to hear Esther's response to this as well given your very particular lens I so we have yes we have encountered a problem about quality in training for years and one of the responses of the federal government set up was in instituting the office of victims of a crime training and technical assistance center that specifically focused on human trafficking training but for task forces and local communities it has been very successful in its efforts I think to create a level of quality for those audiences and and associated audiences Health and Human Services recently also built a pilot training for healthcare providers and their method of going about this was to bring survivors to the table bring medical professionals to the table dental professionals psychiatric professionals and NGO advocates and take about a year and a half to actually build and test something that they're now feeling fairly confident about that was the first time that I saw something really thoughtfully integrated into the community for specific audiences but to do so in all of that I would say going back to Senator Heller's question that the idea of these cross purposed types like when we're looking at vulnerable populations how do we address for that how do we address for the sectors that are most influenced or impacted by human trafficking I love the idea I think a group that I'd love for you to float that idea buys is the Advisory Council the u.s. Advisory Council I think they're going to have a lot of thoughts on that and since they are already giving feedback to federal agencies specifically on training I think they're going to be able to reflect for you what they see those challenges that are facing agencies currently and how you might be able to address those from a policy lens so I appreciate that I'm really curious though in bridging that gap between what's happening at the federal level in the state level so let me let me address as somebody who came from the law enforcement side in the state of Nevada we had no sex trafficking crime most of the sex trafficking was prosecuted at the federal level because of sex trafficking crime at the federal level so we passed a state crime of sex trafficking which then gave our DA's the Attorney General's office the ability to now investigate and prosecute and go after at the state level as well because unfortunately there's enough work to go around I think I can't speak for every state I know that's what was different in Nevada and that's why now we have the ability to do at the state level in the federal level I want to make sure the federal training that is still needed out there whether it's for our law enforcement or whoever that the state the folks are nonprofits that are also providing training are doing the same thing that they should be collaborating there should be this networking connection and that's why this kind of idea of a center of excellence or the standardized training is important so I appreciate that any other comments other than I appreciate the conversation today thank you very much thank you thank you senator Cortes Masto to ask the senator question yes that did you was it mandatory in Nevada for law enforcement to report the data it was not mandatory but because we came together as a task force and this was a focus of everyone in the state we we shared the data so law enforcement in Southern Nevada automatically was collecting Vice unit was already collecting my data for over ten years both on the child side in the adult side Northern Nevada they started collecting some of the data the challenge we had though is not apples and oranges right so somebody might be collecting data at a in the Northern Nevada that is different than Southern Nevada so you couldn't put the two together so there still needs to be that standardization and that's what the task force she should be working with to do yeah thank you thank you we're just discussing though that's a four

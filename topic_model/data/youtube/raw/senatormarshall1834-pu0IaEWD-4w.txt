let's get the read now from kansas republican senator roger marshall you know the american people many of them were asked right there they don't like what they see what can they expect from this many more irs agents is it possible those making less than four hundred thousand dollars a year won't see new audits under all this well sandra now we know why the irs has been buying weapons and ammunition we're gonna have eighty seven thousand more armed irs agents and if the example of the fbi is any example of what the irs is going to do americans should be scared you know this this administration's all been all about equity in the past there's been no equity when it comes to irs audits and i think that's going to continue if you own a small business if you're a working-class american it's going to cost you thousands of dollars to defend this audit uh and it's not good for america it's just one more thing for americans to have to worry about going to create just some concern and then just an attitude of not wanting to expand or grow your business well you saw on that exchange there with karine john pierre and our own peter ducey at the white house it happened just a short time ago if you were to take the white house at their word she said there will be no new audits on anybody making under four hundred thousand dollars a year she said very clear no okay what are 80 000 new irs agents going to be doing who are they targeting yeah well first of all kudos to peter ducey for for doing his job and making the government go on record so i think that's great we need to get him saying this 15 times as we as we know joe biden's lied to us in the past i expect this to be a lie as well uh in the past they've targeted conservatives and after you after you target the first thousand billionaires in america what are the eighty thousand agents going to do the rest of the day the rest of the year i think we can all expect to have more audits you know i think that i think people have big questions when they see that this doesn't lower inflation by most economist estimates perhaps moody's mark zandy i guess is making estimates it'll bring down inflation a little bit but somehow this is going to have to be paid for and you see those new irs agents and you wonder how they will be put to work but there was an exchange on another network where jared bernstein economic advisor to the president he basically would not commit to no new audits for those making under foreign so it's another messaging problem you can make the case on the part of this white house well well certainly there this bill this legislation is inflationary you can mark my words if you're going to raise corporation taxes those are going to be passed on to americans it's going to target manufacturing which is going to drive up the prices for cars and planes everything that's manufactured the prices are going to go up it's going to decrease the supply chain there's new taxes on the oil and gas industry as well this bill is inflationary and yes there's there's the only thing consistent about this white house is their inconsistent messaging all right overall the jct says starting in 2023 taxes will go up by 16.7 billion dollars for americans earning less than 200 000 that is really something we'll keep watching all of it and all sides of it thank you very much for joining us sir great to see you thanks sandra all right forget the i

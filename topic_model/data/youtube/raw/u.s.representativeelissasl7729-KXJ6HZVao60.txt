chairwoman luria ranking member distinguished members of the disability assistants um the dama subcommittee i appreciate the opportunity to speak today on h.r 5607 the justice for als veterans act this bipartisan bill will ensure that the families of veterans diagnosed with als or lou gehrig's disease continue to receive appropriate benefits they deserve after the veterans passing first i want to thank leadership of hvac and this subcommittee for their commitment to veterans and their families second i'd like to thank my veterans advisory board back home for all and all the other stakeholders in the district who've provided input on this bill and that we're discussing here today and finally thank you to the countless veterans and veteran families across my district who have shared their experiences with me and given me direct feedback on how we can better serve them um and both my in my office and here on the committee as you know as you know the va provides dependency and indemnity compensation to the surviving family of service members and veterans who pass away these surviving family members can also receive supplemental dependency and indemnity compensation benefits commonly referred to as dependency and indemnity compensation kicker in the case of veterans who had particularly severe service connected disabilities for at least eight years at the time of their passing the va recognizes als as a presumptive service connected disease and due to its progressive nature it's automatically rated at 100 percent disability as such the only barrier to serve the surviving family members of a veteran who loses their life to als receiving that kicker is having the diagnoses for at least eight years at the time of their passing unfortunately many veterans with als are unable to meet that eight year requirement because the average life expense expectancy of a person diagnosed with als is two to five years this means that surviving families rarely receive the critical supplemental benefit that's why i'm introducing this justice for als veterans act with my friend congressman fitzpatrick a co-chair of the congressional als caucus of which i'm also a member so quite simply the bill extends increased dependency um and indemnity compensation to the surviving spouse of a veteran with als regardless of how long the veteran was diagnosed with ils prior to their passing it's our responsibility to honor our veterans and their families not just with words but with action and i believe this straightforward tweak um to our current law will have tremendous impact on surviving families um with a a veterans of als i'm looking forward to working with the subcommittee on this thank you madam chair for allowing me to speak and i yield back

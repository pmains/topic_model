education he's an officer with the hispanic chamber of commerce and a member of the ingham county health department's board of health but to really know dr rodriguez you only need to read his monthly

spreading word about resources from head start to classes to covid vaccine clinics it's been a key way to reach latino and hispanic residents bridging the language gap in order to improve community relations and as i'm sure dr rodriguez is proud to know it's even being used by some spanish language teachers as part of their lesson plans the publication wouldn't be possible without the special partners that work together to work to put it together danny lane elena tapia patricia briones and dr george mansour in addition no tribute to dr rodriguez would be complete without mention of his

when it needed her most ms brinker has faced adversity in her life three years ago her husband passed away from brain cancer out of that pain she found purpose over the course of the last year she has devoted her time to the new day foundation for families a local non-profit that supports those fighting cancer and their loved ones the financial cost of cancer of a cancer diagnosis goes beyond just medical care as i know well beyond the loss of income the increase in expenses and emotional distress it is a diagnosis that can consume us entirely and that's where the new day foundation comes in with an army of local volunteers like ms brinker they provide resources to give cancer patients hope through financial assistance and emotional support when her husband was in the hospital ms brinker was surrounded by family friends and churchgoers who helped lighten the load for her she wouldn't have known what to do without that help and it's why she works so hard to make people to make someone else's load a little lighter during the pandemic when family members of immunocompromised patients saw a trip to the grocery store as a fraught experience ms brinker was there to provide for their essential needs since the program began last spring volunteers like lisa made more than 300 deliveries helping 125 families in total they were a godsend during covid and not just for their food deliveries by demonstrating that service doesn't stop not even during a once-in-a-generation pandemic ms brinker was a source of inspiration and strength with an infectious attitude that brightens the day of all she serves we are lucky to have her in our community ms brinker has persevered through adversity and loss and it has magnified her service with the powerful perspective that comes with experience she has used it to better her lake orient community as a humble spirit she prefers that any recognition focus on making a difference an article in the local paper ended with her asking readers to get themselves involved and true to form for this recognition she indicated that credit should go to the good people of the new day foundation it's a rare soul who can reduce pain and hardship in others especially when they themselves have been in that position for her work to honor the loving memory of her husband and her tireless service to community it's my privilege to recognize lisa brinker on the house floor today mr speaker i rise today to recognize another lisa the ultimate champion and advocate for the disability community in brighton michigan ms lisa kokab put simply lisa is a powerhouse as a teacher and a mother of five including an incredible 10 year old boy pj who has down syndrome she has built and created an incredible circle of support since moving back to michigan in 2016. at first when she was scouting schools for pj she had to push through being told no the family wanted to move back to be near to the kid's grandparents but the first school district that they called referred the students with special needs to those kids other schools gave similar responses when she asked if pj could be placed in general education that is until she called brighton's special education director who told lisa that pj could absolutely go to school with the other students that if they moved to brighton she would work with them so that's what lisa and her husband did now lisa will be the first to tell you that it wasn't always smooth sailing she's had to overcome plenty of challenges from pj's struggles with development to the to the hurt of hearing intolerant words and from other families lisa has been tested in too many ways to count but she has turned her pain into purpose by deciding to open gigi's playhouse in southfield michigan and with more than 45 locations nationwide gigi's playhouses are now achievement centers for individuals with down syndrome they are spaces that are specifically designed for kids to interact and play with each other while offering free programs to learn how to read improve their help develop health develop career skills and reach their greatest potential lisa was the driving force behind fundraising searching for a location and pulling resources together now with her dream a reality she strives every day to realize the vision of gigi's plays houses to see a world where individuals with down syndrome are accepted and embraced in their families schools and communities in its first year of operation gigi served 383 people with down syndrome more than half of whom were adults since then they have expanded their offerings and in order to help help more residents even adapting during the pandemic by switching to virtual programs mr speaker i'm a firm believer in finding your people those who will have your back and stay by your side through ups and downs failures and successes without a doubt lisa kokab has found her people in brighton and at gigi's playhouse and the disability community in michigan has found its person in lisa she's an inspiration to us all and i'm so proud to represent her here in the halls of congress it is my honor to speak these words into the congressional record so that her story can inspire all who read it mr speaker i rise today to recognize a stable of the community the wong family of wong express house in brighton before moving to

his employees rave about the culture he brings to the team extremely flexible and supportive very welcoming and inspiring i feel honored to work with such excellent people is some of what they've said mr wong's character truly came through in his devotion to keeping his customers and employees safe during covet 19. at a time when restaurants and dining establishments were particularly hard hit by the public health restrictions mr wong put a plan in place to allow wong express house to stay afloat after closing for nine weeks they reopened on may 29 2020 as a model for safe service with a separate enclosed area inside the restaurant the dining area was transformed into a contactless pickup window for customer convenience instead of dine in the restaurant trained staff to fully transition into drive through and carry out only the changes were not easy but the space was turned into a safe simple and effective process that limited customer to staff interaction keeping everyone safe from infection that ability to adapt to work through the challenges in order to keep customers satisfied is why i'm proud to recognize mr wong his wife mae their son jin on the floor of the house today their pride in their restaurant is as evident as is evident as soon as you walk in the door and their resilience can be found in their dedication to each other and our community during the shutdown when jinn had to travel back to brooklyn to support his wife and two kids mr and mrs wong stayed in brighton holding down the fort to make sure that their staff would be taken care of it's no surprise that on their first day back in business they were so overwhelmed with support to the point that they completely sold out of food now as they chart a course for the weeks and months ahead i know that the wong family will continue to demonstrate the toughness and grit that michiganders are known for during uncertain times on behalf of a grateful community it is my honor to recognize the

madam Speaker on April 3rd 1968 the Reverend Martin Luther King gave what the world didn't know would be his final speech seven times in that address dr. King said but I wouldn't stop there as he spoke of his dreams for a better world this Martin Luther King Day it's critical that we not forget the many lessons dr. King taught us lessons that emphasize ways to treat our peers and our neighbors with respect despite our differences in order to make a dream of a better and more unified tomorrow possible that message should resonate today more than ever to my peers in this chamber I've been thank you to this a lot lately what dr. King might say if he was here with us today as he might see the divisive partisanship that lives among these halls and I think he delivered one clear message we must unify to make meaningful changes we must bridge the gaps that divide our nation by working together to find common good civilly it's no secret that division brings pain and disables our capacity to solve problems and as Martin Luther King said in his last speech in Memphis Tennessee and gentleman's time wouldn't stop there madam Speaker I yield back

yeah mr. McKinley for five minutes Thank You mr. Chairman I really hadn't intended to speak I thought this was going to be something new your bill would pass through relatively quickly with that but I've listened to the debate on a couple of the issues that have been raised the one was talking about asthma and health standards if someone would just pay a little bit more attention to the EPA's their own reports are indicating that indoor air quality is far more dangerous than outdoor air as much as 100 times worse and when people spend ninety percent of their times indoors we've not been able to demonstrate that the disease or the health risks that they're addressing or facing have been caused by outdoor air or indoor air so you can walk through a park a mile away from a powerhouse and beef 100 times safer than breathing air in your own home or in your office but yet we keep attacking our coal fire power houses across America because it's easy to blame them we're there to really address our indoor air quality California surely the the gentleman from California has read their law they're much more aggressive in California try and dress it because they understand it's not coal fired power houses is caught it's a lot much more dangerous on our indoor air quality let's go to some of the other matters that were also talked about about what what answer do we have I think what we're trying to do it David excuse me for interrupting would you speak into your microphone I've been told that on the TV they're not picking up your voice the air quality issue of trying to address the climate change I think we are doing it into in a bill that's going to be on this omnibus bill where we're reversing a decision from this administration not to fund coal-fired power houses in Africa because what's happening in Africa has been the fact in and Al Gore and other have been talking about that the burning of the tropical rain forests in Africa and South America and elsewhere is six times worse in our energy our co2 emissions into the world six times worse and all they want the people in Africa want to build a powerhouse so they can cook with electricity they can heat their homes and we're saying because the world bank and the export-import bank and the treasury / saying we're not going to loan you any money I think you're going to see a change the fact that under the omnibus bill we're going to allow them to go back and refinance so they can build coal fire power houses there we're going to reduce the co2 emissions in the world by what we're doing by addressing the poverty in the situation if we want that nations of the world to emerge from poverty you've got to give them electricity and when they have to tear down their tropical rainforests to burn their wood so that they have heat for their home or they can cook we're impoverishing a whole section of our world that's not right and they're contributing so much unfortunately to the co2 emission so what we're doing under this administration is that he's once they maintain them at a status quo and what we're saying is we're trying instead of that if it's two tenths of one percent emissions of our coal fire power houses in America two tenths of one percent of the co2 emissions of the world come from our coal fire power houses we're going to put at risk hundreds of thousands if not millions of jobs in America when we know this isn't the problem it's easy to pick on from the other side but this science doesn't back it up and I get so frustrated sitting here listening to debate about picking on coal fire power houses when we're talking about gentleman from Virginia talks about we can accomplish all this we're just going to add to the cost of adding products we're going to hurt our middle class we're going to cause even a greater division in there between the rich and the poor where do we start raising utility bills we're going to drive more jobs offshore look this is serious business and this idea of pushing and ideology only crushes an industry here in America and push the risk jobs all across it's not just coal money jobs it's a railroad workers it's the truck drivers it's a timber industry all that's affected by our fossil fuels are cold let's be careful about it instead of playing an ideological fight let's find out where the real fight is and that is to get our people with jobs again I yield back the balance of my time German yields back the balance of his time

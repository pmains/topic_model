to the point with congressman bill Pascrell focusing on the concerns and issues facing the families of New Jersey's ninth congressional district hello I'm congressman bill Pascrell I would like to welcome you to the point millions of Americans are living with long-term disabilities as a result of brain injury brain injuries are caused by Falls accidents military conflict others are attributed to sports in recent years parents and coaches student-athletes have begun to take the threat of head injury in sports much more seriously this is imperative because every concussion is brain damage it needs to be treated with the gravity it deserves parents as the founder and co-chair of the Congressional brain injury task force I've long worked to help prevent manage and treat traumatic brain injury and our student athletes this includes passing legislation to provide states with federal funding to address TBI and introduce introducing legislation to support concussion management our student athletes and making ailments and other sports equipment safer in December Congress passed and under this appropriations bill that fully funded TBI research and prevention programs I fought for an additional 85 million dollars on the Omnibus for brain research through the brain initiative and when 25 million was cut from the defense health program on TBI we led the charge to have it restored with me today to discuss this are three other leaders in raising awareness preventing and treating TV I first Leonard Marshall a former defensive lineman with the New York Giants has been diagnosed with signs of CTE in his brain CTE is a degenerative disease of the brain found in athletes second dr. nancy shevell aati director of neuropsychology in neural science laboratory and traumatic brain injury laboratory at the kessler foundation and third wendy burke public education coordinator of the brain injury alliance of new jersey they've done by fantastic job and helping us over these last 15 years so welcome all of you thank you I have to have you here you know I was saying before to to Nancy when we started this and when we started the task force in 1999 you could fit the people of India who had interest in the Congress and a phone booth now we got over a hundred and twenty bipartisan people who work with me on these very important issues Leonard it was something in a New York Times just that a few days ago on a football player who played for the Giants and his name was Tyler sash died at 27 years of age he died from an overdose of painkillers okay which he had to use because of his injury sustained while he was a football player but I want to just get your attention on something i want to quote from the New York Times okay doctor and mckee chief of neuropathology at the VA Boston health care system and a professor of neurology in pathology at the boss University of skilled medicine conducted the examination after mr. sash passed away and said tuesday at the severity of the CTE in Sasha's brain was about the same as the level in the brain of the former NFL star junior sale in junior as you know committed suicide in 2012 at the age of 43 we're talking about a big deal here what's your take on it well you know it's indicative of the space and the time that we're in I mean this is the same woman that said that ninety percent of players that play in the National Football League when they retire will have some form of CTE and I've seen these guys yeah well I've gone and visited to him 40 45 years older like vegetables yeah and and I say to myself well the league had to know way back when that there's something on if there's such a pervasive amount of these folks that are out there and what were they doing about it well that's the thing you know you know build the issue pertains to inclusiveness and transparency and i think that the NFL did a poor job with transparency i think they did a poor job with hiring the right people as both of these women sitting to my left and right with a tester in terms of people to be involved in this but deeply committed to it i mean when you hire a Rheumatologist to deal with an erotic issue what does that say to me what does that speak to hmm that doesn't speak a transparency good so you know that's one of the things that bothers players like myself who really put in a lot of time and integrity right to building that game in that sport and we want parents to be listening very carefully about all three of our guests and what they have to say that's very very important I try to scare anybody but this is the reality of the situation I mean we're not making this stuff up and back in 1990 91 98 99 when i first got involved and it was from a friend of mine whose son a traumatic brain injury from an accident right and i could not believe what's been done since then till now in discovering the sources and what happens after this unfortunate situation develops when i looked at these football players i'm talking about you know we're not just talking about football players or boxes that have these injuries we're talking about all sports we're talking about mail we're talking about female yeah i was just talking to wendy earlier before he went on of a young lady down in Marlborough high school she's in college now nine or ten concussions she was a basketball player what the heck were we waiting for the gentleman up in montclair who died second time they put him back in after he had the first concussion had another concussion and that was the end of it that I was due to no concussion protocol that's time that's rich is what's your something that now we have it you know you're ringing at the road Richard I also think that you make an excellent point and that is that concussion is a mild form of traumatic brain injury and while there has not been a lot of research on concussion and helping people recover from the symptoms there has been a lot of research on traumatic brain injury mild moderate and severe so I think where we are now I think we're at a critical point where we can take that research that's been done in traumatic brain injury over the last 10 or 20 years and start to apply that to concussion to see tae to help the players that are suffering from this and the players that will be diagnosed with it in the future Chevrolet aunty the only thing that's move this quicker than what usually happens in the Congress of the United States were the two wars where the signature injury of Iraq in Afghanistan was traumatic brain injury yes roadside bombs concussions 20 we say that the numbers are we look through the numbers twenty-two percent of those guys and gals in theater at TV I many of them didn't know it never not many the never reported it's like that it's like the kid that gets hit on the field playing baseball or something you don't want to come out of the game he doesn't want to not go back into the game did you say a darn third downward here's the crazy piece about it traumatic brain injury we know of it's the cognitive impairment that's caused by traumatic brain injury which is where everyone is ignorant and they need to be well versed in this and understand what that impairment is and how to deal with that examine and I think you also make a living right I think you make a great point because people think of concussion and when you hear students talk it's I got knocked out my bell was wrong people don't recognize that that can lead to learn long-term consequences and how it can change your life your cognitive ability your memory your mood and just affect somebody in every aspect of their life and that's I think what we need to do more education about is getting people to realize that what's happening on the field in recreation and in the life will have a long-term impact on the quality of life a glaring effect yeah I I'm so happy that we've accelerated the education ah the war push that because when I when I visit our our soldiers in the various hospitals who take care of traumatic brain injury and deceive when I first was going in that what's happening now that's been accelerated to put them on rehab situations to get them to to manipulate those parts of the brain that are not damaged in order to compensate for those parts that are damaged what's the research that's being done the military is going to help the civilian side well we have done some recent work at Kessler where we do neuroimaging we have a state-of-the-art neural imaging center at Kessler we're able to scan people with brain injury before and after treatment and what we're showing is that with only a 10 session treatment non-invasive purely behavioral teaching them skills to help them remember new information we can change the way the brain is actually functioning so we're seeing new areas of the brain more active after treatment and that's correlating with better memory so we're able to intervene now we're able to help these folks it's a matter of getting this work that's been done in brain injury out to a larger population compared what's happened in the past 10 years to the you know the past 150 200 years what's what's going on right now there is so much going on that I couldn't begin to answer that question in the next 60 seconds it's across across the nation this is I think we've turned brain injury injury into a national issue thanks much too much of the work that you've done and I think that now there are so many scientists and so many clinicians and activists that are focused on the issue and that's why we've moved ahead so quickly in the past couple of years I think there's oh there's so much more to come in the next decade and I think back to its ten years that we had our first concussion summit at Giants Stadium actually and in in 2005 actually New Jersey was in the forefront of wrecking izing that we were getting so many calls and so many inquiries from people who were getting hurt while playing sports and recreation sports good that we actually gather together a group of professionals I know you were right on in in the beginning and developed a consensus statement most people don't know what we were talking about nobody just know and it was really just the beginning of you know the concussion and how we brought it mainstream and to see where we are 10 years and next month will be our 10-year anniversary since we had that summit and we at the brain injury alliance of New Jersey continue to have a concussion committee that meets on a monthly basis and we really bring together all of the top health care professionals across the stage so whether you fell off a motorcycle that's like it whether you fall off the roof when you're fixing the shingles whether you're in a car accident whether you're on the battlefield or whether you're in the fields for sports be a male or female these injuries are happening there's a couple of million people that get injured every year civilians in the United States of them at one point seven people sustained a traumatic brain injury each year that does not account for people who do not seek attention do not seek emergency room or any type of medical care and it also does not account for the people that suffer an acquired brain injury did you struggle break but I just want to leave you with this thought as to you know where where we're going on this and these are things that you don't have to have children in order to concern yourself about what happens when you know you get that proverbial bump on the head we're talking serious business here yes and we're going to be back with you in just a moment we're going to take a quick break and then we're right back with our experts and they're doing a fantastic job we'll be right back with you our veterans put everything on the line to protect our we may never be able to repay them for their sacrifice but we can show them just how much we appreciate all they've done every day hundreds of people just like you volunteer to help our veterans you can help by simply sharing your time lending a warm smile a supportive hand for a sympathetic ear to someone who needs it everyone can do something to make our veterans know how much we appreciate their service what will you do a landmine blue been through the door of his patrol vehicle when I came here I couldn't move David was broadsided on the highway they weren't very hopeful at the time that he would survive at all an IED wounded Mike in Afghanistan don't remember all of the blast was over 500 pounds of explosives their physical injuries have healed the traumatic brain injuries tbis haven't the way I can describe is just your frame am I gonna start forgetting things TBI is as serious as any battlefield injury they're just not the guy you used to be thankfully VA has made important advancements in TBI seeing it treating it understanding it and they're here to help veterans affected by it I can see that what we're doing here at the poly trauma unit is to move from survivability to thrive ability if you think you or a veteran you know has sustained a brain injury get screened we're back with our very very very important guests talk about traumatic brain injury where we're going on this parents family members you better listen very carefully to the rest of our show this is for you this is where all of us doctor let me ask you this question we fought very hard to get more money into research and development we start out very well number fourteen fifty million our up to 291 million what war is this in this research going where do you think we're headed in terms of you know something we can grasp on to as to show progress well I think the most important direction we can take in research is treatment we need to identify more treatments that are effective again people back to their normal lives we need to get people back to work we need to get them back out into the community so they can participate in the community and live fuller and richer lives we've already made great strides in that area particularly with the work that we've done a Kessler foundation as well as many of our colleagues nationwide where we're now beginning to identify treatments that can treat cognitive problems and other issues that stem from traumatic brain injury and that's key we have to show that the treatments work because that's how you get the insurance companies to pay for it and whether you're talking about chemistry or whether you're talking about physical rehab or whether you're talking about developing certain parts of the brain that have not been damaged and Leonard had mentioned it before cognitive situation the consequences of this thing I've met many of these players not only football players that had were the victims there were victims yes and and and I I'm shocked by how almost they be many of them are vegetables I don't want them to use that term but that's yeah it's my turn and someone have died very prematurely unfortunately what doctor mentioned about the community where is the community involved in this so we've done a ton of outreach into the community but more education is still needed we started as we mentioned you know years ago starting to address an increase awareness about concussions in education reaching out to schools reaching out to parents and it seems like you know over the last few years with all the attention that it's getting the parents are on board the parents are terrified and we've heard at different seminars that we've been in that parents are starting to pull their kids out of the Pop Warner the Pop Warner leagues are suffering though as we keep talking about this is not just an issue for football this is an issue for lots of different activities but unfortunately it's still very difficult to penetrate the student athlete and we actually did some pre and post-test evaluations a station sir above all others absolutely and they don't understand how and how this will affect their life and so we've actually done some pretest trying to gauge the awareness about concussions with athletes do some edge and then post test and we do see the the pendulum swinging just a little bit that there's an increased awareness and people are starting to realize that this one game can actually change the rest of their life but definitely more education more awareness is needed to be able to let people realize the consequences of not reporting a concussion and that's really what this is what happen in this on the field of battle do I look like absolutely and one of the most important messages we try to get out especially to the student athlete is if you're not feeling good if you have symptoms of concussion if you have a headache if you're nauseous if you're feeling dizzy if you're more fatigued you need to let somebody know you need to speak up and as somebody try to do dollars it is hard to do but we use messages like we had just spoken about a young man Preston who had sustained a second concussion and his message is very clear it's better to sit out for one game then sit out for the rest of your life and so that's the message we try to get out to athletes I want ask Leonard died you and I have met dr. Bennet Omalu who started the research into CT e which is particular brain disease right caused by particular aggravation damage of the brain all through physical contact of sorts not that that's the only way to have brain damage right the physical cause it's not uh what was your impression of the doctor and why did the nfl's try to silence him i think that when bennett determined that what chronic traumatic encephalopathy really was in terms of his research and understanding what tar protein is on the brain and bringing that to the forefront for people who didn't quite understand that i think that's what disappointed the national football league if you look at today just three days ago the NFL pulled out of a concussion research study they pulled all the funding back from it we're talking 40 and 40 plus million dollars back in research money they already had committed to understand fully understand more what chronic traumatic encephalopathy is how it affects the player how it affects the family and the sub statue of people associated with players that witness CTE and live with CTE so it's a shame that how do you handle it well I deal with on a daily basis I i have great doctors at Mount Sinai at Lenox Hill Hospital one of my best friends happens to be on the head of ER at lenox hills and happens to be an authority on head trauma a dr. robert glatter and when I have my spats and my issues associated with CTE he's a phone call away not too many people have a relationship like that ok so I'm fortunate to have someone like that my dear friend Bob Costas his lovely wife Jill my friend Julian Bailes my friend Bennet Omalu people like that in my life that really care not concerned about the wellness of Leonard Marshall after professional football so you know you thought the movie was a reflection of the reality experience no doubt I mean I no doubt I mean you see the scene as powerful as maybe where Mike Webster takes his life inside of his pickup truck I mean is that normal is that normal dog that's not normal I think what we have to think about moving forward the reality is the football is part of American culture it will remain part of American culture a lot of the other sports too however one thing that's important to think about is not all players are suffering from the symptoms that you're suffering for others have suffered from so what's the difference between those players who are experiencing those symptoms and those players who live a long life never experienced in genetics I don't know if its genetic there's a lot of research going on in the TBI community as well as other neurological illnesses that show that cognitive reserve plays an issue so cognitive words what is that cognitive reserve is the intellectual capacities that you have available to you so if you have more cognitive reserve you're less likely to show cognitive decline but upon autopsy you may have the same amount of neuropathology that's what happened with Frank Gifford and that does not surprise me that's it not surprise me so perhaps we can boost someone's cognitive reserve perhaps when a football player is still playing or has recently retired maybe we can teach them strategies memory strategies strategies to improve their processing speed or their attention and we can boost their neurological system to be able to stave off that cognitive decline for a longer period of time thereby increasing their functioning that's just one area of research that I think still needs attention moving forward might we establish the protocol which I recommended the 12 years ago at the beginning of war that we test soldiers before they go out in the bottom feminists you know shave this down to the civilian area and in whatever a situation you're going to be in you test them so you have something to compare it to later on right a baseline is very important yeah basically is very important isais line is critical and you know I had a big big argument with the Department of Defense because they were testing people going in but they never they only tested a few when they were coming out right I so had I can you make a conclusion I want to start doing over high school yeah I won't start doing high school in every sport mm-hmm well they do it at a professional level we do it in soccer are we doing in hockey they do yeah yeah forget we're good we actually so going back ten years ago we actually received funding to offer up to a hundred high schools baseline testing for their student athletes and we had to knock down the doors of the high schools it took us three years to get a hundred high school yeah I remember going those uh I went to nutley high school Passaic Valley eyes Wow also passaic county and uh I felt and the first time I went to one of those schools I felt like I was from Mars what do you want to take our athletes through and I said well this is you know what things are going to be voluntary right but this is for the stew is benefits right be it male or female because we want to know if there is unfortunate problems that occur out in the field that we could test that individual later on and make a comparison to what was and what is now you mentioned that Lee high school and so I just need to say that Nutley is actually becoming a model for creation management great yes they've actually taken the concussion over all and they're bringing it into the classroom and is there developing a whole process now so it's not just a return to play model but it's actually returned to la you tell me my friends the athletic director there is is partly involved in this he absolutely fantastic right now we might understand why there what he was when I went to him and he said I'm all in yeah I said well wait the light you hear what I gotta say I'm happy are you gonna say you're right you aren't that I read about this and I read about that so people are a lot more educated people going to be a lot more educated that people are going to seek help right and when people seek help to have coverage insurance is involved in this kind of thing I don't have to tell you right water right insurance is involved in this and thinking if you don't have insurance it gives you a full off a little problem is I mean what am I going to do hyperbaric chamber treatment oxygen replacement treatment understanding your diet and what do we try to be as gluten-free and in high protein high fiber as possible because that affects the brain the way you think and that's the stuff that people that can't afford right knee did no one understand what should parents do most of all anything one I think one of the most important things parents can do is be educated be aware be involved in their student athletes life and the horrifies me absolutely this is absolutely mela FEMA as I think I mentioned earlier email why we need to be particularly concerned about girls in this situation well females actually have a higher incidence of sports-related concussions oh really you never know it no you know what your leaders and in fact we talk about football wrestling actually is the highest incidence of concussion you know we talk about football because the number of people who play football is so much greater so the incidence is greater across foot but it's actually all sports and not just sports it's recreation it's in every way of life so parents really need to be involved know the symptoms of concussion and ask the questions doctor we really really enjoy I wish we had more time because she's so full of knowledge and learned your full of knowledge thank you so simple and Wendy your full knowledge and you're out there in the community correct and I can tell you eyeball eyeball I'm committed to this as you know since 1999 I'm not coming off of it thank you and we appreciate that great and we do we're moving for we're gonna put pressure on everybody I have to do the right thing Thank You Laura to do the right thing and I want to thank you all for being here I'm deeply appreciate you very much thank you for having us I want to thank you for watching edition of to the point I'd like to thank my guest today Leonard Marshall dr. Nancy sure of a lot e very good and Wendy heard it you have heard our thoughts now I would like to hear what you think about today's show if you have any comments concerns or questions stay tuned our address our phone number our website address will appear in a moment thanks again for tuning in see you next time on to the point

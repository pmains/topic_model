thank you so much representative vince those were very useful questions for the committee to understand further these issues uh and the chair will now recognize the uh gentleman from hawaii uh representative case thank you again madam chair uh chair aila uh first of all thank you for your kind comments you have been at this a lot longer than me through a whole range of uh areas from motion conservation to supervising and and discharging our our obligations to our natural resources and of course in the native hawaiian community so i thank you for your service um let me i want to emphasize or put put some emphasis on the relevance of your testimony here to this committee in support of hgarez55 and so let's just review the history here the hawaiian homes commission act was passed in 1921 the federal government was responsible for the discharge of its obligations and for the administration and implementation of that act for 39 years until statehood for hawaii in 1959 in 1959 we became a state and under the admissions act um we the people of hawaii undertook the direct obligation to discharge the responsibility of the hawaiian homes commission act uh to the beneficiaries of the hawaiian homes commission act and that obligation was then a state of hawaii obligation and the obligation is carried out uh through the department of flying homelands and the hawaiian homes commission and you are chair of the hawaiian homes commission so when you speak here today um in support of hva res 55 you are speaking as i would call it the the point of the spear for the state of hawaii's obligation uh to the beneficiaries is that correct that is absolutely correct and it is it also comes with the um the weight of the commission the commission voted to support this resolution right absolutely so this is us speaking through you all of us not just native hawaiians all of us in the state speaking through you and telling this committee that this is uh what the state of hawaii wants to do yes as and as it was pointed out by um uh chair uh fernandez and it was very clear we um there is overwhelming support here in the state of hawaii and i just want to emphasize that as well because because again um the the law today the federal law today um provides the state of hawaii the the right to amend the federal law in some cases and the right to amend the federal law with the consent of congress in other cases and we're in the latter category here right so we've already we have already amended this law in the state legislature subject only to the consent of congress that is correct representative case okay thank you very much chair let me go back to a point that ms radawagan was asking you about um you know for the indigenous peoples of our country you know housing and the land is it's not a commodity it's it's it's it's an ancestral relationship uh you refer to it as the aina in in hawaii and that's what we call that obligation that relationship um for the native hawaiian people who live on the hawaiian homelands this is their aina that is a generational um relationship with the land correct it is more than that for a positive case it is it is part of the family it is part of the reciprocal relationship between the people and and the aina so it is it is something that i think most indigenous communities clearly understand innately and the answer to your question is yes absolutely okay and and in that in that relationship um in that in that connection uh chair um i think you use the word um psychologically devastating to be dispossessed from the land and i i want to put a point on that as well because in this case if there is not a if there is not a way for ohana family to remain on their ancestral lands because of the application of federal law at some point in what is now five maybe six generations on the land the the hawaiian homelands um that dispossession is not just a dispossession from that land the practical reality is that given uh the rate of home ownership for native hawaiians in hawaii and that very high price of housing that you pointed out they will most likely be dispossessed from hawaii itself would you not say that that's a realistic um reality of it it is uh representative case and we see every day the out migration of native hawaiians to the continent because of that okay thank you and then and then just the the final the final point that i want to agree with you on uh which is that oftentimes some people phrase this as a false choice between between continuing uh homesteaders on the land and allowing those on the waiting list to come on the land and that is a false choice because we do have the option of course of increasing the availability of homes on the land which we are all dedicated to doing correct that is correct and we worked hard every day along with the congressional delegation and the legislature to do so thank you again so much for your testimony and for your service i yield back mahalo thank you very much representative the chair would now recognize representative case the gentle person from hawaii good morning and aloha madam chair members witnesses first of all i note as well as uh ms radawagon that i'm a very proud co-sponsor of hjres55 with congressman calally strong supporter of this and i'll get into that a little bit with with my questioning later i also uh madame chair i want to thank you personally in front of this committee for taking time out of your precious personal family vacation time recently to understand native hawaiians generally back in our home state as well as the hawaiian homelands your visit to the keokah hawaiian homelands to appreciate personally the vision and the reality of the hawaiian homelands on the ground meant everything to congressman helly and me um and everything to un blind homeland uh folks throughout the country that was really a nice gesture so thank you for that mr smith last year we dealt with the question of the participation of native hawaiians in certain programs and protections under the uh of the urban indian organizations the specific question was on a bill by mr gallego having to do with coverage of of urban indian organizations under the federal tort claims act um that bill was eventually passed um very early this year um however the question was whether native hawaiians should be covered and get the same uh torque coverage as they are and remain um integrally um part of the urban indian organization although they're not technically part of the indian health service um they contract uh for services uh when uh folks that are eligible under the indian health service uh for example are in hawaii those are native hawaiian healthcare organizations that provide those services and yet they do not have that coverage and so that was a matter of debate at the time director uh testified in this committee that he would support the inclusion of native hawaiians so that's unfinished business but i i mention it as a prelude to my question which is in your view what consultation um under um hr 5221 or otherwise would be owed would be appropriate uh for other indigenous peoples who are not directly in the urban industry indian um uh um or the indian healthcare service when they when they are not specifically um eligible you have a comment on native wines in particular i think thank you uh very much representative case for the question and comment and certainly this is a an area that we are tracking closely and stand ready to provide technical assistance on if and when requested but certainly uh as it comes to tribal consultation we stand ready to share our experience on some of the critical events that have have played out throughout our history as a federal agency in working with with tribal governments as a form of communication that emphasizes trust respect shared responsibility uh working towards a you know mutual uh decision making if possible if and when possible we certainly believe this is a a policy that has benefited american indian alaska native tribes and would certainly uh be willing to to share our experience with native hawaiians well i think i think excuse me mr smith i think my question is a little bit more direct than sharing it my question has to do with do you undertake any any any consultation obligation or do you think it's a good idea to consult with native hawaiian organizations when native hawaiians are providing services um in a culturally appropriate way to other indigenous peoples under the indian health service certainly we would be welcome to to conversations and and any impact that may impact uh tribes or their members and certainly if there's an opportunity to elevate some of those impacts to to tribal leadership we would certainly um assist in serving as a conduit for those uh conversations thank you mr smith i do support this bill by the way i just um i just want to make sure that native hawaiians are recognized as as part of the number of of these services whether they technically formally are are covered or not right now thank you i yield back madam chair

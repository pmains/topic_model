O DO THE RIGHT THING WHEN YOU GO  IN FOR YOUR DEPOSITION. >> THE PERSON, "OUTFRONT" NOW,  MEMBER OF THE JANUARY 6th SELECT COMMITTEE, DEMOCRATIC  CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF,  CONGRESSMAN, YOU KNOW, PRETTY  CHILLING TO HEAR THAT FROM LIZ  CHENEY, DO YOU THINK THE WITNESS TAMPERING WAS COMING AT THE  DIRECTION OF THE FORMER  PRESIDENT. IS THAT THE PERSON? >> WELL, I DON'T KNOW, BUT  CERTAINLY WE'VE SEEN A HISTORY  OF THE FORMER PRESIDENT TRYING  TO INFLUENCE WITNESSES OR  INTIMIDATE THEM. YOU'LL REMEMBER, I'M SURE,  PASTOR MARI BEING THE SUBJECT OF AN ATTACK BY THE FORMER  PRESIDENT ON TWITTER IN REAL  TIME THAT SHE TOOK AS WITH A  THREAT AND PRIOR TO RUSTY  BOWER'S TESTIMONY JUST LAST  WEEK, THE PRESIDENT ATTACKING  THAT ONCE, THE CONNOTATION OF  ROGER STONE'S SENTENCE BY DONALD TRUMP, CONVICTED OF LYING TO  CONGRESS AND TRYING TO GET OTHER WITNESSES INTO TELLING THE TRUTH AGAINST CONGRESS, SO THERE IS A  HISTORY HERE, WE ARE VERY  CONCERNED ABOUT IT WHETHER IT'S  THE FORMER PRESIDENT OR ANYONE  ELSE TRYING TO INFLUENCE OR  INTIMIDATE WITNESSES BEFORE A  COMMITTEE. >> SOME OF THE TESTIMONY TODAY,  CONGRESSMAN, WAS JAW-DROPPING,  JUST TO BE HONEST WITH YOU AND  CERTAINLY, I, ALONG WITH MANY  OTHERS IN THIS COUNTRY, OF ALL  POLITICAL PERSUASIONS HAD THAT  FEELING. THE QUESTION FOR YOU, THOUGH, IS DO YOU BELIEVE THE NEW  INFORMATION YOU PUT FORWARD  TODAY, BECAUSE THERE WAS A LOT  OF NEW INFORMATION, BUT DOES IT  PROVE THAT TRUMP COMMITTED A  CRIME? >> WELL, YOU KNOW, CHECKING OFF  MY JANUARY 6th HAT FOR A MINUTE  AND PUTTING ON MY HAT AS A  FORMER PROSECUTOR, WHAT REALLY  STANDS 0 YOU THE TO ME ABOUT THE TESTIMONY TODAY IS THAT  TESTIMONY WHEN DONALD TRUMP WAS  INFORMED THAT PEOPLE IN THE  CROWD WERE ARMED AND DANGEROUS,  HIS RESPONSE WAS TAKE THE  MAGNETOMETERS DOWN. THESE PEOPLE DON'T POSE A THREAT TO ME, THAT IS, DONALD TRUMP,  TAKE THE MAGNETOMETERS DOWN, I  WANT THEM TO MARCH WITH ME TO  THE CAPITOL, AND IF YOU HAD ANY  QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THE  QUESTION KNEW THESE PEOPLE WERE  ARMED OR THAT THEY WERE  DANGEROUS, I THINK IT'S PRETTY  CLEAR FROM THAT TESTIMONY TODAY, HE KNEW WHAT A THREAT THEY POSED AND YET HE WAS INSISTENT ON  MARCHING TO THE CAPITOL, TO THE  POINT OF POTENTIALLY GETTING IN  AN ALTERCATION WITH HIS OWN  SECRET SERVICE ABOUT IT. SO THAT IS, I THINK, SOME OF THE MOST RELEVANT EVIDENCE AS TO THE PRESIDENT'S KNOWLEDGE AND HIS  STATE OF MIND INCITING THAT MOB  TO ATTACK THE CAPITOL. >> AND ONE OF THE THINGS SHE  TESTIFIED, YOU KNOW, YOU REFER  TO AND THIS IS SHE WAS TOLD, SHE SAID BY TONY ORNATO WHO WAS THEN THE WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY CHIEF OF  STAFF, THAT ON JANUARY 6th,  TRUMP WAS SO ENRAGED BY SECRET  SERVICE DETAIL BLOCKING HIM FROM GOING TO THE CAPITOL THAT HE  TRIED TO GRAB A STEERING WHEEL  AND LUNGED AT THE SECRET SERVICE AGENT IN CHARGE, THE MAN IN THE  SUV WITH TRUMP AT THE STEERING  WHEEL. NOW, TRUMP DENIES THE STORY. YOU USED THE WORD "POTENTIALLY"  A MOMENT AGO WHEN YOU REFERENCED IT. HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO  CORROBORATE THIS JAW-DROPPING  STORY WITH ORNADO, ENGLE, OR  ANYONE ELSE WHO MAY HAVE  WITNESSED IT FIRSTHAND? >> I CANNOT COMMENT ON OTHER  TESTIMONY BEFORE THE COMMITTEE,  BUT I CAN SAY THAT WE DO WANT  PEOPLE TO COME FORWARD WITH  INFORMATION THEY HAVE. AND HERE, BECAUSE SHE IS  RELATING AND DOING SO VERY  OPENLY, A CONVERSATION THAT  OTHERS HAD, THAT THEY TOLD HER  ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WE INVITE OTHER WITNESSES THAT HAVE KNOWLEDGE  ABOUT THIS TO COME FORWARD. MORE WITNESS THAT IS COME  FORWARD, TO COME FORWARD AGAIN,  IF THEY HAVE MORE INFORMATION  INTO THIS. WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IS OFTEN  BRINGING WITNESSES BACK, THEY  TELL A MORE COMPLETE VERSION  WHEN WE KNOW MORE OF THE  QUESTIONS TO ASK. SO WE HOPE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT  THIS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF HER  TESTIMONY TODAY. >> RIGHT, AND AS YOU POINT OUT,  YOU KNOW, BEING TOLD THEY WERE  ARMED AND SAYING TAKE AWAY THE  MAGNETOMETERS AND LET'S MARCH ON THE CAPITOL, INCREDIBLY DAMNING. DO YOU HAVE CONCERNS, THOUGH,  CONGRESSMAN, THAT THE STORY,  ABOUT HIM SORT OF LUNGING FOR  THE SECRET SERVICE AGENT AND THE STEERING WHEEL IS NOT TRUE? >> LOOK, I BELIEVE CASSIDY  HUTCHINSON, I THINK SHE'S A VERY SMART, CAPABLE, HONEST  INDIVIDUAL. SHE HAS NO INCENTIVE TO MAKE UP  SOMETHING THAT ISN'T TRUE, AND  SO I THINK SHE'S A VERY, VERY  CREDIBLE WITNESS. SHE HAS BEEN VERY CONSISTENT IN  POINTING OUT THINGS THAT SHE  DOESN'T KNOW. AND AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR, ONE  OF THE THINGS I LOOK FOR IN A  WITNESS IS WHAT ARE THEY TELLING ME THAT THEY KNOW AND ARE THEY  WILLING ME TO TELL THEY DON'T  KNOW THINGS AND SET THE LIMITS  OF THEIR KNOWLEDGE, SHE HAS DONE THAT CONSISTENTLY AND I THINK  THAT MAKES HER VERY CREDIBLE.  >> RIGHT, I THINK SHE IS SAYING  WHAT SHE BELIEVES TO BE TRUE. I GUESS I'M WONDERING IF YOU  THINK WHAT SHE WAS TOLD HAD BEEN HYPERBOLE OR EXAGGERATED IN ANY  WAY. >> WELL, ALL SHE CAN RELATE IS  WHAT SHE KNOWS AND WHAT SHE'S  HEARD AND THIS IS WHY, YOU KNOW, NOT JUST WITH THE RESPECT TO  THIS BUT WITH RESPECT TO ANY  OTHER ELEMENT OF HER TESTIMONY  OR, FRANKLY, OTHERS, WE WANT  PEOPLE TO GO FORWARD AND SHARE  WHAT THEY KNOW AS WELL. HISTORY WILL BE VERY KIND TO THE CASSIDY HUTCHINSONS. THOSE THAT HIDE BEHIND PHONY  CLAIMS OF PRIVILEGE OR BECAUSE  THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH IT I  THINK WILL BE DAMNED BY HISTORY  FOR THEIR INACTIONS WHILE OUR  DEMOCRACY WAS THREATENED. >> O

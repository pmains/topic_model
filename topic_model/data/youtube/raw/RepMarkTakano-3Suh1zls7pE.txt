popped an atomic bomb that nearly obliterated that Japanese city 70 years ago here to discuss is california congressman mark Takano whose family is from hiroshima congressman thanks so much for being with us this morning good morning thanks for having me tell us what today means to you and your family well for my Emily it is extremely meaningful that the president's gone to Hiroshima to call the world's attention to the cause of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation I think the people of Hiroshima in the people of Japan are going to I feel a great deal of not only comfort but I reassurance that the president is really trying to make sure that another nuclear weapon is never ever used again your great grandmother saw the explosion in Hiroshima she was in a sweet potato patch in the mountains and she saw it happened she witnessed it with her own eyes she thought it was a fertilizer fire and you wrote a letter to the president sort of urging him to make this trip you said it would be healing and can you explain how how this visit will help heal your family well you know my family course my meet my mother and father and my most of my grandparents for you they were born here in the United States so they were actually in American internment camps during the war and our Americanism was question so it's you know there was always an ambivalence toward Japan and it wasn't until I was aged 41 thought I actually myself went to Japan with a lot of mixed feelings but when I met my relative my second cousin Kikwit takagi who had been in America after the war she had never ever been to the peace Museum she was a 12 or 13 year old girl at the time the bomb dropped most of her classmates Paris because they were near Ground Zero and she was kept home that day by her mother who lived about two miles outside the city center uh as kiku and i drove into the peace museum for the first time for both of us she pointed to the Oder River that we crossed over to we're on a bridge and she said you know they said that the water could not be seen the surface of water because it was so covered with dead bodies at that moment I thought to myself every world leader who controls a nuclear arsenal should come to Hiroshima to really comprehend and fathom the destructiveness of a nuclear weapon of course we have bombs today that are far more powerful than the one who dropped on Hiroshima wow what a moment for history and for our country and for your family of course so congressman let's talk about what's going on back here at home you of course your district is in California Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump seem to be both amenable to having a debate in California should Hillary Clinton be a part of that debate well that's up to Secretary Clinton do you think it would be wise I mean now that it seems like they're taking it seriously and these her two opponents might be having a debate without her should she be involved well I think Secretary Clinton and senator Sanders have had ample time and numerous debates to be able to flush out their differences I don't know what another debate would do to amplify you know the distinctions among the candidates and so you know I don't really have a strong opinion about whether she should be a part of that debate or not well here's the problem congressman in your home state of California look at the polls this is the latest polling out of California Hillary Clinton at forty-six percent Bernie Sanders at forty-four percent I believe that's within the margin of error what do you think is going to happen in your state well I I continue to believe that Hillary Clinton will prevail on june seventh I believe she will be the nominee of our party regardless what happens in California but i still believe she's going to win California and the math is the math she will be our nominee and it'll be a moment at which we're going to round her and I have every bit of confidence that the people have been supporting Bernie Sanders most of them are also going to be given the coalesce around Secretary Clinton and knowing that the choice stark choice with Donald Trump Donald Trump who says that Japan and Korea South Korea should get their own nuclear weapons and it presents the possibility of a nuclear arms race in Asia this is simply no comparison between say Secretary Clinton and someone who's nonchalant and cavalier about foreign policy as Donald Trump so I think we'll see the beginning of a coalescence around Secretary Clinton okay and a unification of the party congressman mark Takano thanks so much for being on new day and sharing

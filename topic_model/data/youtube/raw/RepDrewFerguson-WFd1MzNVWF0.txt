thank you Mr chairman thanks to each of you for being here today um you know when I think about trade agreements I think I think of them as being the icing on the cake for Americans and American workers but the most important thing that we have to do here in America is have have the have the right environment that makes us the most competitive place in the world to do business the right tax code the right regulatory environment the right education environment you go down the list we need to be driving things that drive American Business and workers to succeed all around the world and so one of the things that I struggle with right now is even though we've been Fair we've been very anemic in the trade space right now we've been putting ourselves behind by destroying American Energy independence by by creating the environment where inflation is is is just running rampant really looking at you know the broken supply chains that have just yet to get back online you know I worry deeply that with the growing debt that we have and I worry about the fact that we are no longer energy independent and we are relying on severely Bad actors and certainly here in the short term for for our needs I'm worried that that no matter what trade deal that we work out we're going to be we're going to be behind the curve on that so I think it's incumbent upon Congress to make sure that we put the policies in place that make America the most competitive place in the world to do business once we do that then we need to have the robust trade agreements in place um and and many of the things that we've talked about on both sides of the aisle here are very important in that um as we look at an agreement with Taiwan Mr first question to you um China's there is taiwan's largest trading partner with about 100 billion dollars worth of trade what are the things there that we that we as Americans should look to be competitive in and take market share away from China and bring it here to the U.S what give me a give me a couple of uh sectors real quickly that we should be competing in there where are the opportunities for Americans I know we I know AG is a big one I'm gonna get to that in a second but what are other opportunities there for for American Business and companies so um thank you Congressman for the question just to make sure I'm answering correctly where should we be looking to displace Chinese Imports in the Taiwanese Market yeah so let me touch on and I think it's not just about the exports it's also about displacing right Taiwanese firms choosing to invest their capital in the United States as opposed to Mainland China um I I'd highlight three for you obviously high tech on semiconductors um and the electronic supply chain in the manufacturing that's there on renewable Technologies which I alluded to earlier which is very important also in your state in terms of batteries and the rest of the renewable Technologies and then the last I would say is um biotech Pharmaceuticals and so forth Taiwanese Farms are looking to the mainland we are extremely competitive in that area these are all areas we can be working on and these are high high wage growth areas that support America on the biotech would you agree that when we do a trade agreement with Tom Juan that the intellectual property Protections in the and those be incredibly strong for the U.S absolutely and there should never be an opportunity to erode that and give that away to uh to to other countries absolutely and as I highlighted my written testimony not just the laws themselves but enforcement and specifically increasing criminal enforcement against economic Espionage all right thank you Mr Wu uh Mr Bowden um you know you've talked about how the the anemic trade environment that we find ourselves in has put American farmers behind because we're losing market share to producers in other parts of the world how important it is not just with time one but around the world that we become incredibly active in in trade negotiations and start taking market share and grow in our markets thank you for the question congressman and I mentioned that a little bit in my in my opening statement it's critically important for American agriculture I mentioned that you know depending on the year when 30 percent of net farm income in this country relies on exports that pretty much tells you the story and you know and you know through technology through through a lot of things our American farmers have become extremely productive and uh exports are just important everywhere we we look at the world as our customer that's the way we look at it and we look forward to working with the trading agreements all across the world Mr chairman of yield back

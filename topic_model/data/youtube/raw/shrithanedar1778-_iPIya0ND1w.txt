well my name is Sri Canada I'm an entrepreneur I'm here at take down in downtown Detroit announcing my candidacy for the governor of Michigan I am so pleased to have my family and my friends here and their support for this campaign as we begin this journey to improve the quality of life for all Michiganders let me briefly introduce myself first and foremost I am a scientist a scientist is someone that looks at the data and facts and information and puts it all together to find solutions to tough problems scientists are bold and innovative I am also an entrepreneur who has started and grown businesses so it is especially exciting to make today's announcement here at Tech town where business ownership is promoted and new Michigan businesses are born and grown I want to specifically thank take down CEO Annette and Vice President Greg two of the leaders at tech town for the use of this venue for today's announcement takedown is one of Michigan's success stories and something for Detroit and our whole state to be proud of unfortunately there is another side of Michigan that is not succeeding for the last six years the Republicans in the State House have had complete one party control of Michigan's government and here is their record higher taxes on pensions for retired people while giving tax breaks to the rich a so-called right-to-work bill that destroyed rights of working people backroom deals with billion-dollar corporations who have no loyalty to Michigan a government with questionable ethics and almost no transparency failing roads failing bridges and an infrastructure that's not ready for the 21st century we have seen cities starved for funds we've seen cities run by outside emergency managers and we have seen the poisoning of thousands of children and adults in Flint we have seen an education system that is 27th in the nation and dead last in proficiency growth since 2013 all under the leadership of a governor that Fortune magazine a business publication mind you cause one of the world's most disappointing leader I'm here today to say that enough is enough Michigan cannot afford another four years of nihilism cold-hearted government by spreadsheets designed to benefit only the top we must end corporate welfare as we have seen in Michigan and we must invest in human capital to make people's life better I am ready to fight for a better future for the people of Michigan I am ready to deliver a stronger Michigan and a smarter Michigan and today I am pleased and I am proud to announce my candidacy for the governor of the state of Michigan [Applause] Thanks thank you over the last two months I have had the chance to listen to people in Michigan and talk about ideas I have enjoyed the open dialogue and look forward to more such discussions based on these conversations and my principles here is a summary of our plan to improve the quality of life for all Michiganders if you work hard you deserve to live with dignity and that starts with a $15 minimum wage indexed to inflation Michiganders need vocational and trade skills for the 21st century job our education system must be able to Train Michiganders for their first job and for their next job we will reform k12 public education make college and post high school preschool education affordable and make sure corporations do not profit from public education regardless what Washington Republicans do every Michigander must have affordable health care we will rebuild Michigan's infrastructures the roads the bridges and the waterways will ensure we have clean air and clean water and that they are Michigan's fundamental rights and Michigan will continue to be committed to addressing climate change equality and fairness for all woman's right to choose marriage equality the elimination of bigotry and discrimination the right to Collective Bargaining and the repeal of right-to-work all of this will be non-negotiable in my administration America gave me a chance to succeed and Michigan nurtured my American Dream my success has given me the freedom and the obligation to give back to those around me from my employees to my community to my state I grew up in southern India in a poor family I worked multiple jobs during high school and college to support my education and help support my family pull out of poverty I moved to the United States in 1979 and I have been a proud United States citizen for nearly 30 years my first job in the United States was in Ann Arbor at the University of Michigan it was in Ann Arbor that I took the first steps in my American Dream from 1990 to 2008 I started and grew a business that created 450 new jobs we were successful but as in all of our lives along with success there was sorrow and adversity in 1996 I suffered the ultimate and untimely death of my first wife my two boys were four and eight years old I raised them as a single parent while running a growing business it is my greatest pride to see the lies they are making today both Neil and Samir are graduates of the University of Michigan and both are pursuing their own entrepreneurial dreams Thank You Samira like so many Michiganders I took a hard punch from the Great Recession like many Michigan businesses mine suffered a severe drown turn in the recession my business was taken by the bank and like many Michigan homes during the recession my home was foreclosed in the end the bank got paid in full but I had to start over again in 2010 at the age of 55 I packed all of my belongings in a Budget rental truck and returned to Michigan and restarted my business from scratch in Ann Arbor creating nearly 50 high-paying jobs last year after I won the unstained Young Entrepreneur of the Year award my wife and I agreed we have done well for our family but it is time now to try to help others in my state achieve their American Dream within months I sold my business and gave my staff 1.5 million dollar bonus and decided to devote rest of my life to public service now Rick Snyder's campaign as a businessman I am a different kind of businessman than Schneider or Donald Trump I built small business from ground up rather than being handed billion-dollar corporations I created jobs in America in Michigan and I did not outsource a single job to foreign countries I do not believe what the Republicans always say that you should run government like a business government is not a business I don't believe that you can govern by spreadsheets and we all know that thinking like that leads to disasters like Flint today those in Lansing tell us that giving taxpayers money to big corporations will magically improve the lives of ordinary Michiganders now we know that that doesn't work we will end non-productive corporate welfare and invest in human capital creating jobs supporting small businesses and creating a culture of startups that is second to none as governor I will make sure that tax incentives are only provided in exchange for permanent job growth if the jobs don't happen or don't last the tax breaks end and no more sweetheart deals to corporations who don't deliver to Michigan Michiganders are fed up with political bickering and grandstanding and a government that serves the few and ignores the meaning as governor I will deliver common-sense pragmatic solutions that make people's life better I will work for the people of Michigan and not for the billionaire emily's or the corporate lobbyists I will dismantle the pay-for-play culture in Lansing that exists today I will propose a tough new sets of ethic standards for the government and lawmakers and increase transparency in political donations and corporate lobbying there will be no lobbying from retired lawmakers for a minimum of five years we will end the corruption the fraud and the wastage and remove the influence of dark money in our politics and our government during my childhood I faced dire poverty many nights I went to bed hungry to the thousands of Michiganders living at or below poverty I say I have lived your struggles and I have felt your pain and I promise you that we will create jobs and create opportunities and work to improve your lives we will raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and tie it to inflation so that working families can live with dignity good education helped me get out of poverty to the parents who are worried about the quality of k-12 education and the fear of closing of public schools I promise that we will do what is needed to make Michigan schools the envy of the nation again we will remove the hurdles and the red tape and provide competitive wages and incentives to attract and retain good teachers and we will restore a culture that honors public school teachers will work on providing affordable high school education and ensure anyone wishing to pursue college education can do so and doesn't come out of school burdened with a debt to the young people who have dreams and goals and aspirations to reach for the stars I know sometimes it looks as though there is no light at the end of the tunnel I know that empty feeling I have felt that frustration I have been in your shoes and I promise that our state will offer you incentives and training and incubators like this and counseling so you too can achieve your American Dream to the hard-working Michiganders who are afraid that automation advances in mobility and technological innovations will make your job obsolete we will we will afford training to retool and retrain you to prepare you for high paying opportunities of the future I promise you that we will do everything possible to ensure that you maintain the quality of your life to those concern about attacks on health care coverage let me be clear I surely condemn the cruel and heartless Republican health care bill that ataxic and older Michiganders just to give a tax break to the wealthy I promise I will do whatever it takes to make sure that more Michiganders will be covered under a comprehensive health plan as I believe a healthy Michigan is a stronger Michigan to those in the grips of prescription drugs and here addiction and their families and communities I promise we will devote resources to treatment and rehab we must address addiction more as a public health issue rather than a law enforcement issue to those who are singled out because your religion or your race or your social status or who you love I know that feeling to be looked at as different I know what it feels being told you don't belong here I will stand proudly with you the immigrants the LGBTQ community and the minority community and I will stand strongly to fight bigotry and discrimination together we'll fight for workers rights civil rights the right to equal pay for equal work and women's right to choose Michigan is all office today we set out on the long road to reclaim Michigan's greatness today we ask and answer the questions do we choose the small-minded Michigan of brick Snyder do we choose the small-minded Michigan of crony capitalism potholes and for-profit schools do we choose the Michigan who poison her people to save a few bucks or do we choose a big Michigan a great Michigan and are we ready to reclaim the state that we love ladies and gentlemen if you believe in a stronger Michigan creating high-paying jobs a thriving education system and an infrastructure that supports growth and prosperity please join our movement if you believe we can come together for a smarter measure that finds win-win common-sense pragmatic solutions to its problems then please join our movement I am confident together we will deliver a stronger and a smarter and a healthier and an inclusive Michigan that all of us will be proud of thank you god bless the United States of America god bless the great state of Michigan and [Applause] how do you feel your campaign will stand up against some of these lifelong politicians that are coming into the race now for the governor for the state of Michigan well I present a different viewpoint I come in with a out of the box outside of Lansing thinking of bringing people together putting them across the table the experts all of the stakeholders and solving problems I'm a very pragmatic person that is want to bring win-win solutions and make Michigan's life better well a lot of we hear a lot of good talk and I we hear a lot of policies from many of the candidates my concern is once we get in the Lansing can we work because almost certainly we are going to I will inherit a Republican Senate and possibly a Republican House so it is important to get things done and not grant stranding and not making passionate speeches we have to go beyond the speeches and the grandstanding we need to achieve results and that's what I intend to do I intend to solve the problems I'm a problem solver all my life I have been motivated to solve problems and that's what I bring to Lansing well first of all we have have the Republican control complete control of Lansing for last six years and we need to start with sending one Democrat one we need to cover the governor governor's office and I will give and take and I will negotiate and I will compromise I'll work with them as long as they win 75% of my issues I will be happy we'll see obviously I'm not going to show my cards today at this time but I will work I think as long as we all have the best for Michiganders at our heart we will come together and we'll solve problems and I will use my position as a governor to shift the pendulum all the way to the right that we have now to move it in the middle and I want to make lives better for ordinary Michiganders and move this focus from big corporations and let's take care of the our people and let's have an inclusive Michigan we have a question here you said you wanted to take dark money out of politics that kind of wondering what your plans are what specific reforms you think would would go in that direction well we'll talk about that but we need transparency in how we govern many times we have PACs and super PACs that have money that we don't know where it's coming from and we need to know that we need to know I'm not against free speech that's fine but we need to know who is donating this money who is behind these policies and this advertisements that we see so I would like to see transparency and complete openness about donations hi I saw an interview where you openly acknowledge that maybe you don't look like other candidates you don't sound like other candidates in a traditional sense you think that's going to be a hindrance at all and how do you plan to address that you right I look different I sound different and but you know I believe 810 years ago there was a skinny young black man who just had a couple years of experience working in the Senate and America got over their prejudices because his ideas were something that thrilled us and we got excited about him and if I can have Michiganders look at my ideas look at my platform look at the issues that I care about look at my track record of fixing problems taking care of things I think my looks would not be an issue and my accent would not be an issue I'm confident [Music] what we intend to run a statewide campaign we intend to run a very state-of-the-art campaign we don't want to take any geographically for granted we don't want to take any community for granted we want to reach out to all of Michigan we want people to join our movement we are looking for staff we are looking for volunteers and we are looking for donations because we are going to go out and try to collect as many funds as we can to run the best campaign anyone can done [Music]

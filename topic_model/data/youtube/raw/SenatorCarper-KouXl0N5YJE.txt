madam president senator from delaware thanks uh thanks mr president i i stand and stand in solidarity with my friend from kansas uh to say to senator umar thank you for uh your great leadership and for allowing me to be your wingman as we do our best not just to save the the postal office for the postal service but to make sure that they are robust and uh germaine to the the futures that germaine to the future of our an integral to the future of our countries they have been for the last 200-plus years uh when uh folks in delaware gather we had about 25 men who gathered in a place called dover delaware on december 7 1787 and we voted after negotiating for three days just baiting for three days a draft constitution we adopted it unanimously and sent it off to the other 12 colonies and one element in the uh the constitution that was sent to us from philadelphia by our founding fathers was the creation of a postal service a postal service and it's been mentioned before that the first postmaster general was ben franklin of all people and what the founding fathers had in mind was a way to bind us together as a country to bind us together as a country the idea of being able to communicate through the mail that was important the idea of being fostering a better better uh greater economic growth that was important but they also were looking for a way to pull us together as a new nation and the postal service was integral to the uh to doing that for uh over the years the postal services has changed and for the most part i think it's changed in good ways it used to be people got through mail by going to post offices or maybe in the community where they lived or close to the community where they lived but they had to go to the post office to get it eventually the mail was delivered to farms and to homes and to businesses across the the country and people didn't have to leave their homes to to get the the mail there was a time not that long ago when we didn't have the internet and uh if we wanted to communicate we wanted to send letters to people or cards to people a lot of gifts to people we would uh use the postal service today we can use the the internet the internet uh taketh and for the postal service take within and give us away a lot of folks so who just hit a button a send button for a birthday card or christmas card or any kind of holiday card they they used to send the actual cards a lot of people don't do that anymore if you look at the financial condition of postal service what's one of the things that's happened most noticeably in the last 10 15 20 years is a drop in first-class mail and a large part of that is from the internet i like to say again the internet takes us but and deal with the way but one of the great things that comes out of the internet is that people a lot of people are ordering items over the internet for purchase a lot of people order food but a lot of people order clothes they'll order shoes they order all kinds of things and uh you know who has a chance to deliver the postal service the postal service delivers not just one day a week but seven days a week they are omnipresent and as we hear johnny cash and every time i turn on my tv i hear johnny cash singing i've been everywhere man and the postal service still goes everywhere man and they also have a great partnership with believe it or not ups and a great partnership with fedex fedex and ups they don't want to go to every mailbox in the country every day the postal service does it at least six days a week and what the postal service does in a partnership with ups and fedex is take a handoff and deliver the last mile as five miles less ten miles to the places that they're gonna postal service is gonna go to uh anyway i think one of the challenges that the postal service has had to try to balance their their their books their finances comes and i remember when i was was governor of delaware going to the rating agencies and the rating agencies said to us before they lowered a credit rating a long time ago they they said you don't have a pension fund you haven't funded your pension costs for for your uh pensioners and uh so we create a pension fund fully funded them and after we've done that uh later on we finally kind of got a triple a credit rating years later and one of the things he said you still haven't fully offset the cost of healthcare costs for for your your pensioners we we for us that was a concern but not an enormous concern because our pensioners had access they were covered under medicare unfortunately for the postal service post services paid into medicare for years for their employees unfortunately when those those retirees reach the age of 65 they don't have full access to the full benefits of medicare that is not right these are benefits paid for by the employer of the postal service and this legislation fixes that to make sure that the the the the right thing is done there might be the benefits have been paid for through medicare or actually in order to flow to the uh the the pensioners and uh of the of the postal service the other thing that uh that i would would mention is uh um 6a service uh i just uh i used to see a good service by the postal service would be maybe one day service for local uh maybe in the same city two-day service maybe to in other parts of the state three-day service coast-to-coast and the legislation was before us today calls for delivery within six days uh for for me that's not a uh that's not uh that's not good enough and my hope is we can come back and and uh somehow better uh replace or better response store the term service having said that the postal service has a board of governors and every now and then presidents have the opportunity to nominate people to serve on the board of governors we have the opportunity to vote them up or down we need people as on board for governors who are very good at figuring out how do we how do we help the postal service monetize the burden of going to every single mailbox in the country six days a week how do we do that how do we help the postal service turn that into financial opportunity much as they have with ups and and fedex and other other ways as well delivering medicines is a great example there and there are other examples vote by mail and i think we're only scratching the service on vote by mail those are all ideas that help the postal service monetize to realize revenues from this uh this responsibility to go to every uh mailbox in the country one last thing i'd mention that's not in this in this legislation is uh postal vehicles postal vehicles there are a bunch of them uh well over i think well over 150 000 across the country almost everyone is gas and diesel driven you've seen from others ups fedex amazon others with big fleets are transitioning away from the gas and diesel and they're doing it rather rather quickly we're seeing the same kind of transformation in the vehicles that we drive why is it important because uh we have way way way too much carbon and dioxide in the air it's creating climates uh not just climate change it's claimed creating a climate crisis my state is we're the lowest lying state in the country my state is uh sinking the seas around us arising down to louisiana every 100 minutes they lose a piece of land to the ocean the size of a football field every 100 minutes if you go out on the west coast you have wildfires this year last year bigger than my state temperatures in the arctic circle reached i think last year at 90 degrees 90 degrees more named hurricanes in the last year than any year in the history hottest summers on re on record something's going on here and what it is is way too much carbon in the air a lot of that carbon is coming from mobile sources including the vehicles we drive including the fleets like the postal fleet the postal service's fleet is about 25 years old on average they have the opportunity here to update that the cost of moving to electric vehicles having charging stations is a charge as a cost that the postal service is i think with some legitimacy that we as a taxpayers need to help uh help to underwrite that that cost having said that the postal service and their calculation for buying gas and diesel powered vehicles to replace their fleet i believe my understanding is they're using as an assumption for the cost of gas and diesel fleet uh two dollars a gallon uh charge for gas and diesel going forward two dollars i would like to see two dollars wouldn't we and that is just basically over understating by half the cost of gas and diesel for a future fleet and that needs to be fixed we have a great opportunity to to make sure that the postal service is not just delivering the mail rainstow or shine but also doing so in a way that helps us on climate crisis side we can do both and we need to do both i'll close by saying this i want to thank and uh and applaud the the leadership of our chair and ranking member of the committee of jurisdiction here uh from our chair gary peters our ranking member uh rob portman thank you and your staffs for your work on this and for a lot of other folks that have worked on this before most certainly jerry moran and his and his team i especially want to say to members of my staff who've worked on these issues forever and my friend susan collins not on the floor right now or senator from uh from for maine but she has spent god knows plenty of time and effort working with me and others on on these issues and i uh this is not the end this is not the end in terms of what we need to do on on postal this is not the maybe the beginning of the end this is the end of the beginning but it's a good end to the beginning and uh we need to build on this and go forward on this and i hope and pray that that's exactly what we do i thank you back

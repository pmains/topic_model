hearing from Peter Baker that John Bolton has texted him as well saying that he offered to resign and resigned today so that version is differing very much from the firing version that comes from the president where does this leave the troops having served in Iraq and knowing the troops in Afghanistan as a member of Armed Services how does this make people in the troop on the front lines feel when they see such disarray in Washington well they're going to feel stranded and riyo they're there they're doing their job we've asked them to step up to leave their families behind to go into harm's way and defend America and yet the very top leadership from the commander in chief to his closest advisors can't seem to get their act together and can't seem to come up with a cohesive approach to what we're doing in the Middle East whether it's Iraq or or Afghanistan or Syria um this is a real problem you know how troops are in harm's way right now and the we expect them to get up and do their jobs and yet we don't have a president or a national security adviser who are willing to do their jobs

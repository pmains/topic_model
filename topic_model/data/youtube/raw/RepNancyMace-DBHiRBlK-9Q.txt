south carolina republican congresswoman nancy mace joins us now she's a member of the veterans affairs committee uh the taliban is surging in afghanistan as the u.s continues this withdrawal congresswoman and what we are expected to hear from president biden bottom of this hour as he speaks from the white house is a diplomatic solution he is expected to pitch how do you see this going so far and what is your criticism of the white house with this withdrawal well i actually want to praise the administration for the withdrawal of troops in afghanistan this is a was a policy that also former president trump supported um i come from a family of veterans i have i have family that are serving today that get deployed frequently one of the things that that is i think a forgotten fact and figure in the within the troop withdrawal is that we have the department of defense has over 16 000 contractors still in afghanistan and they'll remain there six 6134 of those are american citizens and that's more than double of the number of remaining troops that are in afghanistan today so we're not going to have a completely uh blank footprint over there those those individuals those defense contractors are training training afghanistan law enforcement and soldiers to protect themselves and their country as well the criticism from your party i should say is the vacuum that this leaves and the surge of the taliban what happens next and what ultimately we see happen um as that environment is replaced john kirby speaking from the pentagon suggested that this is not us turning our back on on that region listen to this we're going to continue to assist the competency and the capability of afghan forces going forward after the drawdown it will include some financial support some logistical support some technical support some aviation support to include the provision addition to their aviation fleet of helicopters and aircraft so we're not turning our back on our afghan partners so what do you expect to hear from the bite administration when the president speaks bottom of the hour then well i do believe that will be the message coming out of president biden that we're not turning a blind eye to this we've had our men and women in uniform they have served valiantly almost 20 years to avenge the deaths of over 3 000 people and literally crush al qaeda and one of the things that i don't want to be lost in all this by anyone on either side of the aisle right now is that we have over 16 000 department of defense contractors over there that are still working and training afghan soldiers and law enforcement and police so we're not totally out of out of the woods out of there but our soldiers need to come home it's time we have men and women that are serving in afghanistan that weren't even born when 9 11 happened and i want to ask the american people today is how many lives more do we have to lose on foreign soil in afghanistan we've done a remarkable job over there and we'll continue to do so fair enough as we mentioned top of the hour we come to you as a mother of two when we look at what is happening in our nation's schools critical race theory obviously as a congresswoman as well i'll ask you about this statement by randy weingarten uh head of the second largest teachers union in this country and her criticisms of the gop listen there are legislators mostly from the republican party who are currently bullying teachers and trying to stop us from teaching kids honest history look maybe they're just trying to raise the temperature on race relations because of the next election is your party bullying teachers over this theory being taught in our schools well the last time i checked bullying would be literally arresting a parent at a school board hearing who was exercising their first amendment right and it was on fox news earlier this week where i heard about the father of a student in virginia who was arrested for speaking out against critical race theory and i myself as a republican have been a victim of political violence my house was just graffitied four weeks ago and so we're seeing divisions on both sides the aisle we're seeing political violence ratchet up and to point fingers and to continue to to label the left or the right that way is just wrong we've got to take responsibility and be accountable to parents particularly on a marxist ideology that's being shoved down the throats of american children teaching them that they are inherently racist and that's wrong it seems some parents feel and you listen to some of these uh boardrooms across the country it seems that some parents feel they're being removed from the equation that it doesn't matter what they think that it doesn't matter if if they're critical of this being taught in our schools that this ultimately is a decision by the teachers unions right but but teachers teachers unions and school boards ought to be held accountable to parents that's the whole purpose of it i remember just a few years ago my kids were in elementary school at the time and they had a government assignment and they told me that socialism was better than democracy and communism i literally had to pull over the car on the side of the road get off the exit and have him explain it to me and then push back on them and say you know that's that's not true let's talk about your five dollar allowance a week socialism i get four of it i get to keep four of it and the one dollar you get i get to tell you how to spend it and they they quickly change their mind after that and i asked myself at that time what are we teaching our children these days that's remarkable that's remarkable um and it sounds like you nip that one in the bud with your own children they're fiscally conservative now interesting interesting when it comes to their own dollars how you can really make them listen right congresswoman thank you for your time appreciate it

hi I'm congressman Tim Ryan from Ohio and want to say congratulations on the 50th anniversary of the National Endowment for the Arts in today's society in so many different ways the Arts I think are essential I don't think there any longer the soft kind of approach to education I think it's an essential approach to education and we see that that the average student who has had and participated in the arts for four years has seen a hundred and two point increase in there sa t scores so if we want to improve education we have to provide access to quality arts education and the National Endowment for the Arts has been doing this in all 50 states for 50 years and I want to say congratulations and I also want to make note that every taxpayer should know that only 46 cents is the cost for each taxpayer to help support the National Endowment for the Arts and that for every dollar that is spent from the National Endowment is matched by seven dollars and other public money or private money and it is this catalyzing effect that the National Endowment for the Arts has had for 50 years and at a time where we see a lot of shenanigans and our political discourse I think it's time for us to understand that we need a deeper appreciation for the beauty of our own lives and the opportunities that we have here and the endowment does that has done it and as far as I'm concerned we're going to fight very hard that it will be able to continue to do this for the next 50 years and beyond and as we're trying to create a new economy we're trying to create new industries and learn how to solve problems creatively again the arts are essential to that thinking process so thank you for 50 great years and we'll be here to support you for 50 great more years thank you

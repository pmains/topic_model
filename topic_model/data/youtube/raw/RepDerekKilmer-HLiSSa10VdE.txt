thank you mr chairman thank you both for being here um my first question is to secretary kendall you know before we get uh acquisition professionals to make smart decisions we need to provide them with the means to execute acquisition programs and under better buying power 2.0 advocated for the achievement of affordable programs and implementation of a system of investment planning with that in mind i'm interested in understanding your thoughts on how the department will plan to fully support the ohio replacement program and the scn budget as a whole this committee offered the national strategic deterrence fund as a solution as i'm sure you know the most recent 30-year shipbuilding plan says that the navy cannot afford to do it all in the spirit of acquisition reform i was hoping you could speak a bit about how we can best protect the investment in our undersea nuclear deterrent uh and in other shipbuilding programs we have a affordability issue as we enter the 2020s in general the ohio replacement's a big part of that it's not the only piece of it the strategic deterrent across the board the bomber icbm and the and the ssbn are all uh need to be replaced in about the same time frame uh that's not the only place in the budget where we have a problem like this what we've been trying to do under better buying power is discipline our programmers and service leadership really to look long-term at the life cycle of their products that they're trying to buy to so that we avoid starting things that we can't afford in the future we've had reasonable success with that but that doesn't get us out of the problem of all those things that we need to buy out in the 2020-ish time frame i don't know how we're going to solve that problem but we're going to have to solve it somehow if we're going to have the force structure that we need i also want to uh ask a bit about um the subject that that mr smith uh mentioned a commercial uh kind of off-the-shelf solutions um there was a featured story in government executive uh this week called uh daring deal and the focus was on how the ic is uh leveraging a leading commercial cloud provider in this case it was amazon to build a community cloud for the intelligence community community based on the utility model we also know that the navy is already utilizing commercial cloud to move uh level one and two uh workloads uh to a commercial solution uh civilian agencies like hhs are are are even moving um sensitive but unclassified workloads to commercial cloud but up to this point the defense department's been been lagging in that category particularly for levels three through five data could you talk to the committee about how the dod as part of the overall defense acquisition reform effort is going to better leverage commercial cloud technologies both in the short and the long term uh and also can you speak to the pentagon's plan to use commercial service providers to build a community cloud for for classified data i'm gonna have to take that for the record but um in our our major what i would call it infrastructure projects i'm thinking right now the navy's next generation for example um we're using essentially commercial products now whether we're using a commercial cloud which merges defense data with non-defense data in a storage facility for example which is really what we're talking about i think here i don't know the answer that question or how much that solution implemented that we do have obviously privacy issues we have security issues we have to ensure are enforced so if a commercial cloud can meet those requirements and i and there are economic advantages to it i don't think i would have any objection going that way but i'm going to take for the record where we are in terms of exploring that and implementing it with the timeout permitting uh secretary barna professional education is is obviously an important aspect of preparing our acquisition workforce both in terms of their ability to develop realistic requirements and you know and buy what we need i think one of the values of better buying the better buying power initiative is that it asks acquisition professionals to think um you know to what extent does the defense acquisition university use case studies to educate students on best practices and lessons learned and the rationale behind the curriculum and how are we empowering our acquisition professionals to make good decisions concern if i could take that one we do use case studies extensively at the defense equilibrium university and i encourage the new president to use them more i think my business school turned kind of wasn't good didn't go to harvard but i kind of followed the harvard model i think case studies are a great learning tool they do help people with critical thinking uh they teach principles at the same time but they force people to confront problems and address them and we have no shortage of case studies historically the defense department that we can use to help help our learning process thank you thank you i yield back

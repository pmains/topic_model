south carolina congresswoman nancy mace congresswoman pleasure to have you back on the show nice to see you pleasure to see you and thank you for having me on again yeah it's our pleasure um so first of all the list was just updated right now as many as possibly 12 members have been fined and uh from what i'm hearing it's basically it starts with a 500 fine that's taken right out of your paycheck after that it's 2500 bucks i mean pretty significant so you haven't been fined for not wearing a mask on the floor right i have not i've got to save every can every dollar that i possibly can uh the fines are very expensive the magnetometer if you don't go through the magnetometer even it's like a five thousand dollar fine what nancy pelosi is doing and we've been told to follow the science but the science doesn't agree with nancy pelosi and she's in charge she's in control even though 75 of all members have been vaccinated and even the senate is unmasked yeah by the way talk about that hypocrisy because i don't think the people at home get that so basically if you walk onto the house floor you've got to wear a mask but if you walk onto the senate floor and not every u.s senator is vaccinated the number's in the 90s but it's not everyone is vaccinated many have had the coronavirus and have immunity they do not have to wear a mask and they don't have to wear a mask in committee meetings either i mean that's which is totally ridiculous right and especially when you look at the science even if you're unvaccinated if you're outside for instance there's a less than one percent chance of transmitting covid19 and then beyond that in our hearing committee rooms we are several feet apart from each other still messed up and we've got to lead our country through a crisis i just flew back to my hometown in south carolina nobody's wearing a mask we're vaccinated we're acting like normal human beings and trying to move our country forward and i wish nancy pelosi would as well what do you think nancy pelosi's problem is here do you think the democrats i mean they were following the science according to them for the last 15 months but all of a sudden the cdc and the president give them cover and they're not comfortable with lifting these mandates what's going on here why is that i think it's about power and control and even you hear dr fauci every time he gets on you can't believe him half the time because he's not telling the truth and he's not following the science and giving bad advice and look what the look what they've done to our children forcing them out of schools for a year they've lost an entire year thankfully places like south carolina we've our governor henry mcmasters has allowed parents to make that decision for their kids as opposed to the labor unions and others forcing something that's unconstitutional on us and our families you know i know that you're a freshman member but it it must be fascinating to see the way that congress works uh the fact that that congress and the senate largely are divided on an issue as simple as this this issue should be so basic the fact that everyone's divided on this issue what does that tell the american people about where we are politically as a country well it's going to be hard to come together i mean we have we have these extremes on both sides they're unwilling to work together this should be very simple and instead the left they're following socialism yesterday the squad held up a vote there they've got power over nancy pelosi who had a very simple vote um yesterday over militarizing the capital which was a partisan vote none of us want to do that but they held it up over their hatred of israel and that's what they're dealing with and joe biden as a president has done more damage in the first hundred days than i thought possible in four years and we've got to support conservatives in the next 18 months so we get back the majority in the house that is the best way that we can turn this country around we'll be in 2022. i'm with you congresswoman uh nice to have you back on the show it was nice meeting you in florida a few weeks ago look forward to uh to seeing you again anytime

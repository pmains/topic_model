five minutes mr. speaker as an obstetrician I delivered thousands of babies and helped mom's through pregnancies for 25 years I stand before the House today disgusted by the murderous barbarous legislation pushed by Democrats in New York legalizing abortions for any reason all the way until the due date of the baby this extremist anti life abortion major is literally nauseating to me how sad it is that we live in a time when extremists are legalizing this the murder of innocent defenseless children the legalization of these late term procedures that amount to infanticide are the worst thing I've heard in my entire lifetime I call in my obstetricians and other physicians who deliver babies I call in the American College of Obstetricians I and ecologists and all physician associations to openly denounced and refuse these murderous procedures legal or not this is morally reprehensible as a father a grandfather a physician as a human being that loves people I cannot sit here in good conscience while this is going on regardless of it being on a state level I'll do everything in my power to combat this position from spreading and protect these innocent children I yield back

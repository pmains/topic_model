  MR. DEUTCH: THANK YOU. MR. SPEAKER, TODAY SHOULD NOT  BE ABOUT POLITICS. I DIDN'T RISE TO BE POLITICAL. THIS IS PERSONAL.  A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS INVITED  TO SPEAK AT THE U.N. GENERAL   ASSEMBLY SPECIAL SESSION ON  ANTI-SEMITISM. I TOLD THE REPRESENTATIVES FROM  THE ASSEMBLED COUNTRIES THAT   ANTI-SEMITISM IS THE CANARY IN   THE COAL MINE, IF THERE IS   ANTI-SEMITISM IN YOUR COUNTRY,   THERE IS HATRED THAT WILL  ULTIMATELY PERMEATE THROUGHOUT   SOCIETY IF IT IS NOT CHECKED.  I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD NEED TO  EXPLAIN THAT TO MY COLLEAGUES. THIS IS NOT POLITICAL. NO ONE SHOULD MAKE IT  POLITICAL. THE USE OF ANTI-SEMITIC  LANGUAGE AND IMAGES CAN NEVER  BE TOLERATED.  WHEN A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN   RUNS A COMMERCIAL ALLEGING A   JEWISH LOCAL CONSPIRACY IN AN  AD FEATURING GEORGE SOROS,   JANET YELLEN, IT IS INVOKING   CLASSIC ANTI-SEMITIC TROOPS AND  IT MUST BE CONDEMNED.  WHEN THEY FEATURE A JEWISH STAR  AND PILES OF MONEY, IT DOES THE  SAME THING AND IT MUST BE  CONDEMNED. AND WHEN ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES   ACCUSES SOROS, BLOOMBERG BUYING  THE ELECTION, IT ALSO INVOKES  CLASSIC ANTI-SEMITISM. THAT MUST BE CONDEMNED.  WHEN ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES   INVOKES THE CLASSIC  ANTI-SEMITIC LANGUAGE THAT JEWS  CONTROL THE WORLD, JEWS CARE   ONLY ABOUT MONEY, JEWS CANNOT  BE LOYAL AMERICANS IF THEY   SUPPORT ISRAEL, THIS, TOO, MUST  BE CONDEMNED.  WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO   CONDEMN ALL OF THAT, BY ALL OF   THEM, INTOLERABLE AS IT ALL IS   BY PASSING A STRONG  CONDEMNATION OF ANTI-SEMITISM. MY COLLEAGUES, BECAUSE OF  ANTI-SEMITISM OVER MILLENNIA,  MILLIONS OF JEWS HAVE BEEN   HATED, TARGETED, EXPELED FROM  THEIR COUNTRIES, VIOLENTLY   ATTACKED, KILLED, AND  EXTERMINATED.  WORDS LEAD TO ACTION AND TO  DEATH. THERE IS TOO MUCH HATRED, TOO  MANY OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE  TARGETED, AND WE NEED TO   SUPPORT ALL OF THEM, BUT WE ARE  HAVING THIS DEBATE BECAUSE OF  THE LANGUAGE ONE OF OUR  COLLEAGUES, LANGUAGE THAT  SUGGESTS JEWS LIKE ME WHO SERVE  IN THE UNITED STATES IN  CONGRESS AND WHOSE FATHER  EARNED A PURPLE HEART FIGHTING   THE NAZIS IN THE BATTLE OF THE   BULGE, THAT WE ARE NOT LOYAL   AMERICANS? WHY ARE WE UNABLE TO SINGULARLY  CONDEMN ANTI-SEMITISM? WHY CAN'T WE CALL IT   ANTI-SEMITISM AND SHOW WE'VE   LEARNED THE LESSONS OF HISTORY?  IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE ONLY ABLE  TO CALL THE USE OF ANTI-SEMITIC  LANGUAGE BY A COLLEAGUE OF   OURS, ANY COLLEAGUE OF OURS IF   WE'RE ADDRESSING ALL FORMS OF  HATRED AND IT FEELS LIKE WE  CAN'T SAY IT'S ANTI-SEMITISM   UNLESS EVERYONE AGREES THAT  IT'S ANTI-SEMITISM.  WHO GETS TO DEFINE WHAT COUNTS   AS STEREOTYPES AND   DISCRIMINATION?  .  . THE PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCED THAT  HATRED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. IF JEWS WHOSE FAMILIES WERE  PERSECUTED, ATTACKED, OR KILLED, TALKED ABOUT ANTI-SEMITIC WORDS  CAN CAN LEAD TO THE MOST HATEFUL AND VIOLENT EXTREMES, THEN IT'S  ANTI-SEMITISM. TAKE MY WORD FOR IT, IF YOU  DON'T DO THAT, THEN PLEASE   UNDERSTAND THAT AN ANTI-SEMITE   WILL HEAR THOSE WORDS AS A DOG   WHISTLE. WHAT'S BEEN SO DIFFICULT FOR SO  MANY PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY IS   THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE FEARFUL WHEN ANTI-SEMITIC TROPES ARE USED ARE BEING TOLD THAT THEY ARE WRONG.  JEWISH ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE   SAYING THAT THIS HISTORY THAT WE KNOW WELL IS INVOKED BY  REFERENCING DUAL LOYALTY, SOME   OF MY COLLGUEAES ARE SAYING IT   DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THAT HISTORY MEANS TO ME. IT IS INTENTIONALLY PERSONAL   BECAUSE IT IS ONGOING. IN EUROPE, IN ASIA, IN THE   MIDDLE EAST, IN SOUTH AMERICA P, AND IN THE UNITED STATES --  AMERICA AMERICA, AND IN THE  UNITED STATES 11 PEOPLE WERE   KILLED LESS THAN SIX MONTHS AGO  IN A SYNAGOGUE BECAUSE THEY ARE  JEWS.  WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTRY  SHOULD ALARM US ALL. THE ATTACKS ON OUR COLLEAGUES  BECAUSE THEY ARE MUSLIM, OR  AFRICAN-AMERICAN, OR HISPANIC,   OR MEMBERS OF THE LGBT COMMUNITY ANY ATTACK MUST BE CONDEMNED   WHEN IT IS BASED ON HATRED . WHEN A COLLEAGUE INVOKES   ANTI-SEMITIC LIES THREE TIMES,   THIS BODY MUST CONDEMN THAT  ANTI-SEMITISM. ANTI-SEMITISM IS WORTHY OF BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY ON ITS OWN.  IT'S WORTHY OF BEING SIN   GUELARLY CALLED OUT. JEWS CONTROL THE WORLD?  JEWS CARE ONLY ABOUT MONEY?  JEWS HAVE DL UALOYALTY AND CAN'T BE PATRIOTIC MEMBERS OF THE  COUNTRY WHICH THEY LIVE? WORDS MATTER.  FOR GENERATIONS THEY HAVE HAD  DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCES FOR ME,   FOR MY FAMILY, AND FOR MY  PEOPLE.  THIS SHOULDN'T BE SO HARD. I YIELD BACK.  THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN YIELDS BACK. PURSUANT TO CLAUSE 12-A OF RULE  1, THE CHAIR DECLARES THE HOUS

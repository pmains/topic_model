thank you uh um chair and ranking member lee uh for allowing me to speak today on the berryessa snow mountain national monument expansion act i introduced this bill earlier this year along with my colleague senator feinstein to build on california's preservation of nature and protection of tribal interests our bill would expand the existing berryessa snow mountain national monument to include nearly 4 000 acres of sacred tribal lands that is already managed by the bureau of land management it would also improve our collaboration and engagement with tribal governments plural and frankly advance good faith partnerships to better manage and care for these sacred lands president obama established debary as a snow mountain national monument in 2015 at the time he highlighted the area's scenic landscapes rich biodiversity and important cultural and human history the national monument is jointly managed by the bureau of land management and the united states forest service and it provides for unparalleled outdoor recreation and diverse wildlife it also contains lands with cultural significance for over two dozen federally recognized tribes now these sacred lands within and around the monument are central to thousands of years of tribal origin stories and in recognition of this history our bill would expand the barriers to snow mountain national monument to include lands known as molec loyuk which means condor ridge in the patman language our bill would also require the blm and forest service to improve tribal engagement and co-management of the monument including historic preservation archaeological sites and forest health and i actually believe this type of cooperative stewardship could serve as a model for other regions where tribal nations seek to work with federal agencies to better care for sacred lands under federal ownership i believe it's our duty to protect the abundant natural resources and the rich history uh for today's children and for future generations and by requiring federal agencies to finally develop a management plan and by enabling and empowering tribal governments to participate in the management of the monument our bill will benefit both people and biodiversity look forward to welcoming secretary holland and deputy director culver on a future visit to the area to see the site and to meet with tribal nations and tribal leaders who are seeking this cooperative management a broad coalition of local and statewide organizations came together to help inform the drafting of this bill the yocha de he went to nation has led the charge to protect these sacred lands for all californians and i'm also thankful for the support of the lake county board of supervisors the california wilderness coalition the non-profit leomi backcountry anglers and hunters and many more and finally i want to recognize my colleagues in addition to senator feinstein introducing the legislation with me uh congress members john garamendi and mike thompson for spearheading the bill in the house so i want to thank you again for allowing me to testify today and look forward to working with you to move this bill through committee thank you

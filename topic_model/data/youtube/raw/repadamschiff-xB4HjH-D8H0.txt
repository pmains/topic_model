the ongoing Insurrection is where we begin this hour the member of the 16 select committee Congressman elect Adam Schiff do you think we will call you congressmanship again by this time tomorrow I certainly hope so um the business of the country needs to move forward I'm desperately concerned though with all of the concessions that McCarthy has made to these hardliners all with the object of giving him the title speaker without the powers to conduct that office and I'm afraid it's a harbinger of what we're going to see going from crisis to crisis we may risk a default on our national debt we may have prolonged government shutdowns this group can uh you know essentially hold Kevin McCarthy hostage at any time and so I'm worried what it means for the country's future that there is such disarray within the Republican party but you're exactly right Nicole Uh Kevin McCarthy is reaping what he sowed when he supported voting against certifying the last election when he resurrected Donald Trump when he uh really catered to this extreme element in the GOP you know and what's so um I I don't want to use a a word to connote anything positive but what's so vexing I guess about Kevin McCarthy is that on that day he saw Trump's role in the incitement of the inspection the same way I know Liz Cheney has the same way you have the same way I did and what seems to have done so much damage to the body and to democracy by extension is the contortion around it do you have a preference or do you have a view on whether or not he are you rooting for him to to continue to whip the vote do you have a position on who becomes the Republican leader and then the speaker you know I I would like it at the end of the day to be someone decent uh someone who has a core set of values uh and that shouldn't be too much to ask I think in Ken McCarthy's case that is too much to ask uh and so I hope it is someone else I think there are other people that the Republican Party could coalesce around that even though I would disagree strong with them on on uh issues uh at least they would be people that could be trusted um you know by their own members uh and and hopefully by democrats if they earn that trust but I don't think that's Kevin McCarthy um so I I'm one a former believer that we need at least two functional parties in the country we don't have that at the moment we have only one functional party but I would like to see the Republican Party return to its roots of a party of a conservative ideology frankly I'd be happy if it became a part of any ideology but right now it's led by these chaos agents and that just doesn't pretend but well for the next two years image of the country has been transmitted to sort of the streams of information and Intelligence being gobbled up by our adversaries this week what do they see as our ongoing vulnerabilities and weaknesses in our democracy well Nicole I can only imagine because one of the outcomes of this lack of a speakership lack of being sworn in as members can't go get classified briefings on exactly that but given what we've seen in the past given what we know of how foreign powers exploited our tragedy of January 6th how they pushed out those images how they used it how China for example used it to make the case that democracy doesn't work that it's brittle that it can't adapt to the times that the China model was somehow to be preferred child model is dictatorship it's totalitarianism that is not an alternative but the more that our adversaries can showcase American governmental dysfunction the harder it is for us to promote democracy abroad when we are exhibiting such shortcomings at home uh and you know it's been moving for all of us to be at the Capitol today on anniversary of January 6th it has reminded me of one of the very strong emotions I had that day which was in thinking about how the rest of the world was viewing America and our democracy and how much the very idea of our country was being lost and I felt that way again today and not just because it was the anniversary but because of what I was witnessing on the house floor on this anniversary we had a chance to speak to officer Harry Dunn who won the the civilian medal today from the president and he noted the amount of time it's taken for any accountability in our judicial system for Donald Trump and his inner circle now in in the days since the Insurrection a bipartisan commission was pitched it gained support it was then killed by Republican leaders and in its ashes rose up the January 6th select committee which was formed staffed initiated an investigation conducted an investigation televised public hearings wrote a report and has now been dismanted no longer exists why hasn't there been any action from the Department of Justice in the time that all of that was able to transpire in terms of holding Donald Trump in his inner circle legally criminally accountable it's an excellent question and I can really only speculate as to the answer because the justice department is going to is not going to tell Congress why it has been so so slow to act but I think while they move with alacrity um against those who broke into the building and assaulted police officers that day they were very slow to work against the ringleaders very slow to work against the multiple lines of effort that didn't involve uh you know explicitly the violence of that day but involved the president on the phone with the Secretary of State in Georgia basically demanding that he fined 11 780 votes that didn't exist and other lines of effort to overturn the election there's no reason why Congress should have finished its investigation before the justice department that can move so much more quickly that can enforce its subpoenas so much more easily than we can but I do think that the caution of the department isn't part of response to Bill Barr's terrible politicization of the department and a desire to avoid controversy and to move away from any suggestion that it was following that terrible model but taken to an extreme that caution becomes a form of immunity for the former president and his enablers and that to me is the far greater danger to our democracy at this point yes Prosecuting a former president is unprecedented but so were the crimes committed by this former president and not Prosecuting when the evidence supports it um is I think the far greater danger to the country the committee members for four of your former committee members are no longer in the body um congresswoman Elaine Laurie is one of them she just said that she's ready to be investigated you have triggered the Insurrection adjacent right for years since leading the first impeachment and that was a role reversal I'm old enough to remember a time in politics when Republicans sought your insights on foreign policy questions and National Security matters what are you preparing for um as Kevin McCarthy has just given away the keys to I don't know if we still call it a kingdom I guess we do out of reverence to the institution and they're gunning for you to investigate you yeah well uh you know I uh I know Kevin McCarthy one of his first concessions uh to the right was to promise to remove me from the intelligence committee uh they want to I think try to neuter any vigorous oversight of what they do any anyone who will stand up uh to Trump and to his enablers into Congress and outside the Congress but frankly I'm far more concerned uh not about what they do with my you know service on the intelligence committee but rather what they do in two years from now if we have another close election um the last one really wasn't that close but if it comes down to a single state next time um and it comes down to an interpretation of the Electoral account act or they succeed in getting a state legislature to certify a slate that lost in the state with a you know sort of unilateral and bogus Declaration of fraud that's what worries me that's what should worry all Americans uh you know I will be prepared for whatever they come after me with it can't be worse than what Donald Trump tried uh but but nonetheless the far greater concern is what they do to our institutions and what they do after the next election Congressman elect um I truly hope that next time we talk to you you are once again Congressman attitude thank you very much for starting us off on this truly historic day thank you very much sir thank you as members of Congress remembered

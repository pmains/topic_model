tomorrow a group of lawmakers will meet with a Yale psychiatrist to discuss president mental fitness one congressman has already proposed a bill to make it easier for Congress to invoke the 25th amendment and remove President Trump from office if he's found mentally unfit joining us now is that congressman Democrat Jamie Raskin of Maryland congressman thanks so much for being here good morning delighted to be here so this meeting tomorrow with the Yale psychiatrist who called for that and what prompted it well let's see I believe that dr. Lee is coming to visit a bunch of people in Washington she's been here before the bill that I've introduced HR 1987 I actually submitted back in April long before I'd met her or even before their book came out and so what prompted that I mean there's a couple of things that happened listen just like I just met in December with lawmakers I know you've spoken to her a couple of times you've proposed this bill what's prompting this well the 25th amendment in Section 4 says that the Vice President in the cabinet or the vice president in a body set up by Congress can determine that there's presidential incapacity for reasons physical or mental and I think that concerns have been raised from the very beginning of the presidency about the cognitive state of the president the emotional state of the president and his ability to take care that the laws are faithfully executed which is the principal job of the president United States and so I don't take a position on whether or not the president currently has capacity or incapacity but I'm taking the position that we've got a constitutional responsibility to act under the 25th amendment to set up the body that's been called for I see and so yours is more focused what you're calling for a Fifth Amendment is more focused on procedure than actual diagnosis of the president's mental fitness and I do drink yeah I want to get to that in a second but first I just want to get to some of the things that doctor Lee has said okay she has said she's described the president as dangerous she has said he is becoming very unstable very quickly mr. Trump is showing signs of impairment she hasn't evaluated him how could she say those things well as I understand it I'll let her speak for herself of course but as I understand it she's taking the position and the other psychologists and psychiatrists and neurologists who participate in the book are saying that there are warning signs and they considered a very dangerous situation without rendering a specific diagnosis and of course they've got a First Amendment right to do that just like the president has the First Amendment right to declaring himself a very stable genius or Steve Bannon has the right to say that the president is totally lost it and so on everybody can opine but what we're looking for in Congress is a real process and luckily because of the vision of senator Birch Bayh and Senator Robert F Kennedy we've got a process that's built into the twenty-fifth amendment which is that we have the authority to set up this body and it would be bipartisan bicameral independent and it would have on a physician psychiatrist former statesmen and states women and they would be able to act in the event of a crisis a couple more questions before I get to that process you're right she has a First Amendment right to say these things however the American Psychiatric Association really frowns on this in fact they have a protocol for not diagnosing somebody without evaluating them and I know that maybe she hasn't given an exact like DSM diagnosis however when she says that mr. Trump is showing signs of impairment and that the president is very dangerous I mean isn't that hyperbole well it may or may not be depending on your perspective I mean you know that they've been invoking what they called delusional behavior so the president one day admits that the Access Hollywood tape is true he apologized for it and then a few months later denies the existence of it and says that the whole thing is fake news you know there are newspapers I think it's the Washington Post that's collected what they call thousands of lies told by the president the other interpretation is that these are not lies but he actually believes them and that is delusional behavior but again you know anybody pine under the First Amendment but what we need is a process to deal with the possibility of a real crisis you know we got 535 members of Congress we've only got one president United States that's why we have a 25th amendment that was adopted in the nuclear age and the senators who introduced it and pushed for it I've read the entire legislative history they said this is very serious business if you have a president who goes into a coma or loses his memory or has a psychotic break or for some other reason is unable to render properly the powers and duties of office okay so as I understand it the way the twenty-fifth amendment is triggered is by the Vice President and your point is that Mike Pence will never do that there's no scenario that you could imagine I wish Mike Pence would do that so you are trying to call for a revision whereby it would be what you think is a more impartial body than the cabinet the president's own cabinet or the vice president I'm just wondering do you that's not exactly right it's not triggered by the vice president if you read the 25th amendment in Section 4 it says the vice president in the cabinet can enact or the vice president and a body set up by Congress so the body can initiate it the cabinet committee ated or the vice president convention okay so you're sort of planning for a rainy day of some kind and I'm just wondering are other lawmakers going along with you and signing on and do you have any Republican support so I introduced it back in April yesterday we had 60 co-sponsors who've joined onto it and no Republicans have done so yet obviously a number of Republicans have expressed their concerns about what they've described as erratic and unstable behavior in the White House which one Republican senator described as an adult day care center again you don't have to take a position one way or another but if you think that enough questions have been raised then we think that we need to be prepared for this and that's what the 25th amendment solves yeah question in December when you met with that Yale psychiatrist and there was a group of lawmakers that did so we understand there was one Republican in there can you tell us who that was um but I was not part of any group meeting with dr. Li she came to my office to visit me for a moment I could go vote so you know about it and so can you tell us who that Republican was I actually don't know I'd be I'd be interested to know who it is - but look I mean senator corker has raised very specific questions senator flake has raised very specific questions so you know I don't think we need to get to the level of investigative journalism to see who said what to whom we've got a whole book written by these psychologists and neurologists and psychiatrists and we've got a number of member of Congress who have raised very legitimate and valid questions so if we can get you know one or two levels above just the name-calling that's been taking place the last few days we can develop the process that the Constitution calls for congressman Jamie Raskin thank you very much for explaining it to us today great to have you today there's another component that's every bit as important so whether congressionally the panel or its the cabinet and the VP or whomever it then goes to Congress and you need a 2/3 vote on it I just don't see where the numbers are not made his point is that he wants the process in place maybe it will never be triggered but he wants the right process and they have the

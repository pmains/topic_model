Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the nearly
800,000 DREAMers, and in strong opposition to the Administration’s decision to end
DACA. The President’s position neither reflects
the values, nor protects the interests, of our nation. Rather, termination of the DACA program will
needlessly disrupt lives, separate families, diminish communities and hurt employers. These fine people came to this country as
children with their families from around the world—from Mexico, South America, South
Korea, India. They grew up in our neighborhoods, attended
our schools, and with their friends, created extraordinary dreams and aspirations for their
future. This is the only country they know. Their faces are the face of America. Their dreams are the American Dream. President Trump’s decision to repeal DACA
is wrong and un-American. Mr. Speaker, these young men and women want
nothing more than to make a positive contribution to our nation’s future, and they trusted
our government to do right by them. It’s now up to Congress to do just that. It is long past time for this body to pass
the DREAM Act and empower these DREAMers to live their lives and reach their potential
in confidence.

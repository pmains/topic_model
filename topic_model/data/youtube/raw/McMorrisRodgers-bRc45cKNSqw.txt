Thank You mr. chairman and I appreciate you allowing me to wave on to the committee today and join you all in this important discussion as technology becomes increasingly integrated into every aspect of our lives our economy our society it's more important than ever to ensure that all Americans especially those in the rural areas have access to high-speed and an internet connection coming from Eastern Washington living in eastern Washington now representing Eastern Washington in Congress in too many of the areas that I drive when getting around the district and visiting in various communities coverages remain static I was reminded of it earlier this year I was I was in a couple of communities just south of Spokane Spokane is the second largest city in Washington State and I was just 15 20 miles south of Spokane in Rockford and Fairfield and they had nothing so there's a growing and growing drumbeat that you know we this needs to be a priority and I join in that because whether it is economic development whether it's health care telehealth so much of the future of healthcare is around telehealth education our kids are doing more and more homework online and personalized education you know it's or healthcare it's it is our future so I in August I hosted a couple of roundtable discussions in Eastern Washington one in Colville which is more north of Spokane 70 miles north and then one in Pomeroy that is even further south and it was good it was good to bring the community together the the elected officials the ISPs others business owners health care providers that are involved in trying to solve this issue in Eastern Washington one of the main barriers that seems to be common right now is ensuring that we have the accurate maps and that this is so important as we have this discussion about how are we going to ensure that every area is covered earlier this year I joined with mr. O'Halloran in introducing the broadband data Improvement Act and is one of several bipartisan bills that we're considering here today and this bill tackles the inaccurate mapping on several fronts one by increasing the granularity of provider reported data using shape files two by utilizing a three-pronged validation process including the use of third-party data and an on-the-ground accuracy verification and third ensuring a robust robust challenge process those are three main areas it also provides assistance to smaller providers to minimize the burden of the reporting requirements and I just want to thank all of the witnesses today for being here today and for your work to improve broadband access for all Americans I'm encouraged by the variety and the priority that this committee is making to move forward in a bipartisan way so that we can ensure that the the limited federal funds that we do have but that we have been prioritizing for this effort reach the areas where the the need is the most I wanted to ask if you could talk just a little bit more about the importance of having a robust validation and challenge process to ensure the accuracy of our broadband Maps in addition to increasing granularity and specifically what role should third-party data play in this process and miss Bloomfield I wanted to ask you that so first of all thank you so much for your leadership it has been very key and as you listed the key points in your legislation they're all things that we absolutely endorse and support and think are important so when you talk about validation you know there's a lot of different ways to do it you know one of the things we've all talked about as a panel has been how do you incorporate things like crowdsourcing how do you actually gather that information from people served on the ground I think that's a really interesting and intriguing idea I would just say though that again what you don't want to do create a process that becomes really a burden where somebody has to chase down every complaint and respond and you know how do we actually capture trends so that we don't get bogged down in that process and we can continue to move forward to make sure that the maps are accurate and people can continue to spend more of their time and energy actually building the broadband then reporting back through that process so I think it's important but I think it has to be done very thoughtfully but again I think that along with a challenge process so at the back end you can actually really do that verification is going to be very significant I would add so I think a challenge process is vital you know the FCC did a one-time data collection and if we hadn't had a challenge process there those maps that show all of Eastern Washington is covered would have been locked into place and used by the FCC you know on the wireless side we used shapefiles to build that last map but without a challenge process to go out and test it we would have been stuck in a real mess so the good news is that you know all of the legislation in front of us puts us in the right direction to fix it once and for all okay hard time has expired I thank the gentlelady

i'm cindy oper and i'm the co-founder of true colors the true colors fund which works nationally to end homelessness among lesbian gay bisexual and transgender youth and it is really an honor to be here with you guys um it's good to be a voice for the homeless youth who have no voice so thank you for hearing me um i myself was a homeless youth as a teen um i could have lost my future but i was lucky i was one of the lucky ones i i found a youth hostel that helped me and directed me to getting a ged and get back into society into the system and i was fortunate i was just blessed because i found that door way back in um i don't know what my life would have been like without art or music i certainly don't know what my life would have been like without girls just want to have fun or true colors and through my travels i've met many people who've come up to me and talk about being disenfranchised from their life from life because of their because they are lgbt and um who have found solace in these songs and after listening to these stories it changed me and i decided that maybe there's something i can do besides just being a famous person and singing to them so here i am um i uh here's what i know we've done a lot of information because i felt like i didn't we shouldn't just have a charity just have a charity so we went out to research because once you have the information then you can act accordingly and not spin your wheels you know don't waste money don't waste your time go find what you have to do and move forward and we were very fortunate what we found out is as say in every any given year there's 1.6 million kids right on the that on the street that are homeless that's in uh the whole country right so up to 40 percent of these kids are lgbt or to put it very much like regular people understand gay or transgender okay now these kids if you if you look at the whole country up to seven only up to seven percent of american youth identify as gay or transgender right but yet the homeless population has up to 40 percent so you can see the disparity and you can see there's something bigger at play here basically the kids come out and they get thrown out you know and it's just uh or they run away because they feel unsafe or unwanted and i ask you is that acceptable i say no and no no young person should be left without a home because of their sexual orientation or their gender identity the truth is they didn't choose their identity you know it's like you choosing the color of your eyes you know you're born that way and these are little these are kids you know keep in mind these are kids from the age of 12 to 24 and they are trying to survive in the street which is hard for grown-ups to do now if you're a kid and you're different it leaves you vulnerable to a lot of things including trafficking okay and they are looking for a way to come back in and be productive citizens it seems to me that if kids are our future we should invest in kids because they're going to be the next doctors lawyers the people who are going to cure cancer the people are going to fix the earth problems and if we don't invest in them we don't invest in ourselves and that's a problem because we cut ourselves off at the knees and to compete in the world we have to have our youth and these kids that are in these kids that are in these situations which we have gone out and researched we have found that there is we've also partnered with hud because um we in our research we found out what government agencies are doing what and then we've been working on putting people together and we've worked with hud on prevention because the way that we can help truly help is through prevention so that would include you know looking at helping the families fixing the child welfare system our floor juvenile justice system and our schools obviously you guys have been working on this but this is what we see that needs to happen because honestly one of those doorways is going to lead to homelessness or a future all right i want to talk about this one we we see that this actually works because we have partnered with hud on a lgbtq youth homelessness prevention initiative and we're seeing what's happening in cincinnati and houston now these counties were chosen because one is a small kind of county and one is a larger county one has jennifer jennifer maybe you can help me one has an uh infrastructure that is has uh a youth homeless infrastructure help and the other one not so much so this kind of represents the country the the counties across our country so what we learn from this initiative will enable us to make a blueprint of of an initiative that could go across the whole country if it works and we're seeing that it is working and um we've learned the five key things that these kids need by working with the different um service providers and and and traveling to talk to them is the one thing is stable housing education and job training a sense of social and emotional well-being and permanent connections that provide stability the same thing any any grown-up would need and the true colors fund the true colors fund is dedicated to finding what works that's important um we have to build a network of these programs that move us from just a crisis response center to long-term solutions but the committees and the surface service providers need funding to put them in place and someone to speak up for them that would be me that would be you so i'm here um i want to give you a few more facts before i turn this over to jen who we've been working jennifer ho who we've been working closely with in particular hud can test programs they need appropriation funding appropriated so they can test programs and systems targeted and targeted in communities to figure out what should be then replicated across the country i said that and the more we learn about these kids the more we help we help them and again remember we're talking about kids from 12 to 24 years old they want to always remember their kids government advocacy government advocacy groups researchers private funders and social providers need to work together to find solutions that give these kids their options back and we know that because we've seen it work and we need a comprehensive national system that is inclusive of all young people lgbt youth are in the homeless population in numbers greater than the other kids so if you have a bigger population of a group of kids you have to learn about them to help them otherwise it's a revolving door you spin in your wheels and you spend the money for what nothing

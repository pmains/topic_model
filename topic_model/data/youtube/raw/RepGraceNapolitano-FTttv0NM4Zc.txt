so one of the things that we looked at there's a in your handouts there's a graph that illustrates the changes between that initial behavior at time 1 and time two and we see decreases in behaviors that were off task or negative behaviors such as attention seeking things like that over the course of the beginning of the school year to the end of the school year there's another graph that sort of illustrates an assessment measure that looks at overall problems called the brief problem checklist and we see changes in those measures as well over the course of the school year so you know it's one thing for me to tell you what the research says but we also see it you know in our students day-to-day behavior and based on their parent report teacher report and the students report as well that the mental health services that they're receiving the school certainly been beneficial for them and has a positive impact on their behavior so if you have any questions I will be available at the end thank you and our final speaker is going to speak from her personal experience but I will go through your bio currently a management analyst for the international travel team under the office of the Commissioner at the Food and Drug Administration Michelle Scott started her federal government career in 2006 as an extramural support assistant for the National Institute of Health Center for scientific review mrs. Scott is the vice president of loud voices together educational advocacy group inc a nonprofit organization that aims to connect families and community partners with special education resources to enrich the lives of children she is also the director of the liturgical dance ministry at her church and a mother of an exceptional young adult who has been able to maximize his potential with the support of programs such as schoolmates based mental health services Michelle Scott enjoys spending time with family and friends and her passion is empowering people in order to help them improve the quality of their lives Thank You Bethany um as you read from my bio I don't feel that I am the most qualified person to be here but I'm hoping that my story or my experience will be able to enlighten some of you or at least give you some further insight on what it means to not only the child with the family I don't know who seemed to have modified what I thought was the agenda but I'm glad they did because I'm still kind of jittery from a Miss diamond story because i know it apart but i'll just try to stick to my reading because other than that it is a very emotional um type of experience to explain so again my name is Michelle Scott I am a mother of a very talented and gifted child by the name of Heath Scott he'd started his public education with the infant and toddler program in PG County at James Ryder elementary school in 2003 after some of our curiosities led me to have him tested for some unique habits he started to display he was accepted into the infant and toddler program out where he received various services based on his initial diagnosis of PDD at that time I realized I was going to need as much guidance and assistance as possible to help me navigate the special-needs process with and for my child I was very concerned since I was not prepared for this experience I wasn't experienced in the area being a new mother and one who immediately had dedicated what I thought myself to being the best carrier possible I maintained a very healthy diet I read some of maternity books I followed all the recommendations in my medical team and made very very appointment during my pregnancy I went as far as to avoiding taking a single dose of medication during my pregnancy out of fear of having any complications passed on to my child during and during my pregnancy and afterwards during nursing I had no idea that I would soon be challenged by the most frightening roller coaster ride ever after learning that my very precious and healthy baby boy will be diagnosed with the condition that would affect him for a very long time well as his journey started with the PG County if it is taller program being my only resource that was very appreciative of the opportunity needs to have my son received in to pitch and other service I am so sorry in order to hit enhance those skills that were not as strong at that time I stand before you to say that the challenge was not easy and at times it felt like the hardest fight that I had ever faced in most cases the children cannot advocate themselves so we become their advocates and for those of us who serve dual growth being the parent it can be very challenging each IP meeting seem to get very long my son's IEP list seemed to grow and become more complex and my emotion seems to grow out of control at each meeting I recall asking for information guidance leads or any resource available to help my son as he matured in age the response was very slim to none until Heath reached middle school and I was introduced to a new program the Prince George's School Mental Health Initiative the two representatives who sit at that table wait a minute I'm sorry the two representatives seem to have come out of nowhere they showed up as if they had been there from the start but these women were prepared and interested in getting started with my son in fact outside of the official paperwork I really think they had already begun their research prior to his arrival to school or the first day I soon learned that this team was a part of a much greater team they came into my family's life at a very important time as you all know the teenagers are already challenging enough now just imagine when you have a teenager who has a different way of just about everything to include how often they need to attend to their hygiene all the way to why they have to follow instructions do chores or adhere to a simple bedtime thanks to the mental health services being offered and received in school we were able to tackle our most difficult challenges with ease and support just when I thought I could not take any more the Mental Health Program was there to provide services such as weekly counseling there was one on one counseling provided to my son in school the councilman was both scheduled up on a they were both on an unscheduled and scheduled basis which allowed the mental health team to assist Heath with crisis management and maintaining the skills he had acquired they did group therapy therapy which is where Heath would be able to work on communication skills active listening friend-making and reading nonverbal social cues case management case management which is the one that's so important to me they provided information and resources to us regularly they even came into my home to be able to see real time what was going on and how they can make you know effective recommendations to improve some of the areas that were not going so well they did stress management for Heath and for us behavioral management chore chart effective communication scheduling and they made sure I kept him involved in the community they followed up with me regularly they participated in our IEP meetings they provide a support for me and my family the school-based mental health services are tremendous asset to youth and their families it is my hope that all families who are in need will have access to these services in their local schools from kindergarten through out graduation and beyond this will ensure that no child is left behind no Chow is left without or just passed along without receiving the services needed to become independent successful professionals in life thank you we'd really like to thank all of our speakers for being here and um as dr. Cunningham said they'd love to take questions if you have a question feel free to raise your hand you may have to speak up a bit but I can repeat it into the microphone so everyone can hear representation where to get the website to be able to find out where that is applicable in their schools in other words what programs do you have that can help expand on service delivery we actually have a section on our website I believe that talks about well thank you the Samson website is wwm set SAMHSA govt and if you look at topics there should be a topic on on campuses I think schools and campuses and that will lead you to the different places different programs that we have that focus on schools and have and then you can go on our grants page most of our grants for this year are already out so our grant announcements for this year they come out every year in the early january to march january to april and so you can see on our grants page what's available right now porsche even came to Congress there was no mental health caucus there was no Melon school match so he's been huge champion he said that you guys work with in coordination with the school counselors to school psychologists and social workers are already there George's County about a great match school social workers can you just drive a little bit more about the importance of that lead to school employee employee person and the connection to the teachers of the school staff as well as their everyday sure yes we work very closely with SARM shorts are gonna maneuver we work very closely with the school counselors the school social workers you know what we have found is that you know certainly there are so many students who have such a wide range of issues and concerns you know we find that the school psychologist while they are there and available to provide treatment are often very busy with assessments and are not an IEP meetings and all the other things they need to do so they're not as available to provide the direct counseling and support services similarly with guidance counselor's you know they're also available to to be able to counsel students but you know they have schedules and you know meetings and lots of other things that are also on their plate so they're not able to be as dedicated to only providing those therapeutic services and supports as our school-based mental health staff are but we certainly work in very close collaboration with them they often make referrals as in terms of students that might need more support or need more assistance we certainly talked a lot with the teachers are our staff provided an enormous amount of teacher consultation so helping the teachers you know once we only see students for a limited amount of time and then they're going back to their classroom so helping the teachers understand you know how to really helps the best support those students based on whatever issues or disabilities they might have and to really help support them in the classroom as well in terms of implementing some of the strategies that can help them be successful just like she was saying how she's having a problem with our professor with understanding and I'm wondering what we are doing on college campuses to train her factors and rappers and training professors at the University about what disabilities are really helped out I think with our programs we know that of we work very closely with the Department of Education and what the folks at ministration for community living in the developmental disabilities and disabilities world largely and we recognize that kids with behavioral health problems also many of them have co-occurring disabilities whether their behavioral cognitive or physical so our systems of care programs absolutely take that into consideration in terms of all the needs that those young people have and and and many of them have multiple vulnerabilities in that sense so I think our sampsa programs definitely do that with respect to college campuses the main work that we're doing right now on campuses does have to do with more particularly suicide and so I would say we don't really have something in this space that you're talking about however I think the good thing about the suicide programming is that it does increase literacy about behavioral health issues and so that is I think a first step in terms of understanding what is the kind of impact that these things can have on young people and therefore what do you need to be on the lookout for so but I hear you it's a great suggestion I just want to add as well that the sunix Center for school mental health recently partnered with a few different organizations that they recently developed a series of online training modules and one actually focuses on co-occurring disorders and it's free anybody can can log on and take it so if you go to the center's website there should be a link to that as well I think it's a Maryland behavioral health online I think it certainly is an important point you know one of the things I always talk to to parents and teachers about is that you know it needs to be a collaborative effort we can't solve all of these problems by ourselves and so you know we do need the the families on board and engage we need the school staff engaged and sometimes you know due to a lot of other issues it's hard for people you know sometimes it's hard for us to what I usually say kind of played nicely together in the sandbox you know sometimes we have competing agendas but it's important to you know always bring back the focus to to the student and you know together we can certainly do more than we can in isolation but I think it's just important to really get that message across that it really does require you know the whole village and the whole community to work together you know that's where we really see that the programs that have the most success is when we are able to partner with families and partner with community agencies and in the schools and not work in isolation sometimes you may see programs that may sort of set up shop in a school and they're in a corner in office but they're not at all engaged in the larger school community and engage in what's happening in the school and so it really is important it makes it a huge difference when you do have those collaborative partners and collaborative relationships I'm sure as you know there's nothing that Samsa does that doesn't involve bringing other partners to the table for our work in in the children's mental health space we think that everything should be youth in form and family-centered it should be culturally competent should be evidence-based be should be trauma-informed in recovery and resiliency oriented and so one of the challenges we hear though from communities and from states is that applying for some of our opportunities is that much more difficult because we require now we're starting to require you have to bring your Medicaid office to the table you have to bring housing to the table employment labor to the table because you know kids with behavioral health conditions as their leading cause of disability have the lowest rate of employment and the highest dropout rates so you know it's it's it's needing to bring together all those partners so we definitely see it but I think there needs to be a social shift because the state says sure mental health subsidies maybe we can get child welfare to the table obviously the schools are sometimes hard to penetrate because the teachers are very busy you know school administrators have a lot on their plates and then you know once you get to Medicaid and housing I mean it gets that much harder to bring all those partners to the table and until everyone understands how central these issues are to their line of business into their bottom lines it's going to be hard for them to pay you know they're they're all busy so how do we get them to have the bandwidth for that and I do think that there's a national effort that's needed by by all the folks that are in this room to keep that drum beat going about how important it is thanks you know right yeah I know that I know you guys are working with the center Chris gonna help ya so there's certainly our programs that are doing that collaboration of doing it quite well I don't know if you're looking for kind of a list or we it's awfully not like wondering if there are some tapping into we need to reach out and help you all remote as well as vice versa one of the things you need to know is in point and again we're on the other spectrum of the US but there are the permanent we start back in two thousand one is foolish from one high school email supposed to not 16 onsite clinicians are ready to do with all the issues that we're talking about and the bill was prior to active for instead of them what has happened since then we have a mental health consortium this is a mental health individuals who want to work together to partner with each other to let with other know what they're going it did help each other so they evolved into well starting off with diurnal was helping new into nursing he knows he spun off into four categories veterans children of young men's women's and the policy and they helped us when he did the Affordable Care Act they looked at the portion of men and recommended the one thing that was missing now is the language competency because we need to be able to adventure that is delivered in the language that the parents can understand behind the child the parents has to who would be able to be involved as you have said that's been ongoing at me sporting they have a beautiful job in helping each other has become a county we have speakers coming from the county from the state mental health providers parents they come in and talk to us this is in LA los angeles's for I represent but is something that you can do is you start building and I suggest all of you can Network and be able to carry out things similar to this it is inviting the parents to come in and listen we had journalists from Washington Post and Jackie mr. Jackie who's bipolar he's a very successful individual a journalism people who are willing to come out and say look I've gone through this and this is what I've done be overcome while those are messages in the parents and the children in here run our tests later you know I punning ball because I've been able to deal with my inner demons that parenting and anger management and all this other stuff because of my psychiatrist opening in after the championship and he started started a foundation where he was 22 mental health clinics into the schools so this is a new cat every time you better start digging that started making phone calls and people here who have an interest get sometimes connect with somebody else and this is something this would you nice me and joe said she has a passion for it because of the boxing in prison in the mental health they occupy a council game over a million dollars to UCLA to study for a prom well guess what it helps us be able to identify some of that so you can just get a big load when you got to put it up you gotta do your own networking your area with your parents and have them become abacus because without them you can't change policy and you certainly don't get the funny little pressure there to make it happen then we talked about the moment oh I'm sorry said mental health office that's been dormant for a year and a half I can't get mr. Bergman to revive it so we've asked mr. Gibson who you met today some of you to become my co-chair of the consortium and then of course suicide in universities one of the highest is in university we don't talk about it and the issue is that pressure it is you name it i'm not an expert so i can tell you but that is will the highest suicide rates in universities so somehow we need to be within this university to have the program to be able to educate not just the student of the parent because they deal with the child we plan on what basis but certainly for the money i would think and of course don't forget the Affordable Care it was supposed to give us clarity in the axis support well if their little paws you got a challenge because we can't change that policy unless you tell us where the loopholes are to be able to ensure that everybody has access to mental health services from providers so with that thank you very much do we have any other questions okay our action counselor transition we have teams in different states across the country and those teams consist of two loops and a belt partner and a sponsoring organization that work together so that means you far able to leave but learn about dope about the civil partnerships and how to actually partner with adults to implement different policies or systems and they are very focused and one of the youthful most teeth on that scene is interested in starting and she's my good thing as well as schools because she talks about how how she had been hospitalized in just a different signal that curves so my question is are there any resources they walk in provided or acquaintances that I can point person that would be helpful for her and city buses youth directed or you live support around little health concerns collections aware of all the difference thinking about other things one group that's really wonderful and inspirational is youth move national so you're already familiar with them also young people in recovery for those who are in addiction recovery and I think those would probably be the two best for those with lived experience and then another group which also speaks to congresswoman Napolitano is concern about what's happening on our campuses is active mines which is another wonderful group that's doing a lot to educate folks on college campuses about the issues around mental health how about the state this do you have any programs have you contacted the State find out whether they have operated covers the state mental health providers do they have a mental health department that you may be able to see whether they have any money carry up to you know of anybody in that state that you might be able to a director we can we can try to connect you with folks in Indiana both whether we have a safe schools healthy students grant and we have relationships with the folks that manage them and health Block Grant and there's probably a child or youth coordinator for the state so we can try to make those connections ask Jill but he had a great idea that she was in my mind you know I just saw was thought that problem sometimes the young people is that getting emotional counseling isn't it if you have a flabby body and go to the gym people always say yay 100 pounds and I wonderful this but if your mind is a little flabby or something nobody ever says oh I just finished our you're doing so much better knowing but thinking of we could develop a hip way to think of for kids like calling the appendage gymnastics so you can either go to gym or mental gymnastics some way that you out of the box that people would actually think that getting therapy was a hip thing to do you do for your body do it through your mind and income a super person because you have it or not other questions any comments anybody would you like to see something of volunteers because this is something again is so critical especially with children that's that's my satisfied four great-grandchildren to me precious then seeing them three balls so is here the office oh my all of you my suggestion is maybe you can share vente wants to put on his part where you want to share your information with each other and become a network of assistance to each other please feel free to do so because you are the one that have to move the ball up it isn't up to me it is you learning it happen all we can do is try this and in unfortunately we're short of funds in some ways anyway and the five year is not conducive to us being able to push the agenda for my governor he ever minamoto we tried last year it fail there's no way that you can say no because they're visible along by AP that is already program so we need your help keep us together and and I know that the founding partners would like to extend special thanks to Jonah for putting up with us and helping us organize this wonderful briefing so we'd also like to thank our supporting organizations other national groups here in DC that supported our putting on this briefing um and I think that one step we can take forward at least is supporting representative Napolitano's mental health in schools bow um and so I just like to say thank you for everyone for coming and listening to us on this incredibly important topic and let's follow up with all of the suggestions

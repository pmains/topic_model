massive operation for private groups working with two federal agencies targeting 22 million social posts what's your first reaction when you hear that was going on behind the scenes actually that was stunning to hear that and to know that it's actually coming through the uh the cyber security agency sisa uh you know this should not be happening this particular type of censorship where the government knows that they cannot do it by themselves because of the First Amendment of the Constitution which prohibits it and then they decide to partner with a a another entity a private entity you know a social media platform or a university and then they say hey we're going to feed you information that we think is disinformation or we want to be disinformation and then you go ahead and you do the D platforming you you label it as misinformation or disinformation or or worse yet you label it as true when they know that it's simply driving a false narrative that is incredibly concerning that something that Congress needs to be looking into and I'll tell you that when we take back the majority 30 in November and I'm a proud member of both the oversight committee and the homeland security committee I think these are this is something we need to look into and investigate further yeah I mean Americans I think across the board are concerned because most people know that if if there's one group that's being targeted at one point it's going to be another group at another point but we're 40 days out from the midterms people are possibly looking for a change what can be done legislatively anything on your radar anything coming down the pike next year well I'll tell you that I have a bill right now and it is called the Free Speech Defense Act and it does exactly what you see happening that shouldn't happen it it prevents the federal government from partnering with other entities with these third-party groups with these social media companies because that is a violation of of our Constitution and this bill would prevent the federal government from from labeling anything through a proxy entity like um you know you name the social media company but labeling it as disinformation labeling it is misinformation or labeling it as true and then it would also give an opportunity for those people who have been injured by it to uh to take legal action so I think it's a great Bill I've got a number of Republican co-sponsors on it already as we know the Democrats are currently in charge of this session the 117th so um you know good bills really go nowhere in 117th but when we we take back the house good bills will have a place to go and I look forward to the 118th yeah that's a big piece of news a legislation coming forward to finally address this censorship issue we're going to be keeping a close eye on that for sure Congressman uh we had another story yesterday that caught my attention I want to just ask you about it there is a growing trend of federal law enforcement agencies state agencies local that are buying America's geospatial cell phone data which basically gives their whereabouts 24 hours seven days a week and using it to solve crimes deal with a civil litigation uh and uh even track Health Trends in America CDC was one of the big purchases of it none of this is happening with a warrant I think most Americans assume my phone data has to be gotten by a warrant or the government can't get it when you hear how readily available is and how widespread the practice of buying it is inside government does that concern you is there something that should be done in that front well I think there definitely are private privacy issue concerns here uh as we uh saw in in one of the documentaries uh 2000 mules I think you saw that cell phone data was used to actually pinpoint people who had been uh who we saw on videotape actually in my own home state that were um uh literally taking absentee ballots they call them uh mules for ballot harvesting so you know that's a piece of information that was very valuable in that documentary but how law enforcement uses it and how government uses it I think there could certainly be a concern there so that's something we just have to have to watch yeah great and Congressman I wanted to ask you specifically about that concern as it relates to the FBI because as far as the limitations of tech companies and also the limitations of three-letter agencies I remember from the San Bernardino shooting the police were trying to break into the phone Apple said either we couldn't or we wouldn't help and the FBI was able to hack into it and then the FBI didn't fill in apple on how they were able to do that is that concerning well I'll tell you you know when when the government gets into our private lives without a warrant I think that's very concerning um and you know as a as a proud member of the freedom caucus and as someone who Champions individual liberty that should be what government is concerned about protecting not what government needs to uh to Snoop in our lives so they can see what we're doing uh you know when we are law-abiding citizens that's just not the right way to go yeah I think so many Americans agree with that uh sir are you worried about the Border daily I know that we've talked before about it uh two things have really struck us the number of people with terrorist eyes that have been captured coming across the border probably a lot who didn't get captured have come across and then we now hear from the Inspector General the Homeland Security Department a massive failure to vet some of those Afghan refugees that were brought in in the chaotic way that President Biden exited the Afghan War what can you tell us about the security concerns these things have raised and what can be done in the near future to maybe tighten up the ship there well I'll tell you that you're absolutely right when it comes to uh being concerned about the southern border you have 78 so far that we know of 78 people on the terrorist watch list that has come across the border that we have actually caught you know and and there are since President Biden has been in office over 3.4 million uh people encounters uh illegal aliens that have come across the border but yet there's over 900 000 godaways people that we know we weren't able to get we saw them we had some sort of information that they were there either they were tracked by a sensor or a video but then there's the unknown gotaways as well and how many more were on the terrorist watch list on the known gotaways as well as the unknown gotaways it is an incredibly concerning piece of information we do not have a secure border and in my opinion we do not have a secure country we'll never have a secure country until we have a secure border so so this is something that that we and the Republicans we have a plan to address it's called the commitment to America and one of those pillars is a nation that's secure part of that security is a secure Southern border and there's a number of ways to do that infrastructure is one of them the wall is one of them and uh funding additional border patrol and and Customs and Border Protection is another way but that must happen it absolutely must to have a secure Nation Congressman I want to dig in on another border related topic you represent the great state of Georgia and I know at one time I think this is still the case Atlanta is a huge hub for human trafficking since the open border have you seen an uptick in that activity at a Jackson Hartsfield or just in Atlanta in general oh we've seen an uptick an uptick in human trafficking across the entire United States because of the open border and it is absolutely tragic because I think that our federal government literally is the last link in the human trafficking chain we are incentivizing illegal immigration illegal aliens coming across the border and there are are many many many thousands upon thousands of unaccompanied children coming across the border I cannot imagine parents in another country sending their children by themselves to cross the border and then they are so susceptible to be to being trafficked and it is a huge problem it must be dealt with but the bind Administration they bear the sole responsibility for it yeah and it's remarkable so we've only got about 20 seconds but uh vice president Kamala Harris she was at a border the DMZ in Korea but not at our border does she ever go down to the Border I don't think she's been to the Border yet but she needs to because it will tell her that it is not a secure border that's so true you've been saying that for some time now sir uh sir it's a great honor to have you on thank you for joining us we're going to be watching for that legislation very important news ahead of us so that's great thank you thank you John thank you Amanda

thank you so my name is Katherine Cortez master I'm the senator from Nevada I am on the Commerce Committee I want to thank our Chairman and ranking member Nelson for their support of the subcommittee work that is being done by my colleagues senators Moran and Blumenthal thank you so much for your commitment but let me let me just say most importantly thank you to all of the women who are here today nobody should ever ever have to go through what you did and I know by what you are doing you are going to make change but here's not let's let's not forget what happened because I think that dictates the change that needs to occur and people need to realize that not just young women but young men who give up their lives who give up their families at time to do something for our country to show that we're the very best and compete and they've made a commitment lifelong and they along with the stressors that they've already given up and they have should never ever have to endure an environment where predators are taking advantage of them and exploiting them sexually physically mentally you name it I have seen as I've listened to these committee hearings and gone through the documentation that I've requested from the USOC and many of the other organizations unfortunately a culture that was created that unbeneficial predators who want to go in that door and we have to change that it's not just enough that we accept these young men and women coming forward to say that something is going on we have to stop it from going on so they don't have to come forward again so they can be free to do and achieve what they believed in that's what this is about it is a cultural change it is a change in the system it is stopping these predators from being able to walk through that door and exploit our kids and not just young girls but young boys as well listen I've talked to them as well and so that is what you guys are about today because your stories will make that change you will help us continue to fight because I'll tell you what you've heard from my colleagues today but there are many more we are committed to holding the USOC USA Gymnastics and all of the other organizations accountable so they make that change I am one to say was Attorney General in my state for eight years prosecutor the Predators are out there and they will exploit a system if you let them but it is about making that change long-term so they can no longer exploit it and we out them and we say who they are and we get to hold them accountable now that's the only way we make long-term change and I know it's not easy at times but what you are doing today is making a difference in the lives not just your lives but the lives of others who come after you so thank you we will continue to fight by your side and with your voices and your help we are gonna make change positive change for the future thank you for being here [Applause]

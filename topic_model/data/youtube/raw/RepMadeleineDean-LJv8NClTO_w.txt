joining me now is congresswoman madeline dean she is a member of the judicial and financial services committees she was also one of the nine impeachment managers appointed in the wake of the capital insurrection thank you so much for coming into the studio to have this chat i appreciate it pleasure to be with you what's your reaction learning now that the new york attorney general is joining the manhattan d.a in a a criminal investigation of the trump organization it's not surprising to me i think the walls are finally closing in on the truth about the trump organization and what has happened you saw that we in congress tried to exercise our oversight responsibility into trump finances tax returns appraisals of properties and those kinds of things and the trump administration thwarted us at every turn we're going to see now through the use of the d.a and the attorney general in new york i commend them and i hope they get to the truth you're having a vote on the january 6th commission congress's investigation or at least potentially to get to the bottom of what happened this will pass the house we expect but right now uh the senate it's sort of unclear what is going to happen i want to play what congressman mccarthy the house republican leader said last night about this commission there's already four investigations and now we want to put a political commission to go forward this is driven solely by politics and nancy pelosi but we should not be a part of that now more senate republicans that appear may be agreeing with him on that what do you think you know brianna i was thinking about that when i saw that last night the most important thing we bring to our public service is our credibility and sadly mr mccarthy has thrown away his credibility he's poured it away in buckets think about what happened here he his ranking member uh of the committee representative catco negotiated in good faith with the blessing of the leadership uh the joint commission bipartisan independent with equal subpoena power uh and uh mr mccarthy suddenly now has turned on that why is that is he afraid of subpoenas is he is that what you think it is you think he's afraid of being subpoenaed that he did speak to trump that day uh yes think of the other conversations he's likely had with the president he was able to call him directly we know from our investigation and from the impeachment trial that he did speak to mr trump and pleaded with him to call off the insurrection so mr mccarthy is showing that he's afraid of subpoenas he's afraid of the truth he's poured away his credibility and he has strangely tethered himself to mr trump to his failed presidency to the big lie and he's leading falsely leading his members in that same place there is a i don't want to say a prevailing thought for republicans some elected officials and some voters that the insurrection wasn't really an insurrection or it wasn't really a big deal you were in the house chamber when riders nearly made it in they pierced the window into the into the door uh what do you say to republicans including ones who were there with you who are whitewashing this like it wasn't really a thing it's nearly orwellian don't believe your eyes don't believe the experience you actually had i was up in the chamber on the sixth when the rioters pierced that chamber breaking the glass banging on the doors breaking the glass we were taken out with gas masks on they were chanting hang mike pence this was no tuesday tour and i don't understand frankly how anyone republican or democrat could say that this is nothing to see here let's just move on we need this independent commission it is not a political commission it is an independent commission the very seat of our democracy was attacked any one of us could have died and people did die that day i would think the republicans would want to get to the bottom of it for the simple reason we're sworn to protect and preserve our democracy if we don't do that now we are destined to have that happen again were you afraid for your life that day i i was i i have to admit i think your brain tells you no i'm certainly in one of the safest places on the planet uh but i was telling you that at the time of the banging on the doors that is what made it very real and i heard the piercing of the glass i crouched down i called my family i was fearful congresswoman thank you so much for being with us congresswoman madeline dean we appreciate it my

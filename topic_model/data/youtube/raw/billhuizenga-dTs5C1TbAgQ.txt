we have to do that same thing that's one of the reasons why i didn't change the thing when people still walked out i told them lock the doors we're not getting different furniture we're not moving what would have happened is they would have come in pack it all up shipped it to a warehouse in chicago waited for me to tell them where they worshiped it back unpack all this stuff i looked at it it was thousands of dollars you had three offices i'm gonna have that's dumb that makes no sense all right we're gonna be going through redistricting here in the next two years let's keep them right where they're at and let's actually save some money on it and so we're we're trying to do the small stuff but you know that's long-term yeah the short-term stuff is like that it is looking at all of those different line items looking at you know does does military really need a second engine for the f-35 you know i have voted for in the uh in hr1 the continuing resolution i voted for every additional cut it was an additional 37 billion dollars there are some tough ones in there like this second engine but again i mean i'm prepared to put my money where my mouth is or my vote where my mouth is on this i just voted on at the end of this week we were going through uh only a security reauthorization i voted for a 10 across the board all right and and i understand that puts me vulnerable politically as people saying you don't care about pick the issue you know airline safety you don't care about the borders you don't care about whatever but when when they're spending tens of billions of dollars and we're not so sure that they're spending it as efficiently as they could or should be you know that's the kind of shared pain that we have to deal with so i am i am i i am working with uh you know it's kind of tied into this with balanced budget uh amendment here it is all tied and this is one big giant boardian knot all right between our our deficits our spending our budgets balanced budgets all those things um one of the things that i've signed on to a letter that specifically requests balanced budget being part of one of those uh one of those discussions as they're moving through the biden conversation if you want to talk about the public all right you've got the vice president and senate leadership and house leadership all in there they're not touching this all right they understand that this is all tied up all in one ball and they're trying to deal with that all in one ball because they know if we're going to get any kind of agreement on this it's going to have to be pretty all-encompassing so yeah yeah let's get a uh let's get a microphone here sorry so we've got probably about 10 minutes yep and i haven't been throwing a single slide at you so um i've had my area and i said to bill just now that um we've been working at social security medicare and uh what's happening in washington and some of the major things that came out of me before i came today was tell the congressman uh we'll work free with you we have a lot of information about tariff and how to cut the budget down seriously and um in total agreement um i've been offering my time and john and yourself to get the information to you we were in your office a few weeks ago by the way and we're sincere about it and what we know about mr geithner and the hill is actually all documented and i think i can be helped to your service and your people holland in this district and i made that offer today okay thank you um ryan can you go to slime for a second i just this is a this is just an illustration of uh and the same thing is happening frankly in uh in the state right the the one with the autopilot spending and this this is the exact same thing i dealt with when i was in the state house we are seeing more and more programs get set up so that they are on autopilot right there's there's no changing it whether it gets constitutionally written in here at the state level or whatever it is yeah yeah uh a lot of that is this is again the source fell from the congressional budget and the omb office management budget it's going to be those health care programs it's going to be the interest it's things that we sort of automatically have to have to go to all right so there they they separate out the discretionary spending which is actually a fairly small part of blood whether it's at the state level or at the uh at the federal level that discretionary spending is what we can actually you know tinker with and say now we're going to eliminate this program we're going to cut this program uh uh no this is non-defense discretionary so yeah so we can get you if you would like we can get you this is this is autopilot discretionary no no no no no this is non-discretionary non-defense non-discretionary sorry yeah non-discretionary so we're happy to provide you in the back but thank you yeah so this is dead in uh let's see if we've got we can we can talk about what defense is part of can you guys look through um but as you can see by this trend i mean obviously we've had more and more of the budget uh sort of happening with less and less specific uh things that we can that we can the defense the defense spending is discretionary i mean we could we could zero out the department of defense i mean yeah i'm not sure that we would like to do that but we you know theoretically could all right um sorry we had that overview over prepared i think we had about 35 different charts that we could show here um but we we are we're seeing the challenge again like i said and and frankly talk to anybody who's at the city council talk to anybody who's on township or talk to anybody who's at the county um there there is just more and more sort of program spending that uh that for you know for good reasons at various times we've said no this one needs to be walled off this one needs to be uh it just needs to be left alone and we've done that we started apparently in my effort to consolidate the 40 charts so i took that out that had listed all the different study we've got it on our website uh so if you go to heisley.housex housing guys.gov so it's actually a good chart to finish this discussion on unfortunately i have never been a republican or democrat and uh when this whole campaign's or become the next president started back in post 708 i was actually ready to vote for mccain until he made his choice of vice president and then i had to think twice but whoever got this presidency i was saying back in the week it was going to take at least two years if not the whole first four years to try to get his or her arms around this issue and start to make some very very difficult decisions in what our expectations have become over these years and as you're talking about the long-term outlook what's really critical is the long-term uh history of reality and how this chart describes where we're headed and to try to make some changes short-term to try to start to even put a little cut in these in these autopilots is so difficult for you and others that no matter what you try to do no matter what part you're part of uh people are going to jump up and down and raise hell about it and um this just is again autopilot whoever believe is defined to me this is where we're headed and wherever the president is right now it's not just the last eight years it actually is the last 20 years or so this actually goes back 40 years we are we have done a lot of criminal stuff to ourselves to our our way of governing ourselves for a long time and until the shot clock stops and really tough decisions are made uh it's going to keep doing what it's doing and i applaud your efforts to be there i see you as somebody who's trying to be on both sides of the aisle i applaud that um a big chunk that's killing us right now is all these wars and uh something's got to happen with some stuff rather than later uh and i've said this during the campaign and afterwards maybe the fact that we would pull um warf running quote off budget yeah i own a small little gravel pit all right i can't pull my fuel costs and put it off budget just because fuel went up you know you got to factor it all in i mean you have to no it is but but then but yeah but they have had as they were running up on things they they had you know i can be critical of republicans too you know that's right uh you know you're gonna go have a pick because you think i'm just defending the republicans but you know it makes no sense to me that that we would that we would do things like that and we have we have got to get serious

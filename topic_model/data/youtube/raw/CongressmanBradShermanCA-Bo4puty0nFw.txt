hello this is congressman brad sherman live from washington dc we're about to start another one of our san fernando valley town hall meetings a little logistics here first i'd like everyone to write down the following phone number just in case we get disconnected 855 920-0548 that's 855 920-0548 and that number will also be useful for our next town hall which will be on april 27th you can just dial in 8 55 9 20 05 48 at 7 pm on the 27th of april i'm going to cover a number of things but only after our guest speaker after our guest speaker i'll make an opening statement we'll take questions from the floor and we'll tell you how you can get in in the queue to ask those questions we have some questions that were submitted in advance by those who went to our website bradsherman.house.gov slash town hall and uh everyone will be able to give their answers to our survey questions simply by pushing the numbers on your phone so everyone will be able to express their opinion on some some controversial issues that face us right now but our special guest speaker has a limited amount of time because she is the busiest ambassador in the world she is the representative of ukraine to the united states uh this is her first and only congressional town hall by way of background i've been with the ukrainian caucus for 15 years i've been an advocate for all that time for us giving the defensive weapons to ukraine that it needs we haven't always been successful in ukraine went into this problem very undersupplied but we're doing a lot to overcome that ambassador we have on the line thousands of residents of the san fernando valley and we also have um quite a number of reporters from the los angeles media so this is your chance to [Music] reach not only the san fernando valley but the second largest megalopolis uh in the united states los angeles uh uh just to introduce the ambassador uh she has been here for about a year representing ukraine you couldn't have picked a more critical year prior to that she served as a minister of finance in the ukrainian government and i hope that she can tell us not only what's happening on the ground perhaps a hint on what's happening in the negotiations in istanbul and of course to describe what americans can do as individuals and as a nation so with that ambassador mark arova the ukrainian ambassador to the united states thank you very much congressman good evening to everyone and it's such an honor and pleasure to talk directly to american people it's also very appropriate because this is what we ukrainians are fighting for right now to be able to leave as a democracy to be able to choose our government and actually even change it on a regular basis to be able to feel ourselves at home and inspired aspired to be part of europe part of nato part of transatlantic community and that civilizational choice that we have made repeatedly ukrainians in the previous century but also in 1991 when the soviet union broke up and 98 percent of ukrainians voted to be independent and we started building our own country uh regained our independence and we thought that we only have to focus on changing us doing the reforms and you know being who we are the nation of peaceful bread growers unfortunately in 2014 russia attacked us for the first time illegally enacted crimea and part of the nazi lugansk oblast and even though we used this eight years after the first attack and first war to restore our territorial integrity only through diplomatic solutions and we've done a lot with the united states reforming our country and actually uh building some of the areas from scratch and i would like to thank the ukrainian caucus congress and personally to congressman chairman to be such a good partner strategic friend i would say as we call the us during all these years and now for 42 days we are discussing something completely different for 42 days we live in the situation of full-fledged war which russia again waged on our country but it's so different from any sin we saw in 2014 or 15 and the scenes that you all see now on tv and that we live in ukraine now through uh we might remind everyone about the world war two images our cities have been bombed and destroyed our schools are being destroyed we already lost almost 40 universities which are burned and destroyed to the ground and just recently after we were able to liberate some of the areas the whole world watched in disbelief in all this uh video and and footage of uh war crimes conducted by russians in the suburbs of kiev bucha european all these little towns which are now covered with dead bodies bodies of civilians uh tortured uh killed raped why is it important and why i am talking to you now and why we are we're uh asking the united states to once again be a leader in this friendship with us but to help us because it's not only about ukraine russian federation is doing exactly what nazi germany did before and what any empire did before they attacked sovereign countries neighboring country and they their intention is not only to attack us their intention is to attack anyone in the region who has uh a desire to be democratic and if to be democratic is a threat then none of us is safe plus the very basis of the international rule of law which we all believe and we also that we put together after the world war ii is shaken yes 141 countries at the united nations condemned it but can we do something about it can we defend anyone can we ensure that if any country is attacked by the autocratic bloodthirsty regime that a peaceful country can defend itself so i would like to thank american people for all the support we have been getting and i would like to stress on what is it that we asked from the u.s now and that we would like the american people to help us first of course with all the weapons and you know we never asked for the boots on the ground our very motivated armed forces have been able not only not to fall but effectively defend our country but as churchill said during the world war ii give us all the tools and we will do the job our armed forces and all the ukrainians who are defending the country right now definitely are capable to do the job we would like to defend and we will defend our country we don't have any other home we're also asking for sanctions there should be punishment for this behavior and we are very glad that the administration are rolling out the sanctions and today we heard again strong sanctions but this sanction should even be stronger and we believe that we have to completely isolate russia and disconnect cut off it from the global financial system the banking system non-banking institutions but also we're asking that all the cryptocurrency exchanges should stop conducting transactions so there should be no business as usual no business business with russia until it stops this behavior and we are also asking for support four million ukrainians already fled the country mostly women and and children 10 million ukrainians are internally displaced because they are fleeing from the areas like kharkiv marijuan cherny have all the places where there is the active day-to-day war and they flee to the safer place of ukraine so any support that you can uh provide uh whether it's the making your position known or helping some some ukrainians who are in need or voicing your support for congressman's initiatives to support ukraine all of this would be appreciated because ultimately even though 9 000 kilometers are between ukraine and the united states we are much closer we have the same spirit of entrepreneurship we believe in freedom and what unites us with the united states is that we are ready to fight for it and we are fighting the fight that you americans fought a couple of hundred years ago but we also need to be successful in it because it's an existential issue for us an existential issue for the security and freedom in europe so with that i would like to again thank congress thank you congressman for this opportunity to join you on as you rightfully said my uh first and only town hall meeting and for the opportunity to speak go to to your constituency and also it's very symbolic because the california national guard is actually the main counterpart that for the for the previous many years helps to train our armed forces so they are our brothers and sisters who prepared us for this very difficult moment and um we're very grateful for them too i think that's some of the guardsmen who have worked with your soldiers and were very impressed by uh uh by what they saw in ukraine ambassador thank you so much for joining us and the mailer that we sent out in advance of this identified that if people want to help with the relief efforts they can go to usaid.gov and there's a list of organizations but ultimately if i understand you ambassador ukrainians are not looking for free food in poland they're looking for the weapons and the sanctions that will allow them to to reclaim their their country and and reclaim peace so we we ought to do everything we can to help individuals who are displaced but ultimately uh to help a country regain its freedom absolutely congressman thank you thank you ambassador um and uh uh i i know how much you have to do and i know it's 10 15 here in washington so uh i i i understand that you can't join us for the whole town hall but we will be talking about uh about ukraine and i want to tell everyone a little bit about how this town hall operates uh if you'd like to be connected to us you dial star three if you have if when you dial star 3 you have a personal matter where you want my constituent service staff to help you out they're available and most people who dial star 3 will want to be put in the queue so that they can ask a question that we will be heard by thousands of valley residents um we're going to be doing this until about 10 minutes after 8 and you can rsvp to our future town halls by going to bradsherman.house.gov that's for house of representatives dot house dot gov and you can submit a question for our next town hall our next town hall will be april 27th and uh you'll soon be getting the mailer about that one and in these town halls we can talk about whatever subject relevant to congress anybody brings up uh but this town hall has a special emphasis on on ukraine and the next one on april 27th will have a special emphasis on inflation and the cost of living so i'll be uh there are number of people who have submitted questions in advance will be taking some of those uh we'll also take questions from the floor from some who dial star 3 and want to be in the queue i want to put in a pitch for my constituent service team that's on the line we've got scott abrams who heads that team kimberly caceres who joined us this year and let me describe their work imagine a federal agency makes a mistake it could happen it could affect you you call my team at 818-501-9200 and scott or kimberly will work hard they'll solve your problem then brad sherman will take the credit i think it's an excellent system and our office is right there on van nuys boulevard uh in america's best name city sherman oaks um i'll be i'm here in washington today we have votes tomorrow and on friday i'll be at the valley economic alliance event in burbank i'm so pleased that i was able to get the president to sign in the law a hundred and fifty thousand dollars for the valley economic alliance to be used for technical training and uh and technical advice for small businesses in the san fernando valley which are the lifeblood of our local economy um let's let me comment a bit about the issue we've just discussed you should know that uh congress is stepping forward on this every day uh today the house overwhelmingly passed the ukraine invasion war crimes deterrence and accountability act which um uh sets up mechanisms and uh to for us to work to document the war crimes being committed in ukraine and who is responsible for them and there's going to be controversy on the extent to which putin himself is responsible it is difficult in these trials and there's a court in the hague that has tried many of these cases from kosovo and bosnia et cetera um to prove that the top leader actually ordered the vicious murders that we see on the ground but one thing is undeniable and that is putin did violate international law and saw and according to some analysis commit a war crime simply by launching a war of aggression there was no reason for this war and there is only one person who is most responsible for for launching it um in addition today i introduced to congress along with uh 14 cosponsors the russian digital asset sanctions compliance act this is a bill that i've crafted along with uh senator elizabeth warren in the uh in the senate she introduced the bill in the senate a couple weeks ago um russians own about 12 percent of all the cryptocurrency in the world and they are that is very outsized for the size of their economy there's no way the russian economy is 12 of the world um and cryptocurrencies have been used by iran by north korea to evade u.s sanctions and so this bill is designed to uh give the president the authority to make sure that cryptocurrency can't be used to evade american sanctions on russia you heard the ambassador mentioned this is an important thing for us to do the vice minister in the ukrainian government and kiev has also called upon us to do just this and so i'm hoping that elizabeth warren and i are able to pass this legislation second i want to put into context the choices that we have we can do everything to help ukraine and we've done most but not all of what they've asked us to do that can be expensive in terms of the value of the equipment but it's at this point one or two billion dollars so far there are two competing and we can impose every sanction there are two competing considerations uh one is to avoid anything that could escalate and get out of hand even if it's just a one percent chance of starting a war that could even develop into something that was nuclear between the united states and russia and for that's the reason why for example you don't see a single american soldier on the ground that is why we have not imposed a no-fly zone over any part of ukraine a third consideration is the economic pain we want to put putin under pressure we want to deprive him of the ability to to wage this war at the same time pain is not just one way russia is a major oil exporter it's the number three producer in the world and um we have not done absolutely everything that could be done when i say we especially the europeans have not done everything that can be done to turn off the spigot on russian oil um and you there are certain banking sanctions that we could have imposed and that i'm trying to impose and you run up against those who say yes but if the banks aren't a method for paying for the oil then the russians won't sell the oil so for so you've got these three competing competing considerations the liberty and life of ukraine um the economic impact on europe in the united states and of course trying making sure that nothing escalates and as we deal with the individual policy proposals all three of those will come into play and finally you will hear at least a few voices saying well all we need is diplomacy and look american diplomats are available to help mediate this in any way they can uh the u.n is available every nobel peace prize winner is available um but those who say well what all we need is diplomacy some are often saying that to say therefore we shouldn't help ukraine with the defensive weapons that it needs and the fact is that diplomacy isn't going to work unless ukraine is able to defend itself otherwise you just need a diplomat to surrender the entire country to putin and when this uh war began the weight of uh expert analysis was that ukraine would fold in a weak it has not um or at least that its conventional forces would fold in a week and they would be reduced only to carrying on guerrilla operations that's not what happened the ukrainians have inspired the world with their bravery and with their success and frankly the russian forces have been far less effective expected so with that opening statement let's open it up to a question on any subject from someone who's dialed star 3. don who do we have in the queue uh we've got uh zachary from woodland hills about ukraine the zachary you should be on now either thank you congressman for my call and uh thank you for the ambassador for coming on uh my question is i i was an expat actually in ukraine up until december and i'm actually hosting two ukrainians right now in la my first question is why are we trickling in support for ukraine in 100 million dollar increments and don't you think it would be better to give more sooner to save more lives and for russian aggression so to front load the support uh especially now that they'll represent let me deal with that first we are of the classes of weapons that we are willing to provide we are rushing those in as quickly as we can keep in mind we the kinds of weapons that we're giving ukraine are kind of uh the underdogs weapons uh we're not giving them so far tanks oh well so far as of last week tanks we're giving them anti-tank missiles well that's often the weapon of choice for the side in a military of the military that doesn't have tanks or doesn't have many so we are scrounging these up we are buying them from our allies and then on many weapon systems we need soviet weapons or even russian weapons that the ukrainians know how to use and so we are buying those from our new allies in in eastern europe uh poland and uh slovakia the czech republic etc so uh i don't think that we are that we're moving slowly on the things we've decided to move on the bigger issues are tanks and planes there are those and there's been a debate in the administration is it too aggressive does it uh risk escalation to provide uh tanks i do not think so um and uh uh i think we're gonna see american provided tanks uh uh to ukraine soon the uh but that has been a debate and so what slows us down is that that internal debate the other issue has been and it's not just an issue for the u.s but uh our european uh allies as well how do you deliver planes now the planes that ukraine wants are soviet-made migs poland has them poland is willing to give them up if we give them better planes but the issue is the method of delivery poland said we don't want these planes taking off from our territory and flying into the war zone because that's as if our air force base is being used to stage a military attack on on on on russian forces so what poland did is they said well we'll let america have these planes delivered to germany which is in the exact opposite direction of ukraine and then it's up to the americans to figure out how to turn these over to to to ukraine um it is difficult to disassemble these planes and put them on trucks it is thought to be um too aggre perhaps too aggressive to have planes take off from nato territory and and uh and fly into war um one wonders is there a way to fly them into a ukrainian base and have them land before they engage in any military activity etc so what is slow we have not been slow when we decided what to do uh tanks and planes are the two issues um i do think you have a second question but i'm going to limit you to just uh just two questions even though you uh have some expertise being so directly involved with ukraine sorry yeah so this the only issue with that is that i don't see how that prevents fuji and i wonder if you know vladimir putin is going through all the same mental gymnastics when he's deciding to invade uh he clearly is not using tactical nuclear weapons uh he is there there is uh some care there um i mean i can't thank the man for not using technical nuclear weapons but both sides are aware that the things in an extreme circumstance could get out of hand now go ahead i have two i have two ukrainian friends here in los angeles who are on tourist visas we're hosting them um we'd like to host more but the biden administration limited to a hundred thousand family members uh we have plenty of people in woodland hills throughout the san fernando valley who are ready to support ukraine by housing the refugees during during this crisis and so the question is can we do more in terms of allowing the people who are here to have special status and integrate into society knowing that they want to go home knowing that you know every day they say they want to go home to ukraine but obviously now is not a great time to do that so they're they're doing more by being here and they're helping our economy these are talented people i don't understand why congress is not pushing for more refugees even if it's temporary right well uh the vast majority of ukrainians want to stay in ukraine the second largest group want to stay as close to ukraine as possible and even within poland want to stay in eastern poland rather than western poland or want to stay in poland even though uh the accommodations might be a little nicer in germany it's a richer country we have set the number at a hundred thousand i don't think anywhere near that has come in i when we approach that number then it'll be time to consider whether to add to that number but our goal if anything is to applaud ukrainians who have made more of their country free of russian troops um if anything there could be some repatriations to western and central ukraine if if things hold up for another few weeks the way they've been going the last couple of weeks so um i uh i i realize the 100 000 number is small compared to the 44 million ukrainians or even small to the almost 4 million ukrainians who have left their country but it's large compared to those we've let in so far and i think congress is ready to expand that number uh depending on the circumstances um and you're absolutely right the ukrainians you know every ever every country has a variety of people but on balance the ukrainians who come here uh are hard-working and capable and uh if they were temporarily part of our economy would cert would uh would give it a boost uh with that let's go on to the next question okay congressman we have uh arthur who has another question about uh ukraine um uh arthur you should be live now uh hi hi uh first of all thank you ms ambassador thank you congressman i know there's talk about uh trying to excel russia from the human rights area in the united nations can is it possible to take it a step further and excel russia from the security council and perhaps the u.n all together as a practical matter no um russia uh has a veto in the security council and uh that would be the body that would have to take such action uh the u.n is a mixture it is um uh majority non-democratic states and there's a place for everybody including the rogues of the world to get together and talk there should be a separate organization that should have more status and more gravitas than the united nations that should be limited to to democratic countries that doesn't really exist it exists to some degree in the nato organization but that's just u.s and europe it doesn't involve countries in latin america and and asia the g20 plays some of that role and i think we may be able to exclude or minimalize russia's involvement in that um but uh yes the un has all this credibility as speaking for the world but a very significant part of the voting power in the u.n both general assembly and security council is held by countries no more democratic than russia or china so if you imagine an organization of good guys you're imagining a new organization and i think it makes sense to have one uh let's go on to uh well i'll actually go on to one of our written questions and this was submitted by scott mcdonald in burbank and he wanted to ask this of the ambassador but he's going to have to settle for me uh will ukraine ever accept russian acquisition of certain regions in eastern ukraine or is there a sense that armed resistance will continue until russia fully retreats within her borders um the uh you know at the beginning of this year you and since 2014 russia has occupied the crimean peninsula and roughly half of two uh provinces uh uh the ambassador called the moblas which is the the technical or the the the the ukrainian word uh uh the nancy my best effort to pronounce the names of those two provinces um zielinski has pretty much indicated that he's willing to have a ceasefire um in which russia rolls back to the line that it had on the first day of february and so that would leave russia where it was at the beginning of this year which is in occupation of those two areas of of ukraine um in addition zielinski has pretty much indicated that he would agree to a very formal uh renunciation of any possibility of ukraine joining nato uh ukraine would not be joining nato any time this decade even if we hadn't seen this invasion nato as was not about to invite ukraine if we have another question i'll explain why but um so i think zielinski will never and the ukrainian government will never formally accept russian occupation of any part of ukraine's territory but they're certainly willing to stop fighting um uh if there's a withdrawal to where we were on the early this year um let's go on to the next question from the floor okay congressman um we have a question um about uh uh medicare for all actually uh from amnon from sherman oaks amnon you should be on now thank you good evening congressman good evening uh in the mailer that you sent us you talked about medicare for all so yeah first of all i have two questions and by the way is the ambassador still with us or she left no no no she she had to go on okay so my first question is with respect to medicare for all does that you know we're gonna we're gonna limit people to one question we have a huge a huge cue if you could just uh pick the better of your two well both of them are better uh the the medical for all does that mean that the entire country all the citizens will benefit from medical just like people over 65 years of age that's my first question and the second one very very quickly if you don't mind sir regrettably we have uh several members of congress who are abusive abuse their privilege and they vilify the united states they vilify israel uh which is which is the best and most loyal ally of the united states as as we all know they're anti-semites and very very hateful i'm talking about the members of the so-called squad ilhan or mars rashida delayed and so on let me know let me deal briefly with uh with both of those um medicare for all is indeed a system very much like we see in canada where the medical providers the hospitals continue to be in the private sector but the uh the payment system instead of it being a mishmash of private pay private insurance and and medicare is instead handled by medicare that would be a much more efficient system um it'd be a more comprehensive system it would be a system where you did not have those people who are uninsured being charged double and triple what the insurance companies would pay for the same services it's going to take us a long time to get there but that would be the most efficient system to make sure everyone in the country is covered as to anti-israel sentiments in congress in most of the uh of the actions that uh uh you know that come to a floor vote we do have uh between five and ten members of the democratic party who vote against helping israel you often get about three or four members of the republican party who vote the same way and yet i guess for somewhat different reasons the republicans who vote against helping israel are more on the isolationist side whereas the democrats who and it's like you know it's two or three percent of our caucus um do attack israel verbally and they're wrong but uh that's it's hard for it's hard to it's hard not to have uh a small fraction of members of congress be wrong on on this or that subject i've of course been i you know one of the strongest voices for the u.s israel alliance over the last 26 years um with that let's uh move toward one of our survey questions um and the first survey question is should we accept the polish plan in which poland gives us migs and delivers them in germany and then they take off from a u.s military base in germany and head into the war zone um obviously this would help ukraine obviously this would be at least a little bit more involvement of nato territory a it's a different than you have a truck going from poland to ukraine it's not engaged in military activities uh for hundreds of miles thereafter um and it's unloaded in whatever versus you take off from nato territory and fly into the war zone so uh if you think we should accept poland's offer and system for delivery press one if you think we shouldn't press two and if you're undecided or unsure please press three um with that let's go to the next question from the floor okay congressman back to ukraine eva from woodland hills eva you are on now thank you very much uh good evening congressman sherman and i very much appreciate your focus on ukraine and the presence of madame ambassador with us i am posting my question of your local space entrepreneur and investor whose son and our company has a working employees in ukraine my son grant blaisdell is currently on the border of ukraine and poland with his one month four weeks old son who was born exactly on the day of war and his family but my question aspires to your tradition of being particularly sensitive to the importance of space and aerospace industry as a space entrepreneur i support and i am in a contact with ukrainian space scientists and entrepreneurs they represent vital ip vital important part of ukrainian society but also of strategic importance to us they are afraid that their ip and science might fall into the hands of russians my question is very pragmatic down to earth i initiated a project to create in woodland hills next to the former factory of saturn 5 apollo 11 i would call it a safe zone an incubator where we could house the remotely virtually or in real life space entrepreneurs scientists so we can give them a protection and continuation of the very important research would you support or would you be willing to have anything to explore and the plan that we already put in place both sitting here in woodland hills and also on the border of ukraine and with the scientists that i collaborate with in tf obviously this is a complex matter in which you know the individual companies and the individuals involved and we hope very much that the the baby and family are are doing fine um ultimately i want for the ukraine what ukraine had when it became independent and certainly what as a minimum what it had at the beginning of this year you bring up the idea that the russians might be stealing uh ip intellectual property and i think it's ukrainians know how to make sure that that doesn't fall into into russian hands and in fact um the russians have not taken any of ukraine's major cities um the idea that smart aerospace engineers from ukraine would be working in woodland hills makes me happy because i represent woodland hills but i would be just as happy if we could get back to the world that ukraine had at the beginning of this year and ukrainians could be our partners in companies uh doing business in ukraine so uh there may be um a particular immigration and licensing things that you'd want to talk to our constituent service team about and look this is the middle of of a war and um the last couple of weeks it's been going well for ukraine and one can imagine that virtually all the displaced ukrainians will be able to go back home perhaps need reconstruction go back home to a place where some of the apartment buildings are no longer functional but go back home on the other hand um uh we'll have to see how this develops and obviously if bright capable ukrainians decide to to leave ukraine or can't stay in ukraine because uh the russians take uh take their homes [Music] and it'd be good to have good people working in woodland hills let's give the results of the last question uh for the polish uh plan to deliver the migs uh 50 30 correction yes is 48 percent no is 17 unsure is 35 um let's uh do another survey question and this is also about ukraine and also has um uh some background um the world burns about 98 million barrels of oil a day and russia produces 7.8 million the price of oil is what economists would call uh elastic that is to say if you just have in produced in the world five percent more oil than the world has a use for the price goes down and if instead the amount of oil being produced is just five percent less than what people want to use the price goes up a lot certainly more than five percent now as a result of uh our sanctions russia which used to uh export 7.8 uh uh million barrels um is exporting five million barrels a day on the top of the table and they're using sneaky devices to sell another million barrels a day under the table and the good news there is what they sell under the table they have to take like a one-third discount already in order to sell so um the europeans well and and and and some in america do not want to see a further reduction in the amount of russian oil that's in the world market on the other hand we have the financial power to drive down further the amount of oil that russia is able to export using sanctions against banks etc as a matter of fact all the banks we haven't sanctioned uh we haven't sanctioned because that would reduce russian oil exports so the question here is should we use our all our financial power to decrease further the amount of oil that russia is able to export knowing that that will have an effect on world oil prices and the price at the pump if you think we should do a lot more to reduce russia oil exports push one for yes if you don't think we should do so press two for no and if you're undecided or unsure uh press three with that let's take another question from the floor okay uh moving back to uh non-ukraine question uh mark from sherman oaks uh environmental question uh climate change green new deal i believe uh mark you are on now hi there congressman thank you so much for taking my question um yeah my my question is about uh you know in your town hall uh reminder email yesterday uh you wrote at length about your environmental bona fides and credentials which is great uh but to my knowledge you have not co-sponsored the green new deal for public schools uh the greener deal for public housing or i believe the green new deal for cities and states uh all of which take the missouri steps to transition us away from fossil fuels and invest in protecting our climate for us and for future generations uh your re-election campaigns have also accepted approximately quarter million dollars from weapons manufacturers and over 5 million from wall street and big banks all of whom make in an enormous profit off of the extraction of fossil fuels so my question is how can we expect you to be the leader that we need when it comes to combating climate change and expedition expeditiously excuse me transitioning us away from fossil fuels when you rely so heavily on companies and individuals who are so deeply invested in the fossil fuel industry um i don't know where you get those numbers uh there are over 100 bills pending and that have been introduced over the last several years designed to pull us away from fossil fuels and i have worked on many and co-sponsored many you've identified a few uh that i have not co-sponsored uh as to the idea that um [Music] any entity in our economy um is reliant to some degree on fossil fuels that's true i drive a car you drive a car and uh so you could say well the sherman you took a contribution from a credit union [Music] executive and the credit union's loan money for cars and that is true um the fact is that we as a society are users of fossil fuels and as environmentalists are trying to uh to get away from that and we have to do that one step at a time but i voted for the carbon tax clear back in the 1990s uh when the vast majority of democrats particularly in the senate would not do so so uh i do think that uh i do you know i do drive a car i can't afford a tesla um [Music] but and uh i do deal with um a lot of other people who drive cars who make car loans uh who sell cars um and that's got to apply to uh to other fossil fuel uses as well but i thank you i thank you for your question and i uh i don't think you'll find many members from southern california who have as long and deeper record on environmentalism as i do in part because i've been doing it for such a long time um with that let's go on to the next question all right congressman we have a uh back to ukraine um we have uh estelle uh i don't know where she's calling from but uh estelle you are on now hi uh thank you for taking my call i'm in light of the a previous caller i wanted to loot back to him asking you about israel and you're talking about your support for israel and i wonder about your support for palestinian human beings there's two people that live in the land that some call israel and some call palestine and i would love to hear you talk about your support for the millions of palestinians who have been living under military occupation for decades in conditions that every major human rights organization both israeli and american and international have now written reports to show how it meets the definition of apartheid well it's certainly uh israeli is certainly not an apartheid state and in fact uh that has been rejected uh by for example the a minister who serves in the israeli government who is palestinian by ethnicity uh what we now you i guess you could say holland is an apartheid state because there's a border around holland and it's drawn so as to include those people who are dutch and uh not to include the the people who are german who are on the other side of the border uh hey you know denmark uh the border there is drawn to include things and to exclude nondanes um and ultimately israel uh every country uh especially in the modern world has minority groups but israel is a homeland for the jewish people and needs borders between itself and an independent palestinian state the problem is that palestinian leaders have been decade after decade unwilling to [Music] reach a peace settlement in which they would get an independent state and i uh what you see instead is and you saw that the president sadat of egypt reached out to try to create peace and then was assassinated by the enemies of peace and since then um very few arab leaders have been willing to step forward um the the fact is that uh the position of uh of of hamas is that all jews must be ethnically cleansed from the middle east uh from the river the jordan river to the sea um palestine shall be free and the middle east shall be uten free um the position of the palestinian authority is more nebulous but they take the position that any arabic speaking person who claims that they or any of their ancestors ever lived in the holy land has the right to extend to move there with their entire extended family so while on occasion you get the palestinian authority saying they're for two states it's only with the understanding that they both be arab states um and uh so i i i does the israeli government occasionally make mistakes everyone does um and you can certainly uh researching the activities of seven million people find this or that mistake um but the real uh problem here is the unwillingness of the palestinian side to accept a two-state solution and really their demand for the ethnic cleansing of all jews from the holy land and that's why you've seen so many arab leaders even depart from that position and say look we're just going to have a reasonable relationship with israel it's a country in our region and we can't wait for the day when those anti-semites who hate all jews worldwide or at least just hate the existence of jews in the middle east finally get over it we're just going to go ahead and have a relationship with israel you saw that with the abrahamic accords just a week or so ago so um uh i i very much uh look forward to to to peace in the area and two states and i don't think it's apartheid to say that you have a border between one country and another drawn so that uh that you know the dutch are on one side and the germans are on the other uh let's go to the next question uh should we use uh financial power to decrease oil exports from russia yes 70 percent no 10 unsure 20 percent uh we have uh an audience here uh that uh i think has been inspired by the ukrainian people and is willing to to pay the costs and take the risks uh involved in providing as much assistance to ukraine as we can um let's see i um we'll go to uh one more survey question do you approve of president biden's uh performance as president so far so this is not just ukraine across the board if you approve of uh what he's uh of his performance as president press one disapprove 2 unsure 3. let's go on to the next question from the floor all right congressman it's ryan from studio city who has a question about the nato resolution the house considered the other day ryan you are um live now thanks thanks for taking the call of yesterday i think it was yesterday there was a house resolution expressing support for nato and principles of democracy could could you comment on that and what does it mean if anything and then maybe comment on the fact that so many of your colleagues didn't support it well um trump was uh somewhat hostile to nato um all of the recent u.s presidents have been calling upon uh nato countries to spend more on their own defense uh the person who's been most eloquent at that has been vladimir putin and you as a result of this invasion you're seeing major increases in german and other european expenditures but um it's one thing to urge european countries to spend more on their own defense it's another thing to take kind of the anti-nato hostile rhetoric that we saw in the last administration unfortunately there's certainly to some degree in the republican party a belief that well whatever trump says we're supposed to do today that's what we're going to do and so you're talking about a resolution that was mostly you know an expression of opinion of the opinion of the house it wasn't by a major piece of legislation uh that expressed our support for the principles of nato and uh i uh believe it passed by quite a margin but it's unfortunate some people voted against it uh let's go on to the next question okay congressman the next question is from uh ralph uh i don't know where you're calling from ralph but you are on now thank you for taking my question uh congressman sherman and uh thank you for your service to our and ralph what town i live in northridge and uh you know i appreciated the uh written uh communications you sent in in preparation for this and lots of things on there that are worth talking about but the one that i want to pick up on are the recent laws against abortion passed in texas and i think it's mississippi the most recent one right or it's it's on on the dock so i i want to i you know i believe that what you've you've advocated for the women's right to choose and i support that too but as a physician um i think that you know abortion should can be or should be considered from the perspective of a medical procedure and um i think that uh i wonder if you would be willing to be one one um person in in you know in congress or at a high level of our government who would take a different approach besides the push pushing back and forth about a women's right to choose which which is important i think is valid but it doesn't seem to be working to stop you know these people and take another angle which is the medical angle and that is to to consider whether whether to to look into the the fact that internationally laws against abortion do not increa decrease the rate of abortion actually what they do is they shift the ratio of legal versus illegal abortions the latter sort of course you know having the same outcome for the you know unfortunate uh fetus right but more often harming or killing the woman and that of course has a lot of cultural factors and and things like that but um taking and then i wonder what what does reduce what reduces the number of abortions is the availability of contraception and the availability of basic sex education and those are things that i've always supported and had sometimes wonder when you see someone who speaks against abortion then opposes the sex education or the distribution of contraception uh that would reduce uh uh the number of abortions uh if a woman um wants to terminate a pregnancy um there are now uh three ways to do so do so in your own town go somewhere else if god forbids abortion services are not available in your town or uh use the new far relatively new pharmaceuticals which i don't think any of these state laws is going to be effective in preventing the distribution and uh all you know all three of these choices ought to be available to women of course in oklahoma that may not be the case and uh it is uh we're going to have to see what the supreme court does roe v wade was correctly decided and um hopefully the supreme court will have i mean clearly a majority of the supreme court would not have voted for roe v wade had they been there at the time but hopefully the justices have enough respect for precedent uh that they will enforce the roe v wade approach if they don't then women in oklahoma are either going to have to rely on pharmaceuticals get an illegal abortion in oklahoma or travel some distance and for some that will be easy and for some it will not so um i couldn't agree more that uh abortion is a medical service like so many other medical services that ought to be available for poor women it ought to be available [Music] under medicare medicaid the same way that other medical services are and uh we'll hope that the supreme court sticks with its precedent i think okay we have the results of the last on biden's approval we've got 69 percent approved 23 percent disapprove eight percent unsure that is only a little less than uh the last time we asked that question which i believe was our march town hall and uh while i'm mentioning a prior town hall let me remind people of our upcoming town hall on the 27th of this month uh and uh you can dial in at 8 55 9 20 0 5 4 8 at 7 pm on april 27th i think we have time for if i can keep my answers relatively short two more questions uh so uh oh uh tell you what we'll take uh one question from the floor then we may take one more rsvp question all right congressman uh one more question about ukraine uh and it's from uh joyce joyce euron now i had asked my question earlier about the uh red line and i don't think we got really an answer from you congressman about the sentiment in the congress about what we're watching and what we're not going to do and how long we can take that position and are we really anticipating a threat of nuclear or chemical attacks um i don't i don't know if you've asked that question before right this is the first i've heard it from you but obviously people want to know oh the the red line is nato territory uh the fuzziest part of the line uh is cyber we have over hundreds of years developed international law about territorial integrity etc dealing with borders and all almost all of wars are fought about somebody crossing a border uh cyber um is something that our international law has yet to really catch up with or international doctrines uh another area that is is vague is what level of atrocity taking place outside of nato territory would be so severe that the united states would get directly involved and you mentioned for example the use of chemical weapons so um at this point i think uh the only line we have where american troops would shoot russians would be a an invasion over the physical border of the nato state that being said we will be sending weapons as quickly as we can uh to ukraine subject to as we've discussed here there's arguments inside the biden administration on on planes and tanks and similar larger systems i very much hope and expect that the tanks will be getting to ukraine soon um uh let's see we now have a an rsvp question that i'll deal with as quickly as i can from deborah reynolds who says i i would uh like to know if you plan to give input concerning the appointment of the faa director um and uh she talks about a noise and air pollution with the next gen system that the faa has imposed um absolutely yes 19 of us have come together under what we call the quiet skies caucus not to be confused with quiet organizations locally in the valley to say that the president must appoint someone who's not just focused on the airline industry but is focused on reducing the noise pollution uh that we focus particularly on on the metroplex [Music] new system which has brought an intolerable amount of noise to studio city into some a number of other valley neighborhoods i have supported a package of legislation designed to reduce airport noise including the restore everyone sleep tonight act which authorizes each airport to have a curfew people don't realize even the airport owners are not allowed to impose a curfew under the present pro-airline statutes that exist in the united states also the quiet communities act which would create inside the epa because the faa is somewhat captured by the airline by the airlines so it's the epa where the tradition is to fight for the environment where we need an office of noise abatement and finally i pushed for and got a gao study of of noise levels in the san fernando valley the ga reported that the faa's measure of noise does not provide a clear picture of the noise levels at different locations that's why i've joined in introducing the decrease noise level act we do have a weak curfew at burbank 10 pm to 7 am we have a much stronger curfew but still some exceptions for uh law enforcement etc uh 10 p.m to 7 a.m out of van nuys uh but we'd like to be able to live our lives both day and night without the truly excessive amount of noise that is coming from both burbank and van nuys airports um our vendor charges us a whole lot more if i go more than roughly one more minute so i'm going to invite people to listen to the uh the tone that you'll hear and the voicemail system and please leave your email address even if i already have it because i'm not allowed to send you emails unless i get your email address from you um at least i'm not allowed to send you emails at some times and in some ways unless i get the email address from you and i want to send you a reminder of the april 27 town hall you can rsvp to that town hall at bradsherman.house.gov you can express an opinion or leave a comment or a question on the voicemail system i'm not going to listen tonight but i will listen tomorrow and we'll keep in touch i look forward to flying to the san fernando valley on friday and uh to seeing as as many people out there as we can i want to once again voice my thanks to the ambassador for joining us and i want to thank thousands of valley residents for spending their evening with us as well thank you very much this is congressman brad sherman

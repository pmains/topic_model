hello I'm congressman Bennie Thompson I represent Mississippi the second congressional district I am the top Democrat on the committee or Homeland Security nearly everyone outside the White House accepts the intelligence community's conclusion that Russia carried out the hacking campaign in an attempt to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election in this week and Donald Trump's juniors emails we saw the first public evidence that the Trump campaign eagerly intended to collude with Russia this shocking new evidence raises even graver questions about Russia's success infiltrating the election systems in 21 states and stealing voting records containing personal information all of this has damaged America's faith in our democracy and confidence in the security of our voting systems in fact just this week one poll found one in four respondents reported that they may not vote in the next election because of cyber security concerns this is not acceptable Congress must act and act immediately we must get the truth about Russia's meddling and the full extent of the Trump's campaign complicity but we must also take action to protect our elections in our election infrastructure next time this is where House Democrats launch the Congressional task force on election security which I'm proud to co-chair with congressman Brady from Pennsylvania this task force's central mission is to focus on how to bolster the cyber and physical security of our election system ahead of the 2018 election it will be a forum for members of Congress to hear from experts in cyber security and election infrastructure and identify actions that should be taken to help ensure the integrity of our election systems and guard against future attacks while elections are the exclusive responsibilities of the states the federal government has a responsibility to step up and help where needed to support States as they work to prevent the Russians or other bad actors from disrupting and interfering with our elections protecting the integrity of our election system should not be a partisan concern we hope House Republicans will join us unfortunately we have a president who shows no interest in preventing last year's election interference from happening again the Department of Homeland Security is also wavering over whether election infrastructure should be designated part of our country's critical infrastructure here in Congress Republican leaders have displayed no appetite to tackle this critical homeland security issue even hold hearings if we continue to do nothing we make it easy for Russia and other nefarious actors to meddle in future elections we must put politics aside for the good of the country and work together on this and so many other important issues to the American people I thank you for your attention and urge you to stay engaged our democracy demands your involvement

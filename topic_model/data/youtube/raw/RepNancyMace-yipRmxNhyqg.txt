sandra for more on the house republicans investigation into taxpayer funding for the wuhan lab let's bring in south carolina congresswoman nancy mace she is a member of the house oversight and reform committee congresswoman good to see you today we do know that u.s taxpayer money through the national institutes of health went to the wuhan laboratory it was not supposed to go for gain of function research but what more do you want to know about how our money was spent absolutely it's a huge problem republicans were told last year when they when they voted the lab leaked idea that they were conspiracy theorists um we do need to get to the bottom of it and there are a couple ways we can do that we can do that through judiciary or oversight and you just heard ranking member republican ranking member jamie comer uh mentioned that we need to investigate it on the oversight committee or judiciary to find out the source of what paid what do we what do we use with those funds for what was it paid for did we study that viruses and their impact on on human life uh that's an answer that we've got to have we're 15 months out from covid19 and we still have very few answers on how it all started dr anthony fauci has insisted that nih money was not used at the wuhan lab for gain of function research but when pressed last week at a senate appropriations committee hearing by louisiana senator john kennedy uh found she sounded like he wasn't able to confirm a hundred percent whether that didn't happen listen here have you ever had a grantee lie to you i cannot guarantee that a grantee has not lied to us because you never know so he's never he has not known a grantee to lie to him but he's not known if they haven't lied to him when it comes to china do we think that they're telling the truth about all this i think we should be very distrusting of china at this point and if the money wasn't spent on gain of function research then what was it spent on and why can't dr fauci answer the question dr fauci hasn't been exactly honest throughout covet 19 as we all know and i think that should be pointed out it's an honest question that the american people should have answered there's a lot of revisionist history that's going on now among the u.s media who a year ago were dismissing uh the suggestion that this thing came out of a lab as more conspiracy theorists that were uh probably you know fostered by people who wore tin foil hats what do you say to the media now that was so quick to dismiss this a year ago and is now saying you know there's growing credence for this idea this great irony because when president former president trump talked about a potential lab leak from the wuhan lab last year he was laughed off by the press and just a week or two ago you had a new york times reporter blaming former president trump for not having all the answers and not investigating whether or not it was released out of a lab and there's there's enormous irony here and really quite frankly with as many deaths and as much as this has impacted the american people we should have answers and we should have an honest and free press that demands those answers regardless of what the result is and regardless if we like or dislike the answer to that question so it's so important that it's investigated and appreciate reporters like fox news and wall street journal who are demanding answers and doing that investigation and asking the right questions congresswoman i wanted to talk to you about an issue that's become very personal for you and this is that the right to organize bill that a lot of pro-union people are pushing your home was vandalized over the weekend graffiti spread on your home your front porch the sidewalk out in front by people who are trying to put pressure on you to either support this bill or if not at least temper your opposition what do you say about what happened well there's been political violence that's been rampant throughout our country it's gaining steam it's sad it's a sad day to see this kind of division in america we all should be safe in our own personal homes regardless of our political beliefs and who if whoever did this vandalized my home thinks that i'm going to be intimidated by this kind of action they can think again because i'm not going to stop working for the people that elected me to do a job and that means that i've got to take tough stances ask tough questions and and be out front and help lead us out of this pandemic and do the right thing for this country we have millions of people that are out of work i'm a staunch right-to-work supporter south carolina has a right to work state um there were anarchists and and tifa's symbols that were graffitied on my home and it's wrong and i'm not going to stop until i get all the answers and whomever did this i hope local law enforcement they're working hard but they will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law no matter what side of the political alley you sit it's really a shame when things like this happen congresswoman nancy mace of south carolina is always good to see you thank you for joining us thank you

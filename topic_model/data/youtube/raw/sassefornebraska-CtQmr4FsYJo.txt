hi i'm ben sass candidate for u.s senate it's not often that i get to talk about college football one of my favorite topics on our campaign trail but it looks like president obama has just given me the opportunity you see the obama administration seems to think that everything is a federal issue now including college football last week the national labor relations board who were appointed by president obama decided that college football players at northwestern university are the equivalent of full-time employees and therefore can form a labor union due to obamacare college athletic departments must provide maternity coverage to 18-year-old boys think about that in this strange new world that president obama apparently lives in college athletes are now employees and since there are typically more than 50 employees on a typical college football team it means that colleges have suddenly become large employers under obamacare and must provide obamacare approved health care coverage which includes maternity coverage this is insane this is what happens whenever everything becomes governmental when washington gets to have an opinion about everything it means that unelected bureaucrats get to decide by fiat that young men need maternity coverage of course like all rulings this one can supposedly be appealed to the full nlrb you remember these folks they're the people who got their jobs because after president obama couldn't get them confirmed through the senate he decided to use recess appointments to circumvent the senate even though the senate wasn't really in recess look i'm a college president and i'll be the first to tell you that college football is far from perfect but if you think that unelected bureaucrats will make it better well you might be a labor lawyer i'm ben sasse and i'm running for senate to repeal obamacare the entire obamacare worldview that goes with it and to keep d.c bureaucrats out of college football go big red

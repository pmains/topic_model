i thank the gentlelady for yielding me the time you know mr speaker i cringe often when i hear people talk about the 1960s as the civil rights movement i always put an s on that the stone rebellion was in 1739. it was a civil rights movement denmark visa's insurrection was 1822. it was a civil rights movement the niagara movement that led to the creation of the naacp more than 100 years ago was the civil rights movement john lewis and i met in october 1960 at a civil rights movement as long as there are people held in suppression there will always be a movement for civil rights however in any movement there will be a few sometimes only one that rises head and shoulders above all others and so it was with my good friend john robert lewis when we met the weekend of october 13 14 15 1960 on the campus of mohawk's college there was a little bit of an insurrection taking place we were college students felt that we knew how best to do things we were not listening to martin luther king jr and a few others and so we asked king to meet with us and he did we went into the meeting around 10 o'clock in the evening we did not walk out of that room until four o'clock the next morning i came out of that room haven't had a soul to paul transformation i have never been the same since but listen to king's plea for non-violence i decided along with most others to accept non-violence as a tactic but not john lewis he internalized it it became his way of life and after going through a few issues of the 60s you know john got elected president of snik in 1963 and was summarily dethroned in 1966 but john then joined the effort the voter education project where he directed that was sponsored by the southern regional council and as he served as the director of the voter education project headquartered in atlanta i became the chair of the voter education project in charleston south carolina and we continued that relationship he got married to a librarian i got married to a librarian though i did so before he did and they became fast friends lillian and emily became fast friends i will never ever get john robert lewis out of my system because he succeeded where i failed it was a tactic for me it was a way of life for john lewis and our year back

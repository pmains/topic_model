congressman adam schiff is a democrat representing california's 28th congressional district he sits in the bipartisan committee investigating january 6th and he joins me now are you surprised by jim jordan's uh statement that he will not voluntarily cooperate and provide testimony to the committee i have to say i'm not that surprised by it uh you know he said he had nothing to hide and then he decided well i guess i guess i have a lot to hide um it's uh it's unfortunate but it is who he is uh and uh and and we will do our best to figure out how do we respond to members of congress who refuse to uh comply voluntarily um whether that is compulsion or whether that is trying to find uh the evidence uh using other means but look he acknowledged talking to trump on the day of the attack on the capitol uh and in terms of that conversation um there are only two people unless there were others in the room during that conversation who can really speak to what went on uh so we obviously would like him to come in but his decision not to not all that's surprising um because i assume that he reached the conclusion if he came in told the truth um it would put him at odds with the former president uh and he just doesn't have the courage to do that i want you to respond to the the accusation that's leveled by jordan others that that this is a violation of of legislative norms by by asking for voluntary cooperation from fellow members of congress on the course of an inquiry that that's you know reckless and beyond the pale and and you've crossed some threshold that you're going to regret crossing well you know the most recent precedent was in the russia investigation and during the time uh as i recall uh when nunes was the chairman so republican chairman i think that's right we had we extend invitations to two members of congress one republican one democrat um and they both came in and gave voluntary testimony and whether it was during nunes or when i became chair um either way there was no objection by members of congress to it and no objection by the members that were asked they came in they did what they should do um but uh but here um you know it certainly appears from these two both perry and jordan that nothing matters quite so much as staying in the good graces of donald trump uh and you know chris i have to say watching those clips and and reading senator round's statement um and see him refer to the facts of the election and refer to them not in a gaslighting way you you find yourself um you know just uh pleased and admiring that someone would speak the plain truth the bar has become that low speaking the facts about a presidential election apparently uh you know makes you a hero now in the gop uh but that's where we are that's where we are in trump's republican party uh and it's why it's hard to get these members to come and testify well here's i think here's a great example um uh uh julie sirkin uh reporting on john thune's reaction soon has occasionally come under criticism from trump for stating the plain fact uh and and this is just sort of an example of a kind of weasley cowardice here well i say to my colleague welcome to the club he joked i don't think that relitigating and rehashing the pass is a winning strategy i mean i think if we want to be a majority in january 2023. this is the most that soon or anyone will muster which is a kind of like instrumental tactical argument for why indulging this truly dangerous lie that resulted in a deadly insurrection is maybe not the best thing to do politically but that's about as far as anyone will go other than romney you know sadly i think that's right um and and even more sad to my point of view is the point you were making earlier which is it looked like it was going to be different a year ago in the aftermath of that terrible tragic day uh it looked like the republican party was going to finally recognize the disastrous ends to which donald trump had brought the country and they weren't going to go along with this big lie and they didn't expect anybody else to go along with that big lie not even sean hannity expected the party to adhere that big lie um but a year later they're more wedded to it than ever and they're using it of course around the country to usher in these laws attacking the the democratic infrastructure of the country uh and in that sense you know it's such a terrible but factual statement that our democracy is on on weaker ground now than it was a year ago let me ask you about uh vice president mike pence there's been a lot of reporting about there's a new york times story today i'll read you the headline pence and january 6 committee engage in high stakes dance over testimony and i'll read you a portion of this mr pence they said these are sources around i guess the ex-vice president has grown annoyed the committee is publicly signaling it has secured a greater degree of cooperation from his top aides it actually has something he sees as part of a pattern of democrats trying to turn his team against mr trump is that what you were engaged in no we'd just like him to come in and share with us what he knows and i hope that he will um you know i'm sure that he is weighing that same calculus that jim jordan and others have weighed but i would hope that he would show greater patriotism than we see from someone like jim jordan um he knows what's right for the country uh he knows what happened in the election he knows the pressure campaign he was under and he knows he could do a service the country by talking about it um but he also knows that there's a political cost that will come with that uh i hope he makes the right decision that's all we can we can hope for um but uh in terms of you know how much cooperation or non-cooperation we're getting from people around him uh you know i'm not gonna comment on that uh all i can say is um that uh the vice president has very material testimony and we hope he'll do the right thing you know congressman when i was about 14 15 years old as a 5 foot 5 inch backup backup jv point guard i had a moment when i realized i was not going to be an nba player and it was actually liberating for what i was able to do with the rest of my life after that and i think mike pence could have that moment with the presidency of the united states might be good for everyone congressman adam schiff thank you very much for your time thanks chris

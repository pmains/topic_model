uh thank you congresswoman mccollum uh just a pr uh appreciation for your leadership uh this type of funding has been a godsend for so many families you know washington county's uh mission and goal has always been to uh do what we can to address the homelessness and also just as important keeping people in their homes and we appreciate your support for providing what you could for us but one of the things you touched on is to build back better the infrastructure component of it we're keenly interested in that there's a significant need for uh expanding broadband i i know commissioner maron is working with the city of scandia and looking at uh partnerships to expand the broadband but uh you know we uh we as you well know it uh if you're going to get something done it depends on the partnerships you have and we're blessed with uh the partnerships of stillwater woodbury oakdale the full gambit all of our communities uh we really enjoy some great partnerships congresswoman uh nicole i would i would speak on that a little bit because i do have a couple friends that are in the restaurant uh restaurant business and and they really appreciated the the funds and that helped them through but now one of the most precious resources are human resources and and he uh that's one of the most challenging is that no matter what he pays he can't get somebody in the door if they're in the door they are gone within a couple days doing something else so that is one of the challenges and whether that is the investment into more training more uh more opportunities to you know as all businesses and even my business uh trying to get people to get out and get out in the field or finding the right training is important one of the things that is challenging too is we all experience is the inflation part of it is that you have a tough time getting supplies but then when you do get the supplies the the price is going up and the margins are being uh uh squished to put it you know put it that way in that uh and that's even i think a story about mcdonald's today about they're raising their prices and at what point do people then start not going out to uh restaurants and being able to go out to restaurants as they're being challenged with uh different things too so i think it's still going to be a need for our restaurants and the service industry and certain businesses to be supported as they move forward as we get through hopefully this transitory inflation issue inflation issue and get back to normal times we i don't know what normal is anymore but uh to getting to that point and uh just keeping them going until we get more of what we are used to trend of being able to get people not afraid uh able to go out there and and get out there so yes any support that they can get and we all know they're very creative business owners are very very creative and i don't say that just because i am one but i just know see and hear on a regular basis the amazing things that they come up with to keep things going because that's their life what else they don't know anything else so anything that we can do to provide that extra lifeboat or to keep them going because we do know eventually these are the people who are keeping ours in our area people employed and able to do and uh providing the success for many people so any help at all would be appreciated congresswoman mccollum as you know your uh my entire district is in your district and uh we have reserved 10 million dollars of that arpa money and we have had many businesses not only in my district but throughout the county small businesses approaching us about need to uh find employment so we're really looking the board's gonna have a workshop on how we can support our small businesses they they really appreciate the past money cares money with this arpa money they can not only uh stabilize yourself but grows we're looking in the area of technical help i.t needs for them to grow we're looking in the area of uh employment to grow uh the board are gonna have a workshop on this in the next month or two um we've already assigned some arpa money to uh high school programs throughout our county for career pathways to help our small businesses and students that could get a really good technical job and then recently we were approached by lakeview hospital to uh invest in a ventilator uh they don't have other resources to uh buy that ventilator and uh we're making sure there aren't other federal or other sources of more appropriate funding but at the same token we want to respond quickly to that need uh to save lives so uh there's still a big need for small businesses that we value much and most of our new businesses are small so we're really going to be looking at that as one of the future ways to use some of the available money that we're uh is uh still there for uh critical planning thank you kevin carver with washington county um you know one of the things that we're really proud of in the county is the work that our staff have done to provide rental assistance you know the the money flowed through the cares act from the county directly and now arpa uh we've gotten some money through the state's allocation through arpa and cares as well as our own direct allocations um and while the i think the message nationally was that it took a while to get that resource out to people um our county put some extra effort in working with minnesota housing and we were one of the counties that did a really nice job of getting the allocated funding to our county out to our residents in the form of rental assistance and part of what that assistance could do is pay for utility bills and so back utility costs are even moving forward with that success so congresswoman i will tell you that we have expended most of the dollars through the emergency rental assistance both phase one and phase two and we've had to start to kind of phase back our eligibility and kind of control costs so we can make sure our assistance kind of gets us through the winter so instead of being able to kind of pay a month ahead for people that are struggling with their rental costs we're now just paying arrears and current current month and so it's a little more difficult for folks to keep up i would say that that we've got some money that's not allocated yet under arpa but i don't think that would come anywhere close to what the need might be on this uh utility assistance um you know if you're seeing your your heating bills double or triple for some residents that are both homeowners and renters that are low income that's going to be a lot of money that's going to be needed to help those people uh you know quote unquote weather that storm i think and so we're going to need uh probably some help with those traditional programs that help with the assistance with utilities along with the rental assistance that we're doing so we can play a role we can help i think but i think the needs can be much larger than what the county could do on its own um we do believe that we can use these arp dollars for much needed public infrastructure funding specifically related to sewer and water infrastructure so these are times when outside federal funding is and will continue to be critical for woodbury as we navigate the pfas contamination as well as aging systems and our growing the city has a long-term commitment to providing well-managed public infrastructure and these arp dollars have allowed the city to plan respond and implement during these uncertain times continued support for federal funding and infrastructure especially areas related to sustainable drinking water will have major impacts on our existing and future residents as well as a workforce in the city of woodbury the city has a long-term commitment to investing in its infrastructure systems both new construction and reinvestment projects and we're continuing to navigate this new topic of pfas contamination so there's there's a lot more for us to learn and we look forward to sort of fully digesting the final rule and determining how the six million dollars of arp funds will be put into use over the next couple two years here uh prior to that 2024 deadline so thank you again very much for holding this uh this hearing this event and we're very grateful for your partnership and assistance well water is a important resource and until it's polluted or you can't use it or you go to look for it and it's gone right people don't really put a tag on that resource and so i'm all about protecting water um all the time and um and then when when it needs when people need help and accessing potable drinking water i want to be there to do that too so so thank you for for sharing

[Music] democratic lawmakers urging americans to follow the science for over a year so why are those same leaders slow to do it now south carolina republican congresswoman nancy mace is calling on house speaker nancy pelosi to lift the mask mandy in the house of representatives she joins us now by the way we did reach out to speaker pelosi we have not yet heard back well hello congresswoman good to have you here so what is the rule right now you have to wear the mask on the house floor unless you're not unless you're speaking correct correct we are required even though 75 percent of congress that we know about is already vaccinated we're still required to wear the mask inside the chamber except for when we're speaking and everyone says follow the science but the science obviously isn't following the politics of nancy pelosi and she's just using us i don't even know why anymore but it's just it's insanity we have the we're the one place in the country where if you're going to have herd immunity we've got it and we should be leading our country and showing people how to safely move forward with covet 19 for those who are vaccinated have house members been given any sort of reason for this considering the cdc's brand new guidance on mass that if you're vaccinated you can drop the mask none whatsoever and in fact we heard dr fauci today say that the reason that they decided to tell people to wear masks inside even though you were vaccinated was more about optics than it was about science and nancy pelosi is following that same rule of thumb i think she's virtue signaling i mean look at the joint session that we had with president biden and you had a nancy pelosi standing behind him everybody's double vaxxed double masked and six feet apart and this is not this is not leadership right now during covid19 we need to show people not to be afraid that vaccinating is safe and that people should get it done so they can go back to work go back to school and go back to being a free country again well interestingly democratic leadership congresswoman is shifting blame to republicans for the mass mandate that is still in place take a listen to the vice chair of the house democratic caucus today guidelines are also very clear that workplaces can decide their own unique characteristics based on their conditions and i think we would agree that the house floor is unique condition especially with republicans admitting that only 75 percent of their members are vaccinated your reaction to that congresswoman well quite frankly we have a real opportunity to lead our country and show them how it's done and the 75 percent figure doesn't even take into account the number of people who've already had covet 19 and may have some level of immunity right now you can take precautions if you want to wear a mask then so be it every democrat that wants to wear a mask or republican should be able to wear a mask but for those who like myself i had a really severe case of covid19 i've been vaccinated i had two vaccinations i should be able to have the choice on wearing that mask or not that's that's the choice that it should be and it's just simply not right now yeah interestingly enough we saw the president touring that ford facility today in dearborn michigan still wearing his mask and distancing although that could have been a rule within that facility we don't know but in many cases he's still wearing it the vice president is still wearing it as you just said nancy pelosi still wearing it meanwhile we know lawmakers are huddling with the president trying to hash out some sort of deal we obviously know your party is criticizing this administration for for pushing these massive spending plans and as i was speaking to senator braun top of the hour he was saying how in so many cases he doesn't see any republican proposals proposals in these spending plans congresswoman you've always been good about finding common ground so can your party come to some sort of bipartisan solution with president biden well it's not for lack of trying i know that a number of republicans have met with the biden administration on multiple occasions now trying to find a way to make a deal on this infrastructure package the problem is we're just so far apart and this infrastructure proposal initially was so bad the administration had to rename it to the american jobs plan and so right now the number is too big and only six percent of it that they're talking about only six percent of that package would actually go to roads and bridges one percent to airports less than one percent to our waterways in ports that's not infrastructure when you're spending a hundred billion dollars on school lunches rather than traditional infrastructure no one's going to be able to agree on that it needs to be a much smaller package and it needs to be singularly focused on traditional infrastructure to find a bipartisan way forward in my opinion all right congresswoman nancy mace thanks for joining us and give us an update on what happens with the house floor mask mandate we'll see if anything changes thank you thank you

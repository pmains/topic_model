Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy joins us now to discuss this a little bit further Senator thank you so much for your time today and for joining us the White House Now pointed the finger Republicans saying that Republicans are going to raise gas prices on the American people after we've seen gas prices you know sky rocket essentially since Joe Biden took office your reaction to that you know they must sit in the back room and figure out how are we going to spend this so that we evade the the blame the fact that they have not permitted as was just pointed out not permitted new refineries they subsidize effectively the conversion of present refineries into going into alternative fuels and they and they refuse to acknowledge all the house legislation effectively does is they have a plan to refill the Strategic petroleum Reserve so that in the future we don't pay more they blame that on everybody but themselves they've got a concerted effort to go after fossil fuel from the Wellhead to the Gas Pump and now whenever it comes to kind of delight in higher prices they look elsewhere Senator you know you listen to secretary granholm talk about why we've got higher prices and she's blaming the weather and she's blaming China reopening which Jackie said are things we can't control it feels to me like we're playing roulette at with energy we're just hoping that the weather lands in the right spot or China lands in the right spot but we're not doing anything to take control of the resources we have and it sounds Senator like that's not going to change you know you by the way congratulations on your second day thanks in your classroom you would have pointed out that when Supply is tight any small perturbation any small Interruption of that Supply will will send prices up so if a weather if weather knocks out a certain amount of oil of gasoline production and you have a limit already on that gasoline production then then that's going to be it's going to be higher you need just a little bit of redundancy a little bit of extra Supply to cushion the average family from suddenly paying far more for their prices they have stretch Supply so thinly those perturbations make a difference they are at blame Senator some of that extra Supply comes from the relationship with oil companies investing in cap-backs and I'm curious how you think about the relationship with the oil love making them a little bit more willing that instead of turning cash flow and profits back to shareholders making them a little bit more willing to invest in cat-backs to help increase production how are you looking at that relationship this Administration has used the SEC they've put up people who wanted to use the FED they've used a variety of mechanisms to to strangle investment in production of new oil and gas and those type of resources so you absolutely have to have a investment environment which gives certainty and there is no certainty right now in that investment environment so the administration can you know we've met the enemy and it is the administration doing whatever they can to drive up prices and on the other hand wanting to have plausible deniability that it is their fault really appreciate your time Senator thank you for joining us and for being with us here today want to get a quick check of course on these markets another volatile

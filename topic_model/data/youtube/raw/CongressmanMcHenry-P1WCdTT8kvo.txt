FOR WHAT PURPOSE DOES THE  GENTLEMAN FROM NORTH CAROLINA  SEEK RECOGNITION?  >> MR. SPEAKER, I MOVE THE   HOUSE SUSPEND THE RULES AND  PASS S. 1698, THE TREATMENT OF   CERTAIN PAYMENTS IN EUGENICS   COMPENSATION ACT.  THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   CLERK WILL REPORT THE TITLE OF   THE BILL.  THE CLERK: SENATE 1698, AN ACT   TO EXCLUDE PAYMENTS FROM STATE   EUGENICS COMPENSATION PROGRAMS   FOR CONSIDERATION IN   DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY FOR, OR  THE AMOUNT OF, FEDERAL PUBLIC  BENEFITS.  THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE:   PURSUANT TO THE RULE THE   GENTLEMAN FROM NORTH CAROLINA,   MR. MCHENRY, AND THE   GENTLEWOMAN FROM NEW JERSEY,   MRS. WATSON COLEMAN, EACH WILL   CONTROL 20 MINUTES.  THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE   GENTLEMAN FROM NORTH CAROLINA. MR. MCHENRY: THANK YOU, MR.  SPEAKER. I YIELD MYSELF SUCH TIME AS I  MAY CONSUME. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. MR. MCHENRY: I ASK UNANIMOUS   CONSENT THAT ALL MEMBERS MAY   HAVE FIVE LEGISLATIVE DAYS TO  REVISE AND EXTEND THEIR REMARKS  AND INCLUDE EXTRANEOUS MATERIAL  ON THE BILL UNDER  CONSIDERATION. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE:   WITHOUT OBJECTION. MR. MCHENRY: I RISE IN SUPPORT   OF SENATE BILL 1698, THE   TREATMENT OF CERTAIN PAYMENTS  IN EUGENICS COMPENSATION ACT.  SENATOR TILLIS HAS BEEN WORKING  TO GET THIS BILL PASSED THROUGH  THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND   IT'S A BIPARTISAN BILL.  IT WOULD HELP VICTIMS OF STATE   GOVERNMENT EUGENICS CAMPAIGNS  BY EXCLUDING ONE-TIME EUGENICS   RELATED COMPENSATION PAYMENTS  WHEN CALCULATING FEDERAL   BENEFITS.  IN ESSENCE, THIS WOULD ENSURE  THE VICTIMS OF STATE-BASED AND   STATE-MANDATED EUGENICS  PROGRAMS IN THE EARLY PART OF  THE 20TH CENTURY WHICH STATES  HAD, IT ENSURES THOSE VICTIMS  ARE NOT FURTHER VICTIMIZED BY  BEING KICKED OFF THE SOCIAL  SAFETY NET WHICH MANY ARE STILL  -- THAT ARE ALIVE STILL DEPEND   UPON.  MANY OF THESE VICTIMS ARE STILL  ALIVE TODAY, AS I MENTIONED. IN NORTH CAROLINA AT LEAST 220   OUT OF THE REPORTED 7,600  VICTIMS WERE STILL LIVING AS OF  SEPTEMBER OF LAST YEAR.  MY HOME STATE HAS WORKED TO  MAKE AMENDS TO THOSE THAT THE  STATE VICTIMIZED.  OUR STATE LEGISLATORS NOW LED  BY SENATOR TILLIS PASSED AND   THE GOVERNOR SIGNED LEGISLATION  THAT PROVIDED LARGE ONE-TIME   COMPENSATION PAYMENTS TO   VICTIMS OF EUGENICS PROGRAMS   THAT ARE STILL ALIVE AND STILL   IN OUR OWE SITE TODAY. IN NORTH CAROLINA, VICTIMS CAN   RECEIVE PAYMENTS FROM THE STATE  GOVERNMENT RANGING FROM $2000  TO $45,000.  AND OUR STATE IS NOT ALONE.  VIRGINIA HAS A SIMILAR PROGRAM   REWARDING $25,000 IN   COMPENSATION TO EACH VICTIM OF   THE STATE'S EUGENICS PROGRAMS. THESE ONE-TIME COMPENSATION  PAYMENTS COUNT AS NORMAL GROSS   INCOME UNDER CURRENT FEDERAL   LAW AND COULD HAVE THE   UNINTENDED EFFECT OF INCREASING  SOME OF THE VICTIM'S REPORTED  INCOME.  THEREBY, COSTING THEM ACCESS TO  SOME FEDERAL INCOME-BASED  BENEFITS.  MR. SPEAKER, SUCH AN OUTCOME IS  UNFAIR.  THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE SUFFERED  GREAT PAIN AT THE HANDS OF   THEIR STATE GOVERNMENT AND MUST  NOT BE FURTHER VICTIMIZED BY   LOSING THEIR IMPORTANT BENEFITS  THEY'RE RECEIVING TODAY. THE TAKEAWAY IS THIS WAS A   STATE-CREATED PROBLEM AND THE  STATE OWED THEM COMPENSATION   AND WE SHOULD ENSURE THAT THESE  INDIVIDUALS ARE ABLE TO GET THE  BENEFITS THEY NEED AND DESERVE.  MR. SPEAKER, THIS IS IMPORTANT   LEGISLATION THAT IS BIPARTISAN.  I'M HAPPY TO HAVE THE SUPPORT  OF MY COLLEAGUE, G.K.  BUTTERFIELD, DEMOCRAT OF NORTH   CAROLINA, REPRESENTING EASTERN   NORTH CAROLINA AS A CO-SPONSOR   OF THIS IMPORTANT BILL.  AND WITH THAT, I WOULD LIKE TO   RETAIN THE BALANCE OF MY TIME. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GE

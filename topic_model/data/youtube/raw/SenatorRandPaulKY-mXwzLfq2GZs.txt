senator ramble with us right now um you know senator how do you know joe biden would would would spill our blood and and make for more wars you know i think joe biden's history in the senate is long many decades long and i don't recall him opposing any war while he was here in the senate when he was vice president he was president obama's right-hand man during the libyan war which was a disaster so i think both in our history in our recent history of the last generation the iraq war and the libyan war showed that regime change in the middle east actually lead to more chaos power vacuum and more more terrorism i think president trump has often voiced that i've heard him say it dozens of times that it was a mistake to get rid of the saddam hussein because it tipped the balance of power towards iran i've never heard joe biden say that he's learned from his mistakes he voted for the iraq war and he enthusiastically supported president obama through the libyan war both of which i think were a disaster and i see no evidence that he's changed his ways well to be fair he was among your quite correct 77 senators republicans and democrats that voted to go to war with iraq back in 2003 and uh ultimately regretted that vote said so many times by 2004-2005 nothing brave there since the overwhelming tide have turned and people felt otherwise having said that though i was looking back on remarks that president trump has made and he has long stated that he was against the iraq war from the start now back in those days when i talked to him um back then he was more impressed with the way the war started and get kudos to president bush about that start he did claim that uh george bush senior should have finished the job some years earlier but he was not against it from the get-go so you never know right i mean you never know you're kind of depending on your circumstances you kind of do know that joe biden didn't learn the lesson the lesson of the iraq war was that toppling a dictator leaving a power vacuum changes the balance of power and wasn't good for us and we lost a lot of lives but the middle east is not a better place the reason we know joe biden didn't learn that lesson and that his contrition is false is that he went on to support the war in libya that did exactly what the war in iraq did so the idea of regime change leading to better things you know i think this is something that joe biden has never learned but president trump people want to dispute when or where he became an opponent of the iraq war all i can say is that for the last couple of decades all i've heard from president trump is what a mistake it was to remove saddam hussein and what a mistake the iraq war was i haven't heard joe biden out there saying that what i hear from joe biden is oh yeah i got caught up and you know now the progressives don't like my vote so i've got to change my position but then when war came about in libya both he and president obama decided to bomb that country to smithereens have regime change and what is libya now it's still a disaster it's a civil war it's a chaotic place where terrorists thrive so there is an important lesson to learn learn from the iraq war and i don't think joe biden ever learned it but you know republicans don't point out another lesson potentially from that same obama by an administration when it came to syria and punishing assad for gassing his own people ultimately they said they were going to leave it up to congress to validate whether they should respond congress never never did so isn't it more fair senator say that both sides sort of talk out of both ends of their mouths on this issue and you really can't telegraph what they're going to do because the situations change it's almost always just safe to say both parties speak out both sides of their mouth that would be safe to say but in the instance of syria i think you can see that president trump has been reticent to get more involved and when threatened with the border skirmish elevating between this the syrian kurds and the turks president trump decided it wasn't worth leaving 200 troops in the middle of a situation where a hundred thousand turks were amassing at the border so i think president trump has shown restraint when iran was bellicose and brought down one of our drones he contemplated an attack on mainland iran but didn't carry it forward so i think that president trump has shown restraint and i think in the past the hillary clinton wing of the party which is also the joe biden wing of the party were very supportive of getting involved in the syrian civil war and i think that was also a mistake i think part of the reason isis arose was that you once again had a vacuum in syria and that isis arose out of that vacuum of weak government and chaos but this was all sort of people in both parties you know the lindsey graham wing of the republican party loves the wars over there too but also joe biden is part of that and i think he's an unreformed part of the war caucus of the democrat party um finally i mean this president also is the first to say i'm going to pull more troops out of germany i believe 10 to 15 000 now still leaving a contingent of i think more than thirty thousand you probably know these figures better than i um others both in your party and the up and the democratic party saying that will risk our problems going forward of you say what i think you have neoconservatives in both parties biden would be one hillary clinton would be one bill christian bill crystal who's also supporting the bidens would be one and they are sort of of this world war ii mentality that you have to own acreage and that we have to have you know millions of troops somehow in europe in case the russians march in times have changed and i thought pompeo did a good job of describing this when he came to our committee recently and he said he was there when we had over a hundred thousand troops but times have changed we had over a million troops in germany at one time so times have changed they do change i think the idea of where we are now technologically is that owning acreage having acreage in in afghanistan or mali i don't think is necessary and probably counterproductive to be in the middle of all these villages but we have the technology to stop people and thwart people from attacking us that can be done often from more remote sites and i think it's less invasive when we get less involved in these chronic civil wars and a much better way to treat this i think president trump believes that but i think joe biden's still old school he supported every war that ever came down the pike when he was there in the senate never voted against a war and so i think joe biden is a much greater risk for war than president trump look i'm as anti-war as they come i support president trump because i truly believe he wants to end the afghan war finally much ado about the president making his speech to the nation tomorrow from the white house some of your colleagues uh those on the opposite side of ledger as well think um he shouldn't be doing that i'm just curious to go beyond this if you were to become president someday and then he say you harbor those ambitions or that you should would you accept uh your party's nomination if the venue were down from the white house you know i would say there are better places frankly and i've said before in the last week or two that i probably would have chosen another venue but i don't think it's an end-all i think it's at the same time we're in the midst of this sort of viral pandemic that a lot of things are different than they've ever been most of this is virtual and having some people on the lawn uh to watch fireworks you know i don't think it's it's the worst possible thing but i i probably would have chosen a different venue but that doesn't mean that it's uh so horrendous that it's something that oh my goodness this should never happen i think that we have to be careful about crossing the line between official government and unofficial government but every day we have these things you know i'm standing in the rotunda of the russell building and we're not supposed to do strictly political things here i'm allowed to answer political questions but it's not supposed to be predominantly political but my office is political so it's often difficult to uh you know what is the line between my official duty talking about legislation and then handling a political question in the same interview so it is tricky um but they're so intertwined that i think it's often hard to separate politics from uh from office as well all right i got you i'll just pretend i never ask you a political question senator thank you very much very good seeing you senator rand paul

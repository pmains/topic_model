revise and extend without objection the gentlewoman is recognized for one minute madam Speaker I rise to support the payment Commission data Act which would make prescription drug prices more transparent and the blocking Act which would bring generic drugs to the market faster I also support the projecting consumer access to generic drugs Act which would prohibit drug companies from delaying the entry of generic drugs into the market unfortunately madam Speaker Democrats have packaged these bills together with poison pills that would prevent States from bring lower healthcare plans Democrats won't increase Obamacare enrollment regardless of cost but Obamacare is not affordable for many Americans the average monthly premium for a family of four is over $1,500 forcing Missourians to cut housing and childcare so they can pay skyrocketing premiums it is not a solution we must take immediate action to allow states to promote choices and affordability I thank you and I yield back

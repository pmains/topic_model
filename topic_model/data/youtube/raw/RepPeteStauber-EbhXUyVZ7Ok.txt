I conclude my statement well thank you and as you know there are many of us who live in the Great Lakes region who serve on this committee but we mr Joyce and I recognize the importance because of the importance we place on our regional geographic watershed quality improvements that we recognize the others around the United States right mr. Joyce we strive to be fair my my first question I'm going to expand a little bit on my opening remarks the UN report also stated and I quote from that the health of the ecosystems on which we all and other just species depend upon is to chew any more rapidly than ever we are roading the very foundations of our economies livelihoods food security health and quality of life worldwide around 1 million animals and plant species are now threatened with extinction many within decades many be more than ever before in human history so mr. secretary like the 4th national climate assessment this information is very sobering and I believe it's a call for action so with the release of this information well the Department of Interior take a pause and its approach to energy development to re-examine the impacts of these operations on ecosystems species and habitats to see if there are better approaches the report and I'll just kind of two other things together for you so you can respond in total the report also states that the abundance of native species in most land major land-based habitats is declined by 20% and so I want to know how the department is going to work just sustain native plants on public lands and I think you've met you touched a little bit about the challenges we have with quail Bareilles and horses but the last thing that I'll mention that the report highlights is the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on nature with those impacts projected to increase over the coming decades so I believe and I believe many Americans would agree with me that we continue business as usual approach so how's the department going to incorporate this science and your everyday operations and long-range planning in other words what are you doing to make sure that the United States is a leader and not to a contributor in the eroding the foundations of our economy is our livelihood and the health and quality of life not only here in America but worldwide so I appreciate that question I'll give you my perspective on this and before doing so I'll give you a couple facts about me I recognized that climate is changing I recognize that man is a contributing factor and I've spent a good amount of time with our scientists trying to figure out how the best practices we can utilize to factor their understanding of science as it stands into making informed legal and policy decisions and I've spent a good amount of time with the fourth assessment and and if you look at that report you don't have to read far you can just read into the overview and you will see that even they recognize that the largest uncertainty in projecting future climate conditions is the level of GHG going forward and that really is because those future levels depend on a variety of factors economic political technological and demographic and those are difficult to predict so what our scientists tell us is that the best practice is to recognize that there is no one right model or right forcing scenario that all are plausible future states and the best thing we can do in making it did inform decision is to look at multiple models multiple scenarios representation representative concentration pathways the the standard you know four or two point six four point five six eight point five they say don't just pick one you know there is it is very important for what we do legally and for ensuring that things are upheld in the courts that we recognize what the science is and articulate a rational basis for it if we can't articulate a rational basis our decisions won't be sustained now that's the first part of your question the second part is are we going to stop oil and gas development because of this report and answer to that is no Congress you all have the ability to side whether we do anything on federal lands and you've decided the Atlantic we manage you've decided a whole host of different range of things on some things you've decided that it's wilderness and should be enjoyed for the solitude and enjoyment of people and untrammeled by man on other things you've decided that this is a national park and it should be managed that way and in on other areas you've decided that the land is for multiple use we go through a planning process that planning process can result in some areas that are for solitude other areas or for multiple years but at the end of the day we also have the mineral Leasing Act and if you if you have a view on what you want to happen we'll carry it out when you execute it and and that is my position thank you the UN report is a lot more than just on climate change it so it's also about pollution my Nina land-use and so I'm going to take the product or the chair and I think my committee members know that I usually don't even go first so I'm gonna I'm gonna follow this up because I think this kind of leads into my second question and it's it's about something that you and I've just just discussed before and it the committee knows probably where I'm going with as I'm deeply concerned about the decisions the Department of Interior made and along with the Department of Agriculture regarding minerally seen on the Superior National Forest so within the watershed of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area the most heavily visited wilderness area in the system and voyageurs National Park and people can you know get into well it's not in the park or it's not in the Boundary Waters wilderness canoe area but it's in the middle of about a body of water that that both of that both this area flows through and also flows north to our Canadian neighbor and as you know it's a area known for pristine waters and diverse wildlife including several endangered species which leads me back to the first part of the question that I asked you about the the UN s assessment about what are we going to do about sustaining need of plants and I would say animals on public lands the department's currently being sued for unlawful reinstating the twin metals mining leases in the watershed they were deny they were denied under the last administration in December the Trump administration canceled a proposed mineral withdrawal in the area and it abandoned related environmental assessment secretary Purdue announced the cancellation and the Department of interior's also been active in participating in this withdraw so I asked you in March first in a letter to provide us with all the documents and communications regarding the decision to reinstate the expired twin metal leases the decision to cancel the mineral withdrawal and environmental assessment the decision to prefer no to proposed renewal of the twin metals leases and any other pending or potential mineral actions on the Superior National Forest so I want to know when you think the committee can expect to receive this documentation because I really think it does go to the heart of protecting water protecting a native plants and protecting some species in the area which are threatened and possibly endangered so we have been waiting for example also for a Freedom of Information Act requests have turned up in meetings and emails showing communications within the department including with you personally about this issue we have an email dated October 3rd 2017 from a persona solicitor's office to you asking about briefing on twin medals withdrawal application the list of attachments includes briefing papers on the withdrawal and something entitled the draft release renewal scenarios with comment so I'm wondering when we can expect based on my March first request this information to come come to this committee so that we can take a look and find out how the discussion to overturn the twin metals leases came to be and you know was all involved in in deciding to be part of a withdrawal so I fully appreciate and respect the request it's sometimes challenging when we're in the middle of deliberation on what documents can come up and what can't and that's no disrespect to to the committee in any way shape or form I we met two days ago I think I went back and suggested that we need to take a hard look at what we could give you so we can give you what we can now my view is that this isn't secretary will make a decision you know we have these very there's two different tiers of leases here that are involved both of them if the applicant were to go forward or the right holder however you want to say it there's lots of opportunity for comment review there's no way that we're going to improve approve something that is destructive to the Boundary Waters but there are processes we go through analyze that we can't approve of mine plan of operation that would cause jeopardy or adversely modify or critically or destroy critical habitat and all of those things need will be looked at at the appropriate time so you know I can commit to trying to get you the documents we can be before decisions are made and getting you the appropriate documents after decisions are made and ultimately you know working through the issue with you this may be one that we see differently but that doesn't mean for a moment that your folks don't have opportunities for comment that there's not opportunities for judicial review I appreciate all of that well thank you I'll be following up but we're fine this committee is finding whether it is getting lists from the department school construction and the Bureau of Indian Affairs and other other places EPA and that sometimes it takes a long time to get a letter answered and sometimes it's not answered very satisfactorily or with information that we need to have in front of us in order to make our budget decisions but sir we will continue the discussion later mr. Joyce

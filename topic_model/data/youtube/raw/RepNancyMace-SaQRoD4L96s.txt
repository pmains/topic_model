in a new op-ed our next guest warns this spending will cost us big time claiming america simply can't afford four more years of this south carolina congresswoman nancy mace is here to explain congresswoman thank you for being with us this morning so once again if we show people the spending spree that we're talking about that six trillion dollars in the breakdown you have 1.8 trillion dollar american families plan 2.3 trillion for american jobs plan 1.9 trillion for the american rescue plan it's a lot of money what are your thoughts absolutely this is president biden's administration what he's proposing is the most radical spending agenda in a generation i'm a single working mom and when i look at what he's trying to do and what it will do to our economy i came to congress to fight for my kids future not mortgage it and when you add up and you look at the spending and future coveted relief spending which i'm hearing rumors about now too we're talking about seven to ten trillion dollars in new spending and the only way you can pay for it is for the highest tax hike in american history in the middle of a pandemic and i can't think of a worse idea to do to our economy right now and to the american people quite frankly yeah it's completely untethered uh from from any accounting or balance sheet we're in a new rubicon like i don't even know where we are i don't think anybody uh believes that we could balance it right congressman i mean how do you pull back from that when you created an addiction to what was supposed to be temporary now they they want to make that type of spending permanent our budget reconciliation process is gone can you really rein it in oh you can't right now we have 28 trillion dollars in debt our deficit so far this year we're at three trillion and counting and when you add on this new spending deficit yeah it's it's insane what's happening right now and doing it in the middle of a pandemic now there have been proposals in the past now i'm not going to blame you know the left on all of these issues democrats and republicans alike for decades now spending has been increasing over the years we've not held ourselves accountable balancing the budget has got to be part of it in the future how we do this but however no one is talking about the spending no one's talking about how to rein it in it's just a trillion here a trillion there and here we are talking about seven to ten trillion dollars in spending this year on top of what we did last year which is 3.5 trillion in coveted relief spending and when you talk about raising taxes and they they do it on an emotional level we're going to tax the rich to pay for this well somebody's going to pay that bill and that's on the backs of hard-working americans and small businesses unemployment will go up wages will go down and in the middle of the pandemic with covid19 i can't think of a worse idea congresswoman there's another way though they could pay for it as well it's a way that they show increasing um willingness to to to do and that is just by printing more money just continuing to print money and that is a way that spreads the cost of this across the entire they're going to talk about tax raises but they're going to say oh that's just going to be on the rich we know that's not enough to pay for it all but inflation affects everyone devaluing the dollar is a way of taxing the entire economic strata and it seems to me at least that's an increasingly likely outcome as we head down this path it is and it's going to affect us um we printed 4 trillion dollars last year and we're the estimates this year we're going to print another 4 trillion more it will in effect inflation absolutely that's a great uh right that's a great comment there but the other thing too that we have talked about in years is the penny plan where the federal government businesses and coven 19 because of the the crisis that they had they had to cut spending and find ways to do that if the federal government could just do that with one penny for each dollar they spent they could balance the budget in a couple of years imagine that working and operating efficiently like a business but instead they're spending our money our kids money our grandkids their future they're mortgaging it congresswoman nancy mays thank you so much i think sometimes these numbers get so big that people just say oh it's too much to tackle but we have to tackle it we have that responsibility for the next generation we appreciate you being here on this thank you

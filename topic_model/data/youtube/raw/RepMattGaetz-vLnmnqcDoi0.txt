we have a great task force with people from all over the state of Florida on all the different industries particularly small business and we're putting together a lot of great ideas for what the next phase looks like in Florida but you know I got to give credit to the people of Florida you go back six weeks everybody particularly in the Acela media was saying Florida was going to be worse than New York obviously we have a very elderly population it was constant people saying that if you look at what's happened that's not true you know New York for example has about 25 times the number of fatalities of Florida even though we have two million more people right now as of last night we had about 730 people statewide in the ICU people said our hospitals we're gonna be overrun we've actually increased hospital bed space and ICU bed space during the pandemic so there were fewer beds available in Florida in February than there are now so Florida's flattened the curve people have done a great job and I think the I think we understand that you can do both you can continue to fight kovat 19 but also get people back to work and have society function again in Bryan I never did draconian orders here like you see in some of these other states where a dad would get arrested for or get cited for taking his daughter to the park that doesn't work we've never done that we've been very I think reasonable with the people of Florida and they've responded would you update us on the testing the vice president said yesterday he says he has enough testing capacity today for every state to go into phase once if you'll update us on that in the field hospital down in Miami that'd be great yeah so we Florida we've done now I think about 280,000 tests in South Florida we've tested one for every 50 residents that's where most of our cases are what they have done is by unlocking these high throughput machines they increase the cost per test or the reimbursement per test from $50 to $100 so now we are looking and in discussions with some of these labs who can put through a lot of tests in a 24 hour period so that will increase our ability to do this we also now have this point of care Abbott Labs that our hospitals are using we're trying to get more for four nursing homes we have strike teams in the nursing homes that are doing surveillance testing which is very very important so if you go back to months of work testing was not only here but internationally and look at all that's happened I mean it's been an unprecedented explosion so we're gonna do more in Florida we're also going to do the serology tests to test for the antibodies you look what's done been done in California some of these places and the indication is is that far more people have had this then then we know that actually it's kind of a good thing because it means the disease is less lethal than we thought but we want to know how the antibodies are in the state of Florida and in terms of the field hospitals Ainsley we plan for hospital capacity we wanted to make sure we had enough we had different field hospitals the Army Corps helped us at the Miami Beach Convention Center every field hospital in the state of Florida right now sits empty and that's a good thing that is a good thing governor I know that you have appointed a reopened Florida Task Force and you've tasked them with trying to figure out how to reopen as much as you can in a phase approach in the next five days and I saw that you've got people like executives from Disney and Universal trying to think of how to get the tourists back and that is really what is impacting Florida because Florida's number one industry is tourism and right now you're at the back toward the end of the season down there and I was reading in one of the papers this morning that one of the suggestions is to get people back you know when they check into one of the Miami hotels or any hotel maybe you take their temperature just to make sure that they're okay but then there's the problem of it could be a false positive or a false negative and you wind up making it worse well so I would say this Steve it's amazing the ideas that the businesses are already thinking about they've been thinking deeply about this for weeks and weeks there's a lot of great ideas that I've already seen put on the table I'm in discussions with places like Disney they are so far ahead of the curve and I think everyone wants to make sure that we do it safely and you know you think about if you own a hotel in Miami the last thing you want is to do a false negative and then have a small outbreak in your hotel so they are very keen on safety and I think that they're going to be leading the way on the innovation so you know we'll have some guidelines of course but I think a lot of the businesses are gonna go above and beyond because the people want to be confident that it's safe it could actually be safe but if they don't think it is then that's bad for business and so all the business people I've talked to in all industries in Florida are very keen on that governor we notice the New York governor led the putting together of a regional coalition of Delaware and Pennsylvania and Massachusetts in Connecticut and New Jersey and then you had the western coalition of three separate states have you thought about consolidating with South Carolina and Georgia and others perhaps and put together one or you just want to leave Florida by itself and making that decision well we're actually kind of doing both so we are in do we we've had meeting with all the southeastern governors Mississippi Alabama Georgia Florida South Carolina and Tennessee and we shared a lot of ideas I think we'll be on the same page of some stuff but as you guys know Florida is about five states in and of itself and so we have a situation where we have three counties in southeast Florida that has over sixty percent of our hospitalizations to date I have other parts like Northeast Florida you know their deaths per 100,000 is like 1.6 you know whereas a place like New York would be ninety deaths per 100,000 so we have this is impact that the state differently and I think how you approach it it may not be uniform in every jurisdiction in Florida so yes we're gonna work regionally but I also got to work regionally within my own state to make sure we thread the needle properly right we're seeing that in New York - such a hot spot in Miami I mean Miami and Manhattan and out here on Long Island but the upper part of the state not so much so yeah that's a tough task that you have staying with you and with Miami in Fort Lauderdale in Jacksonville Thank You governor for being home with us thanks guys

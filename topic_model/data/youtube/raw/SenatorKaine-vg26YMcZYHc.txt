and thank you mr. chair and thank you to the witnesses I want to also associate myself with the comments of the chair with respect to the effects of sequestration and the need for us to find a better solution a compliment and a question so the compliment earlier this week the army made a decision there had been an earlier temporary decision but earlier this week I actually think it might have been Thursday or Friday of last week a decision to allow a an army captain simarik paul singh who is a sikh to where both the beard and the turban that is a foundational part of his religion as he serves he's a combat veteran with an afghan with an afghanistan tour this is something that senator gillibrand and i have been writing letters to DOD about for a couple of years and i wanted to just commend you on that I'm very passionate about this issue maybe just being virginia biased the the statute of religious freedom that Thomas Jefferson author that became the basis for the First Amendment that basically says in our country you can worship or not and you won't be preferred or punished for how you worship and you can freely exercise your faith was one of only two ideas that was unique to the American Constitution the rest of it was a great borrowing job but free religious exercise and interestingly enough that war should be started by Congress not the president were the only two things that were unique to our Constitution and so it's very foundational and I know that their issues of how you balance you know people's religious practices with you know how do you can wear a helmet or a gas mask and you want people to be who they are without proselytizing those are all challenging questions but particularly in the world we're living in today and in the war of today sadly in the future this is becoming more and more important all over the world we see violence and even wore that is driven by sectarian tensions whether it's Hindus and Muslims and Myanmar whether it's isil's atrocities against religious minorities like his Edie's or Christians or other groups they don't agree with whether it's I said Buddhists and Muslims and me and more Hindus and Muslims and in areas of India and elsewhere you also see even when there's not war yeah rifts within armed services you know one of the reasons that the Iraq military many-sided is having been very ineffective against the initial wave of attacks by ISIL was because of deep sectarian tensions between Sunnis and Shias within the Iraqi military that renders it less effective and one of the virtues that the United States plays generally and in our military is demonstrating that people can live and work and go to school together with different religious faiths and we can make it work I was on a code l that senator gillibrand led in early January and Israel and Turkey and it was interesting in both nations leaders said to us wow what's with the anti-muslim rhetoric that we're seeing in your political space right now and as we dug into it a little bit what they sort of discloses hey we live in a neighborhood in the world that has a lot of sectarian tensions but we don't always want to be that way but for us to get better we have to have an example and the US has been our example of a place where people of different faiths could freely be who they are but we could make it work together and so the decision to allow one seek for the first time in history the army to wear a turban and beard might seem like a small thing but it's actually about a deeply critical American value that sadly is really wanting and needed in the world today and so I certainly would encourage the army in the DoD generally to look at this policy the the defense minister of one of our greatest allies Canada who is a is a vet who's been deployed multiple times in Afghanistan is a Sikh who's been able to wear his beard and turban in service we've got a lot of Sikhs who are in and a lot of Sikhs who want to be in the military and I would hope that we would recognize that as not only true our values but also as something where we could hold up an example in the world in a way that is really needed right now the question that i have is about the European reassurance initiative and it's a little bit about sequester politics and the readiness issues the tug-of-wars and putting a budget together we've got all these readiness gaps and at the same time the proposal is to quadruple the investment in the European initiative and to take it up to 3.4 billion I just would be curious as you talk about hard choices how do you trade off the need to do this dramatic increase in the RI with the fact that we are still short in some of the readiness investments that we need to make some of the the ER is really important and it trades off what trade-offs DoD made to make that happen in other accounts you know those are priorities set by the secretary defense but i can tell you that the ER I is really important because the deterrence of Russia from further aggression is a critical national security priority they've been aggressive since 2008 that behavior needs to change this is only one of many other initiatives that have been done in actions that have been done by the US government across all domains and by a whole-of-government approach but this is important deterrence happens because an aggressor perceives that the cost of further aggression is going to exceed the benefit of aggression by putting a divisions worth of equipment ro take an armored Brigade there it'll be clear we think that costs or further aggression especially into NATO allies like the Baltics or Poland and will come with a very high cost relative to the United States of America thanks mr.

from Georgia Thank you Mr chairman and thanks to each of you for being here today listening to your story it it hits really close to home because it sounds like this area has been through or is going through what my hometown of West Point Georgia went through um we were once home to the textile industry the largest employer in our area was a Fortune 500 company and we had about 35 000 people in our area working in the textile industry and it uh and then all of a sudden with some folks that were educated beyond their intelligence that had been elected to office in Washington came up with policies that destroyed our way of life there and they pay us NAFTA and there were a series of promises about better jobs that would come and greater Economic Opportunity and those promises were just simply empty promises never materialized and then Washington response was to send more checks more government assistance and and more ideas from Washington to try to save our area and again it left a generation in poverty it moved people from the middle class into poverty and most importantly it eroded hope in the in our area and it seems like listening to y'all today that these same sort of broken promises are being seen here in this area this green New Deal of energy just seems to be destroyed in a way of life here whether it's in the cost of propane as you mentioned to run your business the The energy needed to to harvest and and process and distribute wood the cost of of energy to process your product Mr McDade and clearly the impact that these policies have had on the coal industry it just seems like that these again are empty promises that are backed up with more checks that come through the distancing of eyes work that put people on the sideline and they just leave a generation behind the rest of the country so I'm sorry for what Washington has done to you Republicans and Democrats in a shameful and it shouldn't happen and that's why we're here to understand the impact of it but also figure our way out of it and it sounds like one of the most important things that we can do is to get DC out of these policies and let America and small businesses run so with that Miss Bachmann first of all I'm sure Running a Restaurant you probably look over to your left and probably need to buy some of Mr mcdade's product on the more regular basis because yeah exactly but talk to me again about the about the cost of propane I want to make sure I heard you right on that you said it had doubled it has doubled since 2020 for for us okay and your the other energy costs that are wrapped into your lease have also gone up yes art lease has gone up uh we started at least at two thousand dollars and it's uh today uh at forty five hundred dollars a month a big part of that is the energy cost that's associated with it do these same cost around propane do they impact a lot of your customers in this area that heat their homes with propane oh I'm sure it does I just had an employee last month to borrow money off of me because she was again it was it was electricity but she was behind 600 on her utility bill wow six hundred dollars that's impactful she's a single mother of two two children well Mr Ward I'm sure you've heard an awful lot from the body Administration about green energy jobs and now that's the wave of the future how have those manifested themselves here in this area as cold jobs or go away and folks are left without uh without income and Hope those green energy jobs manifested themselves here in in this region in southern West Virginia where I'm from I haven't seen too much green energy jobs take any jobs that we currently have I don't believe I'd hold my breath waiting on them um and and it's a shame it really is a shame that it uh to talk about energy policy and do it in a theoretical way and it probably probably Blissful ignorance but at the end of the day it has an impact on families and it's hard um Miss Pfluger again talk to us about the cost of the product that I'm cost of your product that I'm paying for is a consumer because of the energy cost well again uh the our cost of manufacturing the product our cost of operating is has gone up dramatically because of the cost of energy because the price of oil really and and how that translates to all the other goods and services you have to buy along with just the fuel to operate again we've our prices have more than on those things have more than doubled since 2020. well thank you and listen it just sounds like that the the Promises of the green New Deal energy policies are just empty and they're having a negative impact on folks here with that Mr chairman I yield back thank you I'd like to recognize that

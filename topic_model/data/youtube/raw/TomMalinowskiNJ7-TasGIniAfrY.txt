joining me now is the democratic congressman tom malinowski he worked for president obama to open up myanmar and support democracy there he was also former assistant secretary of state for democracy human rights and labor and the congressman is joining me from new jersey welcome um so you heard what i was asking the journalists there who were not naming for obvious reasons um but i did ask her you know how she thought this was gonna you know end up what do you think you know in terms of is the military going to be successful in in crushing democracy and should the united states and and other countries do something to make sure that doesn't happen well thank you thank you christian i think it's not our job uh as leaders outside of burma to predict what's going to happen we don't know our job is to try to promote the best possible outcome that this is a long-running drama in in in burma uh we we had a multi-decade struggle to end military rule to establish democracy which uh led to a partial transfer of power to civilians in the the last decade but we got to remember the military never really gave up power the military was still in charge of everything having to do with security in in the country and um and this is just a reminder that the the job of building democracy in the country was unfinished so i i think the united states and democratic countries around the world they've stood with the burmese people for decades in this effort they're going to continue and have to continue to stand with them so what was the fatal flaw then in this attempt to open the country up the united states lifted sanctions because uh there was some perceived route to democracy um and yet as you say in that constitution the military kept a lot of power how is it ever going to be any different to what we see now did you were you worried back then in you know 2010 or whenever it was that that this might happen again oh sure i was worried in 2010 i was worried in 2015 2016. there was a decision made by the united states and other western countries to to start treating burma like a normal democracy to lift all the remaining sanctions and i thought then and still think that that was a mistake um that said the policy did the the policy that we all followed did succeed in moving burma from absolute total north korea-style dictatorship to a country that was much more open and i think one of the differences you're seeing now with this crackdown is that you have this whole generation of young people in in burma who have spent much of their lives kind of getting used to being pretty free uh freedom of speech and freedom of movement and they're more connected to the outside world and and to each other and so you know they have no intention of going back and are showing great great courage in expressing that and you heard the journalist i mean it could be a protracted she said that there are reports that the military is hunkering down for at least three months in terms of ordering supplies and and the like and it didn't look like the protesters were going to be backing down um i spoke to the un rapporteur tom andrews as this hunter was creating its coup and this is what he said to me i think it's clear that the military is afraid of what might happen on the streets and that again is precisely the reason that it's so important for the international community to speak out and to act because those who are champions of democracy and human rights within the country um are either terrified or they're in detention um so tom malinowski do you think that the international community has done enough that was two weeks ago and nothing seems to have changed the military is if anything stepped up um its presence as you heard from the journalists um you know and we've heard talk of live fire and certainly rubber bullets we know that what i mean what are you what's everybody waiting for well look fighting a military coup is serious business i i don't need to tell you that when soldiers decide to seize control of a country that they're not going to just say oh gosh whoops never mind we we apologize because countries around the world issue a statement or were at the first sign of public protest so i i think and any any serious observer of this would expect that this this is going to be a protracted struggle and a lot's going to depend on the balance of forces within the country how sustained is the protest movement going to be the most important part of this protest movement i think from as an observer from the outside is that a big chunk of the civil servants who make up the government of burma major institutions banks the health care system they're staying home there's a massive strike of civil servants in the country they are they are trying to sanction that the military themselves and what they're asking us to do is to join in that effort by denying resources to the military to its businesses to the key leaders of this country and so i think we've got a lot of tools that we can use here which which are i fear going to have to be used over a period of months to help tip the balance to the folks in burma who are fighting to get their legitimate government back so you know you said correctly that the military hunter which you described as north korean style before this um latest constitution is not going to suddenly say oops you know i made a mistake let's turn back but they did say uh i don't want u.s sanctions and global sanctions i mean you know it was the pressure that you and the rest of the world put on them last time that did get them to move and that was very significant they don't want sanctions on them this is what you know your colleague former u.s ambassador to myanmar told me about how the u.s would need to get into some kind of working arrangement with many of the other important countries to force some kind of change from this hunter right now just take a listen we can't do this alone we can and we must target the military and those who collude with this illegitimate new government that's being put in place against the will of the people but we have to get our partners our allies like japan like korea um australia india is important singapore and asean uh try to get these countries to recognize that this is very bad for the future of myanmar that has already set back business interest ability inside the country that we all have a common interest so do you think that your allies in the region do believe that singapore japan south korea et cetera except that they need to also step up to the plate we're going to talk about china in a second but your allies yes i think they do recognize it and by the way just a word on on sanctions i think we were successful uh 10 15 years ago in putting pressure on the military to relax its grip and that was a time when they were much more isolated than they are today they're much more connected to the global economy much more dependent on commerce today than they were in 2010 2011. so keep that in mind um and yes of course although you know india singapore they're not going to impose economic sanctions in the way that the united states can it's important for the the community of nations to be speaking in a single voice asean put out a statement on this that was pretty tough for asean japan has been i think much more helpful much more concerned than they have been in in the past uh again this is partly because we're not dealing with a military absolute dictatorship that has been there for 20 or 30 years all these countries have gotten used to dealing with the new government with aung san tsuchi she was their friend and now she's in prison so it's a little bit easier to build that coalition i think now so what about china again you heard the journalists who were talking to said that groups of protesters are going to embassies um who they perceive to be supporting the junta well one of those is china and the chinese uh foreign foreign ministry has said or the ambassador to myanmar we sincerely hope that the myanmar people can distinguish right from wrong and guard against political manipulation so as to avoid undermining the friendship between the two peoples well i mean you know fine that's a statement but china doesn't look like it's doing anything to either even even attempt to push back what's just happened i mean they're blocking any movement in the u.n security council along with russia how serious is china's support and without their help can anything really be done to reverse this actually china allowed a statement in the security council a few days ago which was pretty remarkable interestingly russia is the closest friend to the hunter more more unequivocally a friend to to the military than china is i think china's caught between competing impulses i they they don't they don't exactly want to like work with america and europe to promote democracy in burma for obvious reasons uh at the same time the the burmese military is not at all friendly to the chinese historically and uh and they had a very good relationship with aung san tsuchi who's now sitting in prison they've got a concern about stability on their border with burma about this thing getting out of control so i don't expect china to be working in leave with with us on something like this but i think it is interesting that they're in this middle position and and and you know they may be sending signals behind the scenes that are helpful for all i know a quick reality check this military hunter says it's going to allow democratic elections you know this whole the whole reson d'etre for this in their view was that this landslide that aung suchi had in the latest elections in in november they said it was you know rigged or fraudulent or whatever then they charged her with importing walkie-talkies um and then they said they would have uh elections but some there are very concerned that they might just cut her parties you know off at the knees and not allow the nld to take part do you think that's a realistic threat and a realistic scenario you know it's in a way it's a no-win situation for the military that it's a maybe a strange thing to say because they're in charge right now but if if they allow any kind of opposition to run in the elections the opposition will win overwhelmingly again even more so i think after after this and if they don't then it's a complete and total and utter sham that nobody in burma no one in the in the outside world is going to accept and i do think you know mine online the the the head of the the military who's now uh attempting to run the country i've i've met with him i think he does on some level have a sense that he wants to be legitimate he doesn't want to be a complete rogue and i i just don't see a way out for him unless they allow an election uh either the restoration of this government which would which is what they should do or an election that is free and fair but then he'll lose that election right so so they have doug for themselves that's going to be very hard to climb out of all right congressman tom malinowski thank you very much for joining us

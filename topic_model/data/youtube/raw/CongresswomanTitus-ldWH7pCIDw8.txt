AGAINST THE WILL OF NEVADANS.  MR. SPEAKER, NEVADA HAS NO   NUCLEAR ENERGY PRODUCING   FACILITIES AND IT SHOULD NOT BE  THE DUMPING GROUND FOR THE REST  OF THE COUNTRY'S NUCLEAR WASTE.  THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS. IF YOUR STATE GENERATES NUCLEAR  WASTE, THEN YOU SHOULD KEEP IT   IN YOUR BACKYARD.  OR IF ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE   OK WITH SENDING NUCLEAR WASTE TO MY STATE, THEN MAYBE THEY SHOULD CONSIDER KEEPING IT IN THEIR OWN STATES.  I'LL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK  WITH THEM ON AN AMENDMENT. THE PEOPLE OF NEVADA DO NOT WANT THIS NUCLEAR WASTE STORED IN OUR BACKYARD.  YUCCA MOUNTAIN NEEDS TO CLOSE. THAT'S WHY I ENCOURAGE MY  COLLEAGUES TO VOTE IN SUPPORT OF THIS AMENDMENT.  MR. SPEAKER, I WOULD LIKE TO   YIELD AS MUCH TIME AS SHE NEEDS  TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE FIRST   CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, DEANA  TITUS. THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. THE CHAIR: THE GENTLEWOMAN IS  RECOGNIZED.  MS. TITUS: THANK YOU,  CONGRESSMAN IF YIELDING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE.  EARLIER THIS EVENING, WE HEARD   FROM THE DISTINGUISHED MEMBER  FROM ILLINOIS WHO CONTINUES TO   PUSH THE YUCCA OR BUST POLICY OF THE LAST 36 YEARS. HE CLAIMED THAT THAT THE NEVADA  DELEGATION IS TRYING TO  CIRCUMVENT THE ADJUDICATION  PROCESS TO DETERMINE IF NEVADA   SHOULD BE THE DUMPING GROUND FOR THE NATION'S HIGHLY RADIOACTIVE  NUCLEAR WEAS HE SAID CONGRESS  SHOULD REJECT ANOTHER AMENDMENT  TO SAVE $190 MILLION FROM BEING  THROWN AWAY ON THIS FAIL   PROPOSAL BECAUSE WE SHOULD LET   THE LICENSING PROCESS PLAY OUT   WITHOUT SOME PRECONCEIVED  OUTCOME. WELL I'M SORRY, BUT THAT'S JUST  MORE B.S.  IF THEY REALLY BELIEVED THAT, HE WOULD BE JOINING US IN SUPPORT   OF THIS AMENDMENT NUMBER 32  WHICH STRIPS THE UNNECESSARY   POLICY RIDER THAT PROHIBITS  CLOSING DOWN THE ALREADY   SHUTTERED YUCCA MOUNTAIN.  IT PREDETERMINES THAT YUCCA  MOUNTAIN WILL BE THE NATION'S  NUCLEAR WASTE DUMP AND HANDCUFFS THE ADMINISTRATION FROM CHOOSING ANOTHER SITE REGARDLESS OF WHAT  ANY STUDIES SHOW.  IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT SOLVING  THIS PROBLEM, WE SHOULD CHANGE   DIRECTION AND ALLOW  CONSENT-BASED SITING.  WE COULD START THAT PROCESS  TODAY AND RIGHT NOW BY   SUPPORTING THIS AMENDMENT. I YIELD BACK.  THE CHAIR: THE GENTLEWOMAN   YIELDS.  MR. KIHUEN: I YIELD BACK T

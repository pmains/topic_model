good evening everybody I welcome you all to this telephone town hall I want to especially thank my co-hosts who I will introduce to you all in a moment but I really especially most especially thank constituents who have called in I'm Madeline Dean congresswoman for the 4th congressional district and we're hosting this telephone town hall the second telephone town hall that we have had on the issue of coronavirus we had one just last week on March the 11th we held our first telephone town hall for our congressional district of Montgomery and Berks County and that one focused on health and on coronavirus itself the symptoms and what we were learning here in Montgomery County and Berks counties this one as you saw is focused on the economy but it would not be right for me to go forward as we talk about the economy without first talking about what we know is fundamental which is we must get a handle mitigate and reduce the spread of coronavirus and the three principles that I have heard are that we must do as much testing as possible to identify the disease we must also continue with the social distancing and I know the constituents of the fourth congressional district are taking that very very seriously it is our responsibility and then of course we are in the search for treatments cures and vaccines so the health piece is going to be critically important to the health of our economy so I didn't want to begin without saying that and without saying a huge shout out to the health care system first responders in all the health care workers who are every single day serving all of us at great risk to themselves and to their families and so I am in awe of their extraordinary skill and service to all of us and I'm very optimistic that we will get on the right side of this and come out I hope I pray stronger for it on our call tonight and and just let me give you some instructions for those of you on the call if you would like to ask a question press star 3 on your phone you'd be connected then with a staff person and I know we will have probably more questions than time for all those questions so if for some reason we don't get to you please be sure to email me at Dean house gov again it star three on your phone for questions here's how we'll run the show tonight I'm going to introduce our four speakers the experts that I've asked to join me to help me learn what we need to know as we go forward with policies in Washington that I hope make important differences for families here each of them will give a little bit of background on themselves and an opening statement to give us their perspective on where we are and where we need to go and then we'll turn it to your questions and our host will help us get through that the speakers that we have dr. mohammed el iran he is an economist and a Wharton professor with extraordinary expertise education and great experience and I'm sure we'll be able to offer us what he learned from the 2008/2009 and beyond economic recession great economic recession I'm very pleased that he is joining us we will also hear from our Secretary of Labor here in Pennsylvania Jerry Olesya he's Secretary of Labor and Industry we'll hear from Carol kill Co she is deputy secretary for business finance at the Department of Community and Economic Development and finally we'll hear from Michael cane deputy district director US Small Business Administration for the eastern district office here of Pennsylvania I do want to say at this time from the federal point of view we have passed two pieces of legislation that have been signed by the president that I'm very pleased were very bipartisan there's no there's no partisanship in tackling a crisis of this kind so we passed an eight point three billion dollar package that has important dollars for research for testing for Small Business Administration for health care supplies last just last week the President signed the second package that we passed another package that was really focused on families making sure that there's adequate access to testing making sure that there is paid sick leave and paid family leave and also making sure that there is food security through the SNAP program through the child senior senior meals student meals and soon food banks now we are considering an important third package that I hope will be very robust and our experts can help me craft and put my input on that and I'll be eager to hear from them and in the end what I what I hope is that we'll see this in the spirit that we are all in this together and there's something I think very reassuring about this even as we have to do our social distancing we owe each other a responsibility we in government all of you a responsibility but we as neighbors one another responsibility so it is in that spirit of togetherness that I want to open up this conversation and I'm going to throw it if I may to dr. mohammed el here on he is an economist and Wharton professor and doctor it's your turn Thank You congresswoman Dean I really appreciate you having me on this call and thank you all for being on it and I join you in a shout out to all those in the healthcare system that are really do incredible work as matt said I am Mohamed el-erian all I will say about myself is I've worked by accident not design in the intersection of economics public policy and mark markets and business and a mold let me start with with a fact we are facing a health crisis if this wasn't enough to make us feel unsettled to make us feel scared we are also facing major economic and financial shocks and my aim in three minutes is to share five bullet points to help explain what we're facing why and so what first the context a necessary phase in this health policy response is social distancing separation and ice nation that should and is dominating it is inconsistent with the way our economy and our markets are wired our economy and markets and social interaction aren't wide for distancing separation isolation they are interconnected they are wired for ever closer integration so it is not surprising that this inconsistent DC has led to what we are seeing everyday in the economy and what we seeing everyday in the marketplace second what are we exactly seeing this unusual economic and market volatility and disruption results from what economists call a sudden stop when everything just stops it is really unfamiliar to most people if you've lived in a failed state where you're afraid of going out because your streets are being bombed if you live in a community hit very hard by a national a a natural disaster you know what that's like but we have never seen this happen at a level of a country and we have never seen at normal country and we have never seen it happen at the level of a global economy but it is happening and to make it very simple the economics it doesn't matter if you want to buy something it doesn't matter whether the store has it it's not going to happen you can have a desire to buy something you can have the money to do so but you can't get to the store and the store has what it wants to sell you and is able to sell you but it can't because there's no interaction that is massive demand and supply destruction massive destruction of consumption and massive destruction of production and that is what we are feeling and going through now third to turn the economy around you need word the congresswoman stressed which is for all of us to have assurance is that the virus can be identified and contained that illnesses can be treated well and that immunity can be increased a vaccine is of course the fast forward solution to most of that but in the absence of that it is about testing it is about social distancing and unfortunately with the social distancing comes the economic and market disruption my fourth point there is a lot that policy can and is doing in the economic and financial realm but there's also something it cannot do and we have to make that distinction because the time will come when it will be able to do it but it's not now what can it what can policy do well we are seeing it coming together policy can protect the most vulnerable segments of society during these massive disruptions policy can support the strategic sectors starting with health care but it's not just health care also national security is really important policy can bolster balance sheet to make sure that a liquidity problem doesn't become a solvency what do I mean by that for people who live from paycheck to paycheck and suddenly they've lost their jobs for know nothing to blame them for that the worst thing that can happen to him is they start missing payments and then they become they become bankrupt maybe they have to declare bankruptcy and disrupt their life for the next seven years same with a company a company will have no revenue for a while because it can't open its doors but it doesn't mean it should be pushed into insolvency same for state a local municipality so we have to make sure that we can protect balance sheets to make sure that liquidity problems on becomes solvency problem we can do that and steps clearly are being taken in that direction what we cannot do is reactivate economic activity because it's not a match lower interest rates that allow us to to refinance our mortgages and put more dollars in our pocket it's not that we can get a cheaper loan it's not even that we get a tax refund it's not about us not having the means to spend it is about us not being able to spend so economic policy cannot create stimulus that cook that we engineers and we energize the economic activity for that we need the medical solutions first and then that policy would be incredibly potent which leads me to my final point and I'm going to end with a personal note like everyone else our family has been yanked out of its comfort zone and find itself an incredibly unsettling uncertain time and yes we were afraid and we are afraid we have found it incredibly important to remind ourselves every single day of the difference between a journey and a destination and those of us who have taken our kids to even an amusement park we're clearly the destination is going to be a lot of fun but the journey lasts for four hours and all you can hear from the back seat is are we there yet are we there yet you know that even a good destination can be associated with a bad journey that's what we have right now this is not about the destination of our economy and our financial system I share Congress woman's Dean's optimism about that this is about a very uncertain and bumpy journey that will end and as the congresswoman said we are all in this together and we will navigate through it together thank you thank you very much Mohammad very much appreciate your perspective and and your experience and bringing it to the journey that is we are all on this journey together and so let's see how we can do it as best we possibly can just a reminder before I introduce the secretary if you want to ask a question please press star three and if for some reason we do not get to your question know that you can always email in to me and we will be continuing to answer your inquiries or take your ideas my email is Dean at my website Dean house gov so please go on our website and contact us next we have Pennsylvania Secretary of Labor and Industry Jerry Alyssia Thank You Madeline and thank you to those on the call and I want to do a quick shout out not only to the medical in front first responders you mentioned but we have a terrific staff with Labor and Industry who are working incredible hours to continue to provide the services that our our citizens need just a brief bio I am NOT some faceless Harrisburg bureaucrat I am a member of the neighborhood I lived in Abington Township for a large part of my life and just recently moved to Upper Dublin Township so I am a constituent of Madelene and I care very much about this community and the Commonwealth as Secretary of Labor and Industry just briefly what we do we have five major areas within our agency unemployment compensation workers compensation Workforce Development Safety and labor management and OVR office of vocational rehabilitation which works with our citizens with disabilities and help them find employment clearly the one that we are focused on primarily right now is unemployment compensation and we are approaching this from school to trying to balance two very competitive pieces here we want to obviously provide the service that our fellow citizens who are in dire need require and we are a large employer we have close to 4,000 employees and we want to protect the health and safety of those employees we have been preparing for this for weeks we have had our what's called our coop plan which is our continuity of operations plan for the agency we have had regular meetings with the governor and the cabinet we have and I have ad in my agency daily meetings with our leadership team so probably the past two weeks or longer and to plan for this and we planned it to respond to what we anticipate anticipate might happen not just to what has happened it's a very fluid situation as you know it's an evolving crisis situation so it's it's we at you know we make the plan we carried them out and then we adjust as needed I can tell you right now we have had a record number of unemployment compensation claims initial claims we can't give out the exact number those numbers are embargoed until next Thursday so whatever we do this week in our unemployment office we can't release those numbers until next Thursday that's federal law and all I will tell you with its record numbers so we are seeing daily how this crisis is impacting people directly where they live we have made some changes in our system we have made some regulatory changes where we've done away with the waiting week normally when someone applies for unemployment there's a week where they don't earn anything that has been done away with we've done away with the work search requirement normally when someone is on our unemployment they have to be looking for other work we're not we've suspended that during this time and also for employers we've there's relief from charges so if an employer has people go on unemployment often that will raise their insurance rates that they pay that will not happen as a result of this so we have as the Commonwealth under the governor's orders shut down in large ways we have essential personnel we have emergency personnel who are working in state buildings throughout Pennsylvania with a large number of people who are working from home as I am when Montgomery County was the first County that was uh you know ordered by the governor to close down the way it did I began working from home I I asked to stay working in Harrisburg I was told to go home and that correctly so I think so you know we have been we have have people working from home or expanding the number of people who are working from home I know it's been difficult at times to get through in the unemployment compensation system but when I tell you that we are dealing with record numbers I mean numbers that we're doing in a week that normally we don't do in a month so we're doing all we can to adapt our system to the needs that we face right now I want to give a lot a couple links and you have a paper and pencil handy eight please get these down and I will share these with Madelene so that you have them I'm going to give you three different flips links that to check one and I if you've been following dr. Levine and particularly dr. Rick Levine our Secretary of Health she's been doing daily briefings often with the governor occasionally with other cabinet officers WWLP a gov that's the Pennsylvania Department of Health website that's health PA gov and there are several links to what's going on with the coronavirus updates on things there the daily changes in the numbers and in what's available so again health PA gov the other one I want to mention is you see PA dot gov you see PA gov that's our unemployment compensation website where you can begin if you are unemployed the process to begin receiving unemployment compensation and one other one I want to give you is you see PA gov slash Co vid 19 - 19 where you will get see frequently asked questions related to unemployment let me gyah one more time it's you see PA gov slash Cova - 19 there are a lot of questions that we're getting we have updated our frequently asked questions and we're updating them regularly to respond to the number of calls and questions that we are getting I can tell you that none of the last one I want to make is that I've been secretary of labor and industry for two and a half years now and from the very beginning I have constantly reminded our staff that it's important that we as the people who make that system run make sure that we follow the policies and you know follow our budgeting and cross the t's and dot the i's or what what's most important to me and I believe to our staff is that we recognize that there are real people at the end of the process you know you are my neighbors your friends in some cases perhaps you are we have colleagues relatives that are being directly impacted by this and one of the best things that about Labor and Industry is that the things we do respond to those immediate needs of people it may take a little longer than we like wait times maybe longer we're still processing things anticipated processing claims within two to four weeks so that someone will begin to receive their benefits but we are we are very keenly aware of the needs of our fellow citizens so with that I'll I'll stop now and answer questions later thank you thanks very much Terry Secretary of Labor and Industry and as you said I just want to remind people it was only two weeks ago that we had the first reported cases here in Montgomery County we were first in the state sadly we appear to be a bit of an epicenter here as of today earlier today our account in Montgomery County is 68 confirmed cases and five confirmed cases in Berks County and of course many more people being tested as we go sadly in Pennsylvania we have had one death and so the numbers are increasing I hope through the social social distancing we're going to see the flattening of that curve but now let me throw it please to Carroll kill Co deputy secretary for business finance Department of Community and Economic Development thank you very much congresswoman I really appreciate the opportunity to be here with you and all your constituents I am the deputy secretary for business finance and and workforce development at the Department of Community and Economic Development I'm going to say DCED from now on because that's so much easier than the entire name this has been unprecedented for our agency for the entire Commonwealth no one has ever seen anything like this at least in our lifetime the issues that are affecting our businesses across the Commonwealth are are quite varied and with this social distancing the closing of physical locations of so many of our businesses which those of us involved know full well that this is what needs to be done first and foremost it is not has not been an easy decision for the governor it has not been taken lightly by anyone that is working with him our secretary secretary Alexi ACK others have been working very closely with the governor talking through all of the issues but our Department of Health Secretary dr. Levine has definitely made the case that this social distancing has to happen and as our first guest this evening said this is not the way our economy works and our companies and our businesses are truly having difficulty and not understanding you know what do they do next and we and we understand that and what we've been trying to do at the DCED is try to address some of the issues that that we've been told it are happening and need to be dressed immediately let me talk to a little bit about what how we've approached that first of all the first thing that our agency did work we worked with our Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency Pima and also the Small Business Administration on the on the federal level to get the requirements pull the requirements together that our state needed for the governor to send a letter to SBA to look for to have this entire state designated so that our small businesses would be eligible for the economic injury disaster loans we were able to do that in very short order did that by using a lot of the partners that we have across the Commonwealth because we know we can't do this alone we have a lot of people that work on the local level a regional level and there are boots on the ground so they're the ones that came to us with the information that we needed and our there's another speaker from SBA and I'm going to have him he's going to go into some of the detail that you will need for those loans if you are small business we are with that being said we also as an agency knew that at the state level we would want to be able to pull together the funding that we we had to be able to help our small businesses in Pennsylvania they're our backbone we understand that they're the ones that are the most vulnerable and in our economies and we in our economy and we need to be able to assist them some many times a lot of our programs aren't as flexible as they should be for some of our even smaller businesses in our communities and so we we knew that and we heard that from a lot of our partners across the Commonwealth we held a couple to three different different calls similar to what is being held tonight with various different state across the Commonwealth and we said to them we need tell us what are you hearing from the business community help us devise a program or re-engineer what we're doing so that we can be more flexible and relevant to our business community and that was extremely helpful and what we ended up doing is working with a program that we already had in place called our bit small business first program and it is a loan program for small businesses and part of what we loan out is working capital so we knew that this was at least a start so typically we our program for work for working capital is three percent interest the first thing that we did is we are going to be asking our board to approve no interest loans through this program we haven't gone to the board yet but we have had significant significant discussions and we we fully expect that there's going to be these loans available for working capital for small businesses up to a hundred thousand dollars we've also done a number of things with a particular program to allow - it will be much more flexible and easier for our businesses to apply now I need to say one thing there is a group of certified economic development organizations across the Commonwealth and particularly in your region Congresswoman that are going to help these businesses apply for these loans I would be more than happy to send you a list of the of that group so that you can disseminate that or make it available on your website and all of this will be available on GDC Edie's website and I will give you that one at the end of my remarks that that's great Thank You Derrick you're more than welcome that particular loan program I'm really excited and happy to be able to report that this the funding that we had in that program was a only 20 million dollars left and we had another program in with another group at which was a bipartisan group called the it's the CFAA financing Authority and we it is the board members are in the legislature and they all agreed to transfer another sixty million dollars into this program to allow us to get this money out to our small businesses and that was very just a very good thing as I'm sure congresswoman that you experienced with your pieces of legislation that it that has been bipartisan because everyone understands how important this isn't and and where we're going that is the main main things that we are doing at DCED we have other initiatives we are very involved with the what's with the governor's waiver and exemption form for the non life sustaining businesses on the closures we have resources for all kinds of resources and lists of resources available for businesses that are affected by the coded nineteen that all of that can be found on the DCED website and that is DCED dot PA gov very simple and as soon as you get on that it comes right up it's there you can get to that information the loan program that I was telling you about will not be available until Wednesday of next week we have to get everything in line which we're almost there but we have our board meeting on Monday but congresswoman I would be more than happy to send you the information so you're ready to give that to your constituents so with that I will end it and hope to be able to answer questions that we will have thank you I thank you for this really great information and just for everybody on the call I ask for your patience we have a tremendous number of questions and good information we're going to be able to take the call a little past one hour so please stay with us again press star 3 if you have a question and now I'd like Michael Caine deputy director of the United States mobile business administration for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to give us his opening remarks Thank You congresswoman and and okay for every all the small businesses here that are on the line I just want to let you know that the SBA is here to help you and I think that's probably one of the most important things I want to make sure to get across to all of you my name is Michael Caine I serve as a deputy district director for SBA in eastern Pennsylvania I've had the privilege of being with this agency coming on 13 years working with small businesses all across the Commonwealth and as MS Kyoko talked about you know the small businesses are the backbone of the economy the the economic engine if you will of of the Commonwealth and frankly of the nation and and we are in unprecedented times right now and folks are confused and they're fearful and not really knowing you know what to do so what I'd like to do is utilize my time this evening to talk to you about what SBA is doing to provide needed assistance to small businesses here in the Commonwealth to help them survive and really get through this crisis and you know I can tell you that we have been working hand-in-hand with our partners over at the state level and you know we've have great relationships going back many years which really enabled us to move quickly on this and I you know we started our conversations kind of at the beginning of this week and and in a matter of days we a disaster declaration covering the entire Commonwealth so all 67 counties and all businesses that are impacted to be able to be taking advantage what we call the economic injury disaster program and you know typically this program is utilized in conjunction with a natural disaster but this is the first time that it has been implemented at the level that we're seeing you know due to the severity of this crisis right now related to kovat 19 so what I want to just kind of I just want to briefly provide some details about this program first and foremost where you would apply for it and the online portal is open so it opened as of yesterday afternoon where Sylvania received its disaster declaration from SBA so any business that's impacted through Kovan 19 can apply at disaster loan dot SBA dot do fee gov right so disaster loan SBA govt and these loans are designed for to provide working capital to small businesses as well as private nonprofits to help them through these extraordinary times that we're in the terms and conditions of these loans are very generous they're designed to have terms up to from some of 30 years with an interest rate at 3.75 percent for for-profit small businesses and 2.75 percent for nonprofits and a small business can borrow up to 2 million dollars with this program so it is really designed to provide a substantial amount of working capital for small businesses that are being impacted to help them pay their bills to help them make payroll ok so that they don't have to necessarily layoff their workers and frankly help all the small businesses to get past this current crisis until the the economy begins to improve that customers start coming back in the door and spending money we recognize how challenging this time is I want to let you know that just like many of you my office is working in its hello work status so all of my staff are working remotely but we are still open for business and taking questions from any small business that is looking for help my office number is six one zero three eight two three zero six two and I will have someone that can answer the phone and speak to you briefly and link you up with one of our lender relations and economic development specialists again I want to let you know you are not we are here to help you and we will help you and and that's all I have right now congressman thank you so much for including me on to this evening's call Michael thank you very much thanks everybody and thanks everybody for the terrific information that you offered we're now going to turn it to the question portion and I would ask anybody who wants to ask a question star three we do have a lot of questions already in the chute so I thank you for that and if you have when we recognize you if you would and if you can direct your question to one of us I'm going to start with a friend and colleague representative Matt Bradford Matt Bradford it serves in the Pennsylvania House for Montgomery County he is also the chair of the Appropriations Committee and he is a fine public servant and my friend Matt Thank You congresswoman Dean thanks for your clear-headed and compassionate response I realized these are term everyone's using unprecedented time but you've been a great leader for Montgomery County and I want to thank you but one of the concerns obviously at the state level is just because of the magnitude of the challenges ahead of us we're going to need not just a timely response but a robust and comprehensive federal response our state government while doing amazing work and I was glad to hear Secretary Alexia candy CD talk about what they're doing at some point because resources as we go from from response to recovery and really rebuilding this economy to get not just employees but employers the help they need we're going to need federal assistance obviously you guys my great job getting that ball rolling what's that going to look like going forward I thank you for the question thanks for all you're doing as you can imagine we have been on so many conference calls learning from experts but also arguing for what we think needs to be a part of the third bill that the Senate is considering now they're on a phone call literally tonight and a bipartisan way trying to hammer out the details that they want to come forward with but I will tell you on every single call and I've been on a couple dozen support for municipalities is one of the foremost things that we talk about we recognize at the federal level that we are going to have to provide direct funding to local governments whether it's reimbursing fire police emergency we have to that has to be a part of the package we also a part of a caucus and one of the things that we are fighting for is to use emergency authorities the Treasury and the Federal Reserve should buy municipal bonds make sure that insurers see their costs of finance that they don't see these things spike so we know that part of whatever we do has to protect human capital by direct support to people it has to protect our businesses by direct support to businesses small medium and large but it has to and there has not been a single conversation that neglects municipalities the state governments of course but local municipalities and direct support for local municipalities so I I believe it will be an urgent part of the next package and I don't believe bill number three is going to be the end we're in this for a longer haul all right thanks Matt the next call the next question is from Sandra now you can ask it now I know I have a question I'm very concerned you know with this virus in everything because I'm 81 years old trying to stay in the house and healthy I wanted to know oh my I depends on this real estate rebate that I get to take the rest of my taxes all right are they still going to be having that you're I think you're talking about the property tax read read a ha yes and also a plus yes I believe the state will continue processing those and that is critically important I was a state representative along with Matt Bradford before I went to Congress and we know how critically important those are I believe the state is going to stay on schedule with those that the other thing that's awfully important is for people who are filing their taxes their income taxes and I attended upon a reimbursement for their their tax returns people should continue if they can file on time so that you can get timely return of your tax refunds both of those sets of resources whether it's property tax rent rebate or your income tax return those are both sources that we want people to go forward and and process if I'm saying anything wrong on the state side Jerry or the others let me know Madalena I have heard of no program like that that's been suspended we are doing all we can to continue to meet the obligations and and the commitments we've made to our citizens Carol I don't know if you've heard anything otherwise yeah I I have to say the same I've heard nothing like that in fact everything that I've heard in discussions that I've been involved in is only to strengthen those kinds of programs and to make sure that it happens absolutely great and and I want to make sure Mohammad did you have anything you wanted to add I didn't I sort of let you speak on the first question about a to municipalities and what a package should look like what should we be thinking about Thank You congresswoman and I think like you said we should expect something there a package would be aimed at stabilizing the market so that we don't have disruptions that stalled municipalities and local government and States from the ability to raise money in the future it would be administered by the Federal Reserve it would be a special window if you like and really the bottom line is to minimize more breakage not because markets are special but because they are the vehicle to restoring normality and we will restore normality my understanding is something is being worked on as we speak thank you Marlene if I could add something quickly yes go right ahead sir uh one of the things that I know our unemployment compensation system will need is surprisingly enough dollars our most of our our direct funds that provide unemployment compensation come from taxes and insurance that are paid by employers and employees we do get significant federal dollars that go toward our administrative costs so we're going to need at some point we do not have finite resources as you know we're going to need some support for the unemployment compensation systems around the country not just administrative Lieb utt in many cases and for their trust funds as well in the past when there's been recessions the federal government has lent money to the states and sometimes they have been industry interest-free loans other times they haven't been but any support that could be provided to the systems across the country that provide unemployment compensation would be a significant help thank you very much our next call is from Richard full service off premises catering throughout the region and as a result we my business has effectively gone from a successful business over 50 years to potentially zero revenue and zero income for the next four months all of our events that we've had contracted for through the end of may have can't have cancelled or postponed I understand I was online for about four hours today trying to access the SBA I understand its overwhelmed but my particular concern is that the information being provided state level is not accurate originally companies like mine were directed to the Pennsylvania small business first fund which apparently is non-existent when you go to the PID a link and it says to apply it's simply a name and a phone number so I'm wondering if the state applications will be available online or are we going to have to wait for the individuals and these local offices someone I think the name that was redirected to was David Niles at the Monaco development office in Plymouth Meeting do we have to just wait for them to call us back yes this is Carol with DCED I'm on our website right now and I'm not you said that the PID C was non-existent what what I can tell you now this law business small business probably on there redirect to the p90x and when you click on a PID a and says apply its all it is is a listing a PDF listing of offices it's not an application correct first of all the program that I was talking about that is going to be specific to our small businesses that are affected by kovat 19 will not be available until Wednesday of next week that the there will not be an application on our website there will be information in US and what is is confusing you I know is that list that person that that mr. Niles that you were to call him we are working through those groups they're called our sir economic development organizations to help you with the application because to make sure that you're able to you know get the information that you need for the application and they will submit it on your behalf I hope you have them working I hope you have more than one individual who's going to be handling these applications because you have thousand companies that are affected by this yes we understand that we absolutely do we 60 across the Commonwealth and I'm not sure how many exactly are in your area but it's more than one person each of those groups have has won more than one office in Montgomery County okay we if you have a problem if you have you called mister Nile left messages okay all right congresswoman I'd be more than happy to help this gentleman if someone could get me his information uh if that's possible or I look yeah I could we'll take care of information but to your point Richard you are one of sadly many yeah we're going to be a tremendous number of small business owners I think of the restaurants from the caterers and all of the extraordinary terrific stories of people growing businesses that are in incredibly serious jeopardy from the federal level and so Richard make sure we have your contact information but I want to say to the thousands of others within this district who have the same kind of concern this is we're just getting started the first bill that we passed had seven billion dollars in low-interest loans to affected small businesses that was just a start we know that in this next build in the conversations I'm hearing that number has to be much much more robust 25 you know billion it has to be so much more robust there's also conversations around grants not loans but grants to small businesses the other thing that I believe and I know is that with small business loans if we make them accessible and quickly get capital to you so you can sustain that business and keep employees and and and and hope to re-up and reopen and repurpose when you can we know that many of these SBA loans are going to be paid back so it's not as though we're out the money entirely but but know that this is just getting started I believe the first bill was not was only a start not nearly enough and there's more to do anybody else on that one and Richard if you would offer your contact information to us that would be great okay the next call and again it was star three although I think I probably have tons and tons of calls here already lined up Charles hi I'm a retiree and I'm 60 plus years old and I'm just looking at the new legislation you're working on I know you're still in the weeds on that and I know you probably can't give details because it's still in flux but what I was thinking about is as a retiree who hasn't had a w-2 for several years I was wondering if I will be able to be part of the legislation considering the money that you guys are going to hand out not handout but you know provide to Americans as an individual not to a loan or anything like that but the checks that they were talking about and then also I'd like make comment as a very retiree I'm glad you have Muhammed on here because the gentleman knows what he's talking about and thank you for your leadership bad thank you very much Charles and and I'll be happy to let anybody else speak on this particularly Muhammad if you have thoughts about how we do this and make sure we protect seniors as well in all the conversations and you're talking about for example direct cash payments it is amazing how quickly this has moved under our feet and I've been arguing for direct cash payments to Americans seniors included of course and children because we know that as muhammad described so aptly this sudden stop this jolt and just a freezing of our economy in terms of supply and demand we have to make sure that we get direct cash payments to everyone and so there are multiple different scenarios I have introduced a piece of legislation that mirrors one that was also introduced by Senators Bennet Booker and Brown sherrod Brown in the Senate it is direct cash payments to all adults $2,000 for the first payment for adults 2,000 for children and then a quarterly reduction based on employment and unemployment figures for the next two quarters moving forward we don't even know the depth of the need that we need to drive dollars and resources to America's families but know that seniors are certainly a part of it Muhammad could you tell me your perspective on that yes you are absolutely right the approach to this is through direct payments get them there quickly the approach that you have just explained it is the best approach it I know there may be better ways of doing it but speed is of essence here we have heard on this call I'll come back to that of the importance of quickly getting oxygen into the system before it freezes completely and at some point there will be need to refine it there will be need to adjust it as we learn from experience because this thing isn't going away anytime soon but let's not make the best enemy of the good when we have to react immediately and let me just thank Mack who is kind words and and thank everybody I think the feedback you provide as to what you are experiencing is a thousand times more effective than economists like me trying to explain what is going on in the economy we heard from the very successful business owner of what it's like to suddenly have liquidity problems and and risk insolvency Matthew told us what it's like for with I reason I think these sorts of stories what will drive the response thank you thank you very much the next call and question is from Jay Lee yes hi hi thank you so much for taking my call and for your leadership congresswoman and for each of the experts on the line I'd really appreciate the support and just feeling supported in the isolation so thank you for that I have two questions my first question is what type of support I know the bills that have gone forward but what type of support is there for those that are self-employed my husband is a therapist and obviously you know there's no face-to-face clients because people are coming out and I'm a fundraising consultant so obviously no one's doing fundraising right now so we'll do that movement of heart one that's part one of my question and my second part is we also because of that get insurance through the marketplace and I haven't heard anyone talking at all about that my husband is also immunosuppressed he's a kidney transplant patient a kidney had his transplant in 2011 but he's obviously if you know suppressed so if we lose our insurance because we have no income you know that's an issue is is that is anyone addressing those that get their insurance through the marketplace to insure that they don't lose their insurance because of it we're sort of worst-case scenario here Thank You Julie for your questions I want to ask Mike Michael or Carol help with the independent workers the freelancers and then we can also talk about insurance sure hey this is Michael Caine from the SBA so as a part of the eligible types of businesses for the economic injury disaster loan program sole proprietors for that are self-employed such as your you and your husband that you would definitely qualify for that particular program so you know if you go into the application portal you would identify as a sole proprietor you know there's some documentation that you would need to upload as a part of your application you know such as you know your your previous taxes and things like that but it's it's pretty easy for you to fill that information in um the other thing that that part of the application process they'll be asking you for is you know the level of financial impact that you've experienced and what you're projecting that impact to be um you know as a part of determining you know how much of a loan for example that you would qualify for so if you need help with that I can tell you that you know we have some resource partner organizations that we work with that are offering free assistance to help folks with that to help them with the application process so we work with an organization called the small business development centers and we also work with another organization called score both of those you know that you can access like I said for free counseling to help you through that application process and I can tell you that the folks with the Pennsylvania Small Business Development Center network are going to be offering free online courses that are going that we're going to be partnering with them working through the entire application process to try to make it as painless as possible for you yes this is Carol unfortunately at this point a sole proprietor does not is not eligible for our particular loan but I can tell you that we are looking at some changes that need legislative changes and that's that's the issue with this particular loan program that some of the requirements are legislative and we would have to go to the legislature to legislature to make those types of changes but that badly and part of the discussion yes and chilly for your circumstance I think it only reinforces by one and you represent so many other people the need for us to make sure we do robust cash payments to adults and families for those of you so that you can remain in business so that you can pay your rent and pay your be part of ACA and make sure your insurance is covered so know that one of my strong focuses is on making sure that we get a robust and as Mohammed points out quick timely payment of cash to people to make sure freelancers or independent contractors can pay their bills I think our next question sort of lost track here hold on here Jeffrey you are our bring this townhall it's been been very informative so thank you for having the Town Hall my question pertained to the cash payments that you were just speaking of I think there's some confusion as to who would be eligible and who wouldn't and I just thought maybe you had some more information as it pertained to what your income level is and if you would get a cash payment or not if you're confused you're right to be confused because nothing has been decided but I will say that there's been really terrific conversation around who is in need I think because of the gravity of the situation so many of us in Congress are recognizing that we have to do something that literally three weeks ago many would not have thought was even on the horizon that we have to get robust cash payments to individuals but in every phone call in every conference call the the idea is make sure we get it to the people most in need and make sure that we don't hand out checks to millionaires and billionaires so every one of these proposals none of them yet is in law so that is why you're uncertain of it but every one of these proposals talks about the need to make sure we get it to the lowest in the middle income folks and then phase it out most programs and mine included my legislation included would phase it out at the higher income levels but none of that has been determined yet that muhammad' do you have a guide or a reference that you would offer us as to the wisest way to make sure we get money to the folks who need it most no I think you have covered it but I would say if I may also to the earlier question on on the insurance payment we are seeing industry groups step up and respond collectively to these issues and I would that we will see insurance companies also pressing the pause button on payments on on having a payment stand still until we all navigate through this so I think that you will also see the private sector responding to the real importance of not turning a short-term problem into a long one that's really true I've been on calls with small community bankers I've been in calls with the eight big banks today and insurance companies you're absolutely right I've been so impressed by the just forward-thinking making sure they're in it to help people forbearance on payments forbearance on any kind of credit checks forbearance on mortgage payments so you're absolutely right industries are stepping up and and doing unusual things as they should we all have to step up I'll give you one simple anecdote one of the issues that we're having is supply of masks and China has re-upped its its production of masks in the airline industry with their large wide-body planes that are not in use for transcontinental travel are now going to be flying empty to China to bring back supplies lots and lots of industries are stepping up as we're seeing nonprofits step up you're seeing your own neighbors step up so you're absolutely right I think there will be lots of room for folks to make sure that they retain their coverage for the insurance all right our next call is from Paul Paul would you ask your question oh hi Congress on this is Paul from Glenside I love I live in Mill how are you doing I'm doing great you know Glenside that's where I was born and raised yep as you know I live in Mount Vernon apartments across from you is I believe Rosedale for Lindy apartment is over 200 families that live here so you know there's there's well over a thousand people my concern is that maybe if not necessarily for these apartments but certainly across the country thousands and thousands of dollars a month and checks being met out even even for a few months will be seen as an opportunity for rent increases plus you know other price increases i I think that is absolutely has to be a cap on rent because this can't be seen as an opportunity for profiteering and the only way you can do that is with price controls and in particular rent control oh one other question is relation to the economics professor you can chime in on this when it when it comes to giving out this money on a monthly basis for each adult in each child whatever that some might be I don't think we need to get concerned with some sort of means testing and saying that we know Warren Buffett or whatever mark you-ting shouldn't get a check everybody's files and income taxes on Social Security as a government pension and yeah anybody that's anywhere on the radar send them a check and you know what tax the wealthy everyone's making over $400,000 a year and their income tax rate goes up another 5% personal income tax rate or capital-gains to go back up for like you know 20% but the more bureaucratic hurdles that get thrown out there the slower takes for the money to get out so I'm not basically concerned about rent control and just getting the money out as quickly as possible clawback the excess from the wealthy three taxes I appreciate all those comments I'll just make a quick comment pull some of the conversations about making sure that we get some robust direct cash to people has to do with making sure that people can make their rent payments but also balancing the need of landlords to get rent payments so I'm aware of your concern about spikes of rent but I actually think the opposite is going to be what we have to be balancing that we make sure that people have the money to pay the landlords so the landlord's remain in business we got to protect business and we got to protect the tenants it has to be a combination of both any bad actor out there excuse me a landlord who tries to take advantage of the situation I think would be foolhardy number one because this is not a time to increase rents on people who can't pay it and also I think government has a role to play to help them with their businesses and make sure you and anybody else in these properties has the the capacity to pay rent again this is through no fault of anybody on this planet this is a global pandemic it is a virus we need to get ahead of the health and science and medicine part of it but we also need to make sure that we play the right role to protect individuals families in their homes and the landlords who have the properties okay Wayne you are up Wayne are you available did we lose you all right let's try crisp see if chris is still on the line and I really thank everyone for your patience and for being on the line I certainly thank my hosts for the terrific input that they've offered I'm here well here Chris go right ahead congresswoman Dean I think you're awesome I've seen you on c-span you're doing a great job my question is for Department labor in history you know I'm worried that I've applied for unemployment I'll get it I'm a union member it's not a big issue for me I go on and altered as needed I'm always happy with unemployment the way I'm treated he's right you know I feel like you guys actually do understand people like me on the other end I'm concerned that you know I'll get unemployment compensation and whatever else comes I'll somehow be less eligible or money will be taken away right when I you know need to get on my feet the most and someone like me the second I can get off of any kind of assistance I will get off it I will make more money doing my job doing my work so you know I'm not looking to take advantage of anyone here in this Chris tell me what your work is I work in the movie and television industry there's a couple jobs in Philly right now and I also work in New York New Jersey Connecticut Delaware unemployment has to search through many states to find my money I have 1015 jobs in the year and yet says they work hard and they've always taken care of me so I'm a much appreciative well thank you for your important work so I'm sorry - no - go ahead I'm sorry bad no go right ahead the Secretary of Labor thank you for your your comments about our our staff I would agree we are not in the business of punishing people and there are no plans to you know do play those kind of you know the systems games we want people to get back on their feet as quickly as possible we have federal regulations and rules we have to follow state laws and regulations we have to follow and we will follow those but we where we're not going to look to you know get money back if in a situation like you're describing no we do it and normally if someone is overpaid which does happen on occasion because of the timing and and information that people provide that's a standard part of the system if if there's an overpayment that's kind of built within the system but in extreme circumstances like that we're waiving what requirements we can we'd love to see the federal government and that this is another thing to put in your legislation there's a 26-week limit on how long people can collect unemployment and we'd like to see that extended so we want to do what we can to make sure people's needs are met and that we we do that as quickly and as effectively and as efficiently as possible and I'm really thankful to everybody for staying on the line a little bit longer and I am very sorry for those whose questions I was not able to get but I do want to say that please call into our office or go on deemed outhouse gov and send your questions in at this time what I wanted to do is most especially thank all of you for listening

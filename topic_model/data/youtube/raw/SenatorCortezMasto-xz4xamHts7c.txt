thank you welcome congratulations on your nominations welcome to your family as well it's great to see everyone here miss home Andy let me start with you if that's all right obviously you have an accomplished background in rail and safety issues and given that you are acutely aware that there have been various examples of concerning derailments with crude oil by rail and hazardous materials in recent years as no surprise I'm from Nevada I'm deeply concerned with any effort to dramatically expand the movement of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste in our nation's rail and highway network I've previously submitted a report in to the committee record that underscores that this hazardous material would be traveling in close proximity to tens if not possibly hundreds of millions of Americans including through 329 congressional districts and a vast majority of the lower 48 states would all be impacted by shipments to Yucca Mountain in Nevada and nearly all of these folks won't have any idea when where or how much is traveling through their communities and to give you a sense of this scale this project would require the shipment of waste from 76 sites in 9,500 rail casks within 2,800 trains 2650 trucks hauling one case each to Yucca Mountain for over 50 years but it isn't the lack of the foolproof safety of our infrastructure that I'm concerned with and everyone else in this country should be as well is the public and so my question to you is the public provided with information on the timing of shipments and hazardous waste moving through their community would they know that the public know that no senator and so under the concern under the current system highly dangerous radioactive waste would be moving on a railroad railway down the street and families across the country would have no idea that that is occurring is that accurate that's accurate and can you speak to what other rail and labor safety regulatory efforts have been legislated on or or that even been recommended by the NTSB that have not been put into effect yet yes there there are a number of measures that have not been implemented yet some were in the 2008 build PTC being one of them fatigue management plans and certainly a minimum training standard for minimum training standards for rail workers but even with all of those implemented you could not engineer out 100% the risk of transporting nuclear waste and 75 to 90% will be going by rail so if an accident did occur it could be devastating thank you thank you very much mr. King I want to talk to you about an issue that has come to my attention because I've recently received letters a number of them but this one has been signed by a number of groups including the League of Conservation Voters and Union of Concerned Scientists and in the letter they state the recent leaked joint a traffic draft proposal for light duty vehicle standards for fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions shows that nitsa alongside the EPA intends to significantly significantly weaken the existing standards through model year 2026 this proposal relies on unjustified cost analysis and data flawed safety assumptions and blatant disregard for energy conservation and climate change this proposal would increase oil consumption by two hundred and six billion gallons of gasoline between the years 2020 and 2050 further it will put the American industry behind in the global market where many of our largest competitors like China and India are moving forward with more stringent standards now Nevadans and all Americans want more fuel-efficient cars to save them money in fact a recent consumers union survey found nearly nine out of ten consumers want automakers to continue to raise fuel efficiency and on this issue of cafe standards in fact I've literally been visited by automakers who recently came in and we talked on a number of issues and they underscored to me that they don't want to have this form of a rollback in cafe standards do you believe this is in the interests of the US to reduce our oil use of oil no senator there was there was a lot there there is an ongoing rulemaking that I'm working with my colleagues at the Environmental Protection Agency on that rulemaking there is not yet a proposal we will propose a rulemaking soon for a public comment period I have seen the press reports you reference I've not seen the documents that they believe may be leaked but I can assure you that both the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the EPA are working together on a data and science driven process and look forward to a transparent process and receiving public comment the letters you've received I would encourage those commenters to participate vigorously in that process to make sure that this very important rulemaking is the best possible in its outcome can I ask you do you agree that keeping the one national program together is important for industry certainty absolutely thank you I noticed my time is up thank you very much

I will now recognize the author of HR 596 representative Gosar for a brief statement about his bill Thank You chairman lambourne and members of the subcommittee thank you for the opportunity to testify and why responsibly increasing energy development our public lands is critical to our nation's future energy security and the name for passage of HR 596 while I am grateful for all of our witnesses participation today I'm extremely pleased to be joined today at the searing by two witnesses from my home state of Arizona supervisor Wilson and program manager fit sir I really appreciate both of you making the trip and look forward to your testimonies today renewable energy sources like wind and solar are an integral part of a true all the above energy strategy our nation's public lands can play a critical role in supporting that mission but uncertainty in the permitting process impedes or delays our ability to harness our renewable energy potential and must be reformed HR 596 public lands Renewable Energy Development Act will help spur renewable energy development on federal lands in a way that yields maximum benefits to States counties and our citizens that enjoy these lands my bill will bring wind and solar energy more in line with the way other forms of energy development are permitted creating greater long-term predictability uncertainty it would direct revenue so that the states and counties received their fair share hunting and fishing opportunities would be enhanced and permits would be processed more efficiently I introduced HR 596 in February of 2013 since then the BLM is conducted two solar lease sales one generated nearly six million dollars in high bids and the other one generated no bids this is the type of test that my bill was designed to apply to the concept of competitive leasing for wind and solar I look forward to hearing the testimony from the administration and the solar energy industry association on what things they have learned from their these competitive auctions if there are lessons that can be extracted from their experiences and can strengthen i strengthen my bill then i look forward to applying them if any of our other witnesses have suggested for improving the bills then I want to hear from them as well that is exactly what the hearing is for what we in Congress cannot do is sit idly on our hands there's tremendous potential for renewable energy development on our public lands in my district in this in the county that supervisor Wilson represents there is a BLM solar energy zone with the potential to produce up to 600 20 megawatts of energy the expansive public lands of Arizona contain many parcels that are well-suited for renewable energy development this is also true true for many areas across the country especially in the West we must take take advantage of these potential right here at home and create American jobs while also reducing our dependence on volatile foreign energy sources this legislation establishes a revenue sharing mechanism that ensures a fair return to all HR 596 distributes rents and royalties by returning 25% of the royalties to the state 25% to the county 15% to the BLM for the purpose of more efficiently processing permit application and twenty-five percent is depositing a fund for the sportsman of conservation purposes including increasing outdoor recreation such as hunting fishing and hiking the remaining ten percent is deposited into the greater general fund of the US Treasury for the purposes of deficit reduction since federal lands are not taxable state and local governments deserve a share of the revenues from the sale of energy production on the lands within their borders these resources will help local governments deliver critical services and develop much-needed capital improvement projects such as roads road maintenance public safety and law enforcement our nation's public lands must play an integral role in our country's energy future HR 596 is an opportunity to address several problems with a simple solution this bill will allow us to streamline the permitting process for effective use of public lands spur development of renewable energy allow local counties to benefit from sources developed within their borders and support new access for sportsmen and outdoor enthusiasts HR 596 has strong bipartisan support with 60 total co-sponsors more than 30 from of which our folks from the other side of the aisle the bill has also earned the endorsement of 60 plus organizations including the National Association of counties the Western Governors Association Trout Unlimited the Nature Conservancy duck unlimited the American sports fishing Association and the Association and Fish and Wildlife agencies the county supervisors Association of Arizona and countless others I would like to take I would like to submit a few of the written a few of these record letters and documents into the Congressional Record at this time sign no objection so ordered thank you again mr. chairman for the opportunity to testify the importance of HR 596 and mr. chairman with that I yield back

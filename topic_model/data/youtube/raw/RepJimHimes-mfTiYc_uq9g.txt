chair now recognizes the gentleman from Connecticut mr. Himes for five minutes Thank You mr. chairman and thank you mr. secretary for being with us today I have a few questions but I just want to take a minute maybe to restore a little bit of order to this or balance to this discussion that has emerged on our debt mr. secretary like you I believe that a concern with our debt is prudent and I think I say that with some credibility having supported measures that balance our long-term debt scenario some of which were unpopular however when that concern becomes ideology blind to all facts and economic advice and reality it is something different than prudence and the five years I've been here i have heard over and over and over again that the question is not when we have a disaster associated with our debt but sorry not if but when that just around the corner is a debt induced disaster that the federal the federal reserve's expansionary monetary policy inflation is just around the corner and of course the hallmark of every single one of those multiple predictions in the last five years is that they have been absolutely wrong of course in those five years a consensus has developed in the economic community broadly shared that in fact the fiscal the contractionary fiscal policies of this Congress the austerity have meaningfully contributed to a reduction in growth and to the loss of otherwise creatables in this economy mr. secretary you might be interested to know that when Chairman Bernanke was sitting just where you're sitting I asked him conscious as I am of the importance of long-term stability in our debt whether he could point to any industrialized country which had better managed the tensions in the last five years between the need to reduce long-term debt and the need to assist in economic recovery sometimes there are significant tension in those two needs the chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke could not name a country which had better managed those tensions and I know you've been a part of that effort and I thank you for your work in that regard mr. secretary my question is about the Volcker rule like you I was pleased to see that the regulator's finally mount with a rule I agree with you I think that it is strong and comprehensive I am however concerned by the explicit exemption for proprietary trading with respect to sovereign bonds frankly also the exemption for muni bonds the headline Bank brought low by investments in Greek debt i think is probably not just an idea and certainly it's a possibility in the future so i wonder if you could address the ability under the Volcker rule of the banks to invest in securities which could be very very risky and quite volatile over time congressman obviously our initial core concern was the treatment of us treasuries and issues arose particularly with regard to the impact that the rule would have on on banks with relationships with other foreign nationals and their sovereign debt I believe that the way the provisions were worked out it provides guidelines you know a path for for sovereign debts to bonds to be treated appropriately I am I think if you look at the the structure of the rule it's clear that there is accountability at the level of the CEO to come up with a plan for implementing these rules in a way that's consistent with the statute and the risks that are being undertaken so I don't think all of the detail is necessarily reflected in the black letter law of the rule there's going to be questions of interpretation it was deliberately left to be worked out by the regulators and the firm's to reach a balance so that we don't shut down a very important sovereign market including the market for us treasuries so it's something we'll continue to work on with with this committee and and with the regulators if I could just say well I could I have one other question I appreciate that answer I just having worked in that industry for a long period of time I know they will gravitate towards exemptions and both miu knees and sovereign bonds present the possibility of very real risk so I yet you and the regulators will continue to watch that closely one other question before I run on time mr. secretary I'm pertains to a statement in your written testimony dodd-frank many of the regulatory changes being largely completed in now I wonder if I heartened to hear that but I wonder if in my 30 or so seconds remaining you could talk a little bit about how you're feeling about systemic risk and in particular the problem of too big to fail to make the question very simple as titled to succeeded in fact in reducing the likelihood that we see a major dislocation or problem in one of our big in one of our major banks I'm not sure I can do that in five seconds mr. chairman do I have you have three I think what we'll give you about 20 or 30 yeah we've made enormous progress since 2009 we're much safer and sounder and I made some very detailed remarks on this last week I'd be happy to give a more detailed response when I have the time Thank you Thank You mr. chairman time

>>> THE HISTORIC CONFIRMATION  HEARINGS FOR THE FIRST BLACK  WOMAN SUPREME COURT NOMINEE,  THERE WERE MOMENTS OF GRACE,  LIKE THIS POWERFUL MOMENT WITH  SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WHAT IT MEANS  TO BE AMONG THE FIRST, THE FEW,  OR THE ONLY. CALIFORNIA'S FIRST LATINO  SENATOR, ALEX PADILLA. >> WHAT WOULD YOU SAY, JUDGE  JACKSON, TO ALL THOSE YOUNG  AMERICANS, THE MOST DIVERSE  GENERATION IN OUR NATION'S  HISTORY, WHAT DO YOU SAY TO SOME OF THEM WHO MAY DOUBT THAT THEY  CAN ONE DAY ACHIEVE THE SAME  GREAT HEIGHTS THAT YOU HAVE? >> I WOULD TELL THEM TO  PERSEVERE. >> JOINING ME NOW IS CALIFORNIA  SENATOR ALEX PADILLA, MEMBER OF  THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. SENATOR PADILLA, WELCOME BACK TO "THE SUNDAY SHOW." THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. >> THANK YOU, JONATHAN. GOOD TO BE BACK WITH YOU. >> SO, SENATOR PADILLA, TELL ME  ABOUT THAT MOMENT BETWEEN YOU  AND JUDGE JACKSON. >> SO GLAD YOU'RE RAISING THIS  AND THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT, BECAUSE IT NEEDS TO BE  AMPLIFIED. I SAW DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY  AND YOU COVERED THIS IN YOUR  PRIOR INTERVIEWS, SORT OF THE  TWO HEARINGS THAT WERE TAKING  PLACE. ONE, PREDOMINANTLY DEMOCRATS  FOCUSED ON ISSUES OF LAW,  QUESTIONS OF JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY AND THE QUALIFICATIONS THAT WE  WOULD ALL HOPE TO HAVE IN A  SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. AND ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE,  ATTACK AFTER ATTACK, UNDERMINING HER RECORD, TAKING ITEMS OUT OF  CONTEXT. SHE DESERVES BETTER. THE COUNTRY FRANKLY DESERVED  BETTER THAN WHAT WE SAW LAST  WEEKEND, KNOWING SHE IS NOT JUST MORE THAN IMMINENTLY QUALIFIED  TO BE A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE,  BUT IS ON THE VERGE OF MAKING  HISTORY. WHAT IT TAKES FOR SOMEONE LIKE  JUDGE JACKSON, SHE TOLD THE  STORY HERSELF, GROWING UP IN  MIAMI, GRADUATING FROM PUBLIC  SCHOOLS, HAVING THE AUDACITY TO  APPLY FOR AND GO TO HARVARD  COLLEGE, TO GRADUATE FROM  HARVARD LAW SCHOOL, HER PUBLIC  AND PRIVATE SECTOR EXPERIENCE AS AN ATTORNEY BEFORE BECOMING A  JUDGE, HAVING MORE EXPERIENCE AS A JUDGE THAN FOUR OTHER SUPREME  COURT JUSTICES COMBINED WHEN  THEY WERE NOMINATED, ONLY TO BE  SUBJECTED TO THE ATTACKS FROM MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES, IT WAS  INFURIATING AND HAVING BEEN  THROUGH SIMILAR STRUGGLE. I JUST COULDN'T HELP BUT RELATE, I COULDN'T HELP BUT TO CONNECT  WITH JUDGE JACKSON, HEART TO  HEART, AND I FIGURED SHE  DESERVED TO HAVE THAT PLATFORM  TO RESPOND TO THAT WITH THE  GRACE THAT SHE DID WITH THAT  QUESTION AND THE GRACE SHE  DEMONSTRATED THROUGHOUT THE  HEARINGS LAST WEEK. >> YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS  THAT WAS AMONG MANY THAT WAS  OFFENSIVE ABOUT THE LINE OF  QUESTIONING FROM SOME  REPUBLICANS ON THE -- ON THE  COMMITTEE WAS THAT IT -- THEY  WERE SORT OF BESIDE THE POINT. THEY HAD NOTHING REALLY TO DO  WITH JUDGE JACKSON, HER  QUALIFICATIONS, HER PHILOSOPHY  OR ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THEIR POTENTIAL CANDIDACIES FOR PRESIDENT. THAT'S THE WAY IT CAME ACROSS TO ME, SITTING AT HOME, OR IN MY  OFFICE, WATCHING IN THE  HEARINGS. YOU WERE IN THE ROOM. WAS THAT THE ELEPHANT IN THE  ROOM, THAT THESE JOKERS WERE  REALLY RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, ON THE BACK OF A BLACK WOMAN  SUPREME COURT NOMINEE? >> YEAH, LOOK, IT WAS PALPABLE,  JONATHAN. WHAT WE GOT FROM JUDGE JACKSON  WAS GRACE, GRACE, GRACE. WHAT WE GOT FROM SEVERAL OF OUR  REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES WAS  GRIEVANCE, GRIEVANCE, GRIEVANCE. AND I THINK IT WAS ACTUALLY ONE  OF THE REPUBLICANS, SENATOR  SASSE, WHO CALLED HIM OUT FOR -- I WON'T USE HIS -- THE  TERMINOLOGY HE USED, BUT HE  CALLED OUT THAT, I THINK, THEIR  OBJECTIVE, A CAMPAIGN VIDEO AS  AN OUTCOME OF THIS, WHICH IS A  DISSERVICE, DISRESPECT TO THE  PROCESS. THIS IS A CONFIRMATION HEARING  FOR A SUPREME COURT NOMINEE. SOMEONE WHO HAS THE CREDENTIALS  AND CAN SERVE ON THE HIGHEST  COURT IN THE LAND FOR DECADES TO COME. AND SO WE GOT TO KEEP BRINGING  THE FOCUS BACK THERE. THE -- FOR ALL THE REPUBLICANS  WHO SAID I HAVE NO QUESTIONS  ABOUT YOUR RECORD, NO QUESTIONS  ABOUT YOUR QUALIFICATIONS, BUT  THEN TO PIVOT AND TRY TO MAKE A  POLITICAL STATEMENT, IT WAS  INFURIATING, BUT THE LONGER  JUDGE JACKSON WAS IN THE HOT  SEAT, THE BETTER SHE LOOKED IN  MY OPINION IN HOW SHE ANSWERED  TO THE QUESTIONS, THE  TEMPERAMENT SHE DISPLAYED, AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THIS,  JONATHAN, AFTER SEEING ALL THAT, REVIEWING HER RECORD, SEEING HER GRACE UNDER PRESSURE, IF SHE  CANNOT GET BIPARTISAN SUPPORT  FROM COMMITTEE AND THE FULL  SENATE TO BE CONFIRMED, IT IS A  SAD STATEMENT IN AMERICA AND  SENDS A HORRIBLE MESSAGE TO THE  COUNTRY ABOUT THE, YOU KNOW IF  YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE  POLITIZATION OF THE SUPREME  COURT, ABOUT WHERE WE ARE. >> ACTUALLY, ON THAT POINT, REAL QUICKLY, SENATOR, YOU RAISE A  GOOD POINT, JUDGE JACKSON  DOESN'T GET A SINGLE REPUBLICAN  VOTE, WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT  OUR POLITICS? BUT I'M REMINDED THAT NOW  JUSTICE AMY CONEY BARRETT DIDN'T GET A SINGLE DEMOCRATIC VOTE. SO SHOULD JUDGE JACKSON, SHOULD  YOU BE EXPECTING A REPUBLICAN  VOTE, A REPUBLICAN VOTE FOR HER  GIVEN THAT THERE WERE NO  DEMOCRATIC VOTES FOR AMY CONEY  BARRETT? >> SO, FIRST OF ALL, THIS IS THE FIRST SUPREME COURT CONFIRMATION HEARING I'VE BEEN A PART OF, I  JUST JOINED LAST YEAR, SO I  WASN'T THERE FOR THE PRIOR ONES. WHAT I AM SAYING IS THIS. WE WANT TO SET THE HIGHEST  STANDARD FOR SOMEBODY WHO IS  NOMINATED TO SERVE IN THE  HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND. JUDGE JACKSON HAS MORE THAN MET  THAT STANDARD, SHE SURPASSED  THAT STANDARD AND BRINGS MORE TO THE TABLE GIVEN HER DIVERSE  BACKGROUND, NOT JUST AS THE  FIRST BLACK WOMAN, BUT BY ITSELF THAT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND POWERFUL, BUT BEING THE FIRST  PERSON TO BRING A PUBLIC  DEFENDER EXPERIENCE TO THE  ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN THE HIGHEST COURT OF THE LAND,  INCREDIBLY HELPFUL AND  IMPORTANT. BUT, OF COURSE, AS A WORKING  MOM, AS A WORKING PARENT MYSELF, WE KNOW HOW MUCH THAT INFLUENCES OUR LANDS AND OUR OUTLOOK, AND  SO SHE HAS EARNED IT, SHE HAS  EARNED THE SUPPORT, BIPARTISAN  SUPPORT, IN MY OPINION, AND  ANOTHER QUESTION IS TO MY  REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES, WILL THEY LOOK AT IT ON THE MERITS, THE  QUALIFICATIONS, AND VOTE  ACCORDINGLY OR FALL INTO THE  POLITIZATION, THE POLITICAL  FORCES ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE. >> WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING  MORE ABOUT JUDGE JACKSON'S  NOMINATION HEARINGS IN THE NEXT  HOUR, INCLUDING NBC NEWS POLL  JUST OUT THIS MORNING THAT SHOWS THAT SHE IS THE MOST POPULAR  SUPREME COURT NOMINEE SINCE --  LOOK, YOU SEE IT RIGHT THERE,  36% SUPPORT HER AND THE LEAST  OPPOSED AT 17%. SO ROCK STAR NOMINEE WITH  SUPPORT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. SENATOR PADILLA, WE HAVE TO LET  IT GO. WE'RE TWO MINUTES OVER. REAL QUICK --  >> ONE LAST QUICK THING. SHE DESERVES BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. SHE'S GOTTEN BIPARTISAN SUPPORT, NOT ONCE, NOT TWICE, THREE  TIMES.  >> THREE TIMES.  >> WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. >> RIGHT. INCLUDING A VOTE FROM SENATOR  LINDSEY GRAHAM O

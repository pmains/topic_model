mr. cloud Thank You chairman mr. Cohen can you tell me the significance of May 6 a couple months from now that's the day though Surrender yes the federal prison could you for the record state what you've been convicted of I've been convicted on five counts of tax evasion there's one count of misrepresentation of documents to a bank there's two counts one dealing with campaign finance for Karen McDougal one count of campaign finance violation for stormy Daniels as well as lying to Congress thank you can you state what your official title with the campaign was I did not have a campaign title and your position in the Trump administration I do not have one okay in today's testimony you said that you were not looking to work in the White House the Southern District of New York in their statement there are sentencing memo says this Cowen's criminal violations and the federal election laws were also stirred like others crimes by his own ambition and greed Cohen privately told friends colleagues in including C's text messages that expected to be given a prominent role in the new administration when that did not materialize Cohen found a way to monetize his relationship in excess with the president so were they lying or were you lying today I'm not saying it's a lie I'm just saying it's not accurate I did not want to go to the White House I retained a I bought an attorney in and i sat with mr. Trump with him for well over an hour explaining the importance of having a personal attorney that every president has had one in order to handle matters like the matters I was dealing with which included Salix some some reserved for me Daniel's as dealing with Stefan Haslam is concerned other personal matters that need him oh excuse me this is my time thank you ask unanimous consent to submit this insane memo from the Southern District of New York for the record put it it's all right I'll get that to you no singing okay this memo states that you committed four distinct federal crimes over a period of several years you were motivated to do so by personal greed and repeatedly used your power to influence for deceptive ends it goes on to say that you were that they each involved they were distinct in their harms a bear common set of characteristics if they involve deception and word each motivated by personal greed and ambition there's a lot we don't know in regards to this investigation but here's what we do know we know that you were expecting a job at the White House and didn't get it you made millions lying about your close access to the president you have a history of lying for personal gain including that's banks your about your accountant to law enforcement and your family the Congress the American people the Southern District of New York you said that you did all this at a blind loyalty to mr. Trump but your sentencing memo said states this this was not an act out of blind loyalty as Cohen suggests Cohen was driven by a desire to further ingratiate himself with potential future president for whom spittle set success Cohen himself claimed credit for now we're in a search for truth and I don't know chairman how we're supposed to ascertain the truth in this quagmire of a hearing when the best witness we can bring before this has already been convicted of lying before us and what's sad is the American people have seen this play out before we have people in prominent positions fail and then a couple years later they get a book deal now you're set to go to to jail for a couple years you come out with a multi-million book deal that's that's not bad living and so my question is is will you today will you today to commit to donate any further proceeds to book deals to film reviews to charity no

- The first hero I ever
knew was my mother, I watched her fight cancer for five years. She never quit, she never complained, and she never stopped taking care of us. And she told me something before she died, she said, "You will
soar to great heights." I decided to join the military because when I was about 12 years old, I read a book by a former SEAL, it was about patriotism
and heroism and adventure and that was everything
I wanted I be about. From that moment on, I knew
that's how I wanted to serve, I knew that's how I wanted
to soar to great heights. (gentle music) In 2012, my third deployment
was to Afghanistan, and that was when my life changed forever. About six months into that deployment, I was hit by an IED
blast, lost my right eye, completely blinded in the left. and I got back on my feet, had some miracle surgeries take place so I could see out of my left eye and actually went back on deployment. After that, I had to be medically retired and I knew that I would never
stop searching for another way to serve my country and make an impact and do what's right for Texans and do what's right for
the American people. (gentle music) Reagan said, "Freedom is never more than "one generation away from extinction." That is true. There's nothing more
important than making sure that our conservative values carry on to the next generation. My priorities in Congress
are Texas' priorities, it's border security, it's fixing our broken immigration system, it's economic freedom,
it's states' rights, it's guardians of the American identity. We are red, white and
blue, we're proud of it. If you want a leader in Congress and you want a lion for your cause, and a champion for the
conservative movement, then please vote for me,
because I will be that. I know what it means to fight and I know what it means to lead and I know what it means to
inspire people to follow me. I'm Dan Crenshaw and I
approve this message. (gentle music)

Mr Speaker I rise today to highlight the critical need to replace Enbridge lines line three an aging pipeline dangerously corroding and operating at only 51% line three pipeline replacement project is on its fourth year of review and has met or exceeded every single required environmental standard the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission unanimously voted to issue its certificate of need last year the project would create more than 4,000 construction jobs and enjoys the support of construction trade unions throughout the state of Minnesota the project is supporting the elected officials and thousands of Minnesotans it will also generate an additional 19 million dollars in property tax revenue providing a significant funding increase to rural schools with all this benefit it was greatly disappointing to hear we would have further delays unfortunately certain state officials in Minnesota feel beholden to in the words of our Operating Engineers environmental extremism these environmental extremists are the same folks that vandalized the current pipeline just last week ironically creating a dangerous situation for themselves and the environment

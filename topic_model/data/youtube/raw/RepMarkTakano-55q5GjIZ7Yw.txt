now one of the issues that big issues of the day that you've been right in the middle of and you have a large population of veterans in your district is this are the difficulties and really the scandal irradiated to the Veterans Administration are you satisfied now that we're on top of this issue and we're moving toward a resolution to some of the long-term problems for the VA well um I don't know if I'm satisfied let's just say that I believe we are now focusing the attention that hasn't been there on a problem that's that frankly pre-existed the Obama administration I'm not trying to excuse any lacks administration that may have occurred at the VA but it finally we do have I think bipartisan focus on a problem that needs to be focused on and it looks like from what I've learned in the hearings we on the one hand had a problem with some perverse incentives administrators that were that were able to get rewarded based on appearing to have scheduled veterans for appointments and haven't had those appointments kept and there there wasn't a lot of due diligence in and how that was managed and so administrators did receive bonus bonuses or manipulated what time soaking the books cooking the books basically yeah thank you the the other side of it though is it does appear to me that there might be a shortage of providers that there's a mixture of a shortage of doctors a shortage of appointment slots mom combined with this manipulation of white wait times so we have to you know solve the problem of making sure all those people who were on wait times get appointments now and the bill that's moving through the Congress initiated by Bernie Sanders and John McCain mmm the Senate bill and there is a separate bill authored by chairman Miller on the house side and my colleague and patrick has basically introduced the mccain senators bill pretty much identical language in the house and this week we're going to vote on authorizing us to go to conference to reconcile these all these all this legislation have you have have there been similar problems in VA hospitals in southern california have you discovered i mean it wasn't limited to phoenix i guess we know that over seventy percent of the of the VA of sites probably were involved in some sort of inflation of wait times seventy percent yeah that's wow it's a hard number of the swallow yeah based on the audits that there that there were some wait time problems at these places my own VA the audits didn't reveal that i'm still waiting for the doll melinda VA i'm still waiting to hear from the final the inspector general's report but you know we haven't gotten a huge number of complaints about my own local VA my colleague dr. Ruiz and I dr. Lewis was a emergency physician before i canna congressman both of us are planning to visit our local VA you know just to ask some more questions i've sent a letter to my local VA asking questions about wait times and you know how they deal with patient advocacy there and most another number of issues and so you know i am definitely concerned about the treatment of my local veterans as well we've talked to senator bernie sanders about this issue and I mean senator Sanders has said from the beginning that the problem is access the problem is not care that if you can get through the system that the care that veterans are getting in the veteran in the VA system is really very good is that been your do you agree with that you well finding you know I am NOT don't have years and years of experience dealing with the VA I have to go by what I hear from expert testimony and the hearing the the sum of the VA witnesses actual film it from the Olivier itself i can't remember their names exactly they said that you know when asked that question about the actual careth of yeses well the care care does vary across the board when I but they didn't there has not been a huge sighting of of egregious poor care at frys the VSOs the Veterans Service Organizations the VFW the American Legion the the veterans you know disabled but you know you name the the huge number of VSOs we we met with them before at last week leader Pelosi called them all together I didn't hear a single one of them that's calling for you know major revamping at the VA I think senator Sanders claim I think is somewhat vetted by these VSOs they're not looking they're pretty much thinking that the VA does provide quality care the access issue is i think are what we need to primarily focus on and also play a long term to to provide the VA with resources to deal but it needs it you'll need it with this population congressman mark Takano here in studio with us on talking particularly about legislation moving on the Veterans Administration reform 86 655 press is our toll-free numbers when a question or comment we'll be right back this is the bill press show 27 minutes after the hour comes to mark Takano in studio with us congressman just a half a minute or so but I have to ask you we've almost given up on getting anything done out of this Congress are we going to get a Veterans Administration bill out and signed by the president well I hope so there's a great momentum behind this bill and you know the costs are estimated at 35 billion a year for the next two or three years and to do this temporary fix getting veterans access to more non VA private care if they're on waiting lists um there seems to be bipartisan support for this the pay for is another question but I don't usually is a sticking point but I think that this this situation is serious enough that members on both sides want to get it done all right well we will let you get back your work and help get it done and thanks so much for coming in this morning you're welcome to a euphoric oh thanks Samson mark Takano this is the bill press show

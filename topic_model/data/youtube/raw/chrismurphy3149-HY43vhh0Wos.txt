thank you to everyone in Connecticut who helped in my campaign who came out and knocked on a door or made a phone call thank you to everybody who came out and voted for me but know that my job is to represent everyone in Connecticut and so here's my pledge to the folks who did vote for me I'm gonna make you proud I'm gonna stand up to this president when he does something that's wrong for Connecticut but to folks that didn't vote for me I'm gonna represent you too and I hope that you continue to talk to me to make sure that I'm sticking up for every single person in this state regardless of their political affiliation or their political views thank you for giving me the opportunity to represent Connecticut for a second term in the United States Senate

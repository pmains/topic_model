my conclusion is that you believe you are above the law and my only conclusion is that we still want the information we are here for oversight that our next step would be to subpoena you but that doesn't that's that's a disappointment to me because when you when when i voted for you i thought you said you would be transparent and it looks like you're specifically hiding this information from us and just one other thing to note is that again as we go through forgiveness and the sba then starts to look at these loans that's when hold codes can arise as well under those circumstances you know we'd be happy to continue to work with your staff to provide further information uh but again uh you know sba at this point in those loan processes is is obviously relying on the attestation of the borrowers as well as the land so today no planned parenthood has been forgiven no planned parenthood loan has been forgiven that's correct so you know the information you're not willing to reveal it so you know all about their information the record should state you're unwilling to give the information to congress i will certainly support senator paul's requests for reasonable information for oversight i think that's important for the ranking member and any member of this committee to get information for oversight

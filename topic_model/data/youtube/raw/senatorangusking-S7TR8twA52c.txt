for at breaking news the US State Department is ordering the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston you're looking at live pictures of that consulate right now for what the State Department describes as massive illegal spying and interfering and domestic politics now China is valent Valley to retaliate joining me now is independent senator angus King of Maine he serves on the Intelligence Committee a senator King thank you for being with us as a member of the Intelligence Committee I don't know if you've seen more than we have what's the State Department talking about here and what do you make of this development well I think there are a couple things number one this is a dangerous moment John as the confrontation between our two countries continues to escalate number two I know of no recent intelligence of particular Chinese activities either with regard to our elections or the the whole confrontation between our two countries theft of intellectual property and that's what sort of bothers me about this is the timing we've known about Chinese I mean they hacked the Office of Personnel Management five or six years ago they've been stealing intellectual property for twenty years there there certainly is a good reason to confront China my concern is escalating this this tension is it really about confronting China or does it have something to do with an election in four months the president keeps talking about the Chinese virus and linking Joe Biden to China this is a dangerous game here's here's a term here's a new term for you John the lucida T's trap and what that's all about is the tension between a rising power and a dominant power in 16 of the of the times that you've had that situation in world history going back to the ancient Greeks twelve have resulted in wars so the question is can we avoid the Thucydides trap with China and it's going to require some really deft diplomacy and military power and deterrence and all of those factors but I guess my question would be and my question will be today when I talk with my colleagues on the Intelligence Committee is there any particular data is there any particular information that that is behind this new action I'm all for confronting China but it has to be done in a in a serious thoughtful non domestic politics kind of way I see your Thucydides by the way the the strong do is they will in the week suffer as they must I'm on Sparta side as far as that goes I'm beautiful senator King there are reports that the Chinese and the consulate of burning documents over the last several hours in Houston why would that be well that's that's what happens that happens when we close Russian consulates and when they close hours if there are confidential documents and there they know that the building that they're operating out of is going to become essentially available to Americans that's what they're going to do and and look I don't want to minimize what the China the Chinese are I think on a very dangerous path themselves they just essentially put a chokehold on Hong Kong there what they're doing with the weekers is unconscionable and and they're sort of aggressiveness around the world what they're doing in the South China Sea so I don't want to sound like I'm whitewashing them at all and I'm sure there are documents in that building that they're burning that they don't want us to get a hold of but again it's it's a I think one of the issues here John is this ought to be handled on a worldwide basis with allies instead of one to one kind of confrontation and that seems to be where we're headed on the subject of intelligence and on the subject of possible hacks and meddling Democratic leaders including on the Intelligence Committee have asked the FBI to brief all members on alleged new Russian attacks or plans for attacks on the election system as a member again of the Intelligence Committee what can you tell us about what the Russians are doing or planning well I can't tell you anything specific based upon intelligence that I've seen but I can tell you number one we know to a certainty that they meddled in a very serious way in fact metal is too far too weak a word they interfered in our election in 2016 and there are indications that they're going to continue that that path in 2020 for example in 2016 date we know that they penetrated virtually every States electoral system their database and that kind of thing they didn't seem to do anything there was no evidence they changed votes but they weren't doing that for fun John they were practicing and that's a concern we're having a hearing later today with the Rules Committee on preparation for elections I think the states are much more vulnerable than they believe that they are so are the Russians going to try to meddle in our election in 2020 absolutely they why wouldn't they they were wildly successful in 2016 but it also may be the Chinese the Iranians the North Koreans you know this kind of cyber crime and cyber meddling is pretty cheap Putin can can hire 8,000 hackers for the cost of one jet airplane so this is something that they're going to continue to do and we have to continue to defend ourselves senator King I want to ask you about the pandemic if I can just before this interview I had a chance to speak to judge Cortes from Hidalgo County Texas who said he needs more testing and that a neighboring County judge told him he doesn't have the money to procure the supplies for the testing that they need there are billions of dollars in unspent appropriated federal money for testing how can it be that there's billions of dollars sitting around and it's not getting to Hidalgo County Texas as people are waiting days to get results well and how can it be that the administration has told the Republican caucus apparently from what we're hearing they don't want any more money in the new in the new coronavirus bill for testing look.this there's no secret the president has been saying since the very beginning way that first couple of weeks he said I don't want that ship to dock because it's going to change our numbers he's been focused on testing as something that he thinks is bad because it it shows cases that's like saying you know don't do mammograms because you know it turns out cancer cases doesn't cause it but it's detecting it the testing is a scandal the the failure of the testing regime going back and I heard dr. Gupta this morning talking about it this is the this is the signal failure and the problem is John there was a sort of a deal there was a contract between the American people we're gonna shut down lots of jobs are gonna be lost the economic pain is going to be tremendous but in the meantime you develop the tools to help us get out of this safely the the primary one is testing they didn't do it there the president yesterday said they're developing a policy Holy Smoke that's what you did or should have done in January or February their policy thus far can be summarized very easily shift and shaft shift the responsibilities to the states and then don't provide them with the necessary tools in order to meet those responsibilities this was a federal responsibility from the beginning particularly in developing a national testing program they they failed to do it and now here we are in a totally predictable crisis that everybody said was going to happen if we didn't have the widespread testing and it's tragic tragic what's going on in places like South tesca texas or Florida and even other many other states are now on the raw senator King I won't ask you very quickly about a story in The New York Times this morning which reports that the Ambassador the US ambassador to the United Kingdom was pressured by the President to ask the British to use influence to get the the the British open one of the premier golf tournaments in the world moved to a Trump resort in Scotland Turnberry I'm wondering if you have a reaction to that well if it's true it's shocking but I don't get shocked very much anymore why would you be surprised by this one the President himself tried to bring the g7 conference to one of his resorts in Florida I mean that's one of them that's one of the things that's been surprising about this presidency the president never divested himself of his business interests he said well my boys are going to run but he still owns it so if Turnberry makes a couple of million bucks that's a couple of million bucks to him so like I say it's shocking except it's consistent with the pattern you know Trump Hotel in Washington is consistently making money because of the the influence of the administration so it's but it's it's we shouldn't be numb to this John it's not right senator angus King is great to have you on this morning thanks so much for being with us be well good to be with you thanks John

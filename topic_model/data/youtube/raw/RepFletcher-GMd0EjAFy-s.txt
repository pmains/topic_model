thank you so much thank you so much for joining us for our community conversation on the omicron variant my name is shirley martinez and i am the acting district director for congresswoman lizzie fletcher the congresswoman and our panelists will each give opening remarks and then we will move to questions and answers on the bottom of the screen is a q a which you can click to add questions to the queue once we move to questions your name will be called and you will be unmuted so you can ask your question live again thank you so much for joining us i will now hand it over to our host congresswoman lizzie fletcher thanks so much shirley and thanks to everyone who's joining us tonight for this community conversation uh for those of us uh those who are joining us for the first time tonight a very special welcome to you and i'm glad that you're joining us for what i like to call a town hall on a topic and i like to invite people who have deep expertise on a specific topic that matters in our district to join our neighbors in texas seven for uh discussion so i'm so grateful tonight that we have some real experts who've joined us to talk about covid19 and the omicron variant that has been a topic we've heard from a lot of people about over the last few weeks especially and so we have with us on the screen tonight we have dr david purse the chief medical officer for the city of houston who has been with us in these conversations since our very first one in march of 2020 i think was the first time we did one of these and dr purse has been with us and and leading um the city of houston through this incredible public health crisis um and has just been a wonderful um advocate and um and servant to our community here so really glad to have you with us tonight dr purse um and then we also have scott johnson who's the interim assistant director for the covid 19 division for harris county public health and he's joining us for the first time in one of these conversations um but it is not his first time uh serving our community he's been a long time public health advocate and servant in our community um working with harris county public health since 2009 and being a houstonian even though he's still a saints fan a houstonian for 25 years so as i said the two of them are with us tonight and hopefully dr peter hotez who's been with us before as well uh will be joining us during the conversation um for his perspective as well but since the start of the year oh look and there he is on the screen so dr hotes is joining us right now um hi they they put me in the audience not in the uh wonderful well i'm glad that um we got you into the panelist booth i was just saying that you were going to be joining us tonight um for a repeat appearance on our community conversation and we are just delighted to have you here yeah i felt like i was in the parallel universe they kind of put me on the on the side there well i was just introducing um you as well as dr purse and scott johnson from harris county public health and just sharing with folks kind of the reason that we decided um to have our community conversation this month on this topic is because so many people have called our office since the beginning of the year and over the holidays about the threat that the omicron variant poses to our community and how we meet this challenge we all know it is highly contagious and has quickly spread throughout houston bringing us to an all-time high in coronavirus cases and making it the dominant coven 19 strain here in texas seven in houston and across the country um so we started organizing this community conversation a few weeks ago um and then as many of you know last week i tested positive myself uh that's not why we're having this discussion tonight but it does add to my perspective in this nearly two-year-old pandemic so i really want to thank everyone who's reached out to me and our team over the last week or so and i'm happy to report that i'm doing quite well um before i turn to y'all for some opening remarks i have kind of a question i'll pose to each of you to walk through i just want to give a quick update on what we're doing in congress and as as everyone knows for nearly two years congress has worked with each administration the trump administration and the biden administration to implement a national response strategy that takes a science-based approach in combating covet 19 addressing the impacts on the of the virus on our lives on our health um and on our livelihoods in our economy and um and so there have been a lot of different things that we've talked about over the last nearly two years uh that we've been doing in congress but one of the most recent efforts that i want to bring to your attention that's really had a lot of action in the last month or so um has been the effort to expand access to testing that's something that the city and the county have worked to do and i'll look forward to hearing from dr purse and mr johnson about those efforts here locally testing really is a critical tool as we work to mitigate the spread of covid19 and so i just want to mention to y'all um that the federal government has launched a website for all americans to request up to four free at home covid19 tests per household and those will be delivered by the united states postal service um having these at home kits is really an important reverse line of defense and you can order those tests um online or by calling so we will send this out after you don't have to write it down but if you have a pin you can just go to covidtests.gov or you can call 1-800-232-0233 to order your test and additionally as of january 15 private insurance plans are now required to cover uh the cost of at least eight free at home covid19 tests per covered individual per month so if you're a family of three on the same health insurance plan you can get 24 tests covered by insurance per month the federal government's also increasing the number of tests available to schools by 10 million per month so that schools can safely keep kids in the classroom and in addition to testing public health experts have repeatedly told us that masking is a really important tool to control the spread of the virus and so beginning this week the federal government will be distributing 400 million in 95 masks for adults free of charge at thousands of pharmacies and community health centers so a really important part of what we need to do to keep our community healthy and additionally i know this is a big concern high quality mass are also going to be made available to children in the in the near future and of course the best way to protect yourself and our community is to make sure that you're fully vaccinated and boosted there are three different covid19 vaccines readily available across our community and getting vaccinated can lower your risk of getting and spreading the virus can minimize um and protect you against really serious illness hospitalization and death from covid19 so really important to do all of these things and certainly the congress has worked to make sure that vaccines and boosters are manufactured and made available as quickly as possible and that they are free and easily accessible and that wouldn't be possible without the partnership of our public health officials here in houston and harris county that have really done an incredible job making sure um that we all are able to take advantage of of those free and accessible vaccines um and i'm really glad um to see that you know we have a good vaccination rate but we're not quite where we need to be so i really encourage anyone who's looking who still needs to get a vaccine to visit vaccines.gov that'll be another really important tool and together with tests and masks um with these vaccines we really can slow the spread of coven 19 and ensure we're doing our part to protect ourselves our neighbors our community um it's so so important and so with that in mind i really want to turn to the experts um who uh are here to have this conversation with us uh to answer your questions and to um answer i just wanna i'm gonna pose kind of a broad question for each of you to respond to um and uh and get your perspective and then uh hopefully we'll we'll uh hear some other great questions from those who are participating with us tonight but um i kind of want to start the conversation by by getting your thoughts um on this that the world health organization director general said just this week that the coven 19 pandemic is at a critical stage and that it's dangerous for the world to assume that we are in the in game um he said the conditions are really ideal for new variants to emerge but that the world can end the acute phase of the pandemic this year by achieving the target of vaccinating 70 of each nation's population so we're almost there but not quite improving testing and improving tracing um so i'd like to ask just each of you to share with us from your perspective kind of on where we are you know in houston and harris county and maybe dr hotez kind of globally or nationally kind of where we are where we're headed where we could be headed and how we get there um so maybe if we kind of go in that order maybe dr purse we can start with you and then mr johnson and then um dr hotez to go last and kind of this broad opening question um and then we'll we'll keep going from there but um thank you all so much for being with us and i'm really excited to hear um your thoughts on on where we are in this moment and the path forward so dr purse i'll turn it to you well thank you congresswoman and let me start off by thanking you and your team for uh having this uh meeting and this opportunity for us to come together and ask uh and answer questions and i also want to say what an honor it is for me to be on with dr hotez and uh scott johnson from harris county uh two really great experts that we've been working together as a team for two years now and a variety of things and um hopefully we'll be able to answer all of your uh questions so to your question where do we stand now so within the city of houston you know i think we're in a in a bit of a weird spot and the reason i say that is that we're getting a lot of conversation about how our numbers are improving the numbers are in fact improving uh positivity rates coming down uh the number of new cases per day is coming down uh our waste water and we can talk about that more detail there if we want is is improving as well but with the wastewater for example the numbers are coming down but it's still at 300 percent of what it was back in july the 6th of 2020 and while the hospitalization numbers are coming down we still within harris county alone today actually yesterday there were 1472 coveted patients in the hospital so the numbers are improving but we are far from out of the woods and my last thing going to the who um director's comment i agree with that is that this is still a dangerous time because there is the possibility for mutants and more mutations and more variants rather and i think dr hotez can speak more specifically about that i would disagree with one thing though and if if in his comment he said we can do well by getting 70 of the population vaccinated i think he's lowballing that i think it's going to need to be a higher percentage but i'll defer to dr hotes has a more global view but to short dance course that's where i think we are in houston today thank you great thanks so much mr johnson you want to go next sure uh again i'd like to just you know the same as dr purse here thank you so much for uh you know having me on tonight uh it's really an honor again to be on here with dr hotez and dr purse and um you know hopefully we can get some good information out to the community here tonight um yeah to to you know kind of go off of what dr first said yeah we are at we are at a a strange phase right here in houston i think a lot of people um would look back to this kind of where we were at the beginning of the summer this past year right we had come down from the the peak that we saw last year in january february from the vaccines were on board and we were vaccinating people at a very high rate and then the numbers started to drop and everybody i think started to take a step back and relax and maybe loosen the tie a little bit and say hey we're done well then delta hit and we got over the delta hump and it started maybe to kind of get back in that in that same let's relax a little bit and then boom here's omicron and you know i think the the thing that's important here is is that at least on on harris county side the number of people who are getting tested during this wave um are higher than they were during the delta wave and higher than they were in the previous wave of last fall um you know the number of tests that we're seeing people getting right now is kind of equivalent to what we saw back in the summer of 2020 and i think that's a good thing in a sense because people are starting to think well wait a minute let me just not assume it's something else or assume i know what it is and they're going out and actually trying to find it find out what their diagnosis is so that perhaps they can practice those social distancing precautions or those isolation techniques to you know prevent the the further spread um but that's something that we need to really continue to maintain right we need to to maintain the testing presence in the community and really stress to those folks hey if you think you're positive don't assume anything go get the test and make sure um so i think that's i think testing is an extremely critical um critical component of what we're seeing right now great thanks and i want to circle back to you with a question on testing in a little bit but maybe we'll move over to dr hotez um obviously we're so um grateful that you're with us again tonight and also so proud of the work you're doing to vaccinate the world and um would love to get your perspective on kind of where we are in the in the pandemic globally and also maybe if you could just tell folks who maybe don't know about the incredible work that you're doing here in houston making our community so proud developing a vaccine um that's being used around the world just got authorization and um we're just so proud of the work that you and your team are doing here so we'd love to hear your perspective on kind of where we are and where you think we're headed sure well thank you congresswoman you've been terrific throughout this pandemic and and you know really putting science first and that's made a huge difference in keeping the people of texas safe and and of course it's been an incredible honor to work with dr person and scott jameson and and and you know this is one of the sideline messages i always like to tell people about houston how we're blessed not only with one great health department but two great health departments houston uh health department in harris county and and and i know that for a fact because i've lived elsewhere and i've worked with other local health departments these guys are top of the line and so we're very fortunate blessed to have these these two keeping us safe and i can't i can't say that enough and i try to uh provide support for the houston health department and harris county health department every every chance i get where we're at i think you know the this omicron wave as david points out has been pretty aggressive and and it'll eventually wind down i i can't tell you whether we're talking two weeks or two months but eventually we'll will come down the only question is whether it goes down as fast as it came up or whether it gets stuck halfway down and lingers for a while and then what happens to our post omicron world and there's not consensus in the scientific community many of my some of my colleagues think that um having infection with omicron could produce lasting immunity and you're even hearing some of the talking heads on the on the news shows you know say that this is the end game and uh and that's how it all ends because the virus acts like some type of weakened virus or causes um acts like an attenuated vaccine i i i'm a i am of the opinion that no that's not going to happen i i think that the immunity induced by omicron could resemble some of the upper respiratory coronaviruses and will be short-lived so that we will continue to remain vulnerable to new variants of concern and that brings us to the global situation especially to a place like houston which is such a gateway place and and you know that's our strength right we we have people from all over the world and we do trade and commerce from all over the world and that's one of the reasons houston is a great is a great place but it also makes us vulnerable to all the variants of concern that come in and you know when you look at how delta rose the first part of 2021 rose out of an unvaccinated population in india and and then and so mother nature basically said hey watch out for the world's low and middle income countries because if you don't vaccinate them i'm going to throw variants of concern your way and that's what happened with delta and then guess what we we didn't follow her advice and we left the african continent unvaccinated and then omicron arose out of southern africa and and that's what's hitting us now so the bottom line is our most serious variants of concern are now arising out of africa asia and potentially latin america and if we don't figure out a way to vaccinate the southern hemisphere and the world's low and middle income countries we're going to continue to be buffeted by new variants and and that's where our vaccine comes in it's um we've developed it it's their first coveted vaccine designed specifically for global health it's a recombinant protein vaccine that uses the same similar technologies used to make the recombinant hepatitis b vaccine that you've been giving to your kids for for decades or you yourself got and and the reason i say that is because that technology is in place in brazil in india and bangladesh and vietnam and and and the list goes on at least half a dozen or maybe almost a dozen low and middle-income countries so that if you want to make a vaccine that could be made locally and scaled up and to vaccinate the world this is the one there's no limit to the amount you could produce we need 9 billion doses for low and middle income countries very safe technology it's one that can easily be scaled it is the lowest cost vaccine we estimate to be about two dollars a dose and so what we did was we transferred it to four developing country vaccine producers in fact they call themselves that the developing country vaccine manufacturers network to biological e in india be a pharma in indonesia to incept on bangladesh into community bio in uh in botswana and south africa and biowe's the furthest along they and now have made 250 million doses they're making 140 million doses a month that's a billion doses they're going to make over the next few months and they just got emergency use authorization in india for that purpose so we're now working with them and others to get it listed by the world health organization so it could be sent all over the world and hopefully that will make a difference so you know congresswoman we you know we came to houston a decade ago to do big things here and to be part of this extraordinary city and texas medical center and baylor college of medicine and texas children's hospital and and it's worked out really well this is this is a place where you can still come to do big things and and so hopefully uh this is this is the beginning of vaccinating the world well thanks so much dr hotez and i and i love hearing you say that that you you came here and you you brought your incredible team here um because this is a place where um you can have big ideas and we make big things happen and there's really nothing um you know facing the world um right now that is more important than the big things that that you are doing um to help vaccinate the world and and um it's just so exciting to hear you say that the other thing that we do i think so well here in houston and you know i tell all my colleagues in washington all the time we we take care of each other right we care about each other um thinking um about uh mr johnson when we were talking about the saints earlier just thinking about you know one of our finest hours was after hurricane katrina when we opened up the astrodome and you know welcomed our neighbors from louisiana here and i think one of the real challenges that so many of us feel like we're facing um in this moment in this particular moment of the pandemic is a real concern about making sure that we are staying safe for ourselves for our own personal health but also for our neighbors and with this incredible transmissibility rates with how um just how contagious this particular variant is i think there's increased concern and so i want to go back to something that you said before we open it up to questions uh about about testing and how we really are um expanding the efforts in houston and harris county to get more access to testing in addition to these at-home tests um and i know that there have been some concerns that people are worried about making sure that they're going to a um a good testing site um and so can you share any thoughts you have on on that with us um to make sure that people are getting to the places they need to go and getting the information they need and then feeling comfortable kind of going out in the world we've had a couple of other questions about testing and quarantine and stuff like that that i'm sure we'll get to tonight but can we start with with testing and why you think it's important and what people need to know here about doing that sure um so one of the uh one of the main calls that our office gets at paris county public health just from the general public is is how do i know that the testing side i'm going to is legit so harris county public health has several testing sites spread around the county but you know in the in the very beginning it was pretty much you know harris county public health the city of houston had theirs there may have been you know some from fema or the state they were all sort of these government-run agencies that were doing the testing sites well now i mean you can drive down almost any major street in the houston area gas station or just some strip center there's this little little building that's popped up and it's got a sign that says free cobia testing and so we get calls about those all the time um you know i i'd say generally speaking the majority of them yes they probably are legitimate um there's no sign or sticker or something that i can point to and say hey if you see this logo on this building or you know on this sign that that's a legit one right um but some of the some of the red flags are if when you're registering they're doing every single thing by paper there's nothing electronic or they're asking you know for your driver's license number or your social security number or something like that uh there's really no reason to be asking for any of that and and we actually had a i believe dr person and i were doing an interview a couple weeks ago and i said the number one thing if you see a credit or debit card machine at the testing side you're definitely going to be in the wrong place so um on on the uh the harris county the the ready ready harris website that we have in the in the app as well we'll have all of the different testing locations listed out on the map city houston harris county and such so if you're at one and you're not sure well i wonder if this is one of the county or the city sites you can go and look on that app and it'll pop up on the map if it's not one if it's not on that map you know i i don't know right you're kind of you're kind of at your own risk there you know no obviously if you're getting tested at your you know at your physician or you know a cvs or walgreens or something like that then those are perfectly fine but yeah we do get a lot of those um just random pop-up ones and people ask us a lot of questions so it's it's kind of the buyer beware or tester beware i suppose but um if you have any questions on that um you can certainly call our hotlines and you know we will certainly provide as much guidance as to locations of legitimate testing sites that we have great well thanks for that um uh perspective and um and i do think that um it's those are good those are good tips the other thing is we know that um the city and in harris county have a partnership and you can find more information on the website um to make sure that you can find all of their sites there is a site um in texas seven that i visited um out on richmond uh in the site of the former dave and busters if people remember where that is out on richmond um the parking lot there is now um a cova testing site that is uh sponsored by our our local public health departments and that's um that is an important site and there's more information um on y'all's websites that i think is really helpful um i have lots of questions but i also know that a lot of folks are starting to put questions in the q a box so i think it's probably best to turn to them um first and i think shirley is going to walk us through that um and bring people on to ask their questions yes i will start with a question from cindy her question um you know relates to the new variant and she would like some information on that so cindy's going to be unmuted hi cindy welcome thank you i just heard on the news tonight can you hear me yes we can hear you okay good i just heard on the news tonight that there would be a new variant um coming very soon uh different than uh the current all the current variants that we have out there can you can one or any of the doctors comment on this thanks cindy for the question have y'all heard that well i'll just say there's always new variants right this is what viruses do they are plastic in their genome and the question is going to be whether those variants turn out to be what we sometimes call variants of concern so we've been dealing with variants since the beginning of the pandemic let me give you an example lambda that arose out of south america and started accelerating in brazil but you know what goes in brazil stays in brazil it never really took off uh any anywhere else and and there are lots of variants like that so i think it's important to monitor the variants we don't do the globally the level of genomic sequencing like we do here in houston with with the city health department and and houston methodist and and others so we probably under evaluate them but it's the key is whether knowing one's going to really start to accelerate and displace the others which is still a pretty rare event she may be referring to what's called i think ba2 sub-variant of omicron so omicron is because it is so highly transmissible it's mutating and there's sub-versions of it whether or not that's going to be significant i from maybe maybe david and the others or the other the others have more information but i think it's too soon to tell whether it's anything we have to be concerned about yeah dr parce do you want to weigh in on that yeah no i i think peter is exactly right and i think it's important for the public to understand uh you know as dr hotes pointed out that these viruses are we've already seen them mutate we know about alpha and beta and delta and omicron what you don't know about is there's a whole bunch of other ones that have actually popped up on the radar but they never really took off and you know we talked about lambda dr mentioned lambda it never really took off and so one of the things in order for it to take off and and become the virus to worry about or the variant to worry about is it needs to really spread more easily more efficiently more effectively than the one that's already you know causing issues and so with omicron you know we were i think we clearly everyone could see that it had that increased ability to spread advantage and so right now omicron spreads really fast so you know i think we absolutely are going to see more variants the question will be are they going to be able to outcompete omicron and uh you know to become the next thing that we need to worry about and then the other the other thing which again with omicron is that you know there's been this talk about how it uh they talk about how it evades immunity from previous infections and for vaccination it's not like it evades it when people use those terms to sort of personify the the virus like it has an idea about what it wants to do let's all remember the virus has no brain i mean it just does what it does and so if it has an ability it has it has a feature that gives it an advantage and that's that's what's going to happen uh and we're going to have to wait and see now one of the things that's important with omicron we kind of dodged a bullet was omicron spreads more quickly so a lot more people are getting sick and in our community all at the same time but a smaller percentage are getting really sick this is where the hospitalization issue comes in and i want to remind folks that a smaller percentage of a bigger number is still a big number and so with omicron it's spreading you know we had a lot of people get infected all at once few of them got infected but we filled up our hospitals all over again so whatever occurs next it's it's two two characters i watch how quickly does it spread in terms of is it gonna take over and then how sick will it make people be because if we have another and it spreads even quicker and it makes people sick like delta did or outfitted we could be in some serious trouble again getting to get back to the point that our way out of this is to vaccinate everyone on the globe as quickly as possible um that's that is really helpful and i think it goes back to part of what we're talking about with dr hodges but can you talk a little bit um as a follow-up dr purse on where we are in our community in terms of vaccination rates and also um the status at our hospitals like as of right now um kind of where are we uh on those on those fronts here in in houston so for the city of houston for people age five and above so that means they're eligible to get vaccinated we are as of this week we're at 64.9 vaccinated which is not high enough and if you look at everybody even the ones who can't the younger ones you can't just the entire population we're just about 60 so we really need to get those numbers up higher uh and in terms of hospitalizations uh the the texas medical center puts out a weekly report and they're showing i think i mentioned the harris county data that comes from uh setrac the southeast texas regional advisory council and people can go to that it's just it's setrac.org i'm pretty sure and there's an interactive web page there you can look at 25 counties and you can pick which county and look at which time frame you want there's lots of information there but we filled up the hospitals get out the tmc did have to go into phase two which means they had to expand their icu capacity which they haven't had to do in months but only a little bit and in talking with the ceos we talked to them at least weekly on general end tuesdays they seem to think the hospitals are handling it the the problem is the nursing shortage so we've got a nursing shortage a lot of nurses have uh you know they've gone found other things to do because they're exhausted quite honestly and um some are retired and we have we're facing a nursing shortage now so it's not just hospital bed space it's also healthcare worker exhaustion that's complicating things right now in houston they're managing the hospitals we got to give them credit they're doing a good job they're managing it but let's not push it thanks dr purse um okay we're getting a lot more questions so i want to make sure that we're getting to folks with questions and shirley do you have the next question lined up for us yes see the next question we have is from doug f his question is what is the current best guess of when omicron will will pretty much go away and be at a safe level and i don't know if is he able to i think is he unmuted i am unmuted terrific um well so i think shirley shirley previewed your question um but do you want to ask your question and if there's any sure thank you yeah it was uh what is your current best guess and i realize it'll just be a guess of when omicron will dissipate to in houston to say a safe level of something less than 10 cases per 100 000 thanks yeah i think that's a question a lot of people have when are we going to hit the peak have we hit it are we going to hit it obviously knowing that it's a moving target but does anyone want to weigh in on on what we're seeing here in our community i know for example dr purse that you know we we track waste water here we're watching a lot of different indicators um what do we think the trajectory looks like here in our community that's for everybody whoever wants to go next well you know one thing i've learned about making predictions is nothing like a pandemic virus to make you look bad so it's always pretty dangerous and the big question is i think whether it comes down as quickly as it goes up and and i don't you know and you can look at what's happened in south africa in the uk to make guesses but that's what it is because you know that first of all the u.s is a huge country it doesn't always go up and down with in different parts of the country at the same rates i mean the hope is that it does start going down as fast as it comes up and then by you know the by february it's it's as you know it becomes much less of a threat but you don't know for certain because it can come down and and then get stuck as i mentioned halfway down and then it can done a plateaus for several months and we've seen that happen uh before as well so i would say best case scenario you know over the coming weeks and into february it really starts to go down but that's the best case scenario so i'll tell you with the wastewater and drought has written you know if you want to make a mistake make a prediction so what i'll tell you is that the wastewater the amount of virus in the wastewater has been a very reliable predictor about what's going to happen for the next two weeks to four weeks depending which variant and right now the wastewater is showing a very precipitous drop in the amount of virus we're finding in it so i think it's a safe bet that for the next two weeks we'll continue to see this trend of fewer cases although this week alone we're still at 300 percent of where we were uh in july 6 2020 which is the peak of the first uh wave and the peak of the delta wave was at 516 so we're just coming down below where we're at the peak of the delta wave we've got a long ways to go to get to anything that anybody would call safe but we are in the right direction yeah and we have some some recent data that you know harris county public health has been collecting and a lot of the data that we'll analyze will pull data from the city of houston as well and compile them both together and and we are starting to see a decline on what we call our 14-day rolling test positivity rate now we don't put as much stock in test positivity rate currently today as we did say a year and a half or so ago but it is still something that that can be very um indicative of you know trends that are happening and we are starting to see a a slight drop um in that positivity rate on a 14 day rolling average got it thanks that's helpful i think that um you know these are the kinds of things that people want to know just what to expect and one of the things um that we got a lot of questions about we asked people to send questions before um before we started tonight as well as live and one of the questions we got a lot was about some of the changing cdc guidance about quarantine and isolation and there's been several questions tonight so i'm just going to kind of summarize them um but certainly you know what i'm gathering from you all is that you know you respond to each variant because each brings its own set of challenges and and um and so several people have asked about the fact that the cdc recently changed the guidance on quarantining um i have read it in detail i will tell you all multiple times um but you know basically changed from 10 days to five days with um guidance on how to how to proceed kind of at every turn but can can you talk a little bit about the reason for that change and a lot of people want to know whether it's safe to be around someone after five days um whether they should take a another test before leaving quarantine i think any insights you all have about what's the safest best approach and maybe why if it's related to this variant it seems like perhaps if there is another variant that guidance could change again and it's because we're responding to the data and information about this particular variant so um would love your thoughts dr hotez it looks like you're unmuted so maybe we'll start with you well you know the the the prob the problem always is trying to get information that's specific for each variant and there's a small study that just came out from the japanese institute of infectious disease that came up over the weekend it was kind of interesting it showed that if you look at pcr positivity from from the nose and mouth it really drops off after nine days and by ten days it's it's mostly gone and that and then the question is well you know could it be shorter than that because pcr also measures virus genome fragments not real virus well what they did was they backed it up with actual virus culture and it was pretty much concurrent so that by after nine days virus was pretty low and not detectable in most of most of the samples the problem was a small study but if that holds up it means that the original recommendations were actually pretty good 10 days of isolation and then and then you you you can go out and mingle with with family members etc the um and then the nation there was a study done i forgot who was running the study but it was done in collaboration with the nba where they're doing testing all the time and that was showing a similar 10-day time frame so it may turn out that the original recommendation wasn't so bad after all for for the omicron variant um but again these are all these are not huge studies and we're going to collect more information so i think in the meantime i'd be curious to hear what the others have to say about the revised guidance dr

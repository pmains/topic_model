here in Iowa preventing drunk driving is the number one way to reduce the loss of life on Iowa's roadways sadly over the past year over 10,000 Iowans have been arrested for drunk driving 20% of those who had OWI violations occurred from repeat drunk driving in Iowa's roadways and 40% of those are OWI is that involve deaths with repeat offenders what's in a file 1:13 looks at is providing a habitual drunk driving clause on anyone who has received their 3rd OWI while operating in Iowa the Brill provides that by person convicted of a third or subsequent OWI offense may be sentenced as a habitual offender under Iowa code and it is a habitual offender they will receive no less than five years in prison with a requirement that they go through a drug alcohol treatment program before release with that mr. president would yield to any questions is there further discussion on Senate file 1:13 seeing none the chair recognizes excuse me the chair recognizes the senator from Henry senator Taylor Thank You mr. president I was wondering if senator Nunn would yield but senator nunn yield yes mr. president you're an order senator Taylor Thank You senator Nunn doesn't the bill actually say if you have had two previous felonies the third offense of OWI could be charged as a habitual offender correct Center Taylor so in this case if you have had three OWI is have been charged as a felony you could become a habitual offender based on the decision of the court but you can't be charged as a felony with just an OWI your first or second is that correct that is correct thank you senator nunn Thank You mr. president there be no further discussion the chair recognizes the senator from Polk senator nunn for final remarks on Senate file 113 Thank You mr. president thank you to Senator Wyden and Senator Taylor for being involved in the subcommittee thank you specifically to the county attorneys who brought this to our attention this been the standard practice in Iowa for many years and with the Knowles decision that right was taken away from the legislature I want to appreciate those who are fighting directly to combat drunk driving in Iowa this is the clearest way that we can prevent as we just saw over the weekend habitual drunk drivers from receiving a seventh eighth ninth OWI with no prison time of being served and no remediation process with that mr. president I would move the bill

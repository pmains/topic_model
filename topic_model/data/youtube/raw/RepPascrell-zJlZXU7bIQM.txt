I want to welcome everyone in particular when I welcome the firemen and women behind me many of them from the DC district so thank you very much for your service and thank you for taking the time out of your day to be here I want to welcome the International Association of firefighters the National Volunteer Fire Council the International Association of Fire Chiefs my senators Senator Chuck Schumer senator Menendez congressman Pasquale Peter King from New York and Jerry Conway's journey and of course a good friend of mine Brian McQueen a cancer survivor a member of the New York State Board of fire departments our keys and and chief of past chief of the Whitesboro Fire Department where I live so thank you for making a trip here also lieutenant Mike run a cancer survivor and president of the Professional Firefighters of Maryland so thank you everyone for being here today we are here today to announce a bill that's been widely talked about and I think way late in coming we know that cancer among fire men and women is double the national average particularly with certain types of of cancer like non lymphoma non-hodgkins lymphoma and we're gonna hear a little bit about that also we know that the purpose of this bill is just to through the Center for Disease Control to have a national registry so that we can keep track of people to develop protocols to prevent cancers to develop different ways to to help fireman when they approach these far as we know that there's 84,000 different chemicals that many which didn't exist 20 years ago so we're going to hear about that I want to begin by thanking senator Menendez from being here and invite him to take the podium well thank you congressman let me thank my colleagues in the House and the Senate as well as all of the firefighters here in leadership we pleased to join with congressman Hanna and my good friend congressman bill Pascrell who is synonymous with firefighters as well as congressman King and I know congressman Connolly is on his way and to join with heroic firefighters who do so much for our communities every day first responders are the lifeblood of our communities and we owe them our respect when they're on the job and we need and when we need help and we owe them our full support when they need ours as I've always said it defies all logic and reason to run into a burning building but these men and women do it anyhow they protect us 24/7 regardless of holidays or weekends that many of us take for granted they risk their lives and the health their health every time they answer the bell and in turn I think we all feel compelled to do all we can to protect them which is why I'm proud to have stood up for them and helped lead the fight in Washington to pass this a droga Act because the links between cancer in our 911 first responders and the exposure to toxins at Ground Zero have been well documented and discussed and while that was an extraordinary and tragic event that continues to take laws for which we solemnly remember there's been little attention paid to a firefighters routine and daily exposure to dangerous toxins over the course of their entire career firefighters have greater risks of a series of cancers than probably any other professional group think think about what's in your own home everything from what's in your sofa to what's stored under your kitchen sink in a typical house fire they all burn releasing fumes and toxins in some cases carcinogens into the air imposing additional risks for the men and women who so bravely charged in to ensure our safety that's why the bipartisan firefighter Cancer Registry Act which I have introduced in the United States Senate along with Senators Murkowski Klobuchar Rubio as well as distinguished colleague from New York Senator Schumer creates a voluntary registry for firefighters who develop cancer and allows doctors and researchers to track the rates the incidence and the trends of cancers among our firefighters it is our hope that by studying quantifying and understanding the risk of cancer for firefighters that we can develop better methods of protection from prevention of cancer to one day finding a cure so to every firefighter on behalf of a grateful nation we thank you very much and you always have our back and we're going to make sure we continue to have your back and then I didn't know we were rolling introductions the distinguished senior senator from New York soon to be the Democratic leader in the United States Senate thank you and I want to thank Senator Menendez for inviting me here and Senate and Congressman Hanna my dear friend and I want to say in quoting a rock and roll song we're gonna miss you when you're gone who sang but thank them for their great leadership here I'll be very brief as well as my colleague senator pass grill congressman pass growl congressman King and all the firefighters first and foremost led by the great indefatigable always working for the firefighters and beloved in Washington Harold shake burger and who I just learned is from Manhattan originally the old york town area well yeah we have great German restaurants there in the old days till all the yuppies came in and made it a fancy neighborhood but in any case it's very important to be here our firefighters are like our soldiers there's a domestic version of our soldiers they risk their lives for our safety the brave men and women in our armed forces in Afghanistan and Iraq risked their lives for our safety the brave firefighters in New York in New Jersey and across the country risked their lives for our safety and just as we exalt our soldiers as we should we should be exalting our fire in every way and that's why all of us here worked hard to pass this a droga bill without the men and men behind me and women behind me it wouldn't have happened and the fact that we have is these great great battalions of firefighters behind us for the registry gives me great optimism that we can make that happen as well there are 911 brought out what everyone who fights fires knows that there are lots of carcinogens and other things in the air that firefighters breathe in there's a particularly bad one that's in mattresses and children's pajamas which they used to think was a flame retardant and now they know it isn't and it's still there and every time a fire fire goes into a home it could be a couch or a mattress or children's pajamas burning and sending invisible but deadly chemicals in the air that they breathe so having the registry will will will alert us to what happens and increase our abilities across the federal government to fight these things whether it's NIH doing the research on the cancers that are caused whether it's some of the other agencies looking at the chemicals and why they should be banned so I am in full support of this bill I thank on my side of the aisle senator Menendez for his great leadership here he's always stood for firefighters and thank my colleagues for decamp that is rolling introduction yeah standing congressman from Passaic New Jersey and surrounding environs congressman cosgrove thank you very much Chuck I want to thank everybody for being here this morning this is a major effort on our part to create a national registry and you'll see national registries coming forth on many many particular diseases and maladies for firefighters and everybody else now we're interested in those that have been diagnosed with cancer and trying to decide what's the best way scientifically to protect our brave firefighters and then god forbid something happens what to do to make them whole again I want to thank representative Richard Hanna from New York an outstanding caring congressman you know you introduced the firefighter Cancer Registry Act and my good friend of course senator wen then des has always been there for firefighters and police officers for introducing it with Senator McCaskill and thank you to representative Peter King and is always there and thank you chuck for being here today with us we need your support and then I want to thank general president Harold shitburger the International Association we go back 20 years at least and for all the work you've generated in terms of support for this legislation and finally thank you to the president of the Professional Firefighters of Maryland Mike runde for your tireless work and I mean that to keep communities in Maryland safe your story reminds me a former chief Jean Dan ins feller of the Haddon Heights Fire Department well you two have beat the odds we have several members of the fire service struggle with the long-term impacts of keeping our community safe that is why we are here today to highlight the urgent need to create this registry I'm proud to be a chairman the Congressional Fire Services caucus I word on my sleeve well I could be on the frontlines fighting to support the brave men and woman here today and around the country they don't just need a pat on the back they just don't need us putting our grandchildren in to the machines that they drive it is you who put your lives on the line guys and gals day in and day out to keep our community safe so it's got to be a top priority to provide firefighters with the necessary resources to perform their jobs as safely and effectively as possible in during your reign Herald you work so hard day in and day out to do that for the 20 plus years that I've known you in addition to ensuring that our first responders are prepared in advance of disasters and other emergencies we must also ensure that they receive the necessary care after answering the call of duty routinely exposed to a variety of known carcinogens in chaotic and uncontrolled environments public health officials we do not have a good sense of the full picture of the negative impacts of firefighters exposure a 2013 National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health Study found that firefighters have a 14% increased risk of dying from cancer compared to the general population just think about that for a moment this make cancer the leading cause of a line of duty deaths among firefighters other studies have demonstrated statistically higher rates of multiple types of cancers in firefighters brain cancer leukemia lung cancer and kidney cancer despite the knowledge we gained many have been limited by small sample sizes in an under-representation of key demographic groups the first step isn't to ensuring that resources are targeted appropriately is understanding the nature and the scope of the problem that we face developing a specialized cancer cancer registry will provide scientists and medical professionals with detailed international data that will allow researchers access to information that is necessary improving our knowledge base on cancer and its correlation to firefighters will lead to the development of more sophisticated safety protocols and safeguards which can ultimately save laws as long as I'm in Congress know that I will do everything in my power to provide more resources for local fire departments be they can we're for volunteer when honored to be invited here today and I now want to introduce a great congressman from the state of New York we do agree on a few things believe it or not my good friend congressman Peters any one thing before Peter steps up what people don't know that I know because I'm in the house with mr. king is that the drug act is because of Peter King there are a lot of members who supported it but Peter more than any other person who led the charge to make that build permanent so every firefighter that went to that event or spent time there or anyone else owes a better gratitude to Peter so thank you thank you very much congressman had it for those words no some of the great work you've done in the Congress particularly on this bill and believe me we are going to miss you more than you know maybe it doesn't mean that much you means a lot to us you got to be gone so really rich thank you again thank you for the kind words means a lot senator Menendez Bob when I got elected to Congress together he's now moved on to the Senate and it's good to see you Bob I know you guys live in a very like the House of Lords over there and it's good you spending time with his poor guys over here you know Bob is a real actor yet I know the how jealous he is how strongly he feels about this and again I want to commend him don't Pasquale and I have worked here that many years for the Homeland Security Committee together a number of years and I'm co-chair of the fire caucus and it means so much and Gerry Connolly I just walked in and howís a burger was here today I have to say that when we did go through there's a drover act and it was tough and it was easy the people often wanted to to take partisan shots or if they wanted to somehow make it a party issue however made sure never was that he made sure was nonpartisan bipartisan all of us work together that we stood together as one that it could not have passed without the work that Harold did really I know maybe the usual words used in terms of however he was actually a calm reassuring influence I know he's not always calm and I know that he can get herself going but on seriously on Zadroga he was a steadying influence he just kept it moving so the ball got across the finish line want to thank him let's want to thank you for the fact he allows me to come to these events my father was a cop he doesn't hold out against me so that's for me yeah most of all let's thank the firefighters were here today the men and women who put their lives on the line I'm gonna make this very brief I'm gonna end it now other than they said all of us Luffy is the courage it takes the bravery it takes the charges for burning building we realized that the threat that came from the flames you realize the threat that came from the smoke and we thank God there are men and women who are willing to do that and really it was not probably until recently that enough people realized that the silent killer was the carcinogens over in the air now maybe 911 is what brought that out the most but the fact is long before 9/11 and after 9/11 those carcinogens many of them will still be there that could be an ordinary house fire it could be a factory fire it could be a underground fire in a train tunnel whatever it happens to me every time a firefighter goes in there's no such thing as a simple fire and certainly it's so important to have this Cancer Registry because again doctors and scientists are finding out more and more as well for 9/11 the rare types of cancers and blood disorders that can be caused by these custom engines so again thank you for the work you do Richard thank you for introducing this in the house power in the Senate and we have to pledge to get this done essential we're talking about the lives of brave men and women who are doing for us and the least we can do is stand with them so thank you very much and now let's introduce from the great state of Virginia the fighting Irishman is very Connelly it's going to be with you today you know first nine years of my career Harold and I have something in common we both come from Fairfax County where he founded our local union and I worked with them and supported them and they emerged to become one of the most powerful and influential groups of organized labor in our community and for good reason I shared a fire station with those men and women my office was at fire station 30 America Virginia and I was there at 9/11 when our guys were back up to Arlington for the second worst terrorist tackle American history at the Pentagon and they were exposed to all kinds of carcinogens and chemicals and yet they went in harm's way to save others lives and I saw over the years the illnesses our firefighters were subjected to from hepatitis to HIV to various forms of cancer in Fairfax we formed my motion a wellness clinic to try to make sure that the unique needs health needs of firefighters were addressed uniquely and that one the center I'm proud to say has continues to flourish and has saved lives by detecting early cancers and other diseases to which our firefighters otherwise motors to come I'm proud to support this bill it's really important you've heard that statistic from bill Pascrell about we believe that our firefighters are 14 percent more likely to to have cancer and then the average in the public and that's an alarming statistic we want to know more in order to be able to treat it and to prevent it because if these men and women are willing to put themselves in harm's way on our behalf the very least the Congress of the United States can do is to make sure we've got their backs thank you so much for having me here today oh I'm introducing Harold chase Berger the president of the Union who started in Fairfax County thank you thank you very much and let me let me just start by saying how privileged I am to be here just simply as part of a leadership team representing 300,000 plus now of the very very best that our country has to offer to our communities the men and women of the fire service of men and women of the IFF and so many of them here with us this morning from Washington DC Virginia Maryland it's nothing but a privilege and an honor for me to just to be a part of them I want to certainly a Jerry thank you for where did Jerry leave already we do go way back but I appreciate your support over the over the years in so many capacities you've understood the importance of our profession and and the work that those that are sworn to protect our communities the work they do I also want to extend a thanks to congressman Hanna bill Pascrell for being the chief sponsors of the bill I'm very thankful that we've gotten a number of co-sponsors just in a very short amount of time 69 I believe now in the house and growing I want to certainly thank a good friend Senator Bob Menendez who's been with us and supporting our efforts in so many ways for so long along with Lisa Murkowski a great senator from the state of Alaska who's been a terrific friend to our profession our industry if you will and certainly the Chuck Schumer who's who has left us this morning but a but a great leader in our Congress and I know is going to be a great leader I'm looking forward to in the next Congress you know it's sometimes surprises people in general when we tell them that the most dangerous threat to the health and safety of firefighters is not really crawling down hallways and fires or extra cating victims out of cars or doing the specialty high angles and swift water rescues all the work that they do but the fact is that it comes from and Peter and I miss you you talk about a good friend and a constant friend and you mentioned sir Drogo everything you said that was very nice but actually it's only partially true there's a drug act right now provide protection to the thousands and thousands of workers who worked in rescue recovery you know and clean up on that piled south into Manhattan because of your leadership and your work you never said stop you never said no most of the pundits said we couldn't get it done and the environment in this Congress and you never took your eye off the ball you've been a great friend to us but all workers it's been said that you know every day the men and women of the fire service they are being exposed to you know the toxins the smoke the debris the chemicals the carcinogens it is that silent deadly injury if you will that turns into a deadly injury that sometimes hard to measure and hard to see and it comes after years of exposure day after day and over the years of their career and while they we've improved their turnout gears we've improved their self-contained breathing apparatus we have them in hoods we really tried to protect them with the best and equipment that we continue to build on the fact of the matter is it only does so much because we know we're getting exposed through their necks and their risk in their mouth the fact of the matter is are getting exposed in their rigs where so much of that is left by the result of their turn outs in those seats and jump seats and the science is more than been definitive that proves that that we know what's really happening and the fact is that the studies are showing that our rates of cancer in the fire service are much higher than the general populations that we have cancers melanoma and brain and leukemia and prostate kidney lung we have cancers that it's clear science that shows that this is after an accumulation of exposures over a person's career and a 2013 study by NIOSH found as it's been stated firefighters experienced 14 percent higher risk of dying from cancer in general population this is a huge problem it's a huge incident it's one that we're working on but we are so proud that the Congress of the United States and the leadership in our nation's government now sees the need to establish a registry so we can begin to do additional science tipic studies and and to build on the work that's already been accomplished to be able to then have the protocols in the training and change the gear you know and the policies that our members are following in order to protect them even better so I celebrate those 69 members of a house with your leadership and the 14 members of the United States Senate with your leadership and I'm sure that will grow in order to establish the firefighter Cancer Registry Act and I think it can be done you know we're in a place I am Who I am we're in a place where a lot criticize that very little can get done if people are willing to say no more times and they're willing to say yes that partisan bickering sometimes gets in the way of progress but the fact is I've also watched an incredible Congress and leadership on both sides of the aisles but is able to come together and do the important work like passing the Zadroga Act and I believe that that is exactly what we're going to see with the firefighter Cancer Registry Act I think we're going to continue to build on that support and I think we're going to see both sides of the aisle come together to do the right thing on behalf of those that do such incredible work on behalf of their communities and I'm also so proud to have here Mike because I believe Mike Mike run is going to step up to the plate you know you're talking about someone with a fire service background someone with a iaf F Union background but someone who also has fought his cancer and has jumped right back into duty and it's that kind of metal if you will that exhibits exactly what our profession is all about and quite selfishly what this union is all about and so Mike I just want to thank you for your Lee and and you're really helping to show the way the men and women of the fire service you know know they've selected a career that comes with risk and they accept those risk but the risk of cancer is one that they shouldn't have to accept and so we're here to stand with our leadership in the Congress to make sure this registry is a critical step forward and beginning to provide the answers and ultimately the true diagnostics and treatment that those men and women that serve their communities are entitled to and with that it's my pleasure to introduce the president of the Maryland State Professional Firefighters but also my brother Mike Ron hello and thank you all for being here my name is Michael Ron and I'm a lieutenant with the Howard County Fire and Rescue Department I've completed nearly 29 years of service and I have to tell you there's not a more rewarding more satisfying career in the world than being a firefighter I absolutely love what I do and if you ask any firefighter I'm sure they will all tell you the same thing everyone who becomes a firefighter is aware the potential for danger our turnout gear contains a warning that quote firefighting is an ultra hazardous unavoidably dangerous activity and we know that we may be seriously injured or even killed as a result it is the reason I've always made a point to tell my wife and kids I love you each day before I go to work despite the danger of our occupation we take the risk every day knowing that we have been properly trained and having the faith that our training will keep us safe I've been through more training than I can remember in my 29 years and by and large it has helped keep me safe however there is one thing no training can prepare you for the words you have cancer I was 48 years old when I heard those words I'm not ashamed to say I say I cried I was scared as I'm confident anyone is that would get that diagnosis you run through the gamut of emotion when you hear those words and then the question is starting how bad is it can I keep working is it going to kill me how can this happen to me after my diagnosis reality set in it was time to discuss treatment we faced an onslaught of doctors visits to determine just how bad it was and how much of the prostate was affected I faced more anxiety and questions as I decide whether treatment radiation or prostate removed knowing that no matter what I decided each would have side effects and lifelong implications I will forever have to see a doctor to make sure it is not spread however today I'm lucky it has been four years since I've completed my treatment and I'm currently cancer-free over the years have been great advancements in the fire service to enhance our personal protective equipment but it's not enough we do everything possible to mitigate risks on the fire ground but how do we mitigate the risk of cancer after returning from a call as I wash up I still look down and watch the blackwater circle down the drain the water black from slip that's been on my skin for the last four hours so that I've been breathing since I took off my mask particles I've ingested as I wiped my face what I think of the chemicals I've been exposed to over the years I don't just worry for myself I worry for all the fellow brothers and sisters and no we were just beginning this battle I'm here before you today because I'm lucky but how many others are not the research at the correlation between fire fighting and cancer is still new and evolving we owe it to our firefighters nationwide to put forth resources possible to understand this link and reduce the incidences of cancer that is why I'm here to support and urge Congress to enact a firefighter cancer registry this registry will provide researchers the necessary data to understand this magic epidemic our firefighters risk it all to protect our citizens it's time we work to protect them in return thank you [Applause] when I introduce a good friend of mine Brian McLean a gentleman who spends his nights and weekends president he was a fire chief as I indicated Whitesboro fire department their main a cancer survivor who seeks to help other firefighters and EMTs people virtually anyone in Public Safety with his knowledge as an experience and we're fortunate to have you here so thank you thank you very much congressman just a great guide is really gonna miss as the congressman said my name is Brian McQueen I'm a past chief for the Whitesboro volunteer fire department I'm currently their Safety Officer and it's in central New York and I've been a volunteer and firefighter for 39 years and I serve as the director of the firemen's Association of state of New York on the board of the National Volunteer Fire Council I also serve as their co-chair to the National Volunteer Fire further cancer task force and I sit as a member of the National firefighter Cancer Alliance Committee on December 24 2013 I got the same words you have cancer I was diagnosed with b-cell lymphoma non-hodgkins lymphoma which I contracted due to Perpetual exposure to carcinogens over nearly four decades of service as a volunteer firefighter I'm happy to say that today my cancer is in remission the panel of five oncologists confirmed that my cancer diagnosis is linked to my passion to help others as a volunteer firefighter in 2015 I developed an educational program to educate the firefighters as the congressman said and it was through one of those educational programs that congressman attacked the attendant in the fall of 2015 in his home department of barneveld New York that we had a stimulating conversation about the need to collect more comprehensive data about the incidence the firefighter afflicted with cancer both on the career and on a volunteer side a few months later congressman and a very close friend of our Tony's fire service an all-night account II introduced the firefighter Cancer Registry act along with congressman Pascale and on behalf of the National Volunteer Fire Council and the entire volunteer Fire Service of this great country I would like to personally thank the representative Hanna Pasquale Senators Mendez Markowski and all of the House and Senate sponsors that you heard from today and their co-sponsor for support of this critical legislation for decades studies have shown a link between firefighters and the increased risk for several major cancers as we have learned about this issue several things have become very clear there are behaviors in the fire service that we need to change as firefighters to protect ourselves from the exposure of the 84,000 chemicals found that fires today researchers and public health officials need more comprehensive data to help them study for further cancer it is especially important that data on cancer among volunteer firefighters is collected as well I am extremely pleased that the firefighter Cancer Registry Act includes a focus gathering data on incidences of cancer among the groups that are underrepresented in current firefighter cancer databases including volunteers women and minorities the many of our brothers and sister firefighters we continue to be diagnosed with occupational cancer passage of this bill will give us the critical information to formulate new strategies for protecting firefighters from cancer and on behalf of the National Volunteer Fire Council I would once again like to thank the sponsors of this bill for their leadership and urge Congress to pass this legislation as soon as possible in closing I love helping others as a volunteer firefighter what never did it cross my mind that the job of becoming a volunteer firefighter and the job that I was doing protecting my residents was actually killing me I did not volunteer to get cancer thank you if there are any questions we're happy to answer them now oh I'm sorry good morning on behalf of the 11,000 members of the International Association of Fire Chiefs I would like to thank congressman Richard panel and congressman bill Pascrell for introducing legislation to create a national firefighter cancer registry this legislation would create an important resource for researchers looking to understand and prevent growing occurrences of cancer among our nation's firefighters the ifc also likes to thank senator Baumann is that Mendez des excuse me Menendez and Senator Lisa Murkowski for introducing similar legislation in the Senate which would create a national database for firefighters diagnosed with threatening diseases the ifc endorses creating the national firefighter Cancer Registry and urges concert Congress to pass the legislation this year there is an overall high risk of cancer among firefighters research has shown that there are significant increases in risks of cancers such as colon prostate intestine lung bladder kidney and other organs of firefighters for some cancer the risk relative to the general population can be 229 percent higher however more research that needs to be done to better understand the increased cancer risk among firefighters and how to reduce it again the IFC thanks congressman Hanna and Pascrell and senators Menendez and Murkowski for their leadership on this important issue cancer is a daily concern of many firefighters and especially our retired firefighters and it must be addressed nationally and we look forward to working with Congress on us to pass this legislation this year thank you [Applause] if there are any questions I'm happy to answer them now well let me the largest caucus in Congress is the firefighters caucus and think about this like everyone has a postman everyone has a firefighter in their community who is willing to get out of bed day and night to do their job regardless of the risk and it would be a amount in my mind to criminal neglect for anyone not to support this because these people support us so we're we're confident and congressman I just think the Congress many in the Congress are so hungry to get something passed to show that we do work that we are the best that we are at the best of times to do this and so we're putting every effort we can from the very beginning Richard will verify this is how we're gonna do this we're not just this is not feel good legislation we got enough of that we only have five thousand bills this is not feel good legislation I don't I don't believe in that kind of stuff I try to deal with things that I think I can affect I know rich feels the same way so this is serious business you don't play around with grief by playing political games it doesn't work so we're anxious to get this done and it's also very low cost two and a half million dollars between when it's an act and estimated to 2021 and but if you think about it the cost savings from this can be developed billions of dollars over time from what we learned from this registry so there so there is no negative side to this there's no reason why someone shouldn't support this from our perspective we have watched a Congress when both sides of the aisle recognize the importance of an issue related to our industry where we passed the safer act and funded a program that saved 14300 jobs we watched the Congress passed the AFG grant to provide the equipment and the apparatus and the breathing apparatus to be worn by firefighters we talked about this at rogue act which most thought would be much too big of a lift we're very confident that particularly with our approach and watching friends and leaders on both sides of the political aisle that can and do come together and I believe this is a prime example of a bill where they are and will come together and I think we'll see it succeed before this Congress adjourns so what would the two and a half million dollars well this is an anonymous database right so someone dies of cancer their firefighter they they have an opportunity to register if they don't have to we're suing most people will want to and as far as the money goes it's just to reimburse the CDC for their expenses I'm assuming no but there are studies going on right now the private universities and CDC we're trying to work with all of those that's with any registry as with any registry this is a popular thing right now it gives us a lot of data as to where we should be going and maybe we should we should change directions about protecting and then we have me so I'm very confident about this legislation I don't know if a lot of pick some time to build up numbers enough to a statistically understandable and arrival yeah a lot of work has come out of the hospitals Beth Israel in New York and I know we've been using that data and my firefighters have in order to change programs so that we can protect people and not simply give them a gear is not enough in this job gear is not enough so what we want to do is make sure that the firefighter is equipped know what the signs are to speak up you know many of us are in situations where I wants to pick up because we're super people or not we're human beings were affected by a lot of our jobs and then we're affected by the environment and so we want people to come forward so that the registry means something and it's not a sporadic attempt the sporadic attempt to get some information in this legislation yeah well hopefully if we get legislation passed we will pass that in terms of the rules for the bill I think that would be very very important if we just this is just a volunteer situation then you have to question the data the database itself and that's what that's what happened with the try that brain injury and I want our troops we didn't follow through so we need a baseline and we need when when one of our firefighters is not feeling well it is something to compare it to we will use that protocol we'll use that well we are supporting right now this registry will be integrated with it is that we are part of the fire service community building a new database called in force and in that database will be an exposure reporting element for firefighters on every single call to be filling out a portion of their reporting requirements and that data would then be used with a cancer registry data to be able to hopefully show the path the connection between expanded exposure number of exposures related to the experience in the legislation we passed in 2000 the fire act and president refer to it before there was there was a lot of attention paid to plate pay to health issues wellness issues physical education this was part of that the fire act and we felt that was the beginning of what we're we're showing here this is by no means the end and that's very important to protect our firefighters we we have said time and time again that that was we're going to help firefighters we're gonna we're going to help them in a way that will protect their lives that's you know we're just feeling good about what we're saying in the legislation from experience I'm not making it you can't make this stuff up you know and we hope this could we believe it can't can't stand alone but if that's what it takes to get it passed so be it I want to thank everyone for being here today as I no further questions especially the men and women behind me thank you for what you do we're all grateful I'm sure your communities are grateful would you like the last word sir that's a very dangerous thing that my members know to give me the last word but no I'm just no the last word is thank you for your leadership you know the the work of these men and women and all of them across a great country do I don't say it's taken for granted but sometimes there's not a real connection what are they really doing when you see the lights and sirens go by and they're exposing themselves and they really do put themselves on the front line and I think Congress has shown over time the ability to recognize that service to help provide the resources they need this is another critical component to keeping them healthy allowing them to go home after their shifts and and and enjoy a retirement after service of their community so our last word is you know we're going to be working hard to get all the noise out of the way find the path that we've been able to show we can do together and and have this legislation become law before the end of this Congress

so people don't know that um i was actually very athletic as a as a young woman i competed internationally in track and field events and then the other thing that people don't know is that i am a total coupon clipper i love to clip coupons so without show extreme couponing that's right up my alley i'm probably one of the most wired members of congress i'm one of those techies that has the device as soon as it comes out and really am very plugged in technologically i find technology fun and uh and actually being as plugged in as i am has made me a better mom it's allowed me the freedom to be able to work a thousand miles from home and stay connected with my children people don't know that i actually went to college here in washington and spent a good deal of time and actually worked right here on capitol hill as an intern and left washington in 1980 and left washington and the last person that i saw when i left washington was actually ronald reagan who was walking out of the blair house and i happened to be there and shook his hand and told him that i was on my way to california for the first time and he had just been elected president but had not been sworn in yet and wished me the best of luck i am a dog person to the hilt i have two golden retrievers buddy and lucky actually they came to me from the elevator operator in the capitol in washington dc her dogs had a litter and i took i took the the two of them and my husband and i they're the love of our lives i think many of my leadership skills have come from playing sports i often would be captain of my team i started playing basketball in junior high played all through high school and then played in college and perhaps something that a lot of people don't know about me is i'm in the illinois college sports hall of fame growing up i'm the fourth of five kids i have three older brothers and a younger sister and of all of my siblings i was the shyest and most introverted of of anyone in our family and i was very happy to go surfing and read my books and and do my martial arts most people are surprised by that when you talk to my family i'm probably still the most introverted of all of them i'm one of these handyman kind of people i spent last weekend on craigslist driving out picking up pieces of furniture and reassembling them in my apartment so i've got a full full tool set and my dad was a civil engineer so it's my grandfather and i love to fix things i do some of my own plumbing and that probably is not normal for most members of congress

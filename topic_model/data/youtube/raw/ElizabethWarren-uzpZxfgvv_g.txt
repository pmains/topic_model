thanks everybody for joining us I'm here with Congressman row continent and we're talking about something that we're introducing today that we think it's going to be really important for a lot of essential workers people who are helping us respond right now in this health care crisis and trying to keep us fed and keep this economy going well as you pointed out I mean there are still 60 million Americans who are going to work I mean they're the ones for keeping the internet running the electricity flowing people fed and a lot of times these are workers who were invisible one of the cases we've seen if someone was going to work at a grocery store and was saying I want to be able to wear gloves I want to be able to have a mask I want to have social distancing and wasn't getting it anywhere I mean they contacted our office and we had to reach out to the grocery store well the first part of our Bill of Rights says let any worker needs to have safe conditions I mean it's it's shameful we have to regulate this and legislate this but the reality is businesses aren't providing safe working conditions for people who are risking their lives to keep this economy open so legal obligation if you're gonna be on the front lines put people out on the front lines you've got to provide them with safety equipment so that they can take care of themselves and also to protect whistleblowers so if someone goes to the authorities and says there's a problem here that that person isn't in fear of losing her job for doing that unions are important all the time but boy you see this in a crisis the importance of having work and representation someone that a worker can go to and say hey what's happening here is apply or here's what we could do together to make this stronger and safer that's why unions are there for and we need to protect them during this pandemic and you know I was outraged I don't know if you saw this phrase I heard one word with instacart they've set up their app in a way that people could say they were gonna give a mortgage tip and then when the instacart forever delivered their groceries they would reduce the tip to zero they basically wage theft as I as I see it and so we need to make sure these people who are rich sking their lives to keep this economy going are getting hazard pay they're getting some pay acknowledging their work to me that's free market and one more part making sure that people's medical expenses are covered absolutely I mean we're in a health care crisis we ought to be able to provide people with health care and you have a lot of these folks they're independent contractors they don't have health care benefits and so they aren't able to go to a doctor or get testing if they need it if there was any time in our country's history that we need to say we should everyone should have basic health care it's during this crisis so congressman you know we've known there been inequalities in our country for a long time but how do you see the impact of this crisis on this crisis unfortunately has affected those people who don't have Economic Security the worst I mean first of all it's created the greatest health risk for those who have to go in and do physical labor versus those who can work remotely they are having a higher incidence of getting the disease they're having less access to the proper health care a second if they're the ones who are struggling with paying the rent they're the ones who don't have the Family Leave provisions to be able to take care of their kids given how essential they are why is it that they're not being compensated why are all of the gains just going to a very few and so I think this crisis is really highlighted that you know for a long time I've talked about how the economy works best when everybody gets a chance because you have more demand in the economy when you grow the economy from the grassroots up why that is so powerfully important to keep the economy working for everyone this crisis has highlighted how unequal pay and opportunities are for so many Americans and I'm starting with an essential workers Bill of Rights I think this is a chance for us to pull some things back into balance in a really important way we need to make sure that the stimulus is going to help workers and not just big corporations you were on the front lines after the 2008 crisis saying we can't just be looking out for Wall Street we need to help Main Street and unfortunately choices were made there that didn't do that and that left a crisis of confidence I think in all of our institutions we can't repeat that mistake I like the way you put that we need these workers and it's about the first parts of how we're going to help rebuild this economy as we come out of it the best way to do that is to support our essential workers and that's what our essential workers Bill of Rights is all about I'm really glad we're partnering up on this you know this is going to be a long road ahead of us I know it's going to be tough we're not going to come out of this crisis in just a matter of days but this is a chance for us to understand the people that we're depending on they help keep us safe during this time and to help us rebuild this economy for everybody who's watching this thank you thanks for being part of this fight stay with us and be safe out there thanks for all right singing thanks for doing this great let's stay after it awesome all right

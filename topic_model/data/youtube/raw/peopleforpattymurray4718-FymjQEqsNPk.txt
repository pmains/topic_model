hi everyone i'm so excited to share with you that i'm officially launching my campaign for re-election i got my start in politics because someone told me i couldn't make a difference i was just a mom in tennis shoes i ran to be a voice in the other washington for the people of our state and to fight for workers and families dealing with the same challenges as mine did like health care education and opportunity i've been proud to stand up for our state's values and priorities and also to find common ground whenever i can to help families and communities across washington state the last four years and especially the last one have been so hard on people across our state and i've fought every day to get relief into the hands of the people who needed it getting vaccines into arms helping schools to reopen safely supporting our small businesses and getting relief directly to our families and i believe that now with a democratic majority and a white house we've got an opportunity to move forward on the issues that i hear about every day when i'm talking to people in our state and making sure that workers and families not those at the very top come first in that other washington i'm still in the fight for you and your family and all of washington state and together we can keep making a difference and make progress let's lace up those tennis shoes and get to work

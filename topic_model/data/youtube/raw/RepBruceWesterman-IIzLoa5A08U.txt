I'm so sick of Republicans saying we're The Big Spenders give me a break give me a break and by the way this bill is going to reduce the deficit by another 300 billion over 10 years because Medicare is going to be paying less for the drugs that are going on as a result the President also tried to compare his 400 billion dollar and that's in a minimum student loan bailout to the paycheck Protection Program which was established to help struggling small businesses during the pandemic one that was looted in large part by people who didn't deserve the money and took it fraudulently joining me now Arkansas Congressman Bruce Westerman he's a member of the natural resources and transportation and infrastructure committees Congressman what do you make of Biden's remarks from over the weekend I think it just shows you how out of touch Biden is and how to touch Congressional Democrats are that they think just more spending is going to help by this economy you know Republicans have put out our commitment to America and one of the four pillars of that is an economy that's stronger and that starts with uh with energy and this Administration has done nothing but attack energy so we want to have an energy plan uh that actually works and that's what my path will be if I'm the chairman of the rank or chairman of the natural resources Committee in the next Congress should Republicans win the majority Todd jump in here I want to talk electoral politics here for a moment I think Joe Biden and the Democrats thought their student loan bailout would actually help them come the midterms but consensus seems to be building that the majority of the American people don't like this bill don't like what it's going not built don't like this executive action based upon what it's going to do to people who didn't go to college or people who paid off their loans what are your constituents saying and how do you think this plays in your District so in Arkansas's fourth district I'm hearing bipartisan discontent with Biden's uh student loan bailout you know in my district less than 40 percent of our population went to college so you're asking the other 70 uh to pay for those college loans uh or 60 to pay for those college loans that didn't even go to college so people are really upset about this it doesn't matter if they're the Democrat Republican or independent uh they think that we have responsibility in this country when you take out a loan it's your responsibility to pay it back not someone else Congressman you're on the transportation infrastructure committee did you vote for the infrastructure bill foreign no I didn't and this was it's billed as the uh it's actually the largest spending on infrastructure in the history of the world and it didn't even go through a Committee hearing in the house never came to our committee went straight to the floor for Nancy Pelosi's office uh it's a joke what they did with this uh so-called bipartisan infrastructure bill yeah I don't understand though when it was very clear in early 2021 why Republicans some members of your own party would vote for these spending boondoggles that and the chips bill there were I think it was 17 senators from the Republican side voted for the chips bill which is a handout to a high margin wealthy industry semiconductor business so I don't how is it that some Republicans are part of the problem not the solution it's true but I don't understand that when you've got a the semiconductor industry that has such a huge demand there's tons of cash being poured in it why does the federal government need to come in and subsidize that and you know I'm getting to the point that the last thing I want to do is give this incompetent bunch at the White House any more money to spend they seem to have the opposite of modest touch this everything Joe Biden touches goes the wrong direction right and when the Congress if Congress doesn't hand it to them they just take it which is what they've done just by Fiat with the student loan bailout but some of those Republican congressmen who voted for that infrastructure bill you press them on it they get so mad you just Congressman by the way you just introduced a new bill that would be a road map for the natural resource committee if the GOP wins you were talking about this can just um tell us a little bit more about it well it's it's called the transparency and production of American Energy act or the tap act it goes right along with our commitment to America uh that we're going to have a strong economy and the the foundation of that strong economy is to have reliable and affordable energy and guess what we can do it cleaner here in the United States and any place else in the world so while Biden's going to foreign country uh look asking for energy assist bumping the Crown Prince when he relies on China for all these solar and wind components we've got all the materials we need right here at home all the natural resources to have a strong economy and a healthy environment we need an energy system that actually works one of the big problems with what Democrats are proposing is it won't work we have to have something that can meet all of our energy demands that relies on every source of energy that we can muster if you look at the world demand for energy every category of fuels including wood and coal and oil and gas and nuclear solar and wind everything is if we're using more of it today than we've ever used and we've got to figure out how to harness that here at home and not rely on so many foreign countries thank you Congressman good to see you this morning Congress

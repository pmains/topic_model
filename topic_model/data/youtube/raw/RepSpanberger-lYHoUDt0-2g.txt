you've heard it often blaming supply chain issues for those empty grocery shelves and delayed packages but a new bipartisan bill in the house is looking to cut down on one supply chain problem there's a shortage of about 80 000 truck drivers in the u.s and has had a major impact on supply chains and frankly on inflation virginia democratic congresswoman abigail spamberger is introducing a bipartisan bill that is encouraging more people to enter the industry and keep existing drivers on the job the two mechanisms that we use here is refundable tax credit to attract new truck drivers to the industry that tax credit for new drivers would be up to ten thousand dollars would also introduce a tax credit for existing drivers of up to seventy five hundred dollars as long as they drive a certain amount of hours pretty common sense effort to get at a problem that's impacting the nation luke luker wtop news

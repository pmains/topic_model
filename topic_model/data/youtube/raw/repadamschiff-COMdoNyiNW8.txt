. I THOUGHT IT WAS COMPLETELY CRAZY. >> JOINING US NOW DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN, ADAM SCHIFF OF CALIFORNIA. HE'S CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, AND HE'S A MEMBER OF THE JANUARY 6TH SELECT COMMITTEE, AND WAS THE LEAD IMPEACHMENT MANAGER FOR THE FIRST IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF DONALD TRUMP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US TONIGHT, CONGRESSMAN SCHIFF. ONE THING I'VE BEEN WONDERING ABOUT IS WHAT PREVENTED -- HAS YOUR INVESTIGATION REVEALED ANYTHING THAT PREVENTED MIKE PENCE FROM SAYING A MONTH EARLIER, THEN JANUARY 6TH, THAT THE VICE PRESIDENT DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER TO REJECT ANY ELECTORS ON JANUARY 6TH? >> NO, OF COURSE NOT. I MEAN, THERE WOULD BE NOTHING TO PREVENT THE VICE PRESIDENT FROM THE FIRST TIME, THE ISSUE WAS RAISED, MAKING IT VERY CLEAR TO THE PUBLIC THAT THE VICE PRESIDENT DOESN'T HAVE THIS POWER. THERE IS NOTHING -- WE ARGUED THIS. YOU KNOW, OF COURSE, LAWRENCE, THERE WAS SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE WHO KNOW THAT, NOW TESTIFIED, OR NOT TESTIFY. ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR COULD'VE TOLD THE COUNTRY THAT I THINK MAYBE THE PRESIDENT HAS LOTS LOST HIS GRIP OF REALITY. AND YET, THEY DIDN'T LOOK ON THAT. THEY'RE SPEAKING NOW, BUT THE VICE PRESIDENT TOOK THE ACTION HE DID, YOU KNOW, IT WAS A CRITICAL TIME TO DO THE RIGHT THING. BUT SO MUCH OF THE TRAUMA THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN THROUGH, WE COULD HAVE BEEN SPARED, IF PEOPLE SPOKE OUT THEN, AS THEY'RE SPEAKING OUT NOW. >> DO YOU KNOW WHEN THE VICE PRESIDENTS STATEMENT, THAT THE WRITTEN STATEMENT THAT HE PUT OUT ON JANUARY 6TH, DID YOU FIND OUT WHEN IT WAS DRAFTED? BECAUSE IT'S A MULTI PAGE STATEMENT THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT WAS WRITTEN THAT MORNING. >> YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT WHEN WE CONCLUDE OUR INVESTIGATION, AND I THINK THAT WE HAVEN'T REVEALED DURING THE COURSE OF THE PUBLIC HEARINGS, WE WILL BE REVEALING, EITHER BY SUBJECT MATTER OR ON MOSS, SO WILL BE DISCLOSING THAT TO THE PUBLIC. I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER ON THE TOP OF MY HEAD. I DON'T KNOW IF I'LL BE ABLE TO GO INTO THESE PARTICULARS, EVEN IF I DID, IT'S NOT -- >> WAS THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF TODAY'S HEARING TO ESTABLISH CONSCIOUSNESS OF GUILT IN DONALD TRUMP, WITH THE TESTIMONY THAT SEVERAL PEOPLE TOLD HIM, LEGAL AUTHORITIES IN WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL'S OFFICE AND ELSEWHERE, TOLD HIM THAT IT WOULD BE AGAINST THE LAW. IT WOULD BE A VIOLATION OF LAW FOR MIKE PENCE TO TRY TO CHANGE THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTE. >> IT WAS CERTAINLY PART OF OUR GOAL TODAY. THE OVERRIDING OBJECTIVE WHAT'S TO TELL THE PUBLIC THE STORY OF ONE OF THE LINES OF EFFORT TO OVER DURING THE ELECTION, ONE OF THE MULTIPLE WAYS IN WHICH THE PRESIDENT SOUGHT TO PREVENT THE PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER WAS TO PRESSURE HIS VICE PRESIDENT INTO IGNORING THE CONSTITUTION, AND TO ESSENTIALLY, YOU KNOW, BRING ONE PERSON EDUCATE ADJUDICATOR FOR THE NEXT PRESIDENT. BUT OF COURSE, IN THAT BLOND BLOT, WE WANTED TO WIND DOWN THE PRESIDENT'S CULPABILITY. WHAT'S HE KNEW ABOUT HOW FLAWED IT THEORY THIS WAS. SO, YES, THIS WAS VERY IMPORTANT. BUT YOU WANT TO TELL THE BROADER STORY TOO OF THE PRESIDENT LOSING THE ELECTION, DOESN'T ACCEPTED -- HIS OWN ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS THEY'RE BS, SO THEY FALL BACK ON A DIFFERENT PLAN. THAT'S PRESSURING MIKE PENCE INTO IGNORING THE CONSTITUTION, AND DECLARE ME THE WINNER, THAT EVEN THOUGH, AS YOU POINT OUT, WE DEMONSTRATED HE WOULD NEVER WITH A SUPREME COURT THAN ANYONE ELSE. >> SO THE COMMITTEE SENT A LETTER TO CLARENCE THOMAS'S WIFE TODAY, ASKING FOR HER COOPERATION, ASKING HER TO COME IN FOR CONVERSATION. SHE PUBLICLY SAID TO THE DAILY CALLER, A TRUMP SUPPORTING WEBSITE, THAT SHE'S HAPPY TO CLEAR UP ANY CONFUSION AND ANSWER QUESTIONS. HAS THE COMMUTE COMMITTEE HEARD FROM GINNI THOMAS IT? >> I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE'VE HEARD DIRECTLY, AS OPPOSED THROUGH THE DAILY CALLER, AS YOU POINT OUT. BUT I'M GLAD THAT SHE HAS RESPONDED FAVORABLY. WE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY. WE HAVE MANY QUESTIONS TO ASK, AND WE WISH THAT, FRANKLY, ALL WITNESSES WITH RELEVANT INFORMATION WOULD TAKE THE SAME ATTITUDE AND COME IN AND SHARE WITH US WHAT THEY KNOW. INDEED, THE WHOLE SITUATION OF REPRESENTATIVE LOUDERMILK, SHOWING ON THAT VIDEO, GIVING TOURS, IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF EXCEPT AND COME IN AND TESTIFIED. >> ONE POINT JOHN EASTMAN SAID THAT HE BELIEVED GLENN'S THOMAS WOULD VOTE ON THE SUPREME COURT TO SUPPORT THE VICE PRESIDENT REJECTING ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES. DO YOU HAVE ANY INDICATION THAT EASTMAN GOT THAT INFORMATION FROM GINNI THOMAS? >> YOU KNOW, I REALLY CAN'T GO INTO THE FACTS, UNTIL WE HAVE A CHANCE TO DISCUSS THOSE DURING WHATEVER HEARINGS, IF THAT BECOMES A SUBJECT IN ONE OF OUR HEARINGS. YOU KNOW, I WILL SAY, AS I HAVE IN THE PAST, LAWRENCE, THAT THE IDEA THAT A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE WOULD RULE, PRESUME TO RULE IN A CASE IN WHICH THE ISSUE IS WHETHER CONGRESS SHOULD SEE DOCUMENTS THAT MIGHT REVEAL IS THE SPOUSES INDICATIONS ON THE SUSPECT, IT JUST SCREAMS CONFLICT OF INTEREST. AND I CAN'T SEE HOW JUSTICE THOMAS CAN'T PRESIDE OVER ANY CASE RELATED TO THIS MATTER. >> CONGRESSMAN AD

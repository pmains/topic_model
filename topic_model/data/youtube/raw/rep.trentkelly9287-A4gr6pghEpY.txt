you know we were just talking uh Congressman in the last segment opening up the program today about Joe Biden uh just kind of randomly deciding to Target so-called junk fees that's that's his solution to combating inflation it just seems like either dropping money out of helicopters with all these giveaways or instituting Price controls and interfering in the in the private sector seems to be the approach the Democrats here how do we get government the heck out of the way listen this guy uh should have laid in and whispered to make this more effective when I talk like he does I don't think so but you know I was listening yesterday when he started talking about and I had to turn it off because it just makes me so angry but he's talking about uh the fees uh for overdraft fees right and he's saying if you call your bank and check your balance regardless that you've written checks today you should know that those are going to clear so if it you know you know it's the bank's responsibility uh man this guy is a they do not understand basic laws of Economics they don't understand what's causing inflation and everything they do only makes it worse and we're paying the price indeed I agree so do you feel like I I'll just tell you a full disclosure I do before I tell you this but what can we do to get the president of the United States just to go before the nation in the world to say look I'm calling off the dogs on the fossil fuels industry I'm calling on our industry three the domestic fossil fuels industry to go drill we're going to issue these permits to go explore and produce oil and produce more fuel that's the way to Target and truly Abate inflation he won't do it it caused this and he's not going to do that they are so he is so indebted to the lab to the aocs and being green and all those things he intentionally tanked our oil and gas market he's intentionally trying to put them out of business he's intentionally trying to they don't understand electricity the majority of it doesn't come from solar and wind it comes from fossil fuels and nuclear but he's intentionally just tanked this market now he's wanting to buy from other Saudis you know turn him down Venezuela Iran he doesn't care where he's just listen these guys do not understand basic economics they don't understand what they're doing all they want to do is make us all be the same and all have equal results listen equality is not equal results equality is equal opportunity if they want equal results yeah absolutely amen so all right let's say then sir that the Republicans are successful and they're able to take over the house and uh I think it's looking better that we may take control of the Senate but we still got the third leg there in the law making process that being the executive branch what can we get done if if we get the house and the Senate bows about all we can do is stop some of these crazy appointments he's doing on the Senate side yeah and then on the house side we can pass stuff that at least makes some sense uh with the threat of a veto but we can at least challenge every one of these stupid executive orders I mean you know he's a lot like fatterman listen the guy doesn't want to be on TV unless he's got a teleprompter because you cannot trust them the other people are running the show I don't know who they are but listen I don't have to have a teleprompter I don't have one right now telling me what to say or what to do and all we can do is put the brakes on it and maybe get some investigations into some of the corruption that these guys are doing yeah what do you think about uh Kevin McCarthy uh Congressman do you feel like he's kind of the shoe end to be the speaker of the house if the Republicans take control listen that stuff is that's politics worse than the Mississippi Army National Guard but the Mississippi Highway Patrol that's like high level politics I like Kevin he's a friend I think he's the right guy but if you want me to prognosticate whether or not that's going to be an easy go I can't tell you that listen when when you get in those internal politics of those things uh you're going to have people come in and stuff comes up but uh Kevin's a strong leader he's got a great plan and his commitment to America he's worked really hard to get us the majority and I hope he'll be rewarded for his hard work and his good plan yeah how do you feel about the commitment to America I've I've read that I'm quite sure you have as well you feel like it's a pretty good plan no it's a great plan listen Newt Gingrich is with us and we rolled it out you guys put a lot more work and he actually helped us work on it but uh it not only addresses what the issues are it gives us ways that we can we can make those issues uh get better I think it's a great plan it was not just Kevin McCarthy and Newt Gingrich we had working groups throughout Congress of which I was a part of several Michael Gast and Stephen Palazzo were part of those and listen it is a plan to get us back on track but the main thing we got to do as this President oh my goodness we have got this guy does not get basic mathematics totally agree So speaking of that uh we've got this out of control uh deficits which the president's bragging about reducing after he's the one that that boosted them significantly with this ridiculous Reckless spending so he just doesn't repeat that in year two and then takes a Victory lap which is so disingenuous but we got this debt and Kevin McCarthy uh should he rise to be the speaker he's actually said we're going to have to have a hard look at just this kind of rubber stamp raising of the debt ceiling and passing these continuing resolutions and of course the left is saying they're going to shut down your Social Security and your Medicare which is not the truth we got to start and have we got to stop and have a serious conversation about this Reckless standing in this out of control debt do we not sir we do and I think one of the things we've got to do is uh you know we always talk about the discretionary spending which is only about a third or less of all the spending we've got to get all these things off autopilot all this mandatory spending we need to take an out of mandatory spending we need to each year people have to justify what they spend you know we do well what we measure and right now all that mandatory spending which is over two-thirds of the budget we're not measuring that at all which means it's just on we're funding programs that aren't even there and these administrative agencies that just keep getting larger and larger and listen they answer to no one and so we need elected officials answering not some administrative agencies so my pointy who has never been on a ballot no doubt about it I totally agree and we've explained that as well uh on the program thank you for pointing that out clarifying that and so leader McCarthy and other Republicans have simply said even on Senate side Ron Johnson um Rick Scott Florida said yeah we got to take a hard look at this it doesn't mean we want to kill the programs in fact we want to preserve them and make sure they're there they're not really solvent technically at this point and the left comes out says you want to cut and get rid of Social Security Medicare no we're trying to preserve it why can't we just have a meaningful and and Frank truthful debate about that well the party of Lies first of all everything that has been done good for Social Security and Medicare has been done by Republicans it has not been done by democrats they are the ones who want to cut it but it's just like they're now trying to say we're the ones who said beef on the police listen we weren't the ones having rights in the street right the ones burning Portland but these guys try to turn everything they just say whatever they can to get elected and they keep lying yeah on a personal basis Congressman do you have some immediate plans or priorities uh should the Republicans flip the house that you're going to pursue well you know first of all I'm on Intel so uh on the counter Intel side of the FBI we're going to get into some of their uh upper level listen our men and women and the FBI at the lower levels are great people they're great men and women who serve this country but the upper levels they are crooked and corrupt and we're going to go after those we're going to get them oversight on those guys and they're not going to just investigate Republicans I I am so sick of their corruptness you know we can't even get the report on the baseball shooting that happened in 2017 of which I was a part of because we're uh it's an ongoing investigation you tell me how an investigation with a guy's dead there is no investigation they can kill that son of a gun that day yeah and we still can't see the report because it's more of their cover-up so we're going to do a whole lot of oversight is what I'm looking today good it's such a ridiculous double standard I think people are tired of it I know I am I'm sure your constituents are as well oh they absolutely are we've been throughout and listen well I'll tell you what they're most sick of right now though is the high gas prices the high grocery prices uh their wages are going down and listen every family in America is paying six to eight thousand dollars a year more this is just a redistribution of wealth by Joe Biden and it's intentional so his plan is let me go cut some junk fees that's just ridiculous Congressman thank you so much for joining us sir and uh good luck uh Tuesday next

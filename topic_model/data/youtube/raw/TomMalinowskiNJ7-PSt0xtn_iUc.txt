[Music] welcome back to New Jersey power in politics I'm Alec Sedan governor Murphy and president Trump sat down for dinner in Bedminster last Friday the governor left that dinner with a tweeted promise from the president New Jersey is getting a new portal Northbridge but could this be another false start for a piece of the delay Gateway project here to tell us more is congressman Tom Malinowski who represents Hunterdon County and parts of Essex Morris Somerset Union and Warren counties the Democratic congressman sits on the House Transportation Committee welcome back to the show congressman thank you so much Alex so have you seen any movement by the Trump administration since this tweet any actual concrete action towards getting us a new portal bridge actually we saw movement well before the the tweet which is what makes me confident we we got a very high rating from the Department of Transportation and in fact money was already released to Amtrak to start work on the bridge so really the the tweet from the president I breathed a sigh of relief not because he was okaying the portal bridge it was already okayed it was more than he was saying that he was not going to undo the decision that the Department of Transportation already made so I think I think we're in the clear this is something I've been fighting for since the day I got sworn in it is the first stage of the Gateway project and now we got to get the tunnel approved too and I know that you and other members of the congressional delegation have been talking about this strategy to sort of split up Gateway as opposed to all at once and do you feel like that's gonna be successful do you feel like you would move on to another piece of it next well the next piece is the Hudson Tunnel and that can't be split off that's that's the one Trump knows about you know I actually think we got this we sort of snuck this past the president by making it about some obscure from his point of view bridge in New Jersey the tunnel is what he has held hostage all along and you know we are actually today approving a major transportation in or structure bill on my committee in the house that is going to make it much harder for this president to holdup gateway in the future should he be reelected we're putting in a ton of money and making it harder for the Secretary of Transportation to play the kind of games that she's played I want to turn to these protests that have taken place in the wake of the death of George Floyd you were critical of a decision to send 85 members of the New Jersey National Guard to Washington DC you tweeted that New Jersey should have nothing to do with this did governor Murphy make a mistake sending those National Guard members to DC what I'm critical of is the use of our military or in this case National Guard commanded by the the US Army to police dissent in America what happened in front of the White House was a major transgression using National Guard to put down a peaceful protest so that the president could cross the street for a photo op at a church was unbelievably outrageous and the military our senior commanders including general Milley deeply regret their involvement in this they I think made it very clear to the Congress it's not going to happen again fortunately the New Jersey Guard troops were not involved in that incident but look all I can say is I'm really glad they're home we should have nothing to do with that and of course in New Jersey these overwhelmingly mostly peaceful protests have taken place and they have attracted some supporters from the Republican side including your likely opponent in November Republican state senator Tom Kane I want to read you something that Senator Kaine wrote in an op-ed he said I know that step one is acknowledging the problem and so I want to say outright that black lives matter that George Floyd's murder was gut-wrenching an abuse of power and we must work together to end systemic racism in this nation what's your reaction to Senator Kaine one is meaningless if you don't take step two and tell us what you're gonna do about it we are we are passing legislation in the House of Representatives that is going to reform policing in this country that's gonna ban chokeholds that's going to horn this doctrine of qualified immunity for police officers and government officials getting sued that's going to stop the transfer of military equipment to police forces across the country reform use of force rules some of these things are controversial and you know you've got to tell people that you're you're eager to represent exactly what you would do it's very easy to say we're against racism but we have a responsibility as public officials to do something I've been very clear about what I am prepared to do and there are there's an issue that I know that you've been on top of since you entered Congress that we've talked about before and it's the fight against white supremacy and I wanted to ask you if this group called boogaloo apparently one of their members involved in the murder of two law enforcement officers in California is that something that is on your radar as terms of a white supremacist right wing movement and how concerned are you with that group I've been concerned about that since since day one last year we you and I talked about this I got a fully-restored all of the funding that the Trump administration cut from the Department of Homeland Security's programs to fight domestic terrorism in the United States is amazing that that that this administration basically ended that program we these guys really really concerning because they were they were military and and we were we've been working to try to ensure that recruits to our military and were carefully vetted against participation in extremists including white supremacist groups last year the Republicans in the Senate mysteriously dropped a provision from the national defense bill that specifically mentioned betting white nationalists who may be trying to join the military to get training that they might then use in this case to kill police officers that's something we cannot have in this country is a major major threat and do you worry about them growing in strength you worry about that connection to the military and what could you do about something like that other than just you know more vetting well we that's that as that as part of it we need to empower our law enforcement agencies both at the federal level and at the state level to be able to detect this kind of activity before there's violence we need much more pressure on our social media companies to stop the spread of the hatred online that serves as the recruitment mechanism for these organizations and then you know what we need leaders in this country we're gonna stand against it something else happened today that's just extraordinary to me Facebook had to take down an ad that was placed by the National Trump presidential campaign because it used Nazi imagery the upside down red triangle you're talking about right red triangle this this was big this is basically a mark that was placed on political prisoners at Auschwitz and other concentration camps and you know this stuff percolates in the subculture of the far-right and makes its way into the campaign of a president running for reelection the fact that you and I are actually talking about this I just it's bizarre that we have to and yet we we have to this is where we are as as a country the subtle signals sent from the very top to armed extremist groups in our country but finally there's somebody who understands them and speaks their language it's incredibly dangerous it legitimizes violent radical fringe ideologies Congressman Tom Malinowski thank you for joining us thank you

all right do not travel to some eight out of ten countries on this planet so 80 of the world's countries the state department among others saying we don't think it's a good idea uh for you to go there and in fact we might enforce that david lee miller new york city with more david lee neil let's start with this anyone in the u.s age 16 or older is now eligible to receive a covid19 vaccine according to the cdc about one third of all americans are now fully vaccinated and more than half have received at least one dose the cdc also says that airborne transmission of the virus is how it is most often spread the risk of catching cover by touching a surface relatively low the agency says soap and detergent can lower the risk but in the words of a cdc official putting on a show to disinfect an area can give a false sense of security several universities including columbia cornell and brown are going to require students attending the fall semester to be vaccinated and the head of the cdc says despite success vaccinating 3 million people a day the battle against the virus is not over being in a complicated stage on the one hand more people in the united states are being vaccinated every single day at an accelerated pace on the other hand cases and hospitalizations are increasing in some areas of the country and cases among younger people who have not yet been vaccinated are also increasing and according to the world health organization new cases of covet increased for the eighth week in a row and as you were just discussing the state department says the virus still poses what it calls unprecedented risk to travelers and is updating its travel advisories americans are now being warned not to visit 80 percent of the countries worldwide because of the virus meanwhile more states are continuing to reopen and here in new york starting next week movie theater capacity is going to be increased to 33 percent and museums aquariums and zoos will now be permitted up to 50 capacity new york once the epicenter of the pandemic is now seeing some of the lowest number of new covet cases since thanksgiving neil david lee miller thank you very much for that david uh to senator roger marshall of kansas he's a senator but a physician by training so we get you know double bang for the buck senator thank you very much for joining us do you know sir on the state department guidelines whether um they're a friendly suggestion an advisory or something more demanding well neil i think it's too early to tell and i think we're kind of getting ahead of our skis we don't even have herd immunity in this nation right now before we start worrying about the rest of the world but certainly it's not safe to go out yet i don't think it's safe to go outside of this country we need to be focused on getting vaccines into people's arms right now so that we do achieve that hurt immunity here in the united states how far away do you think we are from that because some states are reporting enormous progress vaccinations have gone out essentially or at least advisories have gone out to to all adults at least those 16 and over in most states uh how do you think we're doing well neil i think we're doing great but now we're seeing vaccine hesitancy going on and and we've been out in the in the countryside visiting with kansas and saying why won't you get the vaccine and one of the reasons they won't get it is they feel like they're they're being tied to this mask thing that we're not being rewarded for getting the vaccine we should be able to get rid of the mass so as long as dr fauci keeps preaching that we've got to keep these masks on forever it's like a ball and chain it's insulting our individual freedoms and kansas are just frustrated with the whole process so it's the vaccine hesitancy that's going to be holding us up now not the lack not not the number of vaccines available you know in the middle of all this in your doctor so defer to your expertise on this senator um the cdc has already put out you know sort of an acknowledgement here that even though you get the vaccine it doesn't mean that in that interim period you could contract the virus 6 000 americans have that's still a very small number the 200 million americans who've gotten at least one dose of a vaccine so what do you make of these 6 000 who've actually gotten the virus after getting the vaccine you know it's a miracle it's a miracle that only 6 000 people out of 137 million people have got the virus but more importantly none of those people have had to be hospitalized or or have died to my knowledge so the vaccine works and and really it really renders this copa virus as harmless as the seasonal flu and maybe even a seasonal cold and that's why i think we can lose the mass mandate now that the vaccines actually work i'm not convinced that all these other uh mandates truly have proven to work at this point in time but we know the vaccines work and that's why people need to go get their vaccine so they can be as free as they once were before so that you can see your parents and to protect your parents protect your children protect your grandchildren please i'm pleading with people to go get the vaccine um you know people who have gotten the vaccine of whether it was before the troubles and it was pulled the jnj one dose vaccine or those that defies a modern what have you uh there's been this sort of superman feeling afterwards where they don't feel compelled to wear a mask and people who don't know why they're not wearing a mask wonder um if if this is causing any undue threat to them what is the medical read on that doctor i know your your own view on mass but uh isn't it the better part of valor for those who've gotten the vaccine to still wear the mask so as not to alarm those who don't uh you know know that you've been treated well neil i just i don't follow that logic too well the whole purpose of the vaccine was to protect us from getting the virus there's less than a 5 chance that we would carry the virus after we've had the vaccine so so really we're approaching herd immunity uh certainly there's a small group of people that maybe feel comfortable to still wear the mask but i don't think that they should take away from our freedoms no more you shouldn't be asking a person to wear a mask because of kova 19 that's had the vaccination any more than she'd be asking people that had the sniffles or had the seasonal flu i think it's overreach and treading on my individual liberties and my individual rights and everybody's kind of just tying this control the control with the mass to the rest of the rest of our uh are our god-given civil rights right now so i think the mass thing has got to go we need the freedom to stop wearing masks after you've had the vaccine what about the freedom to ignore some recommendations that have been popping up senator that we might have to get booster shots for this vaccine or the very least treat it as we do the common flu and get a vaccine or a covet shot every year how do you feel about that well i i think again we're getting out in front of our skis i can certainly understand the theory of it much like the the flu a shot we get each year the flu shots a little bit differently they try to predict what flu is going to be hitting the the countryside this year and just like this maybe there'll be new strains that develop that's another reason we need to research from china we need to go way back to the to the bat studies on this virus to understand how it mutates so we can better predict what we need in the future going on here all right senator i want to thank you very much you clarified a lot of things i'm glad i heard it from both the perspective of the u.s senator and a pretty good doctor uh i appreciate that senator roger marshall of kansas on all of that

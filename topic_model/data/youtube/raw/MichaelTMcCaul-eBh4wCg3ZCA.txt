congratulations on your new assignment I know you get you will continue to serve the country well in my condolences to the people in Boston I yet but plan to visit on Friday I think the response efforts of the Boston Police Department fire department the people Boston is a true inspiration and makes me proud to be an American thank you um my question has to do with Benghazi earlier this year Secretary Clinton testified and I asked her about a classified State Department cable mark secret from ambassador Stevens to the State Department on August the 16th and in that cable he essentially warns that the Benghazi consulate could not withstand a coordinated attack and that's quote-unquote the regional security officer believed that our consulate could not be protected at an emergency meeting which is a very extraordinary thing less than a month before the attack on September the 11th a contingency plan was supposedly drafted to move the consulate operations to a CIA annex about a mile away and this cable came on the heels of three significant events one april 6 2012 accrued ied was thrown over the wall of the US facility in Benghazi in May twenty second the Red Cross building was hit by two RPG mortars by the brigades of the blind Sheikh and june six the US consulate in Benghazi was targeted by an IED attack that blew a hole in the perimeter wall at the Benghazi consulate again the brigade to the blind Sheikh take credit and responsibility for this in a written questions after the hearing I asked the secretary who in the State Department saw this cable and what specific actions were taken in response I was disappointed quite frankly with her response and I hope he can do better her response simply identified personnel in the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and the Bureau of near eastern errors as having reviewed the cable but it did not say who received the cable specifically and what specific actions were taken in response to what I consider to be a cry from for help from our ambassador to our state Department in Washington that possibly could have prevented that tragic event from occurring mr. secretary can you tell me which individual or individuals saw this cable and what specific actions were taken I can't tell you which one reviewed it because there's a there's a process going on right now which is supposed to come to me very shortly which is an internal review and analysis of who did what and who may have or may not have made the right judgment or no judgment or whatever and I have to act on that so I have not seen that yet and I don't want you know i'm not going to prejudice anything that i have to do here i think the Chairman raised the issue of people still working there's a process there's a due process there's an administrative internal process it will come to me and I will have to make some kind of a decision I'm not even sure exactly what the parameters of that are yet because I've waited until it's ripe and comes to me but I know that it's coming and i'll then know exactly who made what decision or didn't and i'll have some responsibility to act one way or the other regarding it well I appreciate that but can I have your assurance that you will let this committee know which individuals actually receive that cable and turn and what response was taken you have a right to know I certainly appreciate that one last question mm this is a sort of mixture of State Department in the department of homeland security but recently the Global Entry Program was offered to saudi arabia saudi arabia's were 15 and the 19 hijackers came out of I can't think of any greater threat to aviation security than the Saudi peninsula with the Yemen right south of Saudi Arabia for the life of me I don't understand why the Saudi was given preferential treatment over our NATO allies who fought alongside with our soldiers and fought and died and were wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan and instead of rewarding NATO our NATO allies with this global entry rewarding Saudi Arabia I personally I'm not trying to be politically ER I think it's a a dangerous policy and it could result in in in American lives being killed I'm just trying to determine and I apologize but I'm trying to determine who actually makes the final decision on that and I'm told it's an interagency process which is you know doesn't satisfy me and it won't satisfy you I need to find out where that final decision gets made but but and I want to say this in fairness Saudi Arabia as cooperated with us and is cooperating with us in extraordinary ways there are plots that we have uncovered that have never come to light and won't and shouldn't because of Saudi Arabia's assistance Saudi Arabia is providing invaluable assistance in the counterterrorism efforts in the Arabian Peninsula and Saudi Arabia has an extremely effective and has entered into with us a major capacity to vet to determine the security and as you know in the Global Entry Program you go through a huge background analysis and check plus you have major biometrics that are component of it I went through this a year ago or so so that I could you know join it and I remember you know every fingerprint every sort of aspect of you is proctologist and so you wind up with a pretty good sense of who's who so I I personally have confidence in the capacity of Saudi Arabia do that and I think I wouldn't prejudice them automatically by virtue of what happened I'd look at the procedure and check and see what goes into it in fairness and angry and my time is expired but i will say in the settings have been extraordinary allies with respect to intelligence i agree with you on that point but i do think you it merits review by your department as well well i'll check out on the final review but I'm I have great confidence in the Saudi Arabian contribution the kingdom has been very very helpful in any number of ways

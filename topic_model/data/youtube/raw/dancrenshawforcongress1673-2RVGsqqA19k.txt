- My guiding principles, no,
I love the Republican Party. It's the party of Abraham
Lincoln, it's the party of Ronald Reagan, but if we must choose we have to choose upon principle and that's the people of this district. These are the ones we kneel to. I don't kneel when the
National Anthem plays, but I will kneel before my constituents, because I believe in service. And after I was nearly killed, I kept believing in service, because it's all I really know. David said before that he was the only one willing to talk about the Constitution. Well if you're a veteran
in this room like I am, I have actually taken that oath. And that does not end. The principle that we must put forth before anything else is does this policy encourage freedom or take it away. Does it encourage a more moral society or a lesser one. Those principles are what matter. The people of this
district are what matter. Dave Crenshaw for Congress. (applauding)

woman and I want to thank all of our witnesses for taking the time to come before this committee to testify on an issue that impacts every single congressional district in this country and thank you especially mr. Williams for your courage and sharing your story and being here today as to give your testimony while this hearing is designed to put a spotlight on the millions of Americans who are at risk of eviction due to a lack of affordable units simply authorizing more funding as is been exhibited and already discussed here briefly for these programs is not the only solution although HUDs programs were designed to help address the effects of unaffordability at the local level at the federal level they do not and are not meant to address the underlying causes of the housing crisis and affordability the causes of those problems regulations and increase the increasing that Rhian creased the cost of the supply of housing units and decreased access to Economic Opportunity are inherently local decisions that no amount of federal assistance will ever be able to surmount that is why I would urge my colleagues all of us here today across the aisle both sides to co-sponsor represent Representative Virginia Fox's bill HR 49:56 the finding market-based and local solutions to ensure access to housing act again HR 49:56 like y'all to take a look at this bill codifies president Trump's executive order establishing a White House Council on eliminating regulatory barriers to affordable housing the order recognizes that multiple factors contribute to the affordable housing shortages across the country and state and local governments are in the best position to reduce barriers to affordable housing mr. Hendricks in your experience do you believe that there are local regulatory barriers that are driving out investment and driving up unaffordability in the housing market and you have any specific example sir of these barriers in any states unfortunately there are far too many states where local regulatory barriers are standing in the way more housing being built I think that the coastal states are often the most egregious examples but those are also the places where we see the most opportunity for reform we're actually seeing reforms places that are up zoning their cities and observing their states we've seen that in California seen that in Oregon and we're even seeing progress in Massachusetts as well with the governor Charlie Baker that kind of progress is something that we can't nationalize we don't know what happens in each and every corner there's no one-size-fits-all serration to reforming our housing markets but the localities do know best and they also know the housing markets differ from place to place so it works perhaps for San Francisco may work very different for sandy Angelo and we need to be reinforcing that and sharing information between localities so that they can learn best practices for reform you referenced zoning a little earlier what what changes would you propose to the local zoning and regulatory structure to promote affordability and availability of housing at all income sectors of the community so because every locality is different in every state is different it may look different but it starts with incremental progress taking neighborhoods where there's demand for more than just a single-family home and making it easier to build duplexes triplexes backyard apartments again where there's demand this is not about demolishing what needn't be demolished this is about saying if there's demand if people are demanding to live in a certain neighborhood and there's no supply to meet them we should free up that supply localities across the country are trying to address affordable housing by implementing something called rent and trol New York recently passed one of the most comprehensive laws we've ever seen in this country economists of all all stripes agree that rent control can be very counterproductive mr. Hendricks in the brief amount of time that I have left what can be done to make housing more affordable and stopping failed policies like rent control from being implemented rent control comes from a real desire to address housing needs but as a Swedish socialist economist said the only thing more destructive to a city than bombing is rent control I think we've seen that over time and it often is most harmful to future and future renters and newcomers that's where the cost is transferred and we need to be able to have housing for migrants and immigrants and people of all backgrounds to come in and that is not the solution right my time is expired thank you all for your testimony I yield

thank you madam chair I regret getting cut off earlier I was just going to talk about the the statement in mr. BAE's testimony that I wanted to read back and he said there's a practical solution through science-based risk assessments and land management strategies there is a middle way between a complete hands-off approach or the do-nothing approach and outdated forced management practices of extensive timber harvests that have created homogenized landscapes making them prone to burning hotter this middle road strategy protects large trees and wildlife habitat conducts and conducts ecologically based commercial thinning of trees as the byproduct of restorative work and reduces the risk to communities by returning beneficial fire to the landscape I couldn't have said it better myself thank you for that testimony that's you've conveyed the message that I've been trying to say since I've been on this this committee and I know you've seen this work in the field you with some words that you use in there to do nothing approach when we do nothing when we make the decision not to manage our forests we made a management decision we have to know that that the force doesn't care what policy we make here they continue to grow and fill the growing space and an a no decision is a management decision I also want to point out the using the word of commercial thinning one of the biggest mistakes I think we made is to think that it's wrong to do commercial thinning pre-commercial thinning is a is a cost with very little return to it commercial thinning allows you to recapture some of the cost of moving that crew into the woods and it also makes the forest healthier now there's you talked about patch thinning in different ways to do it but we need to have the flexibility to do commercial thinning I want to this is forests or different all across the country this photo appears from federal land and in my state this is not national forests but it's Filson thal National Wildlife Refuge that may look like a healthy forest to some but that's a control area and there's not much biodiversity in there right conditions that subject to wildfire catastrophic wildfire and and it's the control site you will look at the next slide the management regime is to go in and commercially thin leave the big trees leave different species of trees and then to burn underneath and the third slide that's what it looks like when you're when you're through and those those grasses that are coming up those are seeds that have been in the soil for centuries or not centuries but decades and they they flush and they create a great wildlife habitat the plant and animal biodiversity is greater in that forest then the much greater than one we first saw and the the amount of wildlife turkey deer quill and and this is actually red cockaded woodpecker habitat which is an endangered species so your approach works it would look different in different states because forests are different but that's not clear cutting and that's creating a good good fire break this Rami and your testimony and thank you for what the Forest Service is doing to utilized the authorities that are there and the new authorities through good neighbor and hopefully the stewardship contracting one thing that I think we can focus on more is the wildland urban interface and we should fund state and private forestry at higher levels because that's that's preventive medicine right there to allow because a lot of the land and the we is not federal land it's privately owned land sometimes small woodlot owners that have no incentive to go in and manage those woodlot so I would like to look at the next slide this is a map for the woods across the country you can see most of them are in the east because there's higher population density the areas subject to have the worst fires are in the West let's go to the next slide this is a slide that may not mean much to you but this is a campfire and if you see the red hatched area that is the boundary of the campfire so that dark red line is where the fire stopped that blue line is land owned by seer Pacific a private company in California and you can see the fire stopped on their property and if you look closer there's a light green hatched line that's actually where a timber company put in a fire break if we look at the next slide that's what that fire break looked like it wasn't a clear cut it was where the forest had been thin and the underbrush taken out so again thank you all I think if we implemented what you're talking about 30 or 40 years ago we wouldn't have to be having a lot of the discussions we're having today and if we can get good policy in place 40 or 50 years from now things will be a lot better I yield back mr. Westerman chair

Thank You mr. speaker what does this seem like no one at an airport security checkpoint has been delegated with that awesome yet shockingly absent power of common sense why is the eight-year-old graining wheelchair being harassed why is the US military service member in uniform with a military ID on military orders having his or her toothpaste confiscated as a management and resource allocation issues rise that are plaguing the bureaucracy at TSA red flags are going up with a peak travel season nearly upon us some airline passengers reporting wait times as much as two or three hours to get through security long lines will only get longer if TSA doesn't pursue a course correction coordinating with airport authorities and Airlines to ensure staffing levels meech match peak travel times if you have four lines being occupied and you have a long wait maybe you should occupy some more of the available security lanes Wow law enforcement to do their law enforcement duties to free up more screeners to screen Airlines can do their part by knocking off the madness with a hidden baggage fees the trick might help fill seats on planes but it's resulting on more port more people bringing their baggage through security by the way TSA doesn't have a funding issue last year this Congress gave them more than they asked for no one wants to hear the TSA s excuses I yield back

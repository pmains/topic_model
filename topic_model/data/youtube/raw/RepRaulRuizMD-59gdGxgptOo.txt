the life-saving literally issues ty to having so many Americans and quite frankly so many Hispanic families covered now by the Obama Care Act my district is Albuquerque largely New Mexico I represent the urban district and prior to coming to Congress I wore the secretary Iran the Department of Health and I want to tell a quick story in my 90 seconds about what life was like and remind everyone about the issues prior to the Affordable Care Act and dealing with pre-existing conditions I had an older an 80 year old woman who was not covered by either Medicaid or Medicare who fell in broke a hip in a requirement prior to the Affordable Care Act and prior to investments in both the preventive care and hospital care in hospital coverage and discharge coverage the only requirement for my 80 year old woman is that they treat that broken hip soon as they stabilized that they don't have to do surgery depending upon the break and once she stabilized that doesn't mean she's walking that doesn't mean that she's getting any rehab that doesn't mean that she's got the medications to go home she's discharged home and what I know about being discharged home and we've got a doctor here with us is that's a death sentence particularly with a broken hip particularly with an older woman there are countless stories of families who had left with 0 options now that we have tens of millions of Americans covered and given the fact that I represent a state that's the largest minority majority stake for the first time New Mexico with one of the highest uninsured rates we now have most New Mexicans covered I think about that we have an environment where most New Mexicans are not worried about whether they make a choice between keeping their house paying the rent buying your food in prescription drugs we have most New Mexicans in a situation where they have access to preventive care of physician we have most New Mexicans in a position to make sure that their kids have access to those same medical services and now we're an environment in this country with an tell my stick we're going to take seven hundred and ninety thousand people off the insurance rules and off Medicaid and ask them once again to fend for themselves and remind them unequivocally in this debate after more than 60 repeal votes the health care is not a right that it's a privilege and they don't deserve any of our efforts to protect that I disagree with them and so does this caucus so it is my distinct honor to introduce my colleague from Texas Joaquin Castro to talk more about the value of importance era Thank You chairwoman I'm Joaquin Castro and i represent part of texas san antonio and we're here today in strong support of the Affordable Care Act the repeal of which would strip millions of Americans of vinyl health care coverage while vinos in the United States have particularly benefited from this law because of the APA more than four million Latinos were able to gain coverage over 900 Latinos between the ages of 19 and 26 but otherwise have been uninsured for able to stay on their parents health care insurance and 17 million Latinos have gained access to preventive healthcare services without cost-sharing these numbers are course phenomenal but sometimes it takes real personal stories to understand just how significant this law is the people's lives and over the last few weeks I've asked my constituents in San Antonio to tell me what the Affordable Care Act has meant for them and their families this of course is in the state of Texas which still has the highest percentage of people that have absolutely no health care coverage so there's a story of Andrea Hoskins a small business owner with a pre-existing condition because of the ACA she was funny before the ACA she was uninsured and accumulating devastating the expensive hospital bills thanks to the Affordable Care Act she was able to receive regular care that identified and effectively treated her serious health condition now she says she can live her life to the fullest there's also my constituent Diana who calls the Affordable Care Act quote a lifesaver for her family and here's why Diana's father was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease after he suffered a stroke because of the ACA he can now afford the doctors appointments medications and therapy he needs diana says that if the law is repealed her dad won't be able to find health insurance because of his pre-existing condition so as Republicans consider repeal I hope they consider the devastating effects that repeal will have on Latinos and on millions and millions of Americans not only Americans who signed up for health care through the exchange but those who have benefited from from terms like making sure that they can't not be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions furthermore and this is my final point for Republicans to move forward with repeal without a replacement a viable replacement is to play Russian roulette with the lives of the American people this is reckless policymaking and I hope it don't think twice before they go down that road now it's my honor to introduce a gentleman from California he died a lot good morning I'm Pete Aguilar and I represent san bernardino in Inland Southern California we've heard from my colleagues today about the horrific ramifications we'll see if the Affordable Care Act is repealed we'll go back to the days when we were denied coverage for having pre-existing conditions where preventative screenings weren't covered and we're being a woman was a pre-existing condition it's shameful it's unforgivable that House Republicans would choose to go back to that since the Affordable Care Act has been signed nearly 40,000 residents in my home district California's 31st district at five million Californians have enrolled in the in covered California in my community sixty-seven percent of health care recipients are from communities of color additionally 190,000 people in my county and 3.7 million throughout California have been added to médicale following ACA expansion repealing without replacing the Affordable Care Act would cause roughly a twenty billion dollar hit to California California families will sacrifice their health care nor will they foot the bill for House Republicans to score political points House Republicans viciously emerged mercilessly attacked the Affordable Care Act because they claim they know better well now is the time what's your plan thank you now I'd like to introduce congressman Kildee partners thank you very much I want to share with you a story about a full-time worker who works in the district that I represent in California we had an opportunity to help the community get signed up for the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare or whatever else anybody wants to call it and I was walking around thanking the constituents for coming and participating and accepting our help to get enrolled and there was a gentleman who spoke to me in spanish and he basically said I shouldn't be here and he grabbed his papers and he was about to leave and I said what why do you say that he says because I can't afford health care at my work I can only afford to cover myself and his young daughter and his wife were standing right next to him and he said I can't afford to pay for their healthcare today I won't be able to pay for their healthcare tomorrow either so let me remind you he was standing there with his family as he works full time admitting that his wife and his daughter had no health care because he could only afford to health care for himself it was too expensive I told him to please stay it costs him nothing to find out the truth and then later on as I left the place he was literally in tears and I thought oh this guy got some bad news and then I went up to him and I said how are you and he said thank God I can get insurance for myself and my family for less than I was paying for for just myself ladies and gentlemen this is a full-time American worker this is not somebody who's sitting around doing nothing expecting the government to do for him and his family what he's not willing to provide for himself and that's what the Affordable Care Act means to tens of millions of families throughout the United States an opportunity to have a life of dignity an opportunity to go see the doctor instead of telling your child with a fever hang in there mijo hang in there little girl we don't have to take you to the doctor because we don't have insurance and then wait to the very last second to go to the emergency room ladies and gentlemen that was me when I was a little boy that was before the Affordable Care Act now tens of millions of families can now take their child take their grandmother to a doctor because of the Affordable Care Act and the Republicans have been parking for seven years almost seven years that they need to repeal the Affordable Care Act but they're forgetting about the fact that it needs to be replaced we can either go backwards ladies and gentlemen to a time where we might have all lived in caves without medicine where a person with asthma couldn't get insurance we're a family member if they fell ill and got cancer treatment the family was destitute because they had bills of hundreds of thousands of dollars and the Affordable Care Act protects every family in America the most that a family can be charged even if they use a million dollars with the health care and coverage is thirteen thousand dollars a year they don't have to mortgage the home they don't have to give up on their college education for their children they are protected with their health and financially that's the Affordable Care Act shame on the Republicans for wanting to get rid of it and to go backwards as a nation shame on the Republicans for harking for seven years for saying repeal the Affordable Care Act they've had seven years to come up with an alternative plan and they have absolutely nothing that's what we're up against ladies and gentlemen and I hope and pray that America pays attention family by family individual by individual and they do not allow the Republicans to send us backwards and put us into the dark ages when it comes to our health care with that I'd like to invite the podium Linda Sanchez good morning everyone I'm congressman linda sanchez i represent the 30th district in california and i'm here with my CHC call late because we are focused as is the house democratic caucus on the future of our country on progress for our country we want to grow the economy and raise wages so that every working family is supported by a good paying job we want to strengthen Social Security and Medicare so that after a long career of work workers can retire with some peace of mind in some financial security but instead of working to make America stronger Republicans have launched an all-out war on the health of our country Republicans have fooled Americans into thinking that the ACA only benefits low-income people or illegal immigrants but the reality is that 156 million Americans including 15 million Latinos who currently get their health insurance through their employer will also suffer the consequences of repeal lifetime caps on coverage will make a comeback insurance companies and big corporations will again be able to deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes or asthma millions of workers who work more than 30 hours a week will lose their insurance altogether companies would no longer be required to keep their employees children's on their health care plans until they're 26 years old and that's 900 Latino youths that will lose coverage as a result if the ACA is repealed women will again be charged higher premiums than simply because we're women and that's a practice called Jenner gender rating that has existed since time immemorial everything about healthcare coverage is threatened not just those that didn't have coverage before ACA but those who were covered under their employers plans are going to suffer if the ACA is repealed after seven years Republicans still don't have a replacement plan but they're irresponsibly pushing forward to reveal the ACA without a viable replacement plan you would think that after all their years of grumbling they'd have time to put together a plan in seven years but they have zero nothing nothing to replace it with they can't even promise you that whatever plan they put in place will cover as many people as the ACA currently covers so our message is clear Democrats are ready to work with Republicans to fine tune and fixed parts of the ACA that could be improved but if they would rather work to dismantle the progress that we have made for working families they're going to have to do it alone unas palabras en español no school can assess an N ganando a muchos de este país diciendo que

and with that I'd like to call to the podium a colleague of mine from California he is an emergency room medical doctor like to call Raul Ruiz Thank You Linda I'm representative and I always greased I'm from California's 36 district I am an emergency medicine physician and I'm here to demand access to high quality affordable health care for the American people as an emergency physician my role is to defend and protect my patients and people across the country from policies that could put their health and well-being in jeopardy como medical conceivable has been miss pacientes he al público otra vez el pais de la política que pone a su salud y bienestar Andrea's room this is about people everyday hard-working people it's not about party it's not about politics it's about people this is about the young man with alternative colitis a chronic and painful condition with diarrhea and abdominal pain who's lived his whole life embarrassed wanting to have meaningful relationships with a significant other wanting to find an employment live a life with dignity but unable to afford the medication that would help ease the pain and control his his hardships unable to get a job because employers would say no because insurance for you would cost too much now with the Affordable Care Act he has a meaningful relationship he has a job he has his dignity back and he's living a normal productive life this is about more than 20 million people who could lose coverage and access to care including 6.3 million Hispanics this is about the 913 thousand latinos between ages 19 and 26 who have health insurance because they can now stay on their parents plans this is about the young mother of three that I saw in the emergency department who didn't have health insurance her sister visited her during the holidays and insisted that she go to see a physician because of this concerning lump in her breast so with tears she saw me concerned about what the diagnosis would be in sure enough she had a lump the size of a limit and the next step was for her to go get a biopsy and that fear of not knowing what it was going to show whether it was malignant whether it had spread whether it was benign a mother of three that concern and that anxiety who waited and who waited because it would not only reveal something she might not want to have revealed to her at this age but also something that could break her bank and put her in financial crisis not only her but the shared income of her family's would be in financial crisis so now preventive services for women like her our mothers our wives our sisters and our daughters are covered Republicans have no new ideas only old failed ideas that got us in the mess in the first place low republicanos no tiene una de las nuevas solamente das Vieques política Guillen fracas odd their strategy to delay replacement is really a strategy to evade responsibility because they even know that repealing the Affordable Care Act would mean taking away health insurance for over 20 million people delaying or slowing it down does it make it better it's like putting a leech on a patient and slowly watching them die so astrantia es de pasar el empleo y agua de las consecuencias que los pacientes van imprenta esto es como poner una San sanguis fuera en un paciente he dejado que sangra lentamente hasta su muerte this does nothing to help the millions of people with disabilities and seniors who could lose coverage if the Medicaid expansion is cancelled this ignores the millions of seniors in the Medicare doughnut hole who have saved more than 20 3.5 billion dollars collectively on prescription drugs and who risked stop taking their quit medications because they would no longer be able to afford it this neglects the root of the problem which is that health care costs are rising too high at a rapid rate and prescription drugs are unfavorable Lee expensive for individuals for families for seniors and for people with disabilities and as a physician first and foremost in the core of my soul I have seen firsthand how patients struggle when they cannot access the care they need to live healthy lives we need to address these health care costs we need to address the physician shortage crisis we need to address the cost of prescription drugs we need to make sure that individuals don't have to pay more out of pocket and as a physician I will fight for that access for my patients for my districts and for the American people omo medico y lucha read para que means pacientes tengan acceso a servicios medicos para ministry toe apparent publico American thank you and I would like to turn the time to representative Adriano aspire thank you dr. Ruiz I'm sure that you would agree with me that repealing the Affordable Care Act is as serious as a heart attack and I represent the district which has probably the largest number of hospitals in New York stated at the country and under ACA million of America I have access to the affordable health care through marketplaces and Medicaid expansion this is that just about getting insurance for folks don't have insurance but this is all also about channeling greater resources for Medicaid a program that the services many of our constituencies and children in New York State young people in New York State under ACA will be able to remain in their parents plan until the age of 29 and insurance companies cannot obviously discriminate patients with pre-existing condition now this is particularly important for many of us because we represent district with large numbers of people of color and those folks many of them have a disproportionate number of pre-existing conditions diabetes asthma obesity cardiovascular problems many of our folks hopes that we represent have these three existing conditions and they will be unable to get the type of insurance that that will be offered through ACA unless this is protected and so Republicans what Republicans are planning to do it will mean that 30 million or over 20 million Americans will lose their health plans and rising costs will trick will be trigger and chaos in the marketplace many of the executives and many of the hospital leaders in the hospitals that I represent are concerned about this and they should be concerned about this because the folks that come to these hospitals are not guests from my district they come from all over the city of New York from all five boroughs and so this will have a detrimental and negative impact on the people that I represent quiero decirle que como representante le treat oppress a que tiene un alto the hospital's tommo altamente preocupado por la potencia la elimination day Peter Obamacare un programa que lo Fresa hago Astros constitue gente de protección que le puedo ofrecer a un seguro de salud a persona que tiene condiciones precious 10 de como la dia vetti como es la obesidad Ozma que es muy prevalent a en nuestra comunidades enter programa tambien le ofrece en el estado de novo a los jovenes de voz de vetiver veo la posibilidad de estar en el plan de salud de su padre es un buey programa y beneficios a mess de bente millones de Americanos y por ESO set amo preocupados de que eliminar el tajin easy ativa podria que usar un cows Anitra comunidade kita serio como si o no Suh criado nautica de corazon por ESO estamos aqui para apoyar ello ba mikeraboy on todo eco lleges y vamos a normal scooch odd de la chairwoman dale allen eldatek okis me Shamu ham mission I'm going to thank my colleagues to incredibly artfully reminded and I don't think that we need much remind and write the pre-existing conditions to make sure that we don't have discrimination in rates making sure that our kids can stay on our policies making sure that there's a lifetime cap so you've got a catastrophic illness you're only insured up to that point and then you're off repealing the ACA in addition for the real life stories that you've heard again today is nothing more than a bonus check to insurance company and pharmaceutical companies who have not been held accountable to make sure that out-of-pocket costs network access shoring up the work force so that we're creating an environment that we can address those issues that people i think still want a dress in the Affordable Care Act that this plan doesn't address a single one of those issues and removes every single protective aspect away from the very people we've been fighting for decades to assure that they had equal healthcare access and wings and we're going to keep fighting to make sure that that does not happen that we don't create a giant deficit though don't remove access and lastly and I think again most importantly that we don't again give a bonus check and I might do one more repealing the ACA for a state like New Mexico and so many of these other states and districts means that it not only cripples their rural in frontier hospitals they close and when those hospitals clothes and you don't have access to hospital care and emergency room treatment you don't have the network of community physicians in community health care it all collapses and the only winners one more time insurance companies and for mizzou always that I want to thank my colleague for being here today and we would like to open it up for questions

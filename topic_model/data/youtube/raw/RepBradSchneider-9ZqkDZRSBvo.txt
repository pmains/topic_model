hi good afternoon I want to welcome everyone for joining us this afternoon for our small business webinar small business resources as we are dealing with just an extraordinary moment I'm congressman Brad Schneider again thank you everyone for joining us today together as a nation and I suspect each of you as leaders business owners sole proprietors freelancers or whatever role you you have each of you are facing challenges you never imagined possible every day brings a torrent of new rules and decisions that affect your business your employees and your family I wish I had a magic wand I wish I had some secret solution or a silver bullet that could make all this better but the fact of the matter is we are truly in uncharted territory and where you're learning and crafting solutions each turn every day my team and I have spoken to countless small businesses and I've heard firsthand the challenges you all are facing as you try to stay afloat during these uncertain times my hope today is that we can cover information that points you towards the resources currently available to small businesses and that we can discuss other challenges you are facing so that we in the Congress can look towards other assistance that you all may need I want to introduce as we go forward to people both steiner and mitch penned a new beau is the district district director for the Illinois Small Business Administration's office he's going to present on how your businesses can apply to the SBA SBA's disaster loan assistance program Mitch leads the Small Business Development Center at the college of Lake County and he will walk us through the different resources that they offer as we try to navigate this process similar resources are also available through the 62s bbc's we have throughout Illinois before turning it over to mentioned Bova though I want to give a broad overview of some of the work that Congress has been doing to help small businesses as I suspect you know Congress has stopped our past two major COBE related bills the first passed by the house let seems like a long time ago now back in march forth and signed by the president March 6 included significant funding on public health resources like research on treatments and a vaccine for coated within that bill was also a designation coronavirus as a disaster under the SBA's disaster loan program for which Illinois small businesses and nonprofits are now eligible as of Thursday you can now apply for these loans which offer as much as two million dollars towards working capital like payroll rental benefits 10 days later on March 14th the House passed the second measure the families first coronavirus response act FF CRA the Senate was little bit slower to act on this but on March 18th it did pass the Senate and was immediately signed into law by President Trump included within the bill were provisions to provide paid medical and family leave for workers directly affected by copa90 businesses with fewer than 500 employees would provide this emergency benefits workers and would be able to recoup a hundred percent of the cost to a refundable tax credit now actually before we even passed the second thought we started working on a third bill we are now looking at comprehensive economic stimulus packages that will have an array of resources resources for families for workers and for business owners like you as we speak there appears to be significantly different approaches being advocated by Mitch McConnell in the Senate and Nancy close to the house let me be clear if there was ever a time to put aside person ship and come together for the good of the country this is it I was pleased to see that the FF CRA passed with broad bipartisan support and only 40 no bullet no votes we need to see similar boats coming out of the Senate but at least so far it looks like people are not ready to get there negotiations continue though and there may be something that comes out today over the weekend we had a call yesterday with the Ways and Means Committee Democrats the community that I'm on I made clear in that conversation that we have to help small businesses retain their employees and keep them on payroll I emphasize that our funding mecca's mechanism had to be immediate without putting business owners and even greater personal exposure and that is what we need is something akin to a government back non-recourse know interest loan with long repayment schedules we are still working through the details of this legislation so I won't be able to discuss final language until I get to see it but please know that we will be sending out regular updates on federal resources available to you if you go to Schneider not how's that gov you can sign up for our newsletter and emails to stay informed I'm gonna turn it over to Mitch now who's gonna give us a brief walk through the different resources offered at the SBDC and Lake County Small Business Development Center Mitch will then pass it to Beau and he's gonna walk us through a presentation on the loan program I know that many of you have sent questions we will be going over those in the second half of a car call we have upwards of a thousand people on this call so unfortunately we can't take every question but if you do have questions following the webinar please know that you can call my office at eight four seven three eight three four eight seven zero again I'll repeat that it's eight four seven three eight three four eight seven zero and you can contact the Small Business Development Center at 8:47 five four three two zero three three again eight four seven five four three two zero three three and with that let me turn it over to Mitch thanks congressman Schneider good afternoon everybody and I'm happy to be here to be able to share some of the resources that the small business development centers throughout the state of Illinois can provide most every county in at least the northern part of the state of Illinois have an SBDC served at County in the southern part of the state you might have an SBDC that serves a two or three or four County area but you can go online and do an Internet research survey internet search just put in your county and then type sb2c and you should be able to find more SBDC so I'd urge you to do that because during normal business operations the SBDCs are there to help anybody who wants to start or grow a business both mess to clean internationally we also help people to export to foreign markets we have capability to help people in government contracts and other things so the north during normal business operations that's what we do and we're still doing that now in addition to that we are supporting businesses and their efforts stay open to weather the storm and to know what they have to do to access SBA disasterous loans which beau is going to talk more about in just a bit but I will tell you that the ESPYs overall are trying to make sure that small businesses their error is first of all have the information that they know for example my Small Business Development Center we've created something called small business Survival Guide which I believe if all of you will have access to at some point here at because a download that you'll get and it includes information on things like not original spreadsheet you're able and then lastly and perhaps most importantly getting the money you need operational working capital that you need through the SBA disaster assistance loan and so the Small Business Survival Guide computes all that information and a link to the loan application portal so that's one of our one of our goals is just to make sure that everybody has that information another one is to make sure that people understand the types of business documentation that are required to submit a loan application there there are a number of requirements but they are very well spelled out and the best thing you can do it's have all of those beside you before you begin applying for a lot it'll just make the process futher so that's another piece of information hiding and then lastly we're here to answer questions about the application process to the extent that we're able also to report application website problem to the right people so that we can get them fixed I would also urge you to connect with your local chambers of commerce and your local economic organizations they're kind of the frontline when it comes to your your particular municipality and frankly I do a lot of my communicating through venom through the chambers of commerce the economic development organizations right within your communities so they're a good person to be contacted with as well and so I'm gonna turn it over to Beau and just a moment here and if you report on this if you have questions or comments please feel free to ask and I'll do my best engines for you thanks Mitch bar there I am I'm here over time thanks so much thanks congressman really appreciate the opportunity get on here and thanks everybody who's joined wanted to run through the economic injury disaster loan program this is key tools yeah it's currently at its disposal to help businesses through this challenge so next slide please that would be great so the the economic entry disaster loan program called idle program is something that is declared basically requires a disaster declaration last Thursday night we had a disaster declaration based on the request from Governor Pritzker for that declaration and that declaration covered the entire state so every county within the state all small business all eligible small businesses can apply for a economic injury disaster loan program now as we discussed the disaster loan program is intent on providing working capital used to pay your normal business expenses so so as Mitch mentioned you know one of the things we're seeing right now is a lot of businesses revenues gone down there's nothing filling that gap so in order to help businesses keep moving down stream keep employees on payroll that's sort of saying that's the intent of the emergency in this emergency I'm sorry economic injury disaster loan so from the next slide I'll talk a little bit more about the details and the terms of the loan so through this program eligible entities and when I talk about an eligible entity that's a small business a private non-profit most president nonprofits agricultural cooperative aquaculture organizations so those types of enemies may qualify for loans of up to two million dollars interest rates are 3.75 percent for small businesses and 2.75 percent for nonprofits and the terms can go out to 30 years so so the intent is to try and identify basically for that business what the needs are to keep the doors open basically and have a loan a loan in in place that can help that business to make paint to make all those those payments and I'll talk a little bit more about what those payments look like important to note that the first payment is deferred for one year so once you close the loan and you have disbursement of funds you've got up to a year before you have to start making payments again state the reason we do that is to make sure that is to is to really help the business owner in their cash flow because we all know that cash is king in this kind of situation and cash flow is one of the most important things that we can help small business with when you're talking about eligibility a couple things come into play first is the size so small business is has a number of different criteria that can categorize the business as small those businesses are small business in the United States so as you came a little bit more on that and then the type of business there are some businesses that are considered ineligible for this program and when I talk about financial resources it just means it's two things one you have credit available elsewhere so you have access to financial resources that would make a scene did not need to receive an economic injury loan number one number two looking long-term as we do the underwriting evaluation of the loan do you does your cash flow is this sufficient to support repayment over time and this isn't cash flow right now right because we know everybody's down this is normal operating cash flow that we would give an evaluation on next slide please as I mentioned the list of small eligible entities or small businesses small agricultural cooperatives small aquaculture businesses and most private nonprofits and these funds can be used for basically normal operating costs so think about that payroll accounts payable basically those things that you would have been able to pay had it not been for the disaster impacting your revenues which then impacted your ability to pay next slide please so real quick just we talk about small business what categorizes small business it's the what you're looking at is generally we look at a revenue size standard based on your industry code so on the slide here mentions retail or service is seven million dollars other industries for example construction might be up to thirty five million dollars classifying that's too small so you we'd have to look at basically the the type of industry you're in to make that assessment for manufacturing 500 and 500 employees or less and wholesale businesses is a hundred employees or less you'll note in the slide if you're looking at it there's also an alternate size maximum this is based on the owner the maximum tangible net worth of the applicant is not more than fifteen million dollars and the average net income after federal income taxes is more than five million I wanted to tell you both of those standards because if a business is eligible through either standard they're eligible to apply so just because you maybe don't meet the alternate sized standard if you're the traditional size standard you do meet it your candy cow next slide please so what are we going to look at for approval first thing is we're gonna look in credit history so you have to have a credit history that's acceptable to the SBA which means that we will be going which means I'm gonna look at credit scores we're gonna look at your history of repayment those sorts of things so one of the things that I recommend to people that are going to apply for a loan is make sure you know where if there's anything on your credit report it's either incorrect or wrong that is adversely impacting your credit report because you I would encourage you to take care of that in advance of applying for the loan what kind of look at repayment so we want to make sure that you have the ability to repay the loan and then from an L further eligibility you have to suffer working capital losses due to the disaster I think it's pretty safe to say that almost every business nowadays is suffering some adverse impact due to the coronavirus so you know I would expect in most businesses were applied by that standard next slide a couple other things economic injury loans over $25,000 require collateral so basically up to twenty-five thousand is unsecured but note that lack of collateral is not a reason for decline so if you don't have collateral that doesn't mean that we're going to turn you down next slide SP one thing to note also about this program is that this program is done directly with the SBA if you're familiar with SBA loan programs on the conventional side normally we work through commercial lenders to provide loans to the small business community in this case we're making a direct loan so when you go to apply you're coming to the SBA to apply servicing you come to the SBA for servicing of that loan so everything there goes to the SBA you can find the disaster application at www.sba.gov information there that can help you as you look at look at your application note that there's no cost to apply you don't have to take the loan if it's offered and even if you have an existing disaster loan or a sba conventional loan you still can qualify for an economic injury disaster plan for this disaster so generally speaking almost any business would be allowed to apply under this standard next slide please okay so wanted to talk just briefly Mitch mentioned it a little bit but the application process is pretty streamlined for this particular loan I'm gonna be asking to complete that application which on paper form is two pages just to give you an idea of the effort involved there we're gonna ask for authorizations from the applicant principals and affiliates basically anybody who's the 20% owner or more will need to get IRS form 4500 60 which allows us to pull a transcript for the personal tax returns for those homeowners we look for complete copies of the most recent business federal income tax return including all schedules understanding that you may not have your 2019 taxes done we will take the 2018 tax returns but we'll also probably ask for a profit and loss for 2019 a balance sheet for 2019 to document revenues for the prior year there's a schedule of liabilities personal financial statement and that is for all orders over 20 percent and we may ask for other information now you can apply using a paper application however we highly recommend going through the electronic loan application system it's more streamlined it's faster to get the information to the processing center and it just provides a more usable format to get all the information to our our processing center one one kind of tip or trick and Mitch mentioned it is look at what you have to submit and make sure you have all the documentation together the loan application documents all the documents that I've mentioned that our SBA forms can be pulled down from the SBA website at sba.gov ford slash disaster so you can actually look and see what information is going to be requested for that application in advance of going into the system so you can have everything ready and on hand we do have some other documents that may be required next slide please including your personal financial tax returns those as I mentioned if your most recent federal income tax return hasn't been filed a P&L and a balance sheet for that year year-to-date profit and loss and for no filing requirements may include form 1368 to provide monthly sales figures again this is part of the analysis this can be asked for as part of the analysis for the economic injury that your that you're claiming as part of the loan application documentation from a process standpoint what you'll do is you'll go into the electronic Lona application you'll fill out all these documents online or most of the documents online others like your tax returns that you'll have to upload once you upload and submit then all that information goes to the processing center to be to be reviewed next like I'd mention some ineligible entities agricultural enterprises religious organizations travel organizations gambling concerns that derived more than a third of their revenue from gambling activity she knows racetracks those are a couple of examples you have questions we can always you always get in touch with the Illinois district and we can talk through other central entities that are ineligible next slide this slide basically just goes through all the discussion around the electronic loan application I'm not going to go into too much except to note that if you do have questions when you're going through the process you've got a wealth of resources available to help you the SPS customer service center can be arranged 865 nine sorry here 865 nine to nine five five or you can email disaster customer service at SBA govt next slide in addition as Mitch mentioned you have a wealth of resource partners here in Illinois who can help you through this process the Illinois Small Business Development Center Network has been trained on the application program they I think are pretty much heavily they're very heavily focused on helping businesses navigate the application as well as the strategy to get through the next two weeks two months kind of looking forward we also have score which is an all-volunteer organization that we find provide funding to again that has a wealth of you know a wealth of experience to help businesses navigate this time Women's Business Development Center and the veteran business Outreach Center can all be resources for you as a small business as you go through this process and last but not least we also have the Illinois district office we've got a staff on board that's 100% focused on the disaster loan programs right now and we're answering emails picking up the phone to answer questions for those of you that are in the application process who have questions about it you can reach out to our office and get assistance as well the slide deck at the end it has all the contact information which I'll share in a moment we are also doing twice daily training sessions at 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. so if you want more information and be able to ask questions in a webinar type environment you go to SP a dodgy OD Ford / IL - I can sign up for a training session with with T folks from from my team next slide a couple things on you know as you look forward so we want you to submit your application as quickly as possible make sure you get all your you make sure everything is submitted it's the biggest thing that's gonna slow down the process is if you don't submit all the documentation at once alright in your initial submission and then there's a back and forth that happens that's just gonna slow down the process and slow you down from getting to the point where you're getting approval or denial and hopefully a distribution of funds this also isn't a static program so if you has if your needs change let's say right now I need $100,000 to get me through the next month and then in the future you go okay I actually need more because the you know because of the shelter in place that I didn't anticipate then you can go back and amend your application to increase the amount so there is some flexibility it's not just a static process and then if your request is denied you still have recourse you go back and explain any circumstances under which they said hey we declined for this and you can go back and have a further conversation with the loan processing center to work through that and see if there's ways that you know you can explain why your credit score is what it is or whatever that would then allow them to go ahead and make the loan so important to note that just because you get a little line you can continue next slide alright and then this is just contact information for the SBA lots of information but know that you can go to s da da da V and there loads of information information for small business about the coronavirus about how you can help your employees and your customers so let me stop there and I think I know we've got a lot of questions the answers thank you both thanks so much again thanks to everyone for joining us again we have almost a thousand people on this call so hopefully this information is helpful before we go to questions I want attention a couple of things and I apologize that phone ring was me before I could unmute the phone but we're all working remotely so these are some of the challenges we face but many people ask are asking us what i qualifies as an essential business under the governor's stay at home order and just be clear this is something that is established by the state it's not a federal determination so I refer I would refer people to the governor's office you can read the full text of his executive order at online just google Illinois governor executive order and it's the first thing that pulls up and you get can get more specific guidance second many of you asked about guidance on on how the Illinois state tax provisions related to covert apply to you this is also a state level determination but I'm working with the office of governor to provide guidance and we'll send out to our small business newsletter or with our small business newsletter as soon as we get more information third many of asked if the self-employed are eligible for these loans I think broad mention touched on that but self-employed are eligible and finally many of you have asked whether you should reduce hours to keep employees on the payroll or if you should furlough them so that they can qualify for unemployment insurance fundamentally that's a decision each of you individually are going to have to make but I can say that the family first provirus response act included significant resources for state unemployment programs and we're looking at that exact question as we craft the next emergency bills I have I said the text of the House version just you know a bit ago it's 1,400 pages so it will be a late night for me reading that but with that let me go to our first question and please know that we will be saving this webinar online so if you want to go back and use a resource or share with others there will be like so so thank you then oh and I guess I forgot to mention there is a state website by now most people I should have memorized it coronavirus Illinois gov for general information anyway the question many people have asked us is I'll just read it I want to know what assistance there is to keep my employees on payroll how can I continue to pay for their benefits disaster loans can be used towards working capital like payroll and benefits as far as the next round of this stimulus package we're actively looking at other assistance in the next stimulus in the meantime I think you should look at the Illinois information on unemployment the second package that FF CRA included expanded eligibility for workers took workers who might be furloughed or have reduced hours beau Mitch do any of you want to add anything yeah lemons are appropriate for that you used to keep a role and benefits going and I would also encourage if you're trying to make going through that decision-making process is to reach out to organizations like Mitch's to get assistance because they can help you think through the various options that you've got in play great thank you we've got a number of questions I think Bo I'm gonna throw this from you as well our 501 C 3 eligible can you talk about what makes certain 501 C 3 eligible versus others that are ineligible sure thank you so this answer me not be totally satisfying the standard operating procedure basically the rules that cover the program are fairly limited in their description of what comprises ineligible versus ineligible and T except for except for outlining basically the the following that basically most not probably most private nonprofits are eligible so you say private versus public you know there are like like nonprofits that basically the entities so those would be ineligible but talk about the other areas where we have ineligible nonprofit religious organizations charitable organizations but that's really the description in a nutshell is what it has in the SOP we're working to get better definition on that through our disaster assistance program my what I would encourage is if you don't follow under those two ineligible entities would be to you apply like I mentioned the process for application isn't that owners and I'd rather have you apply and qualified and tell you not to apply and then you may have qualified but you never actually through the process so sorry for that satisfying answer but basically that's the information that we have right now all right great thanks both and just remind people a lot of these questions we had over 20 questions that came in on the registration process so we're taking some of those from there I've got a question from Janine and Liberty Bell are there prioritization set up for certain types of companies for getting resources first or is it the first come first serve my understanding Janine is that all applications are going to be reviewed there's no caps based on state the cap is the maximum two million dollars per low but the states have access to money not not on any priority basis though I don't you have any thoughts on it yeah so it is a first-in first-out process when you can what we're seeing right now is that once an application is submitted about 21 days for the decision to be made and then to another seven to nine days to have dispersement so you're looking on average about 30 days for the application process so that's again why we encourage you know get your application in as soon as possible get you in the queue as soon as possible to hopefully reach that end destination and distortion of funds great and one of the things we are trying to do with subsequent legislation is find ways to accelerate the process to get money out we're very much aware that the needs are immediate so we're all gonna be working out as best as it can Mitch is there anything yes bbc's can do to provide assistance in the in the loan application process certainly you know when businesses or the owners of businesses are applying for the loan make that kind of question they're not sure what the question is asking we could help them through that we're learning as we go here of course but it's not that we're able work will answer those kinds of questions and again if there's any kind of a challenge getting into the website we'd like to know about that because we want to report that to make sure that it gets fixed I think you and I actually did get a call from one of our Township supervisors that they had some people having trouble getting in they try to get in there there is a note on the website as you might expect traffic is is high on the website so so keep trying we've gotten several questions again multiple asking similar questions are self-employed individuals eligible what about those in service and contractors the short answer is yes self-employed are eligible for the disaster loans Bo you can elaborate if there's more to it than that you know I think you okay as far as you know you are sorts of things which are to the program just ongoing operational needs so again I think most individual self-employed are going to be eligible if they have those kinds of expenses that they have to pay keep in operation great thank you and in BO I'm going to stay with you the next question is from Bridget who's online can I apply for an SBA loan and unemployment insurance at the same time that is a you know I would have to find that out I'll have to do some more as well so that another online question from Jessie if I owe federal back taxes how does that affect my ability to get miss be able sure so having back taxes doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to be ineligible for an SBA disaster loan the key here is I think the processing centers going to look at is are you on like a payment schedule or some other kind of agreement with the IRS to pay those back taxes and if you are then then certainly you know the process and we'll look at the other aspects of your application and that won't be a reason for disqualification great thank you I'm gonna put three together Sophie in Libertyville said I have an SBA 504 loan through a bank we used to purchase our building does that affect our eligibility for other SBA loans sandy in Highland Park if I already happiness to be alone can I get more funds extend my terms Missy I also choose online said are there loan are these loans only for people who cannot you secure credit elsewhere my understanding is that these disaster loans to be taken out irrespective of your other SBA loans is that correct though that is right yes sir great I like these straightforward answers Leslie is asking can you provide information about deferring our SBA business loan during this crisis Mitch Bo can you touch on that as far about as far as deferring other loans sure so from a SBA perspective for SBA guarantee loans the lender your lender your direct lender has the unilateral authority to defer the payments on those loans up to six months without even coming to the SBA to ask for additional deferment now that's gonna be the relationship between that business owner in their banks so you'll want to talk to your banker and talk to them about what options they can offer as far as deferment I'm here a lot of banks are working on deferment with their clients so there's definitely that conversation happening in the banking community yeah Mitch you have anything man that only that if you will do get a disaster assistance loan that you don't have to pay the first payment for an entire year so you do have a little time right and I know that in all of our discussions in the house we are looking at ways to help people with with those deferrals of operating loans as well as mortgages Kirsten in Hyde Park has a question I'm only my third year starting up are there restrictions on how long your business must be operating I'm gonna match this with Kevin from Grayslake my challenge with the disaster loan program is that I have just completed my first fiscal year and this is the first year that I will file for taxes I have no history and you're one as planned show to lost so I know we're aware that though Mitch can you touch on it specifically how that's been handled by the SBA sure so from the standpoint of minimum time in business looking for is showing some kind of you know history so even if you haven't filed your taxes that first time you're still showing like a revenue and revenue history and that's what we're gonna look for so even if you've only been in business six months you know the first five or six months you were you know showing thousand dollars and then the next month you should five hundred the virus impact that would be the kind of thing that we do looking for we look for that profit and loss and that dollars she as far as persons question no there's there's no minimum time just that he's got to be able to show some kind of Revenue history to demonstrate you know that force impact number one but also that over time you'll have a sufficient sufficient revenue make repayment conic great going that the next one Paul online what about a web based business actually just good question I'm registered in Illinois but we do not have a physical office what is the definer I know the language in the bill says operating in the state so that people aren't crossing state lines but what about a web-based business how will that work well can you help with that sure so it's based on your your business headquarters is have a physical address for your your primary business location so you would apply for the disaster loan through whatever County your your business is registered in in Illinois got it and Mitch I'm at you know you're talking a lot of different types of business are there other business models that could be similar similarly structured that won't fit the traditional definitions similarly structured I'm not sure I'm from what I say like so a web-based business the consumers I fight I don't have a web-based business I'm in the Illinois but I don't have a physical office yeah other types of businesses that I should be thinking of in that context as well not that I can think of right now going the next question Matt online his question is how do you determine capital loss our business has a lag in accounts receivable so we won't show an immediate loss for some time it's a fair point bow Mitch any specific guidance for our business who was you know doing accrual accounting is going to show that they've incurred a loss knowing that their customers aren't in a position to pay them yes so from my perspective I can totally get the challenge there I would recommend looking at projections also and having those available as you're working with the loan processor so they can understand the perspective on what that's likely to to look like downstream I'd also say that what I'm hearing from a lot of businesses is they're just anticipating that their their AR aging receivable aging is really gonna grow it's starting to grow already and so you know in that regard when you're starting to not show payment by those customers you want to be able to demonstrate that as well okay I'll have to follow up to that though because you know it may be that my AR line looks good but I'm seeing a significant drop on the top-line sales would that be sufficient to establish anticipated capital losses yes so thank you for that yeah so that's part of the additional information is looking at monthly sales numbers and we'll take a look at that as well as part of the process great thanks moving up to our Keegan Brett asked will real estate property management companies be eligible for SBA loans I anticipate loss of a lot of revenue as property owners look to take their property management in-house I think that would make sense it's eligible but though I'll defer to you as well I don't see any reason why they wouldn't be eligible yeah yeah again I think it's just making the case that you're going to have losses it's going to be the hit on the top-line the loss of or extended aging on receivables things like that that you guys are looking for is that fair yes mm-hmm okay great Tom and Ann honey Park and Richard in Downers Grove have a question how does the paid leave legislation apply to employers with fewer than 50 employees can I apply for an exemption for the emergency paid leave provisions so briefly the legislation allows the Secretary of Labor to exclude businesses and 50 employees we're looking to provide further guidance on this in the coming days again this is a chance for me to plug the newsletter and get websites Niehaus gov but we'll be getting out that information as soon as we have it but the legislation says the secretary can accept businesses that he has that he has the authority I don't know if Mitch or BOE you want to add anything to that I do not mean either okay next question is from around Lake Terrence asks can an owner we financed his property through the money that became available to do SBA announcements I don't believe refinancing are eligible for the emergency funds but beau clarify that with you that's correct you can't refi other program great all right thank you princess was online asked what a home-based childcare business be eligible they should be its falls in the classification of businesses with the history and application information is that correct beau yes that's right great Patty's creditworthiness based on personal credit history or of the business how do those two interplay I'll leave that to Mitch and Beau sure so you can give us avid this so typically for most small businesses the credit worthiness is based primarily on the personal credit history of the individual because there's not a lot of differentiation between the individual and their business but that will be on a case-by-case basis niche I'll let you weigh in on this too because you give us a lot now that's exactly the way I understand it your personal credit small business person is pretty much one the same how you the amount of credit you build in your business or the way that you build it is going to affect your personal credit score that's what they're going to look at great thank you the next question is from Maria what other resources are out there for nonprofits I know I assume I'm close to much they can access the guidance from score but what other sba resources are there for nonprofits yeah certainly score can help with not-for-profits and I just saw something United Way put out that might be doing something with not-for-profits but I can't be a hundred percent sure on that that's about all I can think of is those two things okay bow or their other SPM products people should be aware of mostly we're focused on small businesses so this is one of the few the entry disaster loan program is one of the few programs through SBA okay so Jason's the the next question Oh what type of collateral are you looking for if all business assets are collateralized by our current financial institution lender what would be available to using collateral in this case from perspective we definitely take a second position collateral is there you know ultimately we'll take we prefer property like real estate as collateral understand that it right might not be available we'll take inventory as collateral but ultimately if you don't have collateral that's not a reason why you'd be denied through the process so generally the way SBA purchases if there is collateral we'll take a position on it but if there isn't collateral then you know that's kind of what we're there for is to be that lender that our support lending to businesses have access to sufficient collateral all right and I just go back to the prior question one of my people on my team just sent me a note for nonprofits in Illinois there's a group called forefront used to be Illinois donor forum said that might be a resource to turn to their websites my forefront my fo re fr om T org so just didn't want to not share that with you moving that to Thomas in Glenview he asked can employees who had their hours reduced from 40 to 20 hours per week collect parcel employment benefits I think it touched on this earlier it really is the Illinois Department of Employment Services that have the resources and there are shipping resources on work share agreements in Illinois I know within the conversations we're having around legislative assistance we can provide we are definitely talking about this but ultimately one of the mechanisms for the federal government to get money to people quickly as to the state of nature its programs and that those reached ministered by by the state moving on to dawn how how do we list lost revenue for these months some clients have canceled or others order or sometimes postponed under later in the year but in meantime there is zero revenue so I guess the question Bo is drawing a distinction if there is one between canceled and delayed how do you how do you have a lap so when you go through the application process there's a notes field where you can go ahead and put in projected revenue losses looking forward it's what's gonna happen is there's the first part is they're going to look at the required documentation and then as they have questions about understanding what lost revenue is going to be or information about cancelled orders other documentation that's where they'll come back and ask for additional information like the monthly sales the register of monthly sales and things like that so that they can have a clear picture of the impacts to your business great thank you again I mentioned this before but we're seeing several other people asking this question people have tried applying online and website is slower crashing do you have any guidance again the guidance that we received is the non peak hours are the evening for what it's worth the website is open 24 hours and so after 7:00 p.m. or before 7 a.m. maybe better but again it's just so many people applying so all just for that the next question Michael says I live in Illinois but I have a small business in Indiana how would that work Illinois versus Indiana I know that both states have been declared eligible for the program so hopefully that works but is there from the application process though applying Indiana or applying Illinois if a business is located basically you know whether you have the business license or if it's a corporation wherever it's incorporated that's where you would apply for the disaster declaration so if it is Indiana you'd want to do it there or if you went through that process with this secretary state here in Illinois you would you would apply for the declaration in Illinois got it all right the next question is an interesting variation on something I've already talked about but Debra says my business is exist for two years but we just hired our first employee starting January this year how do you show the need to pay and keep these new employees to the SBA sure so that would be in the notes preformed in the application I would recommend that you include information about the costs and the impact of those costs on your on your business and the expenses that you have so the person who's reviewing your application understands clearly the whole totality of your business situation I'd say that's for a really anybody who's submitting an application there's always going to be something that isn't as captured in the with the standard documentation and I think it benefits each of you to be as clear in describing this situation and why you're suffering adverse economic impact you the corona by coronavirus I great thank you the next question from patty McKeon all these have been great questions again thanks to everyone for submitting she asked her personal finances assets at risk when you apply for SBA loans potentially losing business is hard not for putting your all in retirement plan as collateral seems frightening in these circumstances so what do you say to these folks so yes PA does ask for personal guarantee meaning that you're guaranteeing personal assets to back up whatever loan you're taking so yes there's certainly a risk there and that's fine yeah I know that we'll take a look at you know like real estate through the personal guarantee I'm not sure I don't believe a retirement plan is it's a resource for that they don't have to find out no get back to your office congressman on that one great and Patty what I'll say and I've been pushing very hard for this now going back which seems like years ago but left the last three weeks and certainly the last ten days is that the things that we do for small businesses should be non-recourse loans and I push number two things that it's not requiring that personal guaranteed to bridge you through this time because our goal is that you stay in business that everyone stays in business that we navigate this what is unprecedented moment but when we come out of it we can stand up our businesses and rebuild our economy so that's the key thing the other thing just so people know is that purchasing for is that these emergency loans should be very low ideally zero interest loans as we going to business because our objective is to keep you viable and have you they give you the ability to keep your employees in a position to pay for the basic staples of food and medicine keep a roof over their head etc so I know we're getting towards the five minutes a warning so maybe we have time for a couple more questions Edward online asked I've already started the application but there's not a place to request how much you need and interim financials when does that happen in the process so my understanding the process is that you should be there should be a place for you so you can type in in a free-form field some of the other information that you would like to share as far as the interim financials and all that that will happen in the second phase where after you've submitted underwriters says okay let's say they don't 2018 or 2019 tax return business tax return I need that or I need the the profit loss in the balance sheet so then they'll reach out to you and ask for additional information so that's why I recommend that you have all the additional documents available and probably just this practice have three years of your returns if you've been in business that long or personal ham business so that you can have that at the ready when the processor comes to ask you for more information got it and the last question we have time for and again I want to thank everyone for joining us we had as I mentioned close to a thousand people on this call Monica asked so we also wait to see what's being released from the stimulus package or apply for the emergency loan now and see what happens I'll share my thought first is I would apply now everything is changing so quickly but I would apply now and wait what happens but definitely get that application in bow out if you ever thought [ __ ] this is meant agree with that because it is as both said it's a first-in first-out processing of the loan so don't wait and the other thing that I just mentioned that I completely agree congressman image on that even if you are approved for long you don't have to take it so if there's a better situation that better fits your needs that you identified downstream no no harm no foul yeah you took some time to do the application but you know you had that in your back in case you need it you're not obligated great point in that that is worth repeating is if you apply for the loan and you find you don't need it you are not obligated to take it so thank you mitt BOE anything we forgot anything that people should keep in mind going forward and how can folks follow up with additional questions for the SBA or for the SBDC sure so just thanks again congressman for having us on we are here for you as you're going through this we're learning a lot as we go through this process as well if you have additional questions you can reach us Delta was an Oscar SBA that govt so we look forward to serving you and thank you today great Mitch any less thought just make sure to let us know how it's going as you're applying if you are experiencing problems we want to know about it obviously congressman already said that the websites a little bogged down so you don't necessarily need to report that one in particular but if you have questions about how you should answer certain parts of the application you're just stuck on please let us know we don't have the answer we'll find it and get back to you

thank you very much I want to thank the gentlelady for yielding but also for your tremendous leadership on this and so many issues Mack fries in strong opposition to HR 3495 the so-called women's Public Health and Safety Act first of all this bill does not keep women safe and it certainly won't keep them healthy instead it would prevent individuals and hunger or organizations that provide abortion services from treating women and rolled in Medicaid and it would simply strip women of their fundamental right to choose their own health provider by Congress already denies federal Medicaid coverage of abortions which is wrong and that needs to be repealed that's the Hyatt amendment we've got to repeal that now excluding doctors from serving Medicaid patients is yet another attack on the rights of low-income women when in the world are you going to stop HR 3495 would deny more than seven million women access to critical health care services including contraceptive care STI tests life-saving cancer screenings and other primary care services and it would hurt our most vulnerable communities including low-income women and women of color madam speaker this bill is simply wrong it is nothing more than a shameful attempt to excuse me to restrict women's constitutional rights politicians should never interfere with women with women's personal health care decisions period stay out of our lives this woman's Public Health and Safety Act or Public Safety and Health Act it does just the opposite of what this bogus title says it erodes the health and safety of women it continues their war on women and I tell you today I stand with Planned Parenthood I'm proud to stand with Planned Parenthood and the men women and children in our country I urge a no vote on this bill that will severely hurt the health and safety of women

hi I'm congressman Ami Bera or actually in this case i'm dr. Ami Bera the Supreme Court is going to be hearing a case on Texas a Texas law that could dramatically impact a woman's access to health care I hope the Supreme Court does the right thing because as a doctor access to health care is critical and access to full health care and full reproductive options is critical for every woman in America now that those I took as a doctor is to sit with my patients answer their questions but doesn't let them make the healthcare decisions that impact their lives so i hope the Supreme Court does the right thing and gets out of the exam room just as Congress should get out of the exam room and leave this to a doctor in their patients

with that let's bring in Senator Bill Cassidy who sits on the Senate finance committee the Senate joint economic committee so it's great to have you on because of those committees that you sit on we know you know what you're talking about before we get to your thoughts on this bill can you just give us a timeline on when it might pass and what today is going to look like on the senate floor yeah so we have a voter nominations at 12 30 basically to get people there then we start voting on this bill at two uh it'll probably go early in the morning I imagine like 3 A.M so we'll be wrapped up by early tomorrow morning Senator is there any reason to believe this bill won't pass the Senate of the house and get signed into law well it's going to pass by the way it's going to pass the Senate they wouldn't bring it up if they didn't have the votes there's enough sweetheart deals in there to make people comfortable that their particular interest is taken care of if you're on the left side of the aisle on the house it's a different story over August the American people have a chance to speak to their elective representative and if she or he is a Democrat you can remind them that you're voting for are against them in November and you're concern this will raise inflation even more now if you do that they only have to lose two or three or four of those house members and it fails on the house side I would have to thank Senator one of the compelling arguments inflation is one side of the coin the other is all the money going to the IRS and we just saw a chart on who can expect potential audits it isn't they're rich who just made out with the carried interest tax loophole being saved in this bill it's as you can see on your screen right now it's people look at that under twenty five thousand dollars under fifty thousand dollars under seventy five thousand dollars this has got to be something everyone pays attention to the tax man cometh and he come for you and me so uh clearly if they're going to shake that much money on the American people it's going to touch everybody let's just speak about that a little bit more they're using that extra funding for IRS to say that they have a an additional net 120 billion or so in savings but but the CBO in the past has always said that's not true it's an accounting gimmick that that if you say you're going to do it it doesn't materialize now if they say they're saving 300 billion and that's oh my gosh the Fig leaf that they put forward we're going to lower the deficit over 10 years by the way kind of a rounding error in our nation's economy but 120 billion is coming from something the CBO is going to say not really guys you're trying to pull a fast one on the American people it further calls into question any rationale they have that this will lower inflation let's move on to this Senator Taiwan says you know these Chinese warships warplanes and ships are conducting attack simulation exercises and we're learning this as the Pentagon Chief's calls to China are now going unanswered we have some Intel sources that are telling Fox News that China could attack Taiwan before the 2024 election and the reason they would do that is because they would want to get it done when President Biden is still in office do you think that timeline is accurate what are your thoughts on that I think anyone guessing the motivations of the Chinese is guessing into a black box Gigi ping is in trouble he's mismanaged their economy they're actually shrinking if you can believe it they haven't for a long time people are sick of being locked down and whenever he unlocks they have so little natural immunity and their vaccine doesn't work that a lot of old people die so I think he's doing this to kind of rally the base if you will so that he can get reelected I wouldn't be surprised if they're floating rumors like that all I can say is that we have to inject strength China takes advantage of weakness whatever we do we cannot appear intimidated I would think we want to project smart strength you know I'm wondering and I don't know if you can have the answer for this but why did Nancy Pelosi go to Taiwan The Fallout now is obvious that part is undeniable as Carly pointed out the Chinese aren't returning the calls to our Pentagon they've cut themselves out of a climate change deal which I thought was at the center of the democratic agenda they're going to stop regulating fentanyl I don't know if they ever were before coming into the United States they're cutting off and ramping up their aggression right now so what did we get out of it what did we get out of Nancy Pelosi's trip I don't know we got out of Nancy Pelosi's trip but I think we're getting a lot out of what China is doing it shows the vulnerability of our economy and our people to what Chinese actions are and we need to have a coherent strategy going forward that punishes China for the things they're doing just as normal course if they're allowing the chemicals to come to Mexico to make the fentanyl which is coming across our border by the way we had a hundred thousand Americans die from overdose last year or if they're allowing pollution to enter into the atmosphere which floats over to the United States on the trade winds then we have to put a tariff in place for the pollution that they're putting up into the atmosphere we need to have a coherent strategy which pushes back but when China is doing as a normal course of action Senator last week Republicans took a PR hit what looked like they were blocking the packed act to get votes on three amendments that didn't pass anyway but now President Biden's postponed the signing of this bill by a week if you heard Jon Stewart last week you all are the devil incarnate for not voting this the first time why is Biden taking another week to pass to sign into law and get this going because they're more interested in marketing than they are in governance yeah he's more interested in having a Rose Garden ceremony then oh my gosh we've got to get this right out the door it's a good bill in the sense that we've taken care of veterans who had burn pit problems I'm a doctor I understand those issues we tried to make it better that would make it more fiscally accountable but the Democrats didn't want that on the the other hand they are more interested in marketing than in governance and the president is showing that by this decision I hope you guys get in front of the pr side of it because I want veterans to know that Congress has our back not just Democrats not just Republicans in the hope that uh the next bills that come through uh may be a little cleaner and uh fiscally and and getting voted on so I don't have to watch Jon Stewart pretend to care more than maybe I think he does Senator Cassidy thank you so much for joining us this morning it's going to be a long one for you we appreciate it that's okay thank you

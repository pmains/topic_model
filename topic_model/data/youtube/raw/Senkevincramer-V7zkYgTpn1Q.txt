welcome to no apologies I'm Beck I'm your host Lori hinz with me this evening in studio very pleased to have our esteemed senator from North Dakota Kevin Kramer is with us and joins us that's you know this is no I'm pretty I'm pretty excited about having you here in studio I think it's only like a couple of times that I've had you on the program and it just worked out well over the weekend it did and I always like going in studio if I can Skype works or Zoom or whatever but not as well as this exactly well I we have so much to talk about Kevin the um and I can can I call you Senator Kramer can I call you Kevin I've known you just don't call me a steamed anymore but otherwise Kevin all right all right well The Honorable Senator Kevin Kramer here we can talk about China a little bit you have been very vocal and rightly so and I'm so grateful and speaking for the rest of the north dakotans we are very grateful for you being vociferous in your in adamant about your feelings about China and decoupling can we talk about sheet coupling and what that means and how do we decouple from we're so intertwined I've shopped for clothes and I look at the label and I'm like sorry not gonna buy that it's from China yeah no it's a great point and this is why I say strategically decoupler strategic decoupling from China it's actually a term of art that I didn't invent um my friend Bob leidheiser you might recall Robert lydeiser he actually negotiated the U.S China trade deal in the Trump Administration and he was the U.S trade representative and that's his term and he and I have talked a lot about strategic decoupling from China and um that's why it's it's obviously a process a long process but it starts with a mindset and I think we're there Lori I think finally right finally and in many respects what happened with fufang and Grand Forks while a painful experience for a lot of Us in North Dakota and certainly for the people of Grand Forks I think became the symbol that told the rest of the country it's okay it's okay to start thinking about alternatives to Chinese stuff and just to say no and just say no just say no it and then of course um the Spy balloon right at the very time because that was really weird I'd love to take credit but I'm not nearly that smart nor am I I know now the foofing project was finally stopped with the U.S Air Force uh weighing in now my question to you is um they weighed in but it was very milk toast it was very generic in in language yeah it's interesting because for a long time for a year I kept hearing from the Kim Community leaders in Grand Forks we need something actionable and what actionable meant to me was they wanted somebody evidently in some position of authority to give them data or information that would allow them out of a contractual agreement the Air Force didn't do that in fact all the Air Force really just stated their emphatic opposition not even opposition they just said it would be a significant security risk but this wasn't a new message Lori first of all this is intuitive to most people right like a lot of Grand Forks like a lot of Grand Forks people God bless them first but um they raised the alarm they sounded the alarm but even beyond that remember um the the Air Force is a is a citizen of Grand Forks in many respects they're partners with ground force they they're a stakeholder they're you know that's their family in many respects and they didn't want to do anything that would embarrass the community of Grand Forks and I think they gave the city leaders multiple opportunities to back out of it gracefully and and eventually they couldn't anymore they just had to put it on the line with this this significant point but they still didn't provide anything quote actions what they just presented was their opinion which wasn't a new opinion and I can point to lots of examples but one that's probably the most prominent to me was early last year maybe Springtime last year sometime in the standard armed services Committee hearing of course I'm on the committee my colleague and friend Tom Cotton who's very senior on the committee I you know asked the chief of staff of the Air Force General Brown CQ Brown about foofing and his response was crystal clear I I'd rather discuss that with you in a in a secure setting yes now that hardly speaks um gee this would be a swell idea why don't you go ahead and do it that's not the message you get from that and so it's always sort of bothered me that for a year the city waited for somebody else to make a decision for them and I the only conclusion I could really draw from all of it was that the the decision they wanted was for somebody to say it's okay to do it and you notice with all the Nuance no one ever said that right even even when when General atomics wrote a letter similar to the to the Air Forces General atomics are very important corporate citizen defense contractor you know renting space at at the uh at Grand Forks right makes this very strong position known and right away the community started getting suspicious about how did that come to be and and general atomics I I helped get General Thomas to God force in fact I was very instrumental in getting General Thompson that sort of bothered me to think that they were given so little regard in that letter so anyway the good news is we're where we are now now in addition to this 370 Acres which is now still owned by foofing still owned um we're thinking now in terms of North Dakota Economic Development yes about an American company or perhaps a friendly foreign if it's a friendly yeah yeah so it's a great point because I think it speaks to a even the broader U.S Alliance issue at a time when we're looking at these um you know pacing threats like China and these imminent threats like Russia possible threats like North Korea and Iran we need to start aligning ourselves with with countries that have that share our values as opposed to thinking we're going to win over countries who don't share our values and so um I think in the case of Grand Forks and those 370 Acres this is a wonderful opportunity once again for North Dakota to demonstrate we can work with not not just America only America First doesn't mean necessarily America but at least with people who share our values I love that America First not America only I'm going to remember that and use that and steal it um we are a true model in Grand Forks for the rest of the country they can look at if you see something say something they always say yeah well they did for a year and and truthfully that that is what more communities probably need to do open their eyes be aware of what they see and then say something about it you know it's pretty amazing Lori really when you look at those people how quickly they rose up how strong their voices were how United not a few not dozens not hundreds but thousands of them were and and that's the first mystery to me is how you miss that cue in politics it particularly local politics and um I don't know some of the some of the city council members were saying there were just 12 people who would show up all the time that was the quote those five thousand signatures would be hard for me to ignore I know that but even that said to the point of the model I I think you're exactly right and I think Americans all over our country are looking at that and they're looking at other instances we're peaceful but passionate protest is an appropriate form of regress of of of getting your message across when the people you've elected don't seem to be listening or representing now at the same time I think it's really important for people to understand that there are there's a lot of Divergent views out there about the Grand Forks Coalition was it was made of completely Divergent views there were you know people who are economy people there are people who are environmental people there are people who are water people you know all of these different people and they coalesced and came together with a common gold I don't know protect the country well common common opposition is oftentimes a great way to Rally people to get and unify people that's exactly right and and I think that China's situation is one of those things that our country could rally caught against but we also have to find out what we're for to to counter because if we strategically decouple from China we we still have to buy stuff somewhere and we still have to sell stuff somewhere we just need to look for different alliances welcome back to no apologies I am Laura hins your host and in studio with me is Senator Kevin Kramer of North Dakota the junior Senator just remember that and when you think that you're old you're okay or honorable I could say that too there are so many interesting things to talk about and I was really struggling with what to speak because I of course wanted to talk to you about foofing which we did in the last segment but there are so many things going on nationally um the weakness that our country is showing right now with the administration is terrifying to me and it must be far more horrible for you who gets the Intel and the skiff briefings because I can't even fathom the type of things that you're probably hearing you know it's interesting Lori the advantage of getting classified briefings is you see what's really going on in the military apart from the politics of it uh to me I think the worst harm that's been done in the last several months with regard to to International Affairs to National Defense isn't even the spy balloon's ability to spy on this what what's most concerning is that the the Chinese felt bold enough to do it right right and the reaction and the reaction is so slow and that's what they're watching that's what they're watching so people should find assurances and knowing that our intelligence Community knew about the program saw the balloon from its takeoff and then that our North com military side as it was coming our way what's concerning is that the intelligence community and then and the military weren't communicating across political lines and that's something we've got to fix we have got to work on that the other thing though the biggest problem was to your point was the poor reaction politically by the White House especially and and the reputational harm that does to us on the global stage is far worse than any pictures that the Chinese might have gotten of a nice BM Silo because there are 450 of them they're not exactly in Secret locations so I I doubt it gleaned much particularly knowing there was coming in our Direction things were pretty well locked down shut down they likely didn't get much Intel in fact we likely get more from from knowing it was there but that said the harm is to our reputation which is not insignificant because our deterrence is the deterrence of other nations is largely based on our reputation 100 I I know that I just came a couple weeks ago from the Reagan library and peace through strength was everywhere I mean everywhere in that Library were quotes that just got me in the field I have to tell you and and the truth of the matter is is that you know that once you have that reputational damage you know that people are emboldened and it feels like China is emboldened well I think you've said it all right there and you know it's interesting China has had the luxury of patients something that a totalitarian government has something we don't necessarily have we we live in two four six year tranches right and that's that's clumsy but I wouldn't trade for anything that said their patients over the last 30 years to build slowly to to dominate slowly to take advantage of our free and open system in many respects um has been their strength but we're to a point now where any sign of overt weakness could become that moment literally when you talk to people in in the Pacific particularly whether it's other countries or our military in indo-pacific Comm they'll tell you that what they do every day is they wake up and think this is not the day this is not the day well um I have a I want to kind of switch gears a little bit too is this from a May 31st 2018 video uh it is the center for strategic and International Studies or csis they hosted a discussion on a congressional bill that would expand the committee and for recipients which we are familiar with now because of the foofing thing and uh the cipius is of course that government agency that reviews the potential for an investment and the clip they there was a gentleman who asked a question during this this uh discussion panel I want you to listen to the clip and react to okay let's run it one of the things that we run across is the fact that when we go to look and see who the investors are the limited partners in a venture capital structure uh they're not required to be disclosed right the SEC doesn't require because it's not a registered investment company that they disclose and you know uh the investors behind it usually they do but in 23 percent of cases at least that I've been able to find there's it's an undisclosed investor if you go through pitchbook anywhere else very difficult to locate and in fact the SEC isn't even collecting that data so if I'm going to look for non-notified cases in the VC world I'm already missing a quarter well about a quarter of the of the Investments uh I don't see anything in the current bill that does anything to close that loophole I guess it's something that would be addressed through the SEC so I'm wondering of course now how do we close that loophole because if a quarter of them are getting through this is a huge problem so we actually did pass legislation then it had I anticipated this I would have gotten the exact name of the legislation we did pass legislation in a couple of years after that oh good um that because I'm on the Banking Committee and so so the question is exactly right there are there were Chinese companies particularly who trade on American boards it's right in the in the in the uh on our exchanges but who are not subject to the same auditing standards that American companies are including this disclosure of ownership we changed that a couple of years ago maybe a year ago even um maybe just a couple years it doesn't matter and and we did tighten that up but to this point this is again gets back to foofing a little bit remember it was not didn't take a lot of due diligence to identify that the chairman of fufang was a not just a member but an activist member a an honored member of the Chinese Communist party I've seen further Intel on the rest of the board that should be made public and I wish it could be quite honestly because I think that would settle it for a lot of people much earlier so interesting well thank you for that answer to the military Readiness in my view has been hampered by things like CRT they're having trouble right now recruiting people for the military and I think it all stems from Biden's reaction when you have a leader who is feckless and hapless and dangerous why would you even enlist so now we're in a situation where we're struggling we we're depleted because of mandates we were depleted because of the CRT thing where are we going forward with our military well there's no question question that the wokeness of this Administration has been the deterrent for people for patriotic Americans some perhaps some of the most patriotic Americans because it's that Spirit of Independence and it's it's their their personal the personal value that they think they bring to the fight that attracts them to the fight and when you're saying no we don't want that um and and you're prioritizing over lethality things like genders or pronouns or whether you will get a vaccination or not an untested vaccination or not really really violates the principles of the very people we want in the military now having said that Lori it's really important to point out that there are a lot of really good people in the military still a lot of really good ones but we have a shortage and we should not be looking for ways to to prune our military we need to be looking for ways to attract more people to our military oh I absolutely agree with that too uh there are so many other things that I want to talk to you about in one minute here and things like I would like to talk about natural gas pipelines I want to talk to you about radioactive waste in North Dakota there's so many things that are going on um one minute left here give me your view of where we are going as a state right sure so there are a number of things pipelines are an important one right there's there's a combination of federal and state oversight in various pipelines the thing we're probably watching the most closely is people is is private property rights you mentioned that as it relates particularly to the CO2 pipelines um because they're it's not as clear-cut as other things we need to be attentive to to all of that I think Emerald domain which is the Boogeyman and all of this should be the last thing ever used if if ever used I never in any pipeline that I've ever cited as a Public Service Commission did we ever have to have it any not an inch of it including the original Keystone Pipeline never had to be condemned and we need to get back to that and find more strategic ways to move important resources to the market without violating people's personal rights fantastic as always thank you very much yeah we appreciate your Insight on this program and we'll have you back when you're in town again well let's do it [Applause]

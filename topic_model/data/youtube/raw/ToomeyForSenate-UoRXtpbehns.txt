well the campaign is off to a terrific start more than a start we're well underway and our momentum's just growing every day i'm thrilled with the support that we've got all across the commonwealth and that support itself is growing every day you know i think more and more pennsylvanians are becoming really disturbed and very worried about what they see happening in washington endless bailouts staggering amount of spending and debt on our kids that is just absolutely unaffordable and now this effort to take over health care it's just way too much sometimes this happens when one party takes control of government and they let the extreme liberal left wing of their party control the agenda well i'm delighted with the support i've had for my message of pushing back ending the bailouts getting spending under control remembering that our jobs job creation should be priority number one and that'll come from a free enterprise system and not if we continue to put ever more burdens so our our messages is resonating our our support is growing but we certainly need to do more we need to do more every day and we need more fundraising we've got a big effort underway right now to bring in 2010 new contributors before the beginning of 2010 and so i would just ask you to please make any contribution that you can as soon as you can the clock is running down and we're getting to the end of the year it's going to be a good strong quarter for us in fundraising if you'll help us get there so i'm very grateful for your past support and please encourage others to join this effort help our campaign and take back our government thanks very much you

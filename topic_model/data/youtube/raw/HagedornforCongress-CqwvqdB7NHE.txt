Oh President Trump is touting those new jobs numbers on Twitter and the strong economy also came up in his rally yesterday in Rochester Minnesota where he threw his weight into one of the most hotly contested congressional races in the country it's for an open seat in Minnesota's first well the president is hoping that that surprise is at the Republican Jim Hagedorn wins he's facing the Democrat Dan Fein both are vying to fill a seat left open by Democratic Representative Tim Walz who's running for governor so that district is where we turn for this week's district profile catherine richard is senior reporter for Minnesota Public Radio she joins us from Rochester and Catherine Minnesota went for Hillary Clinton in 2016 but the first District went for President Trump so tell us more about the district itself well it's kind of a funny district if you look at it in the long picture it's been traditionally conservative and Republican it's very rural so there's a lot of you know smaller agricultural communities in the district outside of Rochester and Mankato which are sort of the city hubs that being said during the Obama administration Tim Walz won his re-elections pretty handily up until 2016 when he was almost defeated by Republican Jim Hagedorn and of course to the district went handily for a president Donald Trump at the time right well so let's take a look at the two candidates the Democrat Dan thean worked in the Obama administration he's an Iraq war vet a member of the Democratic farmer Labor Party which is aligned with Democrats and in this recent ad he bills himself as an independent voice in the army you can put any differences aside and come together to accomplish incredible great things and that's exactly what's needed in Congress today I'm not taking corporate PAC money so that means I owe nothing to any leader any corporation Kathryn richer tell us more about feein well I think the first thing that people should know is that he's a political newcomer you know he's never served in public office before he hasn't lived in Minnesota since he was a teenager actually and his opponents are frequently point that out so he's moved back to the district to run I think what you're hearing there is his willingness to work across the aisle which is really important in this district which you know in the best case for Democrats is a moderate district so so you hear him you know running a pretty moderate campaign and it's really an echo two of the types of campaigns that Tim Walz ran here well not of the Republican Jim Hagedorn in his recent ad he talks about growing up on a farm in Minnesota doing a lot of weeding which of course he brings to his thoughts on Washington in Washington the weeds of government are so thick President Trump can't pull him fast enough I'm running for Congress to help him uproot the system to rip out the regulations Obamacare and burdens to growth so Katherine we hear him aligning himself with President Trump what's the thought on that well he has been aligning himself with Trump's views before Trump was really even on the scene remember he's run for three times for this seat so he has been running on a very similar platform for far longer than Trump has been you know campaigning and I think that plays well with certain aspects of the district and is playing very well this time because of the fact that the district favored Donald Trump in the last election I think the things to know about Hagedorn that are interesting are that his dad actually held this seat and so he moved to Washington DC when he was a teenager and lived there for a long time and actually worked there for a long time so just like his opponent Dan Fein he has lived outside of the district for quite a while worked in various administrations worked on Capitol Hill and has more recently come back to the districts to run again these last three times so those are the two candidates Catherine I want to ask you about another thing that President Trump said last night that jumped out he really dissed former Minnesota senator Al Franken for in the president's words kind of quitting after Franken was accused of inappropriate behavior behavior that many felt was kind of minor compared to some of the other accusations we've been hearing about in the me2 movement but Franken pulled himself out of politics the president seemed to be saying he was kind of a coward for that yeah it was it was an interesting point that he made and I'm still sort of sorting through what he was getting at because on one hand and he said you know Franken was kind of a wet rag he he took responsibility for what he was doing and he left office of course under great pressure from his own party let's not forget that and this is it's being said against the backdrop of what's happening in Washington did today which is this you know big discussion about whether judge Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the Supreme Court and whether he is taking responsibility for his actions but of course keep in mind that when Franken left we you know the governor here appointed a Democrat to take his place who's now running for re-election and it's effectively opened up a potential seat for Republicans so on one hand he's criticizing it seemed Franken for leaving so quickly but on the other hand it's presented an opportunity for his party well it's fascinating but how is the whole Cavanaugh debate impacting if it is this race or is it just falling along party lines you know I think generally it's falling along party lines when I spoke to people who are waiting to get into the rally yesterday this was something I asked them about all of them said you know we want him to talk about judge Kavanagh we support judge Cavanaugh but what was sort of weird was that people said you know we believe that something bad happened to dr. Christine flossy Ford so many years ago we just don't think it was him because he doesn't seem like the type of person who would do that they called it a witch hunt they said that you know she may be misremembering who it was that attacked her so on one hand they are believing her but on the other hand they're saying there's no way that Brett Kavanaugh could have done this so there's a little bit of nuance there yeah Catherine Richards senior reporter for Minnesota Public Radio thank you so much no problem

thank you madam Speaker I thank the gentlelady for yielding and for her great leadership as our ranking member on the Appropriations Committee and for bringing us together this evening as we have been all along 200 House Democrats Democratic members 200 strong in support of the Republican number that we are voting on today tonight the unnecessary shutdown America has been enduring for 16 days comes to an end Thank You Speaker Boehner for finally allowing a majority of House members to reopen government and avoid a default that would have clearly wreaked havoc on our economic credibility and the stability of our country it is equally clear that the shutdown has already shaken some pillars of our Economic Security and growth it has jeopardized our credit rating slowed our GDP growth by 0.6 percent it has eroded consumer and investor confidence in our economy while taking twenty four billion dollars out of our economy my colleagues do you think that your recklessness was worth twenty four billion dollars to our economy this recklessness is a luxury the American people cannot afford tomorrow we can finally begin what Democrats have been waiting for for seven months to do tomorrow we can go to the negotiating table to debate a budget to create jobs jobs jobs jobs that four-letter word expand the economy strengthen the middle class and reduce the deficit in a meaningful way tomorrow we must governing from manufactured crisis to manufactured crisis and start working to find solutions so that we never again see a day when the government has been shut down and the Full Faith and Credit of the United States of America has been called into question for that reason I urge a yes vote on this bill not on its merits because as we know this number is too low it's even the chairman of the committee has said it's an unrealistic and ill-conceived number and must be brought to an end this number if left in effect would cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs in the months ahead in the next year hundreds of thousands of jobs again a number that is a luxury this country cannot afford so if the Republican number is key to reopening the doors of government and restoring confidence in our economy Democrats are willing to accept this resolution tonight but as I say not because of its merits not be for positive its merits we do so because a vote YES on this bill will take us hopefully not on its merits but in the hope that it will start us down a path to grow the economy promote the prosperity of every American was willing to work hard play by the rules to achieve the American dream and so with those qualifications as to what we are voting for tonight the number doesn't meet the needs of the American people the length of time that the debt ceiling is extended is not long enough but apparently that's the best we can do and I commend Senator Reid for working a bipartisan way to send us this bill tonight so what we bring the sadness to an end and how it is affected so many affected so many people so again not on its merits I do not come here to pin a rose on this legislation it does not have that respect but it does have my support as a means to an end and with that I urge a no yes vote and you're back the balance of my

thank you roger and i find myself in the unbelievable position of going last after session augusta group and i will resist my usual usual moderator role in in wrapping up or summarizing and i'll leave that to roger but um and i realize i'm also in between you and you're burning questions so be thinking of them while you're listening um we've heard a lot about the evolving um threat and mitigation efforts the need for innovation flexibility and nimbleness and ingenuity um partnership collective industry action and i hope i can reinforce and provide some additional thoughts on all of those um on all of those issues so good afternoon it is a pleasure to be here today and an honor to be part of this august group as i mentioned and thank you to congressman mccall and landon for their sustained and commitment sustained commitment on this issue um and uh look forward to the next week and a half of a flurry of activity here on hill tech america is an industry association for the technology history we represent approximately a thousand companies across the breadth of the technology industry including generators security providers software companies communications providers internet companies information technology providers and across small and medium large companies so we have our own version of hurricane cats we've been involved in cybersecurity policy development for over 10 years including our role to help establish the iot information sharing and analysis center and providing industry's input into the development of the national strategy to secure cyberspace and apparently subsequent other bureaucratic reports we also helped establish the sector partnership that became the i.t sector carnegie council under the nip that we've heard referenced today and we've long been working with congress on cyber security policy um and with um the clinton bush and obama administrations this issue is hugely complex and i hope that the collective brainpower experience and thinking by our member companies will be illustrated for our discussion today and the kinds of considerations that policymakers should undertake when they consider the kinds of efforts that they'll be discussing over the next week and a half last year we coalesced our position into a set of nine principles for cyber security that reflect the global nature of cyberspace the importance of partnership considering the interdependent nature of cyberspace risk-based efforts and risk management that addresses people processes and technology leveraging market forces for adoption of best practices national government collaboration and what we call cyber security for the future education training and research and development now they've given you i guess what i would call our credentials i am here to report that as a result of our leadership in cyber security policy matters our website was hit with a sustained denial of the service attack last week for which the internet disruption group anonymous has claimed credit based on our support for information sharing legislation in addition to our public statement um regarding the attack on our website we also reported uh liaison to the itis act usr and law enforcement this kind of attacks as illustrates precisely the reason for information sharing and collaboration among the industry and government to actively defend against cyber attacks in a timely manner the inability to share information is one of the greatest challenges to collective efforts to toward improving our security cyber security and critical infrastructure protection and they appreciate the efforts to remove those barriers it's not but it is not about new surveillance authority or infringement on the privacy or civil liberties we enjoy in our great democracy but it is about combining forces to defend ourselves from malicious actors in cyberspace in a way that allows for innovation and technology and tactics and flexibility and nimbleness in response to ever evolving technology technological and threats environment and it isn't only about information sharing it's also about public private partnership for improving our cybersecurity and immediate in the immediate term by working together on sustained ongoing operational basis and strategically over the long term with cyber security r d building a professional cyber security workforce and ensuring a cyber security savvy user base my four-year-old sons know how to navigate my husband's iphone and my android and i worry about their passwords it starts at home and in our schools so let me move on to public private partnership as another key component of cyber security the second principle that i mentioned is that partnership engagement is vital to cyber security that is because no one entity or sector can solve our national cyber security issues alone the private sector owns and operates most of the infrastructure on which information systems rely louder now to 90 percent we've been hearing 85 for years but we'll take 90. we have a classified briefing but thank you so much no no thank you as a partner the u.s federal government has an obligation to share specific and timely threat and commit with the private sector from which companies can manage their risk and help protect those critical systems the government and industry must leverage and improve the effectiveness of existing collaboration to address cyber risks enhance preparedness and resiliency improved trust we've been touched upon today and enable market growth last year take america department four other associations and stakeholder groups to publish a white paper another report may be less bureaucratic but still on improving our nation's execution the public private partnership the main message in the paper was that the existing public private partnership needs to be fully realized through meaningful and regular collaboration we focused on the nip framework and particularly for our sector of the it sector coordinating council we highlighted key elements that characterize an optimal partnership which are inclusion equality trust operational outcomes and the greatest good and we made recommendations for both public and private sector action in seven areas risk management incident management information sharing and privacy international engagement supply chain security which also includes standards because there is an international um standards making process in which industry is heavily engaged and so uh we encourage both uh industry and government to to participate in that process innovation and research and development and education and awareness i'm happy to address any of those in more detail or send you a link to the paper so thank you for the opportunity to join me today and i'm also happy to answer

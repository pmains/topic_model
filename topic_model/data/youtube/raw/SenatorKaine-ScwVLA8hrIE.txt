senator from Virginia as president and I'm going to try to be very brief I'm rising to return to the topic of the effort vs CRA to rollback transparency in the oil and gas industry and I'll speak briefly and oh my colleague from Arizona's here wants to speak well to the issue has been described it's an SEC rule requiring energy companies to disclose the payments they make to foreign governments for natural resources and the reason is that many countries with abundant natural resources run by dictators and there's been a long history of payments by oil companies American and others to those dictators that don't get to the people and actually further corruption of the country's just one example an IMF report stated in just one year 1998 the government of Equatorial Guinea received 130 million dollars in oil revenues and 96 million of it went directly into the personal bank account of the dictator teodoro obiang meanwhile hungry in that hunger in that country is rampant and that's what led to this I'm on the Foreign Relations Committee and in preparation for our hearing on the nomination of Rex Tillerson the former CEO of Exxon Mobil as Secretary of State i read a wonderful report that was done by senator lugar when he was the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee october two thousand eight report to members of the Foreign Relations Committee from the ranking member the title was petroleum and the poverty paradox assessing us and international efforts to fight the resource curse I read this I read the book private Empire a recent history of ExxonMobil written by journalists even call to prepare for my testimony of for my examination of Rex Tillerson for Secretary of State this particular report was the basis for the 2010 law that was described by Senator Cardin and it was sponsored in a bipartisan way it didn't prohibit any company from doing anything it only required companies that pay foreign governments to disclose those payments I voted yesterday against Rex Tillerson for secretary of state because i believe a public officials duty especially secretary state has to be to the country and i was worried based on the testimony d three areas in the testimony that Rex Tillerson could not set aside his loyalty to Exxon Mobil he refused to answer questions that I asked him about exxon mobil's knowledge of climate science yet efforts to convince the public that the science was not settled he told me he wouldn't answer my questions he did not demonstrate to the committee satisfaction in my view that he could be independent in Russia for example he said that ExxonMobil had not lobbied against sanctions against Russia when we actually had the lobbying forms to suggest that they had in both of those areas I found his response was wanting and I voted against them that mr. president I'll be honest I asked them about the resource curse question and today I kind of feel like I got snookered I said there's a lot of concern about these countries that let resource wealth go to dictators and further corruption what what are you going to do about it as a secretary of state working on development for example of some of these poor nations and he talked about high-minded values and virtues of the things the United States to do that would battle corruption and increase transparency he didn't tell me that he had been personally involved in an effort to defeat the legislation that passed Congress in 2010 now there is press out suggesting that that's the case and he didn't tell me that apparently there was an effort underway to undermine the transparency statute that was so important and I think it's just I got to put it on the record mr. president within one day within one day of the Senate approving mr. Tillison for Secretary of State the Trump administration has relax sanctions on Russia that happened today and now apparently we're going to vote to eliminate a law that requires transparency among companies like Exxon Mobil I kind of feel like I got snookered at the hearing what public interest is at stake in rolling this back I don't think there's any some say well look it's about leveling the playing field us shouldn't be at a competitive disadvantage but US companies aren't at a disadvantage companies listed on the US stock exchange wherever they're from are required to do this transparency these are these disclosures and many are already doing it and because we led the European Union and Canada have said this is a great idea and they're doing it too it would be a horrible thing if the u.s. pulled away from its leadership in conclusion I'm concerned that in the opening two weeks of the Trump administration despite a lot of promises about what they would do in the economy what is the administration done about the economy on day one they entered an executive order retracting an FHA mortgage reduction thereby requiring FHA homeowners with FHA loans to have to pay more for their monthly mortgages they have done a federal hiring band that falls disproportionately on veterans because the federal workforce is a veteran heavy workforce they've done the immigration rules that we've been discussed that not only affect immigrants but also have a dramatic negative effect on a marriage technology industry and then in the first two uses of the CRA procedures since the 1990s they've eliminated a rule to allow more pollution of streams in poor areas that where Cole is produced and now this allowing companies to escape transparency and make the very kinds of payments that lead to corruption and foreign governments corruption so severe that a former Republican member of this body was compelled to write a superb report in 2008 and have five partisan legislation passed I urge my colleagues to vote against the CRA repeal of this rule

hi everyone my name is Emil t-bone I'm the Washington correspondent for Haaretz newspaper it's great to be here in this panel with the wonderful group that we have with us so traduce our panelists and the missing panelist who is on her way in a minute before we start the discussion there are two general comments I want to make one is that we are a bit behind schedule so we will try to be a bit brief and I might be rude to some of the panelists please the panelists and the crowd to understand that this is part of the requirements of my job today and not because I don't like you or my members here on the stage and the second thing I want to say is everyone please put your cell phones off or in quiet mode so that the little time that we do have will not be wasted on you know having noises coming from cell phones in the crowd as we are waiting for one more panelist I will start by introducing the ones that are here with me on the stage and we will build up the momentum as the time goes by the the headline of our panel today is the choices ahead we're going to look at the issues that are dominating the public discourse in Israel that might be on top of the agenda in the upcoming election I can tell you that is an Israeli a journalist working in this city I get the question when is the next election in Israel about three or four times a week from people and I always tell them I have no idea you cannot be a prophet on this issue it might be decided a week from today or it might take place on the original time which is November of next year but we will talk knock not about when the election will happen but when it does what will be the issues that everyone will be speaking about what will make the difference between the blocks and the parties and there's a lot of smart people here on the stage that will give you the I think fascinating perspective on this issue so we have Bergesen bar is the national chairperson of young merits and the founder of McComb eat local leadership movement in Israel she's director of students for workers a program at the general union of workers in Israel and a coordinator of the Coalition for democracy in education in civics she has a master's or she is a master students at Tel Aviv University and she's writing her thesis on the political history of the kadosh party so that sounds interesting ah Hadassah oh my mistake yeah yeah close enough okay that sounds like a good thesis in itself now we have miss hell mannequin next to her he is the Israel director of the Alliance for Israel's future a consortium of donors and organizations focused on building new progressive political leadership in Israel he's also the former CEO of Malad which is a nonpartisan think tank progressive think tank in Jerusalem and for that he directed breaking the silence and he co-founded mahapatra breslav caucus operating within the Labour Party and manages Israel tomorrow a strategic communications company any mistakes on this one okay apologies bar and uh Likud are on my right he joined Israel of as the executive director of these organizations last summer before this world he spent over seven years in leading positions in civil society organizations and in politics in Israel both in the elected and professional positions and he served in the military as a tank commander and still does reserve duty Emmylou him and also used to work for appeared in J Street in Israel and we are missing still a sum of celina and when she arrives I think I will introduce her to the crowd she's also going to be a great panelists with us today but I think as we await for her to to join us we will just hop into the discussion hey I'm going to ask some general questions to our panelists and leave a lot of time for you and all your important and smart questions which will be much much better than mine so we'll try to get to it fast the first question I want to present to to to all our panelists here as we look ahead into the possibility of new elections in Israel and like I said it could be you know any day right now one issue that's really dominating the headlines in Israel and is affecting the entire political system is corruption we're seeing in never-ending stream of new stories about corruption investigations involving Prime Minister Netanyahu some of his coalition partners people in a number of parties and I want to ask you it's an opening general question do you think Israeli voters really care about corruption is it really a game-changing issue in our politics it's moved from missile through bar to worry and here their perspective okay okay this work I mean it depends on when you say the Israelis care care about corruption what do we mean no I don't think Israelis vote on corruption I don't think it's a top issue and definitely in terms of polling in the past when we pull why Israelis vote for what they vote for corruption is usually a very low issue in terms of importance and in terms of priorities but I do think it matters in terms of how a camp tells a story about itself so I don't think it's I don't think it's it's going to be an election topic in that it creates I mean I don't I think everybody's gonna say this at some point another we don't really know answering this kind of time where activists were not pundits and but but I think corruption tells the story of a camp or tell the story of a type of leadership so it's definitely a good auxilary force or tool I don't think it's something that usually ends up being the central issue of election I don't think it'll be the central issue of the election now I do think and this will also sort of pointed the direction with are the things that are important for me to say in this panel I do think it's a very comfortable issue for specifically for the lot of the opposition leaders because it's an issue where they don't need to make clear identity choices about themselves so at least in the perceived notion of our I think rather subpar opposition leadership right now it's a it's a good way to not to divert the conversation to issues which are less important and to feel you're talking about something important I think you all have microphones right yeah okay so I want to follow up on my cell because basically I agree with you I think corruption won't be you know the changing point or the issue that's gonna dominate next elections or people will choose according to it what what how will they vote I can say confidently unfortunately from my own mother quality merits which is has always the image and is also the most transparent and most you know honorable or clean handed the party in the parliament and we are the smallest one in the parliament so it must not be the most important issue but I do think that it is a platform for us for us progressives and that the Israeli left camp to join forces and engage others in our fight it's it's a it's a it's a great let's say excuse for people to hear what we have to say we saw rallies of tens of thousands of people going every week every week to the streets a suddenly seeing partnership in in the the Left parties and not and you know alienating from us or avoiding any connection with us which is a good and gradual change from rallies we could see before the 2011 rallies or the the gas the natural gas issues two years ago so I'll say first of all I think that it will be a topic I don't know if it will be D topic but I want to ask if that's okay one asked the audience a question do you remember what was the first thing that that he could campaigned about in that previous elections in 2015 the first thing there first a door first yes to do with Operation Cast Lead No so the first thing that they campaigned about with governance it lasted for about I think 72 hours and then they switched because they understand that it's a sorry for the world a shitty topic and they switched and I think that one of the things that is important because I do think that corruption moves people I later quote a few people that I think agree with that is that I think that the interesting thing is Mattel already said is it might be a starting point but I think they're more important more important than the more relevant question that we will need to see is where do we had from there because we will not have a 90 days elections campaign all driven around corruption I do want to mention that I think that in 92 that was one of the major topics that labor ran on and eventually won so I do think that it is an electoral issue answer okay and we have some who just joined us so I will introduce her and then she will have the privileges answering the the question as well Solomon is a member of wat assalaam the vishal ohm which is very special community in Israel if you're visiting any time soon I strongly encourage you to go and see it an arab jewish community built on equality and peace she heads the communications and development department in the vishal ohm she's a social worker community activist a feminist blogger she frequently writes for nine seven two magazine on the issues of the palestinian-israeli relationship she's the founder of Arab woman in the center and NGO which is active in the cities of Ramallah load in Jaffa combating violence against women particularly in the arab society and this year she was chosen by idiota for not israeli newspaper is one of the ten most influential social activists in israel and the yes well-deserved and the question we were discussing is how much do you think corruption is going to have an influence of the upcoming election and i will add another subsequent question you know if this is not a main issue of other family said what could be a main topic that maybe we're not thinking about right now that could dominate the conversation well thank you for the question I am I will be encouraged to represent our population inside Israel this is the only thing the Israeli politics a cannot accuse the Arab citizen and the corruption we are not in the government we are not part of what's happening in the government and for 70 years the Arab parties were in the opposition so we don't have this kind of history which is God's good star and I want to mention here that we in the current government we have convicted mainstream Minister who was in jail for corruption and he is now one of the leaders of the chef's party and he is a very powerful and influential Minister I what's concern me about the corruption and that I think that the there it will be part of the campaign's and if merit and the Zionist party do did their job well and cooperate together I think that this issue have to be on the table I do believe that the what concerned me okay as a citizen of Israel as a Palestinian is the the normalization of the collection and the Israeli society that we we we hear journalists we hear leaders who mention and speak up to Bibi Netanyahu says like it's about cigarettes it's about small money it's not the big issue it's nothing next to the threat from Iran and Syria and what's happening is like the small thing is happening it's not the millions of dollars and the public start to accept that this is not big issues a small thing then we have to live with with this thing and for me I think that the next election will be mostly about the legalization of the settlements of the West Bank what's what the right wing's campaign want to do and start already to prepare the Israeli society to that part they are now legalizing the justice system the transportation the higher education and the step-by-step we will see ourself dealing with this issue hopefully the next election will come before that dramatic moment thank you so much and I want to encourage our panelists within the time constraints that I mentioned also if you want to respond to each other but very briefly because then we don't have a ton of time and the next question I want all of you to think about Michele you will have the privilege of starting are we going to see any new political combinations emerge do you think that's something that is likely or maybe even something we should aspire to there's been discussion over the years about how to solve the problem of the left in Israel through you know joining forces between different parties should methods run with the joint least through the joint list break up into two parties should labor break up or in corporate merits or make a bond with repeat you know what what is what are your views on these I could talk about something that won't happen that that I want to happen that's always a start I think a bit but I but maybe nor do that I'll talk about at first about something I'll do it all quickly but something that I think will happen that I don't want to happen and that is first of all I think it needs to be clear that all of this is is fuzzy because there's one thing that we know for sure and that there that there will be new parties in the political system in the next year we know the beginnings of them so any converse and there'll be new people running for prime minister who are not in our head right now so all of the conversation that we have about political parties and political constellations we need to take with a grain of salt because we don't know the full spectrum yet so I know at least of two parties which are being discussed they tend to be centrist parties but uh but we'll wait and see how things develop I think the the dominant theory today among sort of center-left leadership is that there needs to be a wide centrist coalition that sort of the fantasy of the center-left and it's been the fantasy for a very very long time so we're talking about a coalition pragmatic coalition somewhere between merits and Lieberman and I know for at least some of those for us that doesn't seem like a very moderate leadership but I think that's a fantasy that that a lot of a lot of sort of thought leaders in the center-left have where you would have somebody like Yair Lapid running the party just so he's he's the biggest party right now and the most important candidate that's been the dominant theory in the Labour Party for a very very long time I think the problem with it is it consistently fails it's actually consistently failed for the last 40 years it's mathematically very very problematic and there the main part problem with that fantasy is that the center doesn't share the fantasy of the left meaning the left is sure the Yair Lapid will join him join them because it's somehow similar and European and it's important to say this in this room has been saying consistently for the last year that his first phone call to build a coalition will be the Likud and not labour and he said he's been saying that consistently and it's something that we should think about what I would but I do think that'll happen I think it won't succeed and maybe this time around it'll be the last time it'll happen it won't succeed what I what I would like to see happen in general is an open conversation between the Zionist left or liberal Zionists or however it's called in these constellation and at least those relevant in the those parties relevant in the joint list who want to see a political alliance I'm not talking about a joint party because I think that's irrelevant and I'm not necessarily even talking about a joint coalition because that's never existed but a support from the outside from Palestinian Israeli parties and it is worth mentioning that the only time the left has been in power in the last 40 years has been due to support of Palestinian citizens of Israel and if any when I say Zionist left I mean the Labour Party and merits but if those parties ever want to see themselves in a position of power that means we need to be as the majority and as the ones with more power in the room we need to be focused on stretching out our hands votes ideologically and also pragmatically towards Palestinian citizens of Israel because that's it's it's it's good ideology but it's also good politics and I think that should be sort of the trajectory that we're focused on I'm gonna challenge this question and try to broaden my answer because I think that asking questions only about the the structure of parties of national parties is not a good enough answer because he's really left is in a crisis I'm betting most of you know it fill it or he or heard about it and and there's a much a question we have to ask ourselves which is a in at the beginning of the process we have to go through which is we see populist right nationalists right-wing right rising rising all over the world and we see the weakening of you know kind of the the basis of the Left parties all around the world we see how how their basis the you know labor parties or worldwide are losing their their traditional voters and what we should should ask ourselves is what is the alternative we are suggesting we are giving to the voters when we want to have them with us either in merits kadosh labor whatever and i think the answer to this question should be the there needs to be a new agreement a new treaty between the public and its representatives and it has to come from bottom up and you kind of mentioned it in my bio I for the last year I've been dealing with building power from bottom up through local communities and local municipalities because we keep you know this panel he talks about the elections but and we tend to neglect the fact that within six months less than six months from now there's going to be elections in two in two hundred and fifty municipalities nationwide there's gonna be elected 1600 City Council members who are gonna affect the lives of each and every Israeli and we should ask ourselves how do we build power there how do we reach people in their day-to-day lives in life itself and and it should be from bottom up all the time because Israeli politics is built so you know top-down in its parliamentary system that we have to break it apart we have to remind people that behind our values pluralism equality freedom whatever there's people and there's faces and there's people who are committed to this process and they are willing to represent them in the best way possible which is much better than the right way than the right wing and I think this is the real question we should ask ourselves this is short if some of the people in the crowd brings up the kind of discussions that are going on in the United States about should we talk about 2020 or focus all the attention on 2018 before that and it's interesting comment or I want to challenge you a little bit s you grapple with the same question because your organization deals a lot with religious issues in Israel religious pluralism freedom from religious equation from the state and the rabbinate do you think that could be a major issue that could somehow influence how we look at the political map maybe create new coalition's new partnerships affect the election results stop at that place okay I will say something which may I start from from a different point than what you just asked I know one thing for sure I know that both Netanyahu and his political partners do not want elections to be around religion State and the reason that I know that is not because they told me so it's because they were saying it out loud publicly I am Not sure if people in this room have read in September 2017 your newspaper published a series of interviews with for the coudé leaders sort of up and coming leaders from the hood one of them is the vid beat on the vid baton is was formerly and was then the coalition whip and he said that according to his theory votes move from right to left on two issues one is corruption as we mentioned earlier and apparently he was involved involved in that himself or at least there was a personal observation for him yeah and maybe back then he was not still arrested okay yeah and the other thing that he said is that they might lose votes over either of the real estate and six months later in the latest coalition crisis that we have and I know that it's hard to follow our coalition crisis it seems as if that's an ongoing process they signed a new coalition agreement and under that coalition agreement Netanyahu demanded and received an authorized signed agreement in which all the coalition parties decide not to move forward with anything that has to do with religion and state until they dissolve the coalition completely which means up to the next elections the reason for that is that they understand that that is probably the only topic in which they find solutions and that that drives people in Israel to the streets we saw that and every time I need to get over it but every time that I say in English that the most the closest vote that we had under the current coalition has to do with the who has the authority to open grocery stores on Shabbat it sounds idiotic to me but that's actually the fact and I think that what we understand is that my political analysis is that if someone wants to win elections they should try and have those elections around the topics that their opponent does not want the elections to go through so I do think that it's recreation I think that most of you don't know what's happening in the inside politics in the Arab society and that because we are for the most media or the mainstream media in Israel what's happening the joint parties is not that important and it's not irrelevant because they don't really see a politician a part of this system and I think that for me as active it is fascinating to see to see the moves like it's very slow but the moves and the and I consider myself as the left winger and and I really do a search for coalition's and partners and Patel potential partners but I just agree with you that the joint party is not running again I think that they don't have any choice that because they love each other because they both attack by you know all of them attacked by Netanyahu and Lieberman and they don't have any chance to to be in thickness it without being together I think that a next election they will be much more mature and pragmatic and wise to to sign an agreement with the merits for them remains with the votes I think that for me as a feminist for example I don't know if you know but the Islamic movement for example election or the primaries and Islamic movement three months ago approved the third chair for females we will see the first Muslim women and the Knesset this is my optimistic scenario this is what they promised me at least and I believe that they will be afraid from the response of the feminist movement in Israel if they don't and I I do think that because I I know that a lot of Jewish post diners let's see if I can use that term are looking for partnership Tabitha Boras and other people are involved in this new initiative a new movement to establish Arab Jew Arab Jewish Left Party I don't know what is that gonna happen we will see we have a meeting next May so I will post you know my next article maybe will be about that so just follow 972 and I will update and we will wait for the update thank you now we're talking about political changes that are happening in Israel and I'm sure for you and many other people who are interested in Israel and care about Israel that's the main priority at the same time of course there are fascinating political changes taking place here in Washington and generally in the United States and I want to ask our panelists if you see any kind of a spill effect from the United States to Israeli politics or maybe vice versa how events that are happening here with Trump and his style of politics with the Democratic resistance with the never Trump Republicans things like that if you think they have any effect on our political discourse in Israel if there's any connection between the things so I'm sure you want to start or attend but then I don't get to hear what the other people say before I make up my mind yeah for sure I mean definitely on the right and I think in terms of you know I think the challenge the challenge of the amount of craziness coming out from all over the world on every day in every day is it gets it gets you callous and I think I think this was true this was said about the corruption issues that it's even for very sort of involved Israelis it's already at this point very hard to follow the corruption crisis and I imagine that's similar here that when twice a day you're getting new information you just can't do it anymore and that energy that you need in order to mobilize and to write and to organize it's just much harder to use when every day something is happening I think that's also true of activism but it's also true of the press and it's a very natural response and I think the the second maybe tragic element of that is I don't think progressives anywhere including Israel have learned yet how to deal with this new right-wing populism we don't have I don't think we have good answers for it we look I look to other places to the u.s. to other places to see what are progressives doing what is the left doing here what does progressives what our progress is doing there to try to get hope out of that or to try to be inspired I am actually a bit cautious of the resistance models because over time you when you lose enough you become disillusioned and you actually Marja South marginalize I understand why why it comes in and and I'm definitely been involved in and probably will be involved in resistance model in the future but there is also a challenging element of that so in this point of time I think ideologically and at least like in terms of like theoretically and ideologically I think it's it's it's a challenging time and and I know one thing for sure and that is that we don't have yet sort of the real response to how to deal with that so that might be sort of tragic in the short term but I don't think anybody has yet sort of created a language which we know is sticking so maybe that's sort of like initial thoughts on this issue I definitely think that Israeli America Israel America relations and their happenings in the government of both countries affect each other and I see the almost like a competition or a challenge effect between Trump and Bibi and how like how radical how crazy yeah well who's gonna take the next insane press release and it definitely you know the leash has gotten loose and they're running ahead which is dangerous of course extremely when there's this kind of bromance you can only lose but each I think it should also be kind of a ray of hope or or over our a sign for us progressives that well partnerships can work from both sides and if you build it right if you build it on ideology and trust and in genuine exchange of knowledge of you know know-how and an experience you can really make it a multiplier of of your actions and I I see it here in this conference and I see it on a daily basis in the connections I hold with the JC to you and other international partners we have I think that most issues we progressives deal and face have to go through international tunnels in one way or another and the more we will be able to discuss it not preach not you know patronize on each other but form a partnership which requires bravery because I know that as Israelis do not know how to be organized and we do not know how to work it is really progressive we do not know how to work in an orderly fashion and-and-and how to do partnerships Michelle and I are really good friends for the past let's say two years but it couldn't have happened before me America's activists and we fell in labor activists and Bowie the previous a chair of young labor this couldn't have happened before sitting together sharing ideas this is what we need from American jewelry we need to learn how to cooperate we need to learn how to be professional we need to learn how to organize like you guys do and the only way we can do it is by opening up and and being a bit less sarcastic that's important but being able to learn but also being able to sit here and talk with you just like this opportunity we have here I want to start by giving a bad example and going back to a discussion that that Val and I had about two campaigns that merits Ryan one was I even don't remember what were they trying to say but they used the hashtag resist which is nice if you're in another country where that was the second one and then they moved to campaign with hashtag lock him up again about corruption they could which again is nice if you're in it first of all an english-speaking country which tends to work with english-speaking campaigns because if you're doing english-speaking campaigns to Israelis who were talking Hebrew in their daily life its antagonist Inc and that's the easiest word I can find for that I think that we have a lot to learn from the progressive camp here and I think that the other way around what we are now seeing and and we sought I think around we had a dressy delegation right after the elections and for the first time we had people who sort of clicked the fact that oh this is how it happens then you lose an elections that you just don't understand how can you lose and I think that coming from that point there is a need and important need first of all to make those co-operators because they are happening on the conservative side on a very very broad basis and and I applaud them for that I must say that I think that the most important thing that we can look to our right and see is that they are working together they are working professionally they don't shy away from the fight and a lot of times we see as progressive I'm not that comfortable with that message and I'm not that comfortable with that campaign and I'm not sure that that was the exact wording but excuse me sir no one's asking you because it's already out so please support whatever it is that's happening and I think that that is probably the best thing that we can learn from political account opponents and apply to our politics I'm going to say something maybe it's not you know popular and I have to oppose you all and first of all the left wing in Israel learned from the right wing there's the margins big hired the most in a populist campaigner brutal campaigner I to she cooperate with him she she consulted him consulted with him which is in a difference me as a supporter as a potential supporter and I do agree of the techniques that we have to be the left hand will have to be more aggressive and more pure and powerful I do agree before that I I think that in that same you know kind of redline was crossed and for me it was disappointed the other thing I think that we have to open as as activists as citizens and people who really believe in quality and democracy and freedom open the conversation about you know the determination about the influence of what's happening in the US for what's happening in the Israeli politics I can see from the side that eight years of Obama administration don't really affect what's happened in Israel there were Democrat the democracies were in charge Obama was elected twice and Israel goes left and left and left and now we have Trump and it seems like Netanyahu just waited for this way for this thing and now he has like a easy partner and this is this is my feeling and if really what's happened within Obama administration influence what's happened in the politics in Israel I think that Israel after eight years should be in different shape you know so so what's the explanation of this kind of influence I think that we have to break up this myth and and start to think what is really motivate the leaders of inside or the politicians in inside the US and inside Israel and that's why we this is the only way that we can figure out and recalculate the ways that or our our back path or our erode I see for example the sudden warming friendship between regime like Saudia and Arabia Saudi and Israel and the u.s. it's nothing about values of equality and democracy we know what the audience resumed do and the key word for me as a Palestinian as resident investor l as people as women who I see what's happening and I think most of the people know that it's about interest it's about militarism it's about the upcoming war it's about the fear that say odeon regime is controlling his people by the fear of Iran the same thing what Netanyahu is doing the same thing this is the same tool of the right-wingers to control us and control our mentality our emotions because we have to be afraid of something big coming and they will control us so I think that if we really want to recalculate our you know a plan of changing the politics we have to think big we have to challenge the regional relationship between the leaders that think about money and militarism and the industry of war and the other thing that I I do see some similarities in in the civil society war movement I see what's happened for the feminist movement here in the US after Trump election I see what's happened with the asylum seeker struggle inside Israel I see what's happened here with the gun control I see what's happened here with immigration policy and Obama care and all of kind of civil struggles that suddenly have a space or realized that they have to resist they have to to do something the same thing happening in Israel my point of view and people find their small battle that they can win in that so and I and I think that as a you know and I really want to believe that we are in the same side of the political map we have to find out that junctions and the point that we do we do share values and do we do share our believes in human right democracy and equality and fight for those cause and then the you know the highway for for the the government will be much more easier for us okay so on this note of what some I said I want to give one more question to worry and to bar into my cell but very very brief answers minutes or more but that's it which is you know building on what some have said is there one thing that you see right now in Israeli politics does it giving you a sense of hope something that you know we can look at and be a bit optimistic about a positive trend that maybe we're not seeing in the headlines so far so just you know brief answer on that and then we will open it up to questions from the crowd so were you go first so it's not it's not really a recent trend it's just that as Barr said in my one of our previous hats was the chairperson of the young branch of the Labor Party and in 2015 labor along with CP given its movement formed a Zionist union and got 24 Mondays in one of the weakest campaigns that we had I think ever I could play the game again of asking you do what do you remember from the campaign but it won't be a fun game because no one remembers right I'll try to forget this right right so and labor got the most votes that got in decades and was rather close to winning the elections in a very very non strategic and without some kind of a fantastic leadership that we are all sort of looking for and that made me optimistic world I think that if on those terms we were able to bring a very good result then it's possible it's just playing better one thing that is kind of my ray of hope in in current reality is that I think there's a good and gradual studies process of growing collisions between organizations and and individuals who you couldn't see before cooperating in Israel I think that identity politics have have ended its its job right now in Israeli politics we we do we do reached a phase that every group is able to identify itself but then look out and see that whether you're the Arab from Aqua or the gay couple from a Ramat Gan or the ethiopian from that's you that the opium from Kiryat gat or the Haredi from particular all of you have the same the same problem which is you don't get a you don't get to rent an apartment because you're being discriminated you're being discriminated and you probably also cannot finish the month without your parents assistance and you most probably won't have pension won't have a steady job because this is reality right now because economic reality and in the the neoliberal system that we live in does not allow us to do so because we are being pressured more and more and we are told that we should hate each other okay the day ultra-orthodox and their secular in the arab and the gay and as long as we believe it it worked but right now there's a there's a new process which allows people to see that despite the different identities we are all suffering from the same social economic oppressing system that is enforced on us and this is what we should fight and this is what i think missile I promised you would be last and this is also the moment to encourage everyone to get behind the microphone it's also good exercise we need it so you know line up with your questions and meanwhile we'll answer the I'll do it in in under a minute but I want to give four examples would have nothing to do it go the first is polarization of young people particularly in merits merits got out bars people the Reds got out over eight thousand ten thousand registered members to the merits party in the last couple of months which is unbelievable had nothing to do with it but I think young people being politicized is always a brilliant thing the second is Palestinian leadership passing an Israeli leadership which wants partnership with with liberal Zionists even at a time when liberal liberal Zionists behave the way they do and particularly I'm in order which I think is something which we shouldn't be expecting but I think it's unbelievably impressive and unbelievably important the third ISM beam by Assad standing together and if you haven't seen them up until now speak to them I encourage you to do that in the next couple of days because they're incredible in mobilizing on so many different levels and the fourth is within the Labor Party and still relatively small but the fact that there's an ultra-orthodox caucus in the Labor Party particularly of heredity feminists is something which we wouldn't haven't been able to envision ten years ago or maybe even five years ago or maybe we can't even envision now but I think that's awesome and I think incredible and I think opens up also for me as a little religious individual so much options and ideas regarding to what Israel and Judaism can do on a progressive level so those are four examples I think you need to go with the questions I will say we don't have time at all release so what we're gonna do only short questions no speeches no comments no observations a question which is a sentence or two I'm going to write down all the questions and then refer them to the panelists so we're not gonna do question answer but rather take it all down and and move so let's go and let's try to be fast and efficient okay so finally at the end you know you got to what I thought was the point of the what you're gonna discuss what was an observation no no the point is that you know you're all a bunch of and I want to say left wing losers but finally you got to the subject matter there are other people who have issues besides just you all and they are the ones who have created the majority that is currently governing Israel and you didn't speak to necessarily their issues and they have their issues hit with your issues except at the very end so could you please discuss a little bit more about that so we see a broader perspective than just who's gonna cooperate with who but the real issues and how you're gonna win elections on what the real issues are in the street okay not sure where the questions are but I got it we're gonna try to stab at it yes I know that as you've talked about that most of the center-left is talking about a centrist coalition and I'm just confused as to know why the left isn't really getting together working with like the joint list Moretz and the Zionist Union and trying to make like their own Left Front like I really don't understand why this has to be an obstacle cuz to me I've seen the central strategy in the United States and it's a complete dumpster fire that's some kind of a larger Center Left Front yes a couple of years ago what I seem to hear here was that Israelis we're concentrating on the issues that you talked about the economic issues housing cottage cheese prices and and we're not paying much attention to foreign affairs but the israeli-palestinian thing has that changed so occupation versus social issues okay yes the prevailing notion that you here in the u.s. is that Bibi wins because of security and that that is the overwhelming concern how does how do you envision the opposition effectively countering that argument or is that really just bogus and what's been created by Bibi constantly is it real that that's what the the public opinion is and why people sort of fatalistically vote for him or is it illusionary is security really the management how can we win on it and that's exactly yes ma'am I don't have that good a sense of numbers in Israel and I mentioned the possibility of the power of these right the potential power the israeli-palestinian community these very citizens I'd like to know in terms about voters what person and then the last question and we will try to squeeze them in very quickly can you talk about the expansion of the settlements as a domestic issue how that's being seen today is it a financial must be a financial drain yeah we wanted to take a quick step at the first gentleman's comment about not talking about the real issues right you you said you were interested to say and you know these are the you know the real issues are always security there are always social economic issues and there are always issues of civilian civil relations and they all in competitions of identity it's not who I am as an Israeli and that's something that's manipulated in many different ways so it's not always about issues even it's about optimist and pessimism happy to live in a place sad to live in a place I think that's an issue that everybody deals with all of us are Israelis we're not outside political people who have ideas and we have families in Israel we're dealing with all those things as well I don't think it's anything sort of out of the ordinary if anything I think the Israeli left today is much more consciously aware of different communities organizations like Imran weren't mentioned and even if they're not their bipartisan or nonpartisan still most of the activists are coming from the left on these very issues LGBT issues and so on so I think we're actually in a very very good place regarding that I'll just enter the statistics because somebody asked about six-six around 20% of Israelis vote for the center left for center-left parties 20 to 25 20 % of Israelis vote for center parties around 40 percent of Israelis vote for right parties and 16 percent of Israelis are the Palestinian Israeli a voter bloc because another couple percent when every talk about twenty percent were usually talking including Palestinian Jerusalemites who are residents and not citizens and therefore cannot vote in general elections if you did the math quickly that means that nobody can build a coalition on their own oh there's ten percent ultra-orthodox and when I talked about ultra-orthodox leftist I wasn't referring to them okay barri you wanted to talk about the day of some kind of a lift fron the center and the left coming together again very briefly because we have other questions waiting for other panelists okay I'll catch up on the on the BB a question as well BB one because he had a good methodology and agenda of fear and hatred and putting in acts between people and and scaring ones could sector unleashing it on to another the left didn't the left didn't given alt a good alternative of hope a good alternative of what should Israel look like and and this is why we lost the security issues as much as they are important are not as important as to Israelis as they are to Americans and it's unfortunate to say but when you sit in a coffee shop in Tel Aviv you do not feel the occupation you do not know it exists you do not know it's there and and it's unfortunate so this is why I think that our connection progressives connection to those atrocities happening on a daily basis has to come from what we feel and we know that there is a welfare state in Israel outside Israel actually in the in the occupied territories there is a place where public funding with Israel funds its children and their roads and and and everything and but it's not in Israel they don't put this money for us they don't build the development cities they don't build the Negev they don't build the north because they do prefer to to invest in the settlements and once we realize that this is our interest that Israeli government does not care about us Israelis who are paying their taxes who live inside the legal state of Israel this wouldn't this will end once we realized it once we realize that this is our economic interest okay I want to refer to some us there was a it's gonna be a mash-up of two questions there was a question about creating some kind of a larger front and then a question about arab-israeli participation in the political game can the Arab the joint list and the different Arab parties become part of this broader coalition of a some kind of a center-left front or are the gaps too wide over there and to only the last question will be about security is this something that the center-left can win on security is it something that where there is a chance to challenge Netanyahu in the right wing so now if you go first quickly and then we will end so I I will answer his question because women can speak about security and I am Arab women so I am the one who will be afraid of so I am causing the insecurity for them so it's illusional insecure security issue we know that Israel the last three years did have a war and now they are cooking something for us to the next summer and with the help of Trump and we will see that coming and in inside the society that 1 million Palestinians are citizen of Israel the aggression or any kind of violence from this 20% of the population it's almost you know nothing it didn't happen I do think that it's the statistic says that 65% of the Arab population voted in the last election even though what's happened with the day of the election when Netanyahu said that the Arab voters was taking buses Bussard by the left-winger and the buses that funded by the new Israel fund to vote and and so I am the threat of that Israel democracy I do think that if the Palestinians residents will vote for at least twenty eighty percent we will have more representative I don't think that the join list or any because we have also Arab member in merit and another member in the Labour Party and I count them as represented of the Palestinian inside Israel I don't see the they are part of the coalition I do think that if the incredible you know wishful thinking lead us to when the election they will be there you know at least as block blocking or backing up the left center coalition and I do think that in one election or two or after like two cadential or or two I will really want to see Arab nested member in the government and believe me like it's now be like a dream but it's gonna happen and as soon and it depends on what we are aiming for you know it depends on us in the pensive of you know playing the game till the end and and everything in every scenario that we can see have to aim to that point and this is the obstacle of this dream is only the occupation because the Arab method member can not back up or agree for any aggression or any presence of military to route militarism in a Palestinian territory and this is the key point I have to say last sentence because he after what I criticized the man she's with my friend but I think that the one week after her election when she said that we have to investigate what's happened in in the border in Gaza all you know the public opinion in Israel this kind of statement this kind of position is a gathering or engaging the Palestinian population to the to the left and I hope that she will dare and other people really you know be courage enough to challenge the public or publicity or the right-wing publicity in Israel thank you we'll finish our discussion so so I'll start anyway I do not agree with so much about the fact that security issues are made made up I once heard that question from an American diplomat stationed in Jerusalem who said he wasn't sure if it's a real thing that Israelis are really afraid of or these data made-up thing and I knew from his different friends of his day-to-day life that his family is not allowed to go on public transportation in Jerusalem for years by the way I think that for the last 15 years as far as I know American diplomats are banned from using public transportation in Jerusalem the right train let alone buses so I think that security issues a real I think that security issues is always issues that come up in in elections although we haven't had a big power military confrontation in the last three years as you said I think there's still dominates the the debate and I think that for your answer if it could help a win from the center center left I think that it can't happen unless they decide that they want to attack on that and I think that the issue that we are always seeing is that there is a fear to question that issue and and there's a fear to question the issue is Netanyahu providing security to Israelis which I believe that the answer is no and I think that we are in an unfortunate position in which my party leader at the moment but others as well don't really believe in their ability question-it and as long as they don't believe their own ability then I can't really explain to other people why will they be the correct choice because it seemed that I've been a node buglet but but I think that it does not require you to be lobbying or a blog or an extra general the first thing that I think that a politician needs to have in order to convince other people is to actually believe himself and I think that it's lacking maybe don't underestimate the fear you know I I know that the fear is there and it's real the cause of the security thing is for me it's fake and the statistic is like the Islamophobia it's like I'm talking about numbers you know I went to a synagogue here in San Francisco and through the gates of security that cost like maybe fifty thousand dollars and I asked the people there that is something happened in the synagogue and and this man says like thirty five years ago one man tried to do something and and for me it's it's it's the fear is real but a you know the rationale that you know for the reality is different so I think if you if we really want to fix this is we have to think or recover the fear and that's why people places like what - Salaam Navy Shalom hand-in-hand school or attacked by the tag price windows because we are ongoing evidence that Arab and Jewish can be together without fear and they want to maintain that fear within 40 years of existence of what is Allen official own nobody did something grown to his name wrong to his neighbors so then this is a fact and we you know and one example here and they're mixed cities in it like up and Jewish in Israel they're mixed they are in the same public space so the fear is there but the cause or that whereas this come from it's come from bad brutal and incitement from the government for all of us and we are suffering from that okay thank you so much and I think you know there is so many more things that we could talk about in so many more fascinating questions but I'm gay some urgent cues that we need to finish the discussion thank you so much to a great panelists thank you to the crowd for smart questions apologize for every time I cut you off and you know I hope everybody enjoys the rest of the conference

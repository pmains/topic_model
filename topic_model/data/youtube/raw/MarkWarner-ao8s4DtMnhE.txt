we turn now to the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee Virginia Senator Mark Warner senator you've been briefed what do you what do you know about this attack well first of all John let's express our condolences to the British people they're our strongest allies and clearly the London police force responded appropriately eight minutes after the incident started the terrorists were taken down and I also want to emphasize as well that as your report just made that the information sharing between the British and the Americans is still top-notch and going forward I think there's not much more that the NCTC knows than what had been publicly reported there is no imminent threat in the United States but I think the very question is was this terrorist directed or terrorists inspired the British will continue to investigate I think it is really important though and one of the things that concerns me about the president's tweets this morning where he in effect is calling for a Muslim travel ban again even though the courts have continued to turn that down if the president wanted 90 days to re-examine how individuals from certain countries would enter the United States he had more than 90 days why if there's new procedures put in place put those procedures in place don't continue to call for this travel ban which is frankly all of the leaders in the intelligence community has said would be a in effect a slap in the face to two Muslim Americans and others in many ways might actually incite more incidents very quickly here Theresa May said she talked about technology he were once a technology executive she talked about internet service providers and and how there needed to be some way to regulate cyberspace to keep this ideology from having a place to grow what's your thought about well I think we do have to re-examine the roles of all of these platform companies the face Twitter's the googles and recognize there may need to be some responsibilities to curate information I was out on the west coast last week met with some of those companies I think they understand that they first started some regulation around child pornography they've now started to regulate some content around terrorism threats I was out there raising questions around fake news and how that can affect the democratic process Facebook for example said they took down 30,000 fake sites before the French elections but I think this is a discussion that we need to have because obviously there's value in the Internet we want to continue to have this connections but there's also we're seeing the dark side you have two hearings this week there's James Comey testifying on Thursday but before you have a hearing on Wednesday what's important about that well we're going to have at the Wednesday hearing odni director coats and NSA had Admiral Rogers the press has reported that both of those individuals had some level of pressure from the president to downplay the Russian investigation I want to ask those individuals directly did they have that kind of pressure can they report on those conversations they had with the president because it would be very concerning and then obviously Thursday we have a former FBI director call me and I think we've known since Watergate that rules of the road were you know a president shouldn't intervene in an annealing investigation particularly the case if it involves individuals that are close to that president and it would be unthinkable if the president actually did what was reported who asked FBI director Comey to enough that back off of at least the investigation into general Flynn and and is combing going to be able to testify there's been some talk away there's been some talk but I my hope is and I believe this morning the White House is backed off from some call of executive privilege since clearly the President himself has commented about this and you know frankly no matter what you thought about Jim Comey the fact that the president disparaged him with comments from the Russians is just unacceptable so you expect James coming to give a sense of why he felt that pressure he won't be bringing those memos though that he wrote though why can't you get it so we want to get a look at those memos as well I believe former FBI director Muller who's now leading the investigation he'll have to agree whether come we can look at those metals or whether we can look at those memos ultimately I think we will get a chance to look at them I think it's very important is there a key question you want Kumbi the answer I wanted him to reinforce one the fact that the Russians directly intervened in our elections which everybody accepts except for the President and maybe Vladimir Putin and to I want to know what kind of pressure appropriate inappropriate how many conversations he had with the president about this topic did some of these conversations take place even before the president was sworn in and I think Jim Comey deserves to have is in effect day in court since the president is disparage them so much you also said that the Treasury Department has not complied fully with the committee document requests where does that stand we're still sorting through will getting more cooperation we're trying to follow some of the financial ties there have been some evident eyes to Russia ties to Russia between some of the Associates of mr. Trump some of the payments we just want to follow that to ground whether with general Flynn or mister manna fort and I think it's important that we have that information the one thing about this committee and I know you're going to have Susan Collins on later in the program I'm very proud of the committee that it we have stayed bipartisan and we're going to follow the facts and every one of us Democrat or Republican realize this is one of most important things will ever do and wherever the facts lead we're going to follow will you be asking Treasury for any information about president Trump's ties to Russia I think there are inappropriate indication of financial ties we would look at those we've not seen those to date there's a lot of smoke we have no smoking gun but there's a every week there's more smoke that appears and we've got to sort Philip give me a sense of that larger smoke question there is still no proof of collusion so we're really are we on the question what smoke versus fire we have a number of contacts that took place between individuals affiliated with the Trump campaign and the Russians prior to elections and there are still some of those contacts but I don't think have been fully revealed then we have a series of contacts that took place between the election and the president's inaugural some of those were contacts and obviously didn't get disclosed originally cost general Flynn his job cost the Attorney General he had to recuse himself from the investigation because these individuals didn't fully disclose we have a series of contacts as well between mr. Kushner that some may have taken place before the election but obviously others after the auction then we have the series of events that took place since the president's been sworn in we're clearly Comey and potentially Rogers Coates and maybe others have been attempted that influenced by the president so as each week goes along and more stories break what I think the president deserves and the American public deserves is to go past reported press stories and actually get backs all right final very quickly anything off limits with coming on the questions I think he's going to have a chance to tell this story and I know every member is going to have a number of questions for him all right senator we're going to tell you well thank you so much for thank you to us and we'll be back in a minute

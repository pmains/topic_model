thank you Mr McMullen I want to address Kroger's Workforce practices and specifically how you accommodate or how you treat requests for accommodation let's suppose hypothetically that Kroger had a vegan worker with strong ethical beliefs about Animal Welfare if she requested to work outside say the butcher department and instead in the produce department would Kroger accommodate that request thank you senator for the question and it's one of the nice things about uh one of our retail stores there's many different areas and we routinely have people transferring between departments some of that is just personal interest some of that is to grow in their own personal career and if you look at our store directors 70 percent of our store directors started out as an hourly associate so it's easy to accommodate somebody and that accommodation is really based on their own desires and their own interests would you make such accommodations based on their Christian beliefs as well we would not get involved in terms of religious beliefs Okay the reason I ask is that you recently agreed to pay a hundred and eighty thousand dollars to settle a religious discrimination case in Conway Arkansas in that case two Kroger employees Brenda Lawson age 72 and Trudy Rickard age 57 declined the directive to begin wearing a new store apron with a multi-colored heart symbol on it they like many other of your employees felt uncomfortable with the new aprons because they thought the heart resembled a gay pride symbol rather than make accommodations Kroger fired these two employees one employee simply asked to cover the symbol with a name tag but Kroger refused even that reasonable accommodation are you aware of these terminations Mr McMillan uh Senator I am I am not this was not a private lawsuit either by two disgruntled employees Mr Mullen this was brought by the EEOC so are you not aware when your company is sued for religious discrimination by the United States government uh no sir I am not not always well I'm disappointed by that are you aware that Mr or Mr mcmuller you're aware that Kroger has something called an allyship guide for its employees uh yes Senator okay um in the allyship guide you direct employees to stop using sir and ma'am because they're not inclusive do you expect 72 year old employees in rural areas of Arkansas to really stop using words like sir and ma'am if you look at our allyship guide overall it's trying to support our Associates and going forward and trying to be inclusive for everybody with all different beliefs and when you look at our associate Resource Group our associate resource groups were created several years ago for people with different types of interests and we think it's incredibly important to be an inclusive opening culture to Welcome All Associates if employees in your stores in rural Arkansas refer to other employees or customers or service ma'am do they face disciplinary action uh I not that I'm aware of sir I would have to ask um are you still requiring employees to wear the apron with the rainbow heart symbol on it yeah if you the um if you look at this uh we we put in place an apron several years ago because our Associates wanted to have a common dress code uh the heart is a symbol of art the Kroger's fundamental purpose is to feed the human spirit and uh part of feeding the human spirit is the heart and that heart is our fundamental strategy to support our purpose uh the colors were not tied to uh any specific thing well I'm not sure I believe that because it was introduced during pride month as a supposed sign of inclusivity and a federal judge didn't agree with it either that's why he rejected your company's motion motion for summary judgment and you just paid 180 000 to two employees that you wrongly terminated by the way would you like to offer an apology here to Brenda Lawson and Trudy record for the ordeal they went through I would need to understand more of the details Center thank you okay so is it the case that you are still requiring all employees without accommodation to wear this apron with the rainbow heart uh if you look at the uh our apron would be required for all Associates to wear consistently across the company does it or does it not still include the symbol for which you just paid 180 000 to settle an EEOC lawsuit against your company uh it would include a heart on it uh Senator and having settled that lawsuit are you now going to Grant accommodations to employees who don't wish to display a symbol that they may perceive as not aligned with their moral and Christian views uh Senator I will uh thank you for the question I will need to follow back up with our team with more of the details if this merger goes through who's going to be making decisions about uniforms and the combined company and whether to Grant reasonable accommodations if you look on in terms of our fundamental uniform that was put in place our associate resource groups work together in terms of Designing the uniform and uh and we would use the same type of approach on a combined company basis okay um you know this situation reminds me a little bit of the situation big tech companies have found themselves in in recent years they've come to Washington because they fear regulation from our Democratic friends or action by the Biden Administration and they expect Republicans who are traditionally more supportive of free enterprise to come to their defense and I've cautioned them for years that if they silence uh conservatives and Center rights uh voters across the country if they discriminate against them in their company they probably shouldn't come and ask Republican Senators to carry the water for them whenever our Democratic friends want to regulate them or block their mergers so I I've heard a lot a lot of questioning about that today and I've read a lot about it in the news and I'll say this I'm sorry that's happening to you best of luck

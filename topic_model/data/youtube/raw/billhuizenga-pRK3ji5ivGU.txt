now to a story that we've been following for weeks it could affect your money once again the u.s senate has failed the lower interest rates for new student loans they automatically doubled to 6.8 percent when a deadline passed on july first and you heard from democratic senator debbie stavenow about 20 minutes ago and now we're getting the other side of the debate 24 news 8's political reporter rick alban spoke with republican representative bill heisiga this afternoon congressman the question about tuition interest payments for students has been a hot one on capitol hill senate took another run at it today couldn't make anything happen what's going to happen to those interest rates well unfortunately it looks like due to the senate's inability to deal with the house and our solution that we passed almost eight weeks ago those those interest rates are going to double and it shouldn't happen doesn't need to happen we've offered a market-based solution and as the president had requested back a while ago in his own budget and unfortunately they're not willing to go along with that once again rick the problem is is the senate is wanting to kick the can down the road they don't want to make the tough decisions this was last year's solution to give us a one year reprieve to go figure out what we're going to do to solve this issue and well here we are again a year later and they want to do the exact same thing given that the house has come up with their own solution which is tied to the fluctuating market rates that the senate has been unwilling to take up up to now with their failure to be able to pass an extension today do you think it's more likely that they'll take up the house plan well they should uh the sad reality is if they don't uh interest rates are going to double on these kids on these students it shouldn't happen it doesn't need to happen uh we we we've got a solution in front of us here and one that frankly the president had asked for originally so we need to proceed with that and i i hope that the realities of what they're dealing with are going to come home to roost and that they're willing to to look at what the house has done who does this impact because there are a lot of people that are watching right now who have loans that may be four or five or seven or ten years old but we're really dealing with new loans is that true yeah this will be for new loans that is uh is not going to affect those currently having those loans but we know that college is getting more and more expensive that's a separate issue but one that's vitally important to address as well the cost of college not just the interest rates that kids are taking on when they when they have these loans we've got to start talking about why and how much college costs but this is going to be for kids going into college i can tell you it's it's a niece of mine that is starting college it's a nephew of mine who's going to be starting college soon that that are affected and frankly my kids and in all of our kids uh here in the near future uh if if we don't tackle this congressman thank you for your time

house gop with steve scalise is the ranking republican on the select subcommittee on the coronavirus crisis a poll from last week here at fox news uh when you think about the origins of kovidge which is more likely 60 of people said created in a lab only 31 evolved from nature so with that kind of number like 60 you'd think you could get a bipartisan hearing going what happened there yeah dana good to be with you and you would think that speaker pelosi would be joining with us to want to get to the bottom of how this virus started especially when you've seen mountains of evidence recently come out that point even more strongly to the likelihood that it started in the wuhan lab look we were calling over a year ago house republicans calling for a hearing we weren't saying we knew it started there we just saw a lot of evidence that pointed to it starting in the lab in fact many medical experts over a year ago were saying it may have started in the lab and for some perplexing reason speaker pelosi keeps trying to cover up for china not wanting to have a hearing and have some accountability to get answers so we said if they're not going to do it we'll just do it ourselves so we're having a hearing today we've got a lot of medical experts other people who have done extensive research into the origin of covet i mean look this has killed over 600 000 americans millions worldwide why wouldn't speaker pelosi have a hearing our name of their our committee is the select subcommittee on the corona virus and yet they refuse to have a hearing on the origin of the coronavirus so we're going to do it ourselves and i think we're going to start getting some answers all right well we'll pay attention to that i also wanted to ask you about this uh latest messaging from the white house suggesting that it's actually republicans who are the ones that want to defund the police here's cedric richmond he's of course a senior advisor to the president watch let's talk about who defunded the police when we were in congress last year trying to pass a rescue plan i'm sorry not the rescue plan but an emergency relief plan for cities that were cash strapped and laying off police and firefighters it was the republicans who objected to it so look republicans are very good at staying on talking points of who says defund the police but the truth is they defunded the police the white house press secretary said the same thing so now you can imagine the entire white house apparatuses are going to be pushing this message that's the republicans fault how do you plan to fight back against that well by putting a mirror up and just reminding them what they in fact did over the last year everybody knows it was democrats who started this crazy radical extremist move to defund police all the big city mayors that defunded their police whether it's new york los angeles chicago they're all democrats and in fact you had democrats here in congress speaker pelosi just recently called police storm troopers you had one of her top lieutenants in congress on the democrat side who said police are inherently racist and need to be abolished that's democrats who did it now they're seeing the dumpster fire they created i mean crime's up uh yet almost 80 shootings in chicago over the weekend where they defunded police and so what is their answer to admit that they were wrong they never admit they were wrong they just want to try to blame somebody else you know i do wonder about this though because they might not ever say that they're wrong however the fact that they're even trying to blame republicans for this and not trying to embrace it to me says that they are seeing the same numbers that we're seeing which is that the the numbers that on public approval that are dragging biden down have to do with two main issues crime and immigration yeah the public the public has dramatically rejected this crazy defund the police idea and in fact in many of those big cities where they defunded the police or where people are against it the most because they're the ones who have to live through the consequences you see so many of these council members who voted to defund police are begging for private security while they voted to take security away from everyone else they're all democrats who voted to do that and now they're seeing the results of it the public's turning against it because they see crime out of control they see police resignations off the charts and so what's their answer they should be working to admit it was a mistake and then go fix it and instead they just want to try to blame somebody else it's not working but it shows you how failed of a crazy idea defund police really is come on it's not going to it's not going to help anybody that's out there and in these communities that need more police protection steve scalise great to see you we'll pay attention to the hearing that you're having later today thank you thanks dana

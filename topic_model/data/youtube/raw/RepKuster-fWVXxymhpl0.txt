thank you madam chair and thank you for allowing me to wave on to your subcommittee i'm grateful for the opportunity many americans have benefited from technological advances including high-speed broadband the internet mobile phones which many of us take advantage daily however we also know by some accounts 95 of domestic abuse cases involve technology and countless others have suffered or perpetrated abuse online dr condrey i'm so grateful for your expertise and your experience in your testimony you define digital abuse as people exploiting technology to harm others specifically involving the use of technology to control harass stop survey or threaten someone in a way that invades their privacy or autonomy or harms them emotionally physically reputationally or financially can you describe for us how family plans would you refer to as a snake in the grass can be a tool of such abuse absolutely thank you congresswoman and thank you for your leadership on on this bill you know one source of common information uh is is just the phone bill or other account records right which which reveal uh you know details about a victim's communications and can also provide clues about their location you know such as the area codes that they're calling um or call patterns that they're making some family plans also allow an abuser to kind of listen uh to a victim's voicemails and sometimes even see their their text messages and so you know these kinds of of surveillance this level of surveillance and the type of surveillance just creates this justified i think anxiety as much as anything else and i think that's what's at stake here well thank you for your good work and i'm proud to have introduced the safe connection acts it's a bipartisan bill with the health subcommittee chair representative anna eshoo and republican representative mr wahlberg which provides a clear template for survivors to work with their phone carriers to exit from a family or shared account that they share with their abusers uh again dr condrey can you explain how the safe connection act will help these survivors certainly so i think you know although a victim could simply abandon their phone um you know theoretically and and maybe avoid some of the risks that i've talked about during my testimonies today of course there are many reasons why that might actually do them more harm than good because phones are so often lifeline amid abuse and so even if you know then there are the high fees that come associated currently with kind of leaving a family phone plan and so even if they have the funds to be able to leave they can still encounter resistance from a phone company that has no legal obligation to honor line separation requests and so a bill like the safe connections act that would you know give them the right to leave safely and quickly would be hugely important um thank you for that and i think you may have addressed this question but i'll just ask it quickly survivors of digital abuse with limited resources and income are often unaware that they may qualify for participation in federal programs that provide a discount on phone and broadband services such as the lifeline and affordable connectivity programs but the safe connection act requires the fcc to adopt rules to allow survivors facing financial hardship to enroll in one of these programs as quickly as possible whether or not they otherwise meet the qualifications of the programs so they can receive a discount off of service for a short period of time while they're getting back up on their feet why again dr contrera is it important to ensure that these abuse survivors are able to maintain consistent communication services after they're allowed to separate from the shared account with their abuser absolutely happy to reiterate on this point because it is so important i think and and it's just that people remain in deeply precarious positions long after they attempt to leave a relationship in one form or another and so being connected through their phones is just crucial in regaining their independence and in guarding against future abuse and this again was always true but it feels important to stress that these last two years of course our reliance on technology increasingly and the way that our you know many of our interactions have been filtered through technology more and more has increased this risk of digital abuse but it also means it's more important than ever for us to be able to use our devices safely whether that's for social connections work ordering food testifying before congress you know all of these different ways it just shows how important it is and so survivors should be entitled to do that safely well thank you and thank you dr valentin as well for your work and on behalf of the many members of the bipartisan task force to end sexual violence i'm pleased to see the safe connections act come forward today at this hearing thank you madam chair and i yield back

IT'S ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO SEE  YOU. WHAT MESSAGE IS THE U.S SENDING TO UKRAINE AND RUSSIA WITH THIS  AID PACKAGE? >> WELL, WE'RE EXPSSIN NOT  ONLY OUR SOLIDARITY WITH  UKRAINE. WE'RE DOING EVERYTHIN WE CAN TO HELP IT ACHVE VICTORY IN ITS  DENSE OF ITS NATION, A AND IN MY VIEW, A GREATER MESSAGE NOT ONLY TO RUSSIA BUT TO OTHERS THAT  THIS IS ALSO A DEFENSIVE RULE OF LAW AND THE PROPOSIONON THAT YOU JUST CANNOT TAKE OVER A COUNTRY  AND CNGE ITS TERRITORIAL  BOUNDARIES BY FORC ANDUR ASSISTANCE TO UKRAINE IS A MANIFESTATION OF THAT VIEW. WE WAN TO DO EVERYTHINGE CAN TO HP THE UKRAINIANS ACHIEVE  VICTORY AGAINST RUSSIAND THE  WAR CRIMES THAT RUSSIA HAS  COMMITTED IN UKRAINE. WHEN YOU MATCH TODAY'S VOTE WITH THE FACT THAT OUR EMBASSY IN  KYIV HAS BEEN REOPENED AND  YESTERDAY TO THE SENATE FOREIGN  RELATIONS COMMITTEE W PASSED  THROUGH THE U.S. AMBASSADOR TO  UKRAINE AND LAST NHT THE  SENATE IN LIGHTNING SPEED AGREED TO CON FIM HER AND SHE'LL BE ON  HER WAY. E CULMINAON OF A THOSE  THIN IS AOWERFUL MESSAGE  THAT WE'RE IN TOTAL SUPPORT OF  UKRAINEND ITS FIGHT AGAINST  THIS AGGRESSION OF VLADIMIR  PUTIN. >> SENATOR, CLOSER TO HOME, THE  BIN ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED  IS WEEK IT IS EASING  RESTRICTIONS ONCUBA, ILUDING  EASIER TRAVEL, REMTANCES AND  INVESTMENT INTO THE  REGIME-CONTROLLEDUBAN ECONY.  MOVE YOU CALLED THE WRONG  MESSAG TO THE WRONG PEOPLE AT THE WRONG TE AND FOR ALL THE WRONG ASONS. WHY? >> WE SEE THE REGIME'S RESPONSE. ON THE D THE ADMINISTRATION  ANNOUNCED THESE UNILATERAL  CONCESSIONS TO THE REGI, THE  REGIME PUT INTO LAW AS PART OF  THEIR PENAL CODE SWEEPING  DRACONIAN CONSEQUENCES FOR  PEOPLE WHO EXERCISE WHAT WE WOULD CALL HERE IN THE UNITED  STATES, FREE SPEECH, INCLUDING  THE DEATH PENALTY UNDER CERTAIN  CIRCUMSTANCES FOR WHAT WOULD BE  AN ACT OF FREE SPEECH. INSTEAD OF INSISTING THE REGIME  MOVE TOWARDS CHANGE OF RESPECT  FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, PEACEFUL  PROTESTS, GIVIN A VOICE TO THE  CUBAN PEOPLE, AND STOPPING THE  ILING OF DISSIDENTS, WHAT WE  HAVE IS A UNILATERAL CONCESSION THAT ULTIMATELY WAS RESPONDED TO BY HAVING A PENAL CODE THAT  INCLUDES T DEATH PENALTY FOR  FR SPEECH ACTIVITIES. >> ANOTHER UNILATERAL MOVEMENT  WAS WITH VEZUELA, THE BIDEN  ADMINIRATION AOUNCING THIS  WEEK IT'S EASING RESTRICTIONS ON CHEVRON'S ABILITY TO DO WORK  WITH THE VENEZUELAN REGIME AND  THE NEPHEW OF THE VENEZUELAN  FIRST LADY, ACCUSED OF DRUG  TRAFFICKING. YOU ALSO SMMED THIS IN A  STATEMENTAYING GIVING  UNDESERVED HANDOUTS JUS SO HIS  REGIME WILL SIT DOWN AT THE  NEGOTIATIN TAB IS A STRATEGY  DESTINED TO FAIL. WHY? >>E SAW MADURO DO ABSOLUTELY  NOING,NCLUDING HUMANARIAN  ASSISTAN TO THE PEOPLE OF  VENEZUELA. WE TALK ABOUT UKRAINE AND THE 5, 6 MILLIONHO HAVE FLED UKRAINE  IN TS HORRIFIC WA WELL, THERE ARE 5 MILLION  VENEZUELANS THAT HAV LEFT  VENEZUEL UNDER HI HERE WE ARE WORKING IN  DICTATORSHS IN A WAY THAT  DOESN'T STAND UP FOR OUR  PROPOSION OF DEMOCRA AND  HUMAN RITS AND RULE OF LAW. WE DIDN'T GETNY OF THE  AMERICAN CITIZS WHO ARE  UNJULY IN PRISON IN VENEZUELA. WE DIDN'T BRING IN HUMANITARIAN  COURT AND HUMANITARIA  ORGANIZATIONS AND THE HAVE NOT  RETURNED TO THE NEGOTIATING  TABLE. SO, I DON'T UNDERSTAND THESE  MOVES WHEN WE GET NOTHING IN  RESPONSE. SO, I THINK THAT'S WHY I DE  THE STATEMENTS I DID. >> SENATOR, YOU ALSO SIT O THE  SENATE FINANCE COMMITTE WHAT'S YOUR REACTION TO THIS  BA FORMULA CRISISE'RE SEEING IN OUR COUNTRY? WHAT COULD O NEEDS TO BE DONE?  WELL, I'M GLAD TO SEE THE FDA HAS COME TO AN AGREEMENTITH  ABBOTT, WHICH IS THE BIGGEST  PRODUCER OF BABY FORMULA. I'M ALSO HAPPY TOEE THE  PRESENT HAS INVOKED THE  DEFENSE PDUCTION ACT AS A WAY  TO MAXIMIZE THE PRODUCTION OF  BABY FORMULA. OF COURSE, THIS ALL STARTED WHEN ABBOTT'S LABORATORIES WERE -- OR FACTORY WHERE T FORMULA WAS  CREATED EDENTLY HAD SOME LEVEL OF CONTAMINATION AND AFFECTED  SOME CHILDREN. SO IT WAS SHUT DOWN. THAT CREAT THE CONSEQUENCE. ALSO I SEE T PRESIDENT HAS  CREAD AN AVENUE FOR BABY  FORMULA THAT MAY BE CREATED  ABRO AND CAN BE ACCEPTED IO  THE UNITED STATES TO BE ACCTED DURING THIS INTERIM PERIOD. SO, OBVIOUS THIS IS A CRITICA EFFORT AND IMPORNTO SO MANY  FAMILIES IN OUR COUNTRY. AND S I'M GLAD TO SEE ALLHE  ENTS OF T FEDERAL  VERNMENT CAN COME TOGETHERO  MAKE THIS HAPPEN IS COMING  TO

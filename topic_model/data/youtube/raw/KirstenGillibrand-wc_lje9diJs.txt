it's equal pay day it is a day that symbolizes that it takes this many months into the new year for women to make the same amount of money as men we are still 80 cents to a man's dollar 61 cents for African American women 53 cents for Latina women what gives we still as a country are struggling to value women and we see it across the board we don't have equal pay for equal work and if you're a woman of color you will learn even less the fact that we don't have national paid leave or affordable daycare or universal pre-k basic structural changes that would make it possible for more women to work at their fullest economic potential it's a drag on the US economy not paying women equal pay for equal work means the economy is less strong it means that for 40 percent of the workplace they're not actually earning what they would be earning if they were a white man it's a problem it's a real issue and so we as legislators and you as an advocate and someone who reveals the truth in the news we have to keep speaking out about it cuz it's just not right and it's hurting the US economy

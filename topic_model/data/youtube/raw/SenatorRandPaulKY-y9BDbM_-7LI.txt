recognize the ranking member for some uc's um i'd just like to ask unanimous consent i think we've entered these before just to make sure they're there for people these are the letters to the planned parenthood of washington and delaware they're from the associate administrator of the small business administration under the previous administration and i'm told that these letters are not sent without a process everyone has to review and sign off on these papers there is a paper trail and so it was said earlier there was no paper trail there isn't a paper trail and this was an official policy of the small business administration not i like to ask unanimous consent that they be entered into the record without objection so ordered and uh senator paul i'm going to ask that the administrator's response to your letter dated may 25th yesterday be made part of the record and it does answer senator marshall's inquiry about the penalties and they're pretty severe it's uh for false statements it's it's prison time and heavy fines depending on which section is violated it can be as much as 30 years and a million dollars but the false statements that sba generally fall into the five year 20 uh maximum 250 000 fine range so we'll make that part of the record as well

figures well u.s lawmaker tom malinowski has been a proponent of sanctions against china i want to get his reaction now to cnn's exclusive report um thanks for joining us um you will have seen our report amnesty international releasing a report stating that thousands of uyga families are being forcibly split up in chiang zhang and children being prevented from leaving the region to be with their parents we brought you our extensive uh reporting to our viewers from my colleague david culver just before the break um your response to that reporting i i found it heartbreaking but unfortunately not surprising we've known for some years now that the chinese government is engaged in an effort to essentially eradicate the weaker culture to make everything that is unique about the identity of the of the weaker people um to make it disappear because it threatens their conception of a unified country under communist party rule and the effect that it has on individual families is sometimes lost because the numbers of people affected are so great we hear about hundreds of thousands of people locked up in camps and that's a number and what you've done is to put a face and a name to the victims i think that's incredibly important for for your viewers to see the us eu and canada also the uk introducing sanctions on several chinese officials over human rights violations in the region of xinjiang i should note that the chinese communist party has been accused of committing genocide there by human rights experts the dutch and canadian parliaments and also the outgoing trump administration now look these sanctions are the first multinational effort uh to punish beijing since joe biden took office the question is will this move or these moves actually have a meaningful impact on the chinese government or its actions in xing so here here's what's really significant about this action it that it was done by the united states the european union canada the united kingdom together this is something that that we've not been able to muster in the past a joint international response holding specific chinese officials accountable for these crimes the chinese diplomacy is all about splitting uh us from our allies it's about isolating their critics and then putting pressure on those isolated critics so i do think that this is something that will cause significant concern in in beijing that for the first time uh all of the the the leading democracies of the world or many of them have come together to make the statement and then you know i would say the important thing here is also that we are trying to win an argument with the chinese communist party it is very difficult to change the policies of a powerful country like china but imagine what the world would be like if we just watched this and did absolutely nothing if we allowed china's actions to become the new normal in the world we're trying to win an argument about what is right and what is wrong what is acceptable and what is not in the international stage the genocide is not acceptable whether we affect china's actions or not i hope we do but it's essential to establish for everybody in the world that this is wrong president biden has made it absolutely clear that containing china's aggressive rise is his top foreign policy goal uh the first meeting between his administration and chinese officials last week in alaska underscored that the two countries quite frankly are engaged in an ideological power struggle over issues like trade and human rights now look since the nixon era the u.s has had a policy of engagement with china meaning consistent dialogue in areas of mutual interest i wonder whether at this stage you believe that that is clearly no longer the case and if so can you talk me through what the new strategy is as you understand it sir sure so i would not phrase it as an effort to curb china's rise the problem is not china there's nothing wrong with china or the chinese people or the chinese nation what this is about is defense of international standards and norms of rules that should apply to every single country we're not standing up against china we are standing up for human rights we are standing up for fair trading rules we are standing up for state sovereignty and the law of the sea and the rule that big countries cannot just steal territory from others because they are they are bigger it's about standing up for principles that the chinese communist party is challenging and i think that's the difference between joe biden's approach and donald trump's trump's was more anti-china which is no way to win the support of the chinese people or the people of the rest of the world biden's approach is more standing up for universal international norms and bringing democratic countries together in that effort these sanctions related to what's happening in xinjiang are an early sign that what biden is doing is working that he is building an international coalition i could talk about this all evening with you sir but i have got other things uh that are important although i have to say this is absolutely top of our priority list at present um it is extremely important and i do appreciate your time and this evening perhaps we will talk again as we continue to watch this space thank you my colleague

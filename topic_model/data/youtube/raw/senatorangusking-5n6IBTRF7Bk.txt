Thank You mr. chairman I want to follow up on the point that Senator Reid made each of you testified that the cost over and above the current budget to modernize the the the military and to get us to a place where we should be and we all agree around this table that we should be it's around a trillion or something over a trillion dollars the senator used the word ironic I use the word preposterous that later today or tomorrow we're gonna pass a bill that is going to take between a minimum of a billion of a trillion five and probably more like 2.2 trillion which the once the cuts are extended which everyone knows they will be out of the budget which I believe will make it flat impossible to do the work that you're suggesting is necessary for us to do this the the implications of what we're doing today or tomorrow to trying to achieve the level of defense of this country that you all have told us is absolutely necessary it just can't happen and so I that's not a question that's that's an observation I want to move now to the question I'm I'm somewhat astonished and disappointed that not a single one of you talked about anything other than military hardware defending the national security the United States involves a continuum it seems to me that in that goes from diplomacy to war war is the most expensive and least desirable of those outcomes I think of Afghanistan our success there will ultimately depend upon the success of the government in Afghanistan to gain the confidence of its people in Iraq the relationship between the government of Iraq and the Kurds and the Sunni population is going to determine whether Iraq ultimately is a successful state North Korea the the the solution to North Korea lies through diplomacy with China I think everyone appreciates and understands that the reason that Iran is not North Korea today is because of the jcpoa that was passed two years ago otherwise we would be according to the intelligence services we would be dealing with an Iran within a nuclear weapon today about two years from when we passed that bill Israel Palestine a major flashpoint in terms of conflict in the Middle East it's all about diplomacy don't we have to talk about that as part of a national defense strategy this is the tyranny where the Armed Services Committee and we've got Foreign Affairs Foreign Relations but it's that's part of the strategy and I'm very disappointed that that that isn't part of the discussion dr. Carlin talked to me about this this and right now by the way under the under the current dispensation this part of the strategy that is diplomacy is being drastically downgraded budgets cut at the State Department's fire we don't have an ambassador to South Korea for example or even a nominee dr. Carlin talked to me about this this problem sir unfortunately you're spot on when you look at the senior diplomats who have left the State Department in the last year it's almost equal to about 30 percent of the u.s. general officer a flag officer corps I suspect of about 30 percent of the general officers or flag officers left this committee would be having a set of really serious hearings and unfortunately that's not just a today problem that is a real future problem I also suspect if you ask most of us as much as we want more money for defense we would be delighted if that could go to the State Department what we'll probably keep happening is that we'll see an increase neutering of the State Department and of diplomacy more broadly and by the way what's going on now with people leaving and being driven out I understand it's already reflecting itself in people who are applying for the foreign service applications are down something like 30% indeed I think it was actually about 50% it's pretty substantial so this has really long ranging consequences for the future of American national security as you know no one takes these jobs for the money they take these jobs because they want to help make the world better and if they don't see that opportunity they'll go do something else and so it's it's really profoundly worrying across the board I think a lot of us aren't really terribly sure what to do about it but what will likely happen is you will see the State Department get increasingly neutered everyone will turn to the Pentagon and ask the military to fill those roles and the military will salute and they will try to fill those roles but they aren't as capable to do so moreover there will be a real opportunity cost because they won't actually be focused on fighting and winning wars or preparing for the future they'll be trying to be pseudo diplomats well do you have a thought on this point no look diplomacy is undoubtedly important and I had undoubtedly important it isn't yeah no and and I worked at the pleasure of working for a secretary of defense who worked very hard to increase the size of the State Department however you know diplomacy is much more effective when it's backed by credible military power right and nor can diplomacy be a substitute for the military I'm certainly not asserting that yeah but what I'm asserting is that if you've got two pieces here we're talking about strengthening one and while the other is atrophying before our eyes and I think that's a serious national security concern I would agree and I think it is unfortunately it's been a long-term trend across administrations but with in terms of funding of the State Department you know and and and attracting the best and the brightest I think it is an issue that needs to be addressed thank you Thank You mr. chairman

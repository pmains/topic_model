i want to thank everyone our panel for participating these issues are so so critical critical right now particularly in the middle of a pandemic and i have almost everyone in my family either is either active duty right now some are transitioning out some have already transitioned and so i know secondhand not firsthand um how critically important these issues are today so my first question is going to be for the entire panel who's with us uh this morning um briefly in a few sentences what is the biggest challenge that each of your organizations are facing regarding tab and then how can we uh how do you believe those issues that issue your number one issue can be resolved i'll start if uh my colleagues don't mind the biggest the biggest issue facing dod today i would say is data data yes ma'am data we have a lot of information uh on the the period of time leading up to the time that a person actually transitions but what we don't have today is data that talks to what happens to that service member after they transition and i think that's very important uh in our in our annual report to congress we talk about data and the data needs that we have last year in the 2020 in addition it was an appendix j as well and so um i would say there are data for external organizations to help us better ascertain how we did as the service member was moving up to transition because i've heard from everybody talking earlier you know we do reasonably well i think in getting up to transition but we really don't have the data that tells us how a service member has done afterwards we don't can't really tell how well did we do and so that type of data is what's needed i think for example the social security administration rs information such as that from those organizations would help us and that was more than a couple of sentences i thank you that's okay well it's just a problem you're on that where you're on that comment um is there any effort currently today to try to collect some of that information or is there no ability to do that right now that's a great question um that we need to work on okay uh yeah curious yeah we have had some conversations but we could certainly use the help of the committee to help move that forward for us yeah that's that's great and is anybody else on the panel uh would like to comment on their largest challenge and then potentially what might be a resolution yeah go ahead cheryl i was just going to echo it's it's not only the data platforms it's the data sharing um for sure and um relationships with public private partnerships and for us it's about finding that sweet stock sweet spot and delivering the message so people can retain the information because we know this is a lot gotcha after that the congresswoman is that one of the challenges that i think was spoken by their was that veterans still have to figure out what they want to do what they are transitioning out and that was a challenge even as someone when i tried out was still consistent today and we that we have tremendous amount of resources with all of the agencies listed here but getting those resources to meet somebody's individual needs when they are transitioning out it will continue to be a challenge so getting the ability to identify what they want to do when they transition out is really important because we can then identify resources that meet those specific needs gotcha and then um i also had a question for captain stevens um understanding that it's difficult for dod to replicate the three months uh your three bond transition program what are maybe some potential critical elements that you believe should we try to incorporate from your program into yours to help improve the transition process and for the question uh i believe working on the first phase of our program which is all about purpose and the strategy of defining who you are first as a person what makes you thick uh i think that is the the critical element that is currently missing our phase two of the program is all the tactical tools that complements what the what the uh transition assistance programs do um but but i really think going back to that phase one of defining purpose what makes you thick what's going to make you happy and building in an incredibly professional manner great and mr chairman i yield my time thank you

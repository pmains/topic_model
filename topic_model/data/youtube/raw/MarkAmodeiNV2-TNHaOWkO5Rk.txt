these folks basically declared war on energy on day one yep and even though they've come out a couple times and said hey we're trying to do this encourage this or that nothing can speak more clearly than the fact that they canceled a bunch of leases which heretofore had been fine one in alaska some in the gulf where were you going don't tell me that you really are concerned about this you are clearly against fossil fuels you have ignored and listen well he said he said so we got to give him credit for that at least he's doing what he said he was going to do it still ain't very good well yeah but but now that he's doing it and it's like well there's impacts and because remember your question was inflation leading the charge is fuel fuel to produce food fuel for people to travel in their cars go to work or whatever fuel to haul stuff to grocery stores supply chain and so there's plenty to talk about but make no mistake it's fuel and what it costs in the war on that before you get to you know the old american rescue plan where people are going oh my god the deficit and it's like yeah there was uh there was four and a half trillion dollars that fit the old rom emmanuel thing oh goodness where it was like you never want to waste a good emergency so let's call it all covered and then and then put through a bunch of money and it's like well part of it is there's too much money and it's just like well yeah it's probably worth noting who didn't vote for buildback better and and no disrespect to my contracting pals but the infrastructure thing quite frankly where it requires taxpayers to pay for building electric charging stations one of the things dan every 50 miles now now i know that that you're not geography challenged but you drive from here to vegas you drive from here to ely you drive from here to elko it's like really there's really not a wide spot every 50 miles and you start thinking about all of that stuff where it's like hey we don't care about the facts or the impacts we're pursuing this at a time when china is continuing to create um between 25 and 30 percent of all of the carbon-based emissions in the world and you know what you know what we're requiring from them nothing yeah i've said that very often we can we can do all the cutting back and you know cutting of carbon and all that that we want but if russia and china don't play ball it's not going to really mean anything here's the other thing that nobody's talking about but i can't imagine why in the national press nobody's talking about the progress that we've made in this country on fossil fuel emission yeah cleaning it up nobody's for dirty air it's like guess what it is possible to generate electricity with coal in a much more responsible fashion than 30 years ago the tank has been that way too correct the tailpipes and smoke stacks of trucks that are delivering goods to your retail outlets or cars that you're commuting in those emission statistics keep getting better that doesn't mean that electric isn't a big part of the future and we shouldn't continue to pursue that but to basically try to put a gun to america's business and individual heads and say fossil fuels will bear no part of of your transportation when you're like well how are you generating that electricity mm-hmm anyhow you you kind of well there's one more question there's one more thing too as you mentioned the the oil and gas leases you know not only has he says we're opening all that back up but he's put as many roadblocks in place as he can including jack and the royalty payments up about 50 percent well and and here's the other thing where he said go oh no we're we're actually for this we want to make permitting easier and stuff like that like maybe for lithium for those batteries since we got a couple of those in nevada it's like guess what yeah you've said a b and c but the whole story takes d e and f and guess what you've changed in d e and f for permitting for those people in nevada yeah and by the way and by the way the environmentalists don't like lithium mines either so they're they're fighting those every chance that's because all mines are evil i mean of course of course it's impossible to extract minerals in a in a responsible environmental manner it's like well i don't know these companies have been doing a pretty good job of it for the last 30 years here in nevada yeah congressman mark amada is here with us on the dan mason show news talk 780 koh hear a lot of talk about recession possible recession the list of things that that are kind of wonky in the country is is pretty big are we digging ourselves too deep a hole to get out of here you know what i don't see anything in the administration changing their course in terms of how they view energy um how they their foreign policy is like huh the war on corporate america that's a familiar one oh we can get out of this by uh by uh uber taxing the mega rich or whatever and it's like i don't see anything that's gonna um that's gonna change this trajectory i hope i'm wrong but i think the next two years are going to be tougher than the last year and a half yeah they just uh they just might be and of course he keeps you know attacking business every chance he gets for for price gouging but i've yet to see the evidence of that have you no it's just it's a it's a cliche the culture of cliche is in full control there um and and so even though people even people that used to go okay are getting tired of it because the the absolute in-your-face impacts are you know it's like well you tell you tell me whether it's baby baby formula whether it's child care whether it's driving to and from work whether it's finding some tires to put on your car um buy a plane ticket i mean there's there's no safe haven for what these folks's agenda is bringing yeah you mentioned the baby formula so that's been the the big news the last couple of days it's it seems you know the sudden shortage of baby formula something that's actually been going on for several months now we just haven't heard much about it that oh look now we've got another crisis in front of us nobody's mind in the store to try to get ahead of it and think of a solution you know you're in trouble when it's the blame game instead of how do you fix this yeah what do we need to do different to keep whatever on the shelves if that's what it is or to keep trucks running at something other than what the heck's diesel up to now i mean it's it's i don't know i don't even know if i want to know that yeah is there anything where everybody knows what the problem is whether it's baby formula or something else but the baby forming in particular is really a scary kind of situation i heard a story today that we're delivering pallets of baby formula to the southern border so we're apparently being illegal is better than being a citizen now well and not only that is after you get your baby formula they're going to get a plane to come that you can load up onto sure in the middle of the night if it was that righteous a thing wouldn't you do it during the at noon or one o'clock in the middle of the night and and we're going to sneak you into someplace else away from the border the bad news for them is once they take their free ride there may not be as much baby formula available wherever they're taking them huh yeah they might be better off yeah you know not uh not going there um you know the real question is on the baby formula issue there's a lot of talk about it today what could the president and maybe congress do what can you do to speed this up we're kind of in trouble because none of this kind of stuff happens fast you just can't snap our fingers and make more tomorrow well first of all that the one plant that they're talking about in michigan is like what was the problem what was the you know impure product whatever what caused the recall fix that in other words fix it now now you say well they called it they called it potential salmonella so i don't even know if it was actually real and it's been three months more testing in there so you can test it more robustly but keep them cranking that stuff out and so you know the thing that and this is just reality i mean listen nobody's ever accused congress of being nimble okay but the reality is the vast majority of the federal workforce works in the executive branch so whether it's the food and drug administration whether it's department of j whoever it is so those folks that are about uh food purity is that's a federal thing so you get your you get your fda head guy or girl in there and go i want you to get up there and give me a plan to have those guys back online in a week well it's been months and so you sit there well no we it's like when you when your priority is agenda and not solving problems this is what you get well you have to ask yourself what has the fda been doing about this in these three months since they shut the plant down apparently little or nothing that's what it appears uh to be and then when you say well we got to get them going against oh my god there's this there's that it's like hey cut through whatever and get it going and even if they do that what i i did hear this today that you know it's probably going to take a couple of more weeks i heard one person say today for the fda to reauthorize the plan then another couple of weeks to get the plan up and running then six to eight weeks before any of it shows up in the stores that's not fast and the other thing is is nobody should accept that for it's like hey no we're up there now what do we need it was kind of like when donald trump and they're going like hey um it turns out ventilators weren't a great idea but at the time it's like we need more ventilators they use the defense production act yeah it's like okay well let's start making them um and and same with with operation warp speed on the vaccine now some people nobody wants to be forced to take it but it's like hey we're pulling all the plugs to bring that out as soon as possible for those folks who do want to take it he's congressman mark abbott

an Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu are set to meet Monday and the top issue is how to stop Iran's nuclear program joining us now are two key members of the Senate Armed Services Committee just back from the Middle East Republican Lindsey Graham and Democrat Richard Blumenthal and senators welcome to both of you the President and Prime Minister will be wrestling with two key questions tomorrow first what are their red lines how far each leader will allow Iran to go before giving up on diplomacy and how second a second how committed is each to a military strike if Iran crosses that red line senator Graham what does President Obama need to say to Prime Minister Netanyahu to reassure that I am committed to stopping Iran from getting nuclear weapon not only in words but in deeds that if necessary we'll use military force and they need a common definition of what change what kind of change would be acceptable on Iran's part it meaning the red line how far they're willing to allow a run be a common definition conveyed privately to Iran so they'll know what they need to do senator Blumenthal does President Obama need to go further than he has so far in reassuring the Israelis I think that he needs to give a more specific and muscular content to the formulaic expression has been used again and again and again all options are on the table to say that containment is not an option that a nuclear-armed Iran for all the reasons they stated so powerfully in the interview that he did recently with Jeff Goldberg is simply unacceptable because it would destabilize the Middle East it would create access for terrorists to nuclear armaments and it would make the Middle East a nuclear tinderbox and that's the kind of passion and specificity that he needs to bring to this conversation now all right on the other hand senator Blumenthal does Prime Minister Netanyahu need to give tougher sanctions that have been imposed an oil embargo by Europe against Iran tougher measures against Iran such rule bank does he need to give those more time to work before he launches a unilateral military strike you know Israel's interests are its own just as our interests have to be are owned our national interest has to be the guiding principle and the cooperation we come back from a trip recently the Middle East my impression is that that cooperation strategic and intelligence has never been stronger between these two allies and the Prime Minister Israel has to recognize that the United States has its own interest but in this case they are aligned with Israel's but but there is a disagreement here I mean there's is Senator Graham a disagreement at this point about when how far they should allow Iran to go and at what point a military strike should be towards the difference in capability as no but also a difference in their assessment of the service there's an intelligence picture difference but here's what we're agree on we've been talking with Iran for three years they keep enriching we've been sanctioning Iran seriously I think in an effective way for about the last six months they keep enriching their 3,000 kilograms of low-enriched uranium one and a half times more than need to make a bomb so here's the the situation in Israel their military capability is less than ours they'll come a point where these sites get hardened and they are being hard if they wanted to build a power plant for peaceful purposes the Iranians are going at it at a very odd way when you put their rhetoric and their behavior together with with their nuclear program if you're Israel you can't let you can't lose control of your own destiny so that's what the Prime Minister Israel told us we will not lose control of our own destiny we want sanctions to work we will give them time but when the Iranians get to the point our military capabilities not sufficient stop their program that's the red line for us and we have a different point militarily than they do and there's the conflict and how should that be resolved should it be resolved on what the Israeli capabilities are and what they at the point at which they have to strike we should be talking about today or should they be willing to rely on the United States basically we should not be talking about our differences we should be talking about our commonalities president statement on not contain Ian alarm Iran was great we should be talking about Iran's behavior not our differences and you got to understand this the Israeli government and people will not lose control of their own destiny period that's the end of the discussion from their point of view sanctions could work have not worked yet but they'll come a point in time where they will lose control of their destiny militarily and they're not going to let that happen and we should acknowledge it and say that's okay with us so that in other words when they say we will no longer have the capability to take out the nuclear problem we're not going to rely on the US we're going to do it ourselves you should understand that's a reasonable position for the Israelis to take and we should support that position and hope we never get there and hold that that our assurances will enable them to understand how we will be there a lie how we will stop a nuclear armed Iran how we will not tolerate it as a matter of our national interest not Israeli interest the focus is so much on restraining the Israelis but it ought to be on making sure that our commonality of interest is served by a strong United States policy that convinces the Iranians that they are crippling their economy they are brutalizing their people and the United States at the end of the day is not going to accept a nuclear-armed Iran let's turn to Afghanistan and the blowback to the burning of several qur'an's in that country the last couple of weeks in recent days six US servicemen have been killed by our Afghan partners and the reaction from some leading Republicans and conservatives has been striking there's some problems what you have to do is say you know you have to figure out how to live your own miserable life it's gotten to the point where why are we there if this is the end result of us being there let's get these people out bring them home in the hell with the place over there senator Graham are Newt Gingrich and Rush Limbaugh wrong they're expressing frustration but I know why we're there General Allen would be here in two weeks to tell the congressman where he's the commander of US forces commander I spent an hour on the phone with him there are 30 million afghans it breaks your heart when six soldiers are killed for an inadvertent of burning of a religious document they left their homes and their families to help the Afghans but this is not a total picture of what's going in Afghanistan we have made progress and we do have strong allies within Afghanistan so don't let this snapshot ruin the strategic importance General Allen will tell us why it's important we get it right if we leave and it falls back into Taliban hands and al-qaeda re-emerges will pay a heavy price history will not judge us by the day we left but by what we left behind in General Allen has a plan for us to withdraw our troops and the key to this is a strategic partnership agreement telling the Taliban the Iranians the Pakistanis will have a follow-on military force and the Taliban will never come back what we do after 2014 in the way we do it determines our long-term security answer senator Blumenthal same basic question to you when Afghan troops Afghan police are turning their weapons not on the Taliban but on US soldiers when you see leading conservatives saying it's time to go to the exits is it time to get out of Afghanistan we will be getting out of ass afghanistan hopefully went that strategic part in two and a half years on the timetable and with the strategy that General Allen and the commanders and the troops there are fallen so you have a dog I think if we can speed up and accelerate that withdrawal with the kind of strategic partnership that we are building and with special operators continuing to make the progress in taking out targets and turning over that function to the Afghans that certainly is a goal to be pursued but let's let's remember Chris very importantly three tremendous problems in Afghanistan economic weakness safe havens corruption in the government beyond this incident which is tragic absolutely tragic for both sides really there is an important point here that we need to stick to this strategy and overcome this incident finally finally I just because we're running out of time and I want to talk about one last trouble spot and that is Syria and the slaughter of the Opposition of civilians in Syria continues unabated senator Graham what should the u.s. do should we start arming the opposition and what do we do about Assad I think the opposition needs military support you could probably do it from the Arab League working with senator Blumenthal we're going to do a sense of the Senate resolution calling on the United Nations to declare Assad a war criminal because he is we need more international pressure we need to help the the rebels militarily economically and let Assad know that he's a international outlaw and be held accountable you say well I missed what you said when you said arm him in a what that I think the Arab League would be a good vehicle to provide military assistance to the opposition forces and we should consider that we should consider no Drive no flies on to pretty quickly so you're saying basically what we did in in Libya I think the Libyan model could serve as well senator blumenthal you know Secretary Clinton is doing a very good job of bringing together world community as well as the Arab League in support of some kind of aid to the opposition and that aid can be technical assistance communications equipment humanitarian aid financial support and if possible arms that would go in directly there means to do it but it should be under the auspices of the international community as Secretary Clinton is endeavoring to do and this resolution I think we'll send a very important message first of all on Iran on Israel on Syria we are bipartisan absolutely and bipartisanship is breaking out as i saw on this great trip that we took with Senator McCain there is very strong support for the kinds of initiatives that we saw in Libya and Libya is a model for how we can lead rebels but let me emphasize Chris no American troops none no American troops on the ground in direct aid that will bolster that opposition senator blumenthal senator Graham we're going to have to leave their want to thank you both so much for coming in today and we will see what comes out of that key Obama Netanyahu meeting tomorrow thank you gentlemen banky

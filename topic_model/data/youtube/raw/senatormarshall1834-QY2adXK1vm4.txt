senator marshall uh joins us right now uh senator marshall in particular no one's saying 10.4 million dollars is not his or he's anything corrupt but this is an astounding number yeah good morning brian look i think we're over the target now dr fauci lied over three different issues during that hearing including the public availability of his finances he lied about that we proved him wrong that they were not publicly available but we were finally able to get them and now we know why he was so defensive why he was visibly shaking he made over two million almost two million dollars in 2020 while the rest of the economy was shut down why so many people couldn't go to work and make a living he made almost two million dollars he's the highest paid federal employee right now making 434 thousand dollars a year more than the president of the united states significant investments in china as as well so we have great concerns about why he's so defensive about his investments senator what was your reaction to him calling you a on a hot mic and also did he contribute or his organization contribute to gain of function research in the wuhan lab right uh so we've all been in those heated moments i i didn't take it personal i think the more the bigger issue is that he he deceived he was lying to the american public that's the real issue here uh you mentioned the viral gain of function he's been lying about that as well we recently helped break uh earlier in that in that hearing an issue regarding viral gain of function that he was funding a particular research project that the department of defense refused to fund because they thought it was viral gain of function but he went ahead and went forward used the eco health system to help fund the wuhan lab to develop a furon cleavage site for the coveted virus he also won a million dollar israeli prize did he keep that money or is that good the nih well brian i near as weak until it looks like he probably kept about a hundred thousand dollars of that uh but we're still trying to dig down a little bit further now senator you say he lied to the american public did he lie in addition to what he said there when he said my financial records are public any other lies yeah i think yeah i think there's three issues during that hearing that he misled or lied to to the public in questioning with rand paul dr paul brought up basically the dr fauci cover-up how he used his influence remember in addition to being the highest paid federal employee in the land he also distributes about five billion dollars of grants per year so dr paul's point was that dr falchi used that influence to change people's mind on the origin of this virus so people who in january were saying there's a 70 to 30 chance that this virus was made in a laboratory suddenly they're signing a letter a couple weeks later dismissing that as a possibility and then they go on to get 15 million dollars of grants later over the next two years so that was number one number two was the viral gain function issue as well as the his public availability of finance real quick do you have a democratic sponsor with the fouchy act that you're going to propose not yet we sure hope so we do have some democrat sponsors though on a 9-1-1 style commission to get into the origins of coven and that's really where this is leading i think we proved our point that dr fauci lied to the public we proved that and it's time to move forward and get to the real truth here and start figuring out where this virus came from yeah that would help senator marshall thanks so much

arguably the most important piece of legislation that Congress considers every year is the Defense Authorization bill and I will be supporting this year's version of that defense authorization bill I'm proud that it gives our troops the first significant pay increase in roughly a decade I'm proud that it will reassure our partners and allies that the United States is prepared to fight alongside them to protect our interests and our people I'm also proud that this provides a measure of predictability to Indiana's defense workforce it helps keep our warriors our war fighters prepared for the fight so they never have to fair fight a fair fight I'm hopeful that the amendment I'll be offering to ensure that Indiana stays on the cutting edge of defense technologies will be considered I'm also hopeful that a separate amendment they will name a ship after the late great Senator Richard G lugar will also be considered this should earn bipartisan support this legislation typically does earn broad bipartisan support I hope for the good of the country it does this year as well

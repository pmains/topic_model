it's been one year since our congresswoman and my dear friend Louise slaughter passed away recently it was announced that Louise will be inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame a fitting tribute especially as we celebrate Women's History Month for one of the most inspiring women I have had the privilege of knowing the only woman to ever serve as chair of the House Rules Committee Louise slaughter left behind an incredible legacy of fighting tirelessly for what she believed in and breaking glass ceilings to achieve her goals she was a champion for women everywhere who always stood up for the right to choose she helped author the landmark Violence Against Women Act worked to expand access to reproductive health care and fought every day to ensure equality for all Americans I'm delighted that Louise will take her place in the National Women's Hall of Fame alongside some of our nation's greatest trailblazers where she will continue to inspire generations to come as we mark one year without Louise I hope everyone takes a moment to remember her to honor her and to thank her for her immeasurable contributions that have made our community and our country a better place Thank You Louise

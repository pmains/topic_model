watkin is recognized for five minutes thank you thanks for being here um and for those who don't know happy punchy day that's a big holiday in michigan i have punch keys over here for anyone who wants them it's like a polish jelly donut that we all celebrate with um so mister okay they're over here guys um okay so i guess um you know what is going on uh between russia and ukraine is so um incredibly unbelievable to watch both the russian decision and calculus to do this the ukrainian resistance which is formidable and then the way that it has galvanized the international community um and i i will say that over multiple administrations democrat and republican we have tried to minimize basically since the cold war friction with putin and with russia in the hopes that it wouldn't exacerbate a problem it wouldn't inspire retribution for the russians and and i guess i just feel like that era is over that all of our attempts to minimize friction didn't mean anything and he went ahead and made this move and i think it's a sea change for how both the defense department and the state department should think about our presence in europe our assistance to europe um and uh so i guess i just want to clarify a couple of things what is the official administration position on letting in countries like kosovo bosnia potentially georgia finland and sweden into nato very quickly thank you couldn't agree more congresswoman that that we're in a different ballgame right now and we all need to step back and assess that i would say uh regarding new members of nato uh there's not kind of an effort to fast-track folks but there there is an effort uh to work with those who are interested and who meet the necessary requirements right i know but that's been our process before and i would offer that if the answers that we're getting and i say this as someone who is in your exact positions testifying in front of this committee in 2014 when they put little green men into eastern ukraine if we are using the same metrics and same assessments from before this conflict as we will be afterwards then we're not we're missing the moment here and i'd ask you to to come back to this committee maybe in another month's time and just tell us how you've changed your thinking and i would strongly advocate that we seriously consider a different approach to letting folks into nato and not slow roll those who we're just trying to drag out and i've done it myself number two the buildup in the baltics couldn't agree more with my colleagues who have talked about putting more force in right now um uh and i i guess i would just make that as a point as opposed to a question that we need to be doing more and obviously china is watching everything that we do but i i know we're right in the middle of this it's still a very fresh and new event but for any administration to go through this we have to completely reevaluate deterrence and how we re-establish it and i'd ask that we have folks come back to the committee to present on that on the assistance we get really confusing messages about what is being provided and when by not just us but also our allies we were told in a briefing yesterday that you eu members were providing aircraft now we're seeing online that no one's providing aircraft if you all could come up with a routine where we would get maybe a regular update just something that a staffer could put together so we know what's true and what's not true and the final mile of making sure that assistance gets in the hands of the ukrainians not just shipped and it sits somewhere but it gets there because we know that's going to be more complicated i i guess lastly i was wondering if someone could give us your sense of how this plays out in ukraine over the next week and a half i know that's not your specialty but we're in the middle of this crisis people are watching can you tell us what you think is going to happen we heard it privately but i'd like to say publicly hear publicly what the defense department thinks is going to happen over the next week and a half thank you and we can absolutely look at getting you those those materials that that you requested on the aid i would just say our european allies are doing so much uh that folks are working on on keeping track of it so thank you for that what over this next week and a half i think what we have seen is the ukrainian military is fighting so incredibly hard i mean the political will they have demonstrated is extraordinary and i think that we have seen it has been um a lot more and a lot harder uh than than putin and his military would have expected i would continue to expect that they will do all they can assistance as you know is flowing to them and and i think that they will uh try to um try try to continue to push back this invasion to the extent possible unfortunately as you probably saw this morning in particular we've seen um that the russian military is prioritizing just increasingly horrific approaches in particular indiscriminate bombing i would just say you have an absolutely unique moment where the u.s congress has bipartisan agreement on giving you what you need and we're not getting an ask ask us for things and the gentlelady's time has expired i think that that is a very reasonable request to get to get that very focused um ask for what it is you want us to do

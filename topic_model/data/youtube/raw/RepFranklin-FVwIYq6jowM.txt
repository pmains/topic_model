thank you mr chairman and thank you madam secretary thank you general mcconnell for being here today and your guests this is a long process appreciate your patience uh secretary warmuth on october 8th 2021 the biden administration signed an executive order stipulating that the entire federal government including the department of defense would be required to purchase only 100 zero emission vehicles by 2035. the executive order also states that the requirement for net zero emissions from federal procurement no later than 2050. so in 13 years dod will be forbidden to purchase anything other than electric vehicles or non-zero emission then in 2050 there will be no fossil fuel vehicles remaining in service were you consulted regarding the potential impacts this exec executive order would have on the army prior to it's being signed into effect by the president congressman uh i am not under the impression that the army will be unable let me say this differently the executive order is not putting up any obstacles for the united states army to continue to have tanks that rely on fossil fuel for example we do have a strategy to move to all uh light duty non-tactical vehicles being electric by 2027 and then all non-tactical vehicles by 2035 but i think that we very much uh will be continuing to have many of our combat vehicles still using fossil fuel okay i'll need to look at that more closely because my understanding was that was going to be for all vehicles uh even in light of that um is it your is it your opinion that the technology is advancing quickly enough that's going to enable us to to field those electric vehicles to set aside tanks and things like that but just the general support vehicles that will be necessary and in general i'd also like your input on that as well congressman i think for our for our non-tactical vehicles i'm pretty confident that the technology is coming along well i mean there's some amazing things being done with electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles and we're even looking at a hybrid version of our joint light tactical vehicle you know again i think for some of the heavier things like tanks you know we're probably some time away from being able to move from fossil fuels but for uh the tvs and non-tactical vehicles the technology is there okay general your thoughts on yeah my thoughts uh congressman is you know from a readiness standpoint um especially with the bigger vehicles hybrid's probably the way to go if you can reduce fuel some of our bigger vehicles use a lot of fuel and that puts five thousand gallon tankers on the road and if we can bring that down i'm fine with that and the other thing is they actually reduce the noise in some cases so those are the readiest values but but some of these bigger vehicles it's going to be a lot unless the technology really changes it's going to be a while before we can get there okay i have a report it's called powering the u.s army the future it was produced by the national academy of sciences engineering and medicine looking into this very issue about the feasibility of the technology has the army conducted its own research into determining uh i understand moonshot kinds of promises and ambitious goals to try to reach certain uh initiatives but are we layering over the requirements to to see if the technology is actually going to be there because just to cut to the chase and i can provide this report into the record i'd be happy to um it does a deep dive and there's a lot of smart folks looking that are looking at it but their their general assessment the bottom line is that um the battery technology isn't going to be there any time soon the the energy density just isn't there uh we also have recharging problems uh you know the ability to do that out on the field just isn't there and my concern is that we're signaling to industry that they need to be gearing up that that's the direction the administration's headed but the technology doesn't seem that's going to be there in time i just welcome your thoughts on that i think congressman uh what i would say is you know we again i think what we have signaled to industry is that we're very interested in being able to move towards electric for our non-tactical vehicles and they're already working on that in the commercial space you know i just look at i think what gm is doing you know you're absolutely right that for things like tanks you know we're not going to have charging stations in battlefields of the future uh and so again i think you know we're we're not going in that direction we still you know the folks who build our tanks are still working from an assumption that we're going to be using fossil fuels okay all right anything to add on that general no we're looking for efficiency when it comes to fuel even you know an itep engine the improved turbine engine that we're developing we're getting a lot more power out of a lot less fuel and again however we can best optimize the force that's what we want to do roger thank you mr chairman i yield back you

like to strike the last word the gentleman from Georgia Dr Ferguson has recognized to strike the last word thank you Mr chairman um I would hope that everybody on this committee would support this uh this inquiry and getting to getting getting to the the process of how the administration decided to give away intellectual property I think I think is important oversight question for this committee but I think giving away our intellectual property is an absolutely horrible precedent to set one of the witnesses last week Professor Wu Dr Wu from Harvard said in his response and one of the responses that any trade agreement that we have going forward should have very very strong intellectual property Protections in it not give it away his words his position and I agree with him on that and keep in mind that this this technology is just not about covet 19. this technology can be used in a lot of other ways and it's taken decades to develop and to Simply give this technology away in this intellectual property away and it could wind up in the hands of Bad actors is not the right thing and let's think talk practically about what it would mean let's just say that a company decided that they were going to take on this intellectual property well I mean think about what would have to happen in order for that company to produce vaccines safely I've got to go out and find a site to build a facility they have to build a facility they've got to hire they've got to get the man they've got to get the Machinery in place God knows how long that's going to take with the supply chain issues that we've got they've got to train a Workforce and they've got to develop develop the product we can do that so much more quickly right here in America we should be doing that we should if the issue is to get enough to get more vaccines out well let's get more vaccines out the door but let's not give away our intellectual property that is wrong it it hurts American innovation and it really does create the environment where innovators are not going to want to do they're not going to feel comfortable producing the product code innovating and producing the products here in America because what's to say that the federal government won't come take their stuff and give it to somebody else it's a horrible precedent to set it's not going to have the impact that the that uh that that the administration believes that it will and we should fight back hard against doing this I mean what's next are we going to give away our our Tech our intellectual property on cyber security are we going to give away our intellectual property on on new technologies for for for cleaner energy are we going to give away everything that we invent in this great country it's our competitive Advantage we should be doing everything possible to put America and Americans first not giving away our intellectual property we should fight hard against doing that we can provide the vaccines we can provide the testing the Diagnostics we can do that we should do that we should invent things here in America we should make things here in America and we should sell it to the rest of the world we shouldn't invent it and then give it away to to folks that really quite candidly May mean to do us harm in the future with that Mr chairman I yield back thank the gentleman

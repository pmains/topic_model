from from California mrs. Pelosi one minute the gentlelady from California the menorah leader is recognized Thank You mr. Speaker I thank the gentleman for yielding commend him for his tremendous leadership on America's workers thank you mr. Andrews for your leadership mr. speaker across the country Americans of every political party in every background Democrats Republicans independents and others agree that our nation's top priority must be the creation of jobs and the economic and economic growth and security yet for more than 250 days the Republican majority in the House has refused to listen to them they the Republicans have failed to enact a single jobs bill and the American people do not have the luxury of waiting any longer for Congress to act create jobs president has proposed American Jobs Act he's called upon us to pass the bill now and we I support that as to as do the members of House Democratic members of the House but today instead of passing a jobs bill we are wasting the time of the Congress by attacking workers instead of strengthening them we are debating a bill to undermine the foundation of our middle class instead of fighting to put people to work rebuilding our roads bridges rail wade's broadband lines schools airports water systems we're voting on a measure to send jobs overseas instead of focusing on how to keep jobs here at home through our Make It in America initiative advanced by our Democratic whip mr. Hoyer Make It in America how to strengthen our economy and our national security by stopping the erosion of our manufacturing base indeed by strengthening our manufacturing and industrial base I want to recognize my colleague congressman George Miller the ranking member of the committee of education and work force for his leadership for his knowledge for his tireless advocacy for sencha life but his passion on the subject of America's workers as congressman Miller has said Republican Republican colleagues have proposed the so-called outsourcers Bill of Rights or as I prefer to call it the outsourcers bill of wrongs because this legislation has the wrong priorities for America's economy and for American workers this is bill is it more of the bill is about more than one company or a single case it is about the economic security of America's workforce and families rather than create jobs this measure encourages the outsourcing of jobs and undermines the rights of middle-class workers this bill cuts the National Labor Relations Board makes it easier for corporations to ship jobs overseas allows employers to punish their employers allows employers to punish their employees for simply exercising their rights to organize to demand better benefits and safing safer working conditions to ensure a full day's pay for a full day's work for months in Wisconsin Ohio and states nationwide Americans have seen Republican governors and legislators attack teachers and public servants and we've seen these workers union and non-union alike inspire the nation to fight back now Republicans have brought their assault on working Americans to our nation's capital to the floor of the house claiming their actions will help the economy but it will do just the opposite it will weaken our workers our middle class and our families indeed the corners of our economic prosperity of our middle class and of our democracy the outsources bill of wrongs or rights is not about jobs it's about dismantling protections established pacifica Lee to strengthen the rights of workers we need these protections now more than ever last year American companies listen to this last year American companies created 1.4 million jobs overseas overseas while breaking an enormous profits we must create these jobs here at home Democrats will stand strong for our working men and women we will stay focused on jobs and economic growth on a personal note mr. speaker the other night I had one of the thrills of my political life time I received such an honor for me the frances perkins award from my colleague lynn woolsey a champion for working families in our country for those of you who may not know Frances Perkins from history she was the first woman to serve in the cabinet of a president of the United States she was the secretary of labor and she was responsible for many important initiatives the 40-hour workweek ability for workers to bargain collectively as she was a remarkable champion for working people in our country she was largely responsible for creating social security imagine having that as her credentials imagine what it'd thrill it was for me to receive an award named for her especially given the congresswoman lynn Woolsey a champion on the education and Workforce Committee much of what she done it did well the credit was given to the President of the United States as is appropriate more than 75 years ago upon the signing of the National Labor Relations Act President Franklin Roosevelt said this by preventing practices which tend to destroy the of Labor this law seeks for every worker within its scope that freedom of choice and action which is justly his I guess he could have said his or hers but that independence that freedom of choice in action has rested at the core of a growing thriving American workforce it is not it has not limited the ability of companies to move to change or extend their operations it has simply ensured that companies treat their workers in ways consistent with the laws of our land the independence and freedom of our workers have helped build and expand our middle class which is the backbone of our democracy and has a dr unprecedented prosperity for our families and for our nation and it must be preserved in our time i call upon my colleagues to do just that to preserve this right in our time I call upon my colleagues to oppose this legislation to uphold the value of fairness for our workforce and to get to work putting American people back to work by bringing President Obama's bill the American Jobs Act to committee and to the floor to put the two again again give people hope and confidence dignity of a job with that I yield back the balance of my time nore litter yields back the gentleman from New Jersey reserves gentleman from New Jersey has eight and three-quarters minutes remaining the gentleman from Minnesota has nine

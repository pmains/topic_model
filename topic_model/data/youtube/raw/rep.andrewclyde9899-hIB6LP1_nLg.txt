if every Senate Republican did their job we wouldn't be in this mess yet yesterday 18 Republican Senators voted for this 1.7 trillion dollar Omnibus Bill in order to skip town for Christmas those Senate Republicans got played by the Democrats as expertly as my wife plays the violin unfortunately we're likely to see Republicans in this body do the very same thing and get played the very same way as the Senate hoping to quickly and quietly pass this massive spending bill with no questions or accountability but Americans deserve the truth a vote for this bill is a vote for increasing inflation As Americans struggle to afford the cost of living bolstering foreign Nations border security while willfully ignoring our wide open Southern border rubber stamping wasteful pork projects like lgbtq museums to be friendly highways and everything in between empowering alphabet agencies like the ATF with more money as bureaucrats destroy our nation and infringe on our freedoms pouring an additional 45 billion into Ukraine with zero accountability and green lighting another year of the left's big government socialist agenda right before the end of Democrats one party rule in Washington a vote for this Omnibus Bill is a vote for America last I urge all my colleagues to reject the swamp status quo and stand up for America and vote no on this monstrosity

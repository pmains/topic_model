well it may not be of historic public policy nature but I think it's one you might appreciate when I was go back some years I was now the new ranking member on foreign ops now when I was outside the Congress and you know paring pickets Russians out of Soviet out of Afghanistan and going to Central America and the worst to me the most important place in the world was the foreign ops Committee of the house they could stop the funding of all these things or make policy net policy but statements that relate our our national security and human rights throughout the world so to be the ranking member on floor not never never you know it was one of those things I never expected but this that that night you know around here there was I when I came to Congress I said does anybody know anybody on foreign ops because I want to talk to that person now I'm the ranking so I go to make my first bill on the floor the managing the bill I mean I wasn't the chairman but now we worked very closely together our chairman Sonny Callahan from Alabama it was just wonderful we worked very closely together but we had some differences one of them being international family planning here we go again so anyway I go I come to the floor I have won a suit that I hadn't warned and now mind you Dave Obie had been the chairman of that catch air mman of that committee for like 13 years you know every summer : got everything in the bill and so he's the chairman of the committee know the ranking on the committee it's his it's his baby you know he thinks it is his bill so I go to the floor the first person I ran into is Barney Frank he said Barney Frank he says that's who give it away give it away don't wear that suit anymore so I'm like the truth it would so I do the deal I get everything accomplished that I set out to do I was so proud david√≠s you know sitting there the way David sits there I and David says to me you did what you came to do you got the job done but you could have been more diplomatic so this is really my day I'm getting second I'm getting fashion advice from Barney Frank and Diplomacy advice from Dave early can you imagine can you imagine so I'll tell you one other point Frank story but again if you want to know what has helped me by Barney I could be all day on Barney's you mad when I first came to Congress as I said to you my first the first words I uttered on the floor were about hiv/aids and so I was in my office and one of these shall we say Southern California very conservative members denim ire was on the floor this is way before most of your time was on the floor just ranting and raving against people with HIV it was stunning to me I mean these are people who are sick ranting and raving so-called Barney I said Barney hirama Dan dynamite you believe what he's saying I can't believe that somebody would say that on the floor of the house and he said what are you calling me for you have something to say go down to the floor and say it why are you wasting my time and I thought what a good yeah why am i calling him so so what he trained me to do is when I would call him I would say Barney subject question timing action you know just talk that way and really served me well for over 20 years that we could speak in that shorthand to each other and I wouldn't have to set it up or show my emotion on the subject this is the subject this is the question you know what do you think opposed to this so he says to me you know I love barn you know I personally I just love him I'm really going to miss him he takes great joy in the fact that he is one week younger than I am and so I say to him when his birthday comes around now we're the same age he said no you're always one week older than I am but anyway this so I always get these calls from reporters doing an article on Barney but you know I'm talking I've been here you he gets a course and I got this call from Magazine they're doing an article about members of just people and one of the questions they have is what is the most this gets to your question what is the most poignant statement saying whatever that sticks with you and I said he Oren he says that you want most of you won't even know what I'm talking about here that's right part before he says oh no offense but I'll direct it to some of you on this left I've always wondered about good night mrs. calabash wherever you are good night mrs. calabash wherever you are no need to even explain it's too much to go on so you know what I'm talking about right so we said then they call me bat now this is a really like something from decades ago that everybody in America knew that phrase right Jimmy Durante good night mrs. calabash wherever you are because it's his long-lost girlfriend was it yeah so when it comes and he says they called me back from the magazine and the reporter said the writer said I took your statement to my editor and she said can we check they like it but can we change it to good night miss calabash wherever here this is a generational thing you could never possibly that was that was so demonstrative of the general challenge that we all face around here but it was it was mins kaolinite now you're missing the whole boat it means to say I don't have to tell you what Barney said said to that advice to say let me say this about Barney Frank he really is a giant eye he was an aide to Mayor Kevin White in Boston now we're in the sixties and early seventies when her brother was mayor of Baltimore so they while I didn't know Barney then that whole bonding of the activist mayor's what was something that we bonded about later when we served together he is the one of course you know of his brilliance and you know of his humor but he also there is it one of the fairest persons he listens he listens he listens and tries to find a solution and I hope that in so many of the stories that are coming out about him they don't that they recognize that he commanded the respect on both sides of the aisle and from the business community for his openness he make his values he had his point of view but he knew we had to have a solution that had legitimacy and that would hold and I think that one of his great contributions was to be an idealist and a pragmatist and and to do so in a way that again took us from an idea to legislation to public policy to improving and strengthening our economy and our country whether it was housing issues on his committee it's not just about Wall Street it's about Main Street it's about Housing and Urban Development and things like that so his contribution is an enormous one his personal courage is one that that helped us most recently while not most recently but in recent memory on the hate crimes bill when he told the story that I'm now the chairman services committee captains of industry beat a path to my door leaders of financial institutions want to see me but I wasn't always the chairman of the committee or was it once a teenage boy who was conflicted about my ID enter identity and with the one he spoke to my don't do justice to the way he spoke but the emotion and the sensitivity that he brought to that discussion enabled us to pass a hate crimes bill Matthew Shepard bill that was all inclusive to say that resorting to violence against anybody in our country is not acceptable so he's made a difference in many many ways I just give you a little sample of some of them thank you all very much

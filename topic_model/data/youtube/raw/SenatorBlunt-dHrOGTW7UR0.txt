I think in both the fight for the economy and the fight against the virus time really matters and so what we've tried to do in both the the cares act and the follow-up on the cares Act is to create a lot of incentives to speed up everything we can speed up whether it's the shark tank an idea that we put in in our bill with Senator Alexander senator Shelby very involved in that along with me coming up with this idea that people would bring bring concepts to as far along as they could get them on diagnostics and other things and then the shark tank will try to figure out the handful or whatever the number is that are more likely to work than not and weed fast forward as much as we could the opportunity to get into production the White House with their warp-speed on vaccine bringing the same concept and I said at the lunch today to our to our members that with this concept if some of the things we advance into production underwritten by the federal government don't fail we're not trying hard enough that the whole idea here is to is to try to buy time to move forward a couple of steps beyond you would normally be and because you would do that you'd have a vaccine you'd have a easy to take and quick responded to test 30 or 60 days sooner than you would have if you did this the traditional way if we do that on all these fronts on testing on therapeutics on vaccine hopefully in all three cases we'll get where we want to get quicker than we would otherwise get there and believe me whatever we invest in that will be worth it if we're successful in buying that time in the fight again against the virus and for the economy

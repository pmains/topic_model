Twitter would not consider a quote from the Bible the Koran the Torah as as hate speech and it has not the context matters and what the relationships and what the purpose of the speech is at social media Giants Facebook and Twitter facing a grilling on Capitol Hill over allegations that they censor conservative users so let's bring in Republican senator from Texas Ted Cruz he led the charge today chairman of the big text censorship investigation hearing great to have you with us Shannon always fun to be with you okay so listen I want to talk about one of your democratic counterparts senator mazie Hirono who says there's much ado about nothing essentially she says we cannot simply allow the Republican Party to harass tech companies into weakening content moderation policies that already fail to remove hateful dangerous and misleading content if conservatives have had their content removed maybe they should look at the content they're posting well you look unfortunately that is more and more the views of the extreme left which is they say if you don't want to be censored just don't say things we disagree with and and and and that's really the arrogance we see that on college campuses we see that in big tech and you know we had testimony today for example we had the producer of the movie unplanned a phenomenal movie true story of Abby Johnson former clinic director of Planned Parenthood who became a pro liked life activist unplanned had Google refused to run their ads Twitter took down their web page they did everything they could the big networks all refused to carry their their ads and nonetheless it became the number for moving the countries in the theaters right now and yet and we see this pattern over and over again we heard testimony from the susan b anthony list about how repeatedly pro-life tweets pro-life posts have been censored you know we had during the hearing today i put up a tweet that was sent out from the susan b anthony list a quote from mother teresa that twitter censored and I asked Twitter I said do you consider this quote from Mother Teresa to be hate speech they refuse to answer that and and that pattern of censorship it's really dangerous and and and none of us should be happy to have a handful of left-wing Silicon Valley billionaires censoring what is said and silencing conservatives silencing Christians silencing people of faith that that's not right and and we've got to act okay quickly because I want to get to some other topics these are private companies they are and and so much of what the hearing today talked about listen the problem is serious the remedy is complicated I will readily admit the remedies complicated but there's one remedy I talked about quite a bit today which is the tech companies have a special immunity from liability that Congress has passed called section 230 of the Communications Decency Act it means you can't sue Twitter and Google and Facebook if they commit libel if they commit slander look if you libel someone on air Fox News can be sued but Twitter and Google they can't be sued and and the whole reason Congress gave him that immunity from liability is it was based on the idea that they would be neutral public forums in other words they wouldn't be speaking it would be other people speaking well they're now engaged as partisan left-wing political speakers there's no reason on earth they should have a special immunity from liability that protects them in a way that nobody else has protected okay lightning around on our other topics okay senator Sanders today and he rolled out Medicaid Medicare for all he's got several Democratic co-sponsors most of them are running for president in 2020 today senator Gillibrand says it's vital to humanity it must be a right not a privilege health care coverage for everyone look the Democratic Party as a whole is galloping to the left you know it used to be just a few years ago Bernie Sanders won that was on the extreme fringe now the entire Democratic field is agreeing with Bernie Sanders an avowed socialist socialist medicine doesn't work medicare for all you know you actually slipped up and called it Medicaid for all that's that's right that's in fact what it would be and and one of the consequences of it look millions of Americans millions of seniors have paid into Medicare for decades what Medicare for all is talking about doing it's taking millions of people that haven't paid into the system including illegal aliens putting them on Medicare which would bankrupt Medicare and hurt all of the millions of Americans who rely on it it's wrong and it's dangerous but it's where the Democratic Party is all right when I quickly get you to comment on Yale Law School the fact that they will not pay students there are help them with loan forgiveness programs and other things if the students choose to go work for faith-based organizations that they say are discriminatory because these groups may be against things like same-sex marriage a student their rights this he says crew flagrantly misrepresented Yale's policy and belied his own poor record on free speech and religious freedom he says you talk tough against intolerance but when it comes to fighting discrimination and protecting constitutional rights you're all hat and no cattle I know we used that because you're from Texas well look I it is not surprising to see left-wing activists on on universities including Yale who want to censor speech and so the Constitution subcommittee the Senate Judiciary Committee which I chair has announced an investigation into Yale's discrimination based on religious faith we're going to examine what they're doing and it is illegal under federal law under federal civil rights law to discriminate based on religious faith and and and and if yell gets away with this this is the canary in the coal mine every other law school will follow all the other schools will follow and by the way you know what the group outlaws asked for initially they asked Yale don't admit conservative students if you believe marriage is the union of one man and one woman if you believe a man is a man and a woman is a woman don't it don't admit those students to Yale that is extreme bigotry and we can't let that stand alright we got to go

mr speaker i rise today in strong support of the domestic terrorism prevention act it is heartbreaking to stand here today just days after 10 innocent lives were taken in a buffalo new york grocery store by a gunman espousing white supremacist views and hatred towards african americans this devastated mass massacre took me back to june 17th 2015 when another white supremacist gunned down nine parishioners at charleston's historic emmanuel amy church in the intervening years we have witnessed far too many other acts of domestic terrorism from a counter protest in charlottesville virginia to a synagogue in pittsburgh pennsylvania to a walmart in el paso texas to a sikh temple in oak creek wisconsin and an asian-owned nail salon in atlanta georgia all told over 200 mass shootings this year to be sure all of these shootings have not been racially motivated or motivated by hate but all of them share one thing in common they or have been committed in their country too tolerant of irresponsible regulations of weapons of war and the proliferation of firearms of mass destruction this legislation is long overdue it would enable the justice department the department of homeland security and the fbi to prevent investigate and prosecute cases of domestic terrorism more effectively i and many others in this body know what it is to experience acts of racial hatred and witness events of domestic terrorism we cannot continue to turn the blind eye to white's supremacist vigilantes it impacts all of us while the gunman in buffalo was aiming for people who looked like me others who did not look like me fell victim to this evil act so after my first meeting with dr martin luther king jr back in 1960 i met with one of my professors mrs rosa harris to share the saw to paul transformation i was experiencing two days later mrs harris handed me a copy of dr king's 1958 book stride towards freedom the gathering is recognized to share one passage from that book i quote true peace is not merely the absence of tension it is the presence of justice mr speaker this legislation will provide federal agencies with necessary tools to ensure that peace and justice prevail i urge a yes vote from all members of this august body and yield back the balance of my time

madam Speaker I rise today to discuss an issue that's very important to me and to the 1,300 Hoosiers currently in need of an organ transplant that issues the lack of organs for patients in need in our broken organ donation system for more than 30 years our nation's organ donation system has operated in complete darkness groups known as organ procurement organizations or Opie O's are responsible for getting organs from the donors to the patients who actually need them but questions surround the effectiveness transparency and accountability of these organizations opioids are the main link between donor hospitals and organ recipients and their performance can be a limiting factor for all stakeholders in the organ donation system in the last 20 years no Opio has been decertified despite serious issues of underperformance for example CMS recently recertified the New York City Opio despite persistent underperformance for nearly a decade this problem exists throughout the country currently Opio performance is measured by data that is self-reported unaudited and fraught with errors many of these errors have been documented by Lenny Bernstein in Kimberly kindy at the Washington Post and that's why today I introduced legislation that would require organ procurement organizations to be held to metrics that are objective verifiable and not subject to self interpretation this way there can be meaningful transparency evaluation and accountability updating these metrics will also enable Geographic level donation rates to be evaluated and improved this is desperately needed for the more than one hundred thirteen thousand Americans currently waiting for a life-saving transplant the legislation I introduced today is supported by the American Society of nephrology dialysis patients citizens in the nonprofit group organized additionally in April of this year I wrote to CMS administrator Seema Verma urging CMS to update Opio metrics to be objective and verifiable I'm hopeful that we will soon see action from the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services you see this issue is very personal to me my friend Dave Gunny mcfarland from Jeffersonville Indiana died because his heart transplant never came we served together in the United States Marine Corps you know over the years I've gotten to know his widow jennifer mcfarland current-gen has made it her mission to raise awareness about the organ transplant process and to help prevent others from facing a similar situation because the system is so complex most people don't know how it works or if patients are actually being protected it's time to change that today's legislation is the first in a series of bills I'm working on to reform our organ donation system once and for all and help save precious lives I will not stop until we increase the availability of organs for patients in need thank you Semper Fidelis and I yield the floor

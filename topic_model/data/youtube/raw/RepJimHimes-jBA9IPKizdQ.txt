well Valentine's Day right around the corner and children at a local elementary school are making some very special Valentine's Day cards this day News eights up by the Oxford elementary school of darienne this morning where students are making Valentines for veteran it's all part of their fifth annual Valentine's for vets program Congressman Jim Heintz was there to tell us what it's all about it's doing two things one obviously it's great for a veteran who maybe is feeling a little lonely on Valentine's Day to see that you know some of the kids in the area really care about him what's really neat though is this part of it which is taking these kids you know otherwise will be consumed with their day-to-day stuff introducing them to some veterans and making them conscious of the fact that we do have an obligation and a real need to say thank you on a continual basis to those people who have worn the uniform that is a nice sounding program the hope is those handmade cards will bring a lot of joy to the vets overseas attacks

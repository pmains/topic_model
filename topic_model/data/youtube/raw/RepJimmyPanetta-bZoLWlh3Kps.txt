Thank You mr. speaker Thank You mr. Johnson appreciate this opportunity mr. speaker today I rise to discuss our commitment disability a promise that I have made to my constituents at home and a promise that I have made to my colleagues here in Washington DC prior to my being sworn in during my campaign of 2060 the number one question i heard i received from the people in my district on the Central Coast of California was why would you want to go to Washington DC right now I heard that over and over and over I heard that people were dissatisfied with the dysfunction in Congress I heard that they were disgusted with the partisanship of Congress I heard that they were disheartened with our system of government and I believe that it's that sentiment that led to the denominator I admit I was disappointed by the presidential election and I believe that partisanship that was displayed during that election continued in Washington DC and it started when I got here for new member orientation when we got here with freshmen republicans and democrats we were automatically split up i did not get to know my fellow Republican colleagues freshman here in DC it wasn't until we went on to Boston and Virginia that we actually took time to get to know each other we're there and what they were about and what I can tell you the thing that I say that gives hope to so many people is that my freshman class heard the exact same things during this past election that it is time that we get things done and that we do it together now I believe that once once we get past these turbulent times at this point I do hope and I will work on issues that affect our country we had immigration reform investment in our infrastructure and ensuring that our health care is not just accessible but affordable but I also realize as many of you but that's easier said than done yet I believe that to get things done in Congress you have to treat it like a marathon and not a sprint and I believe that we begin this race by building relationships my predecessor congressman Sam far spent 23 years representing the place I call home on the Central Coast of California he will tell you that for most of that time he was in the minority yet he was able to get numerous things done and he will tell you that the way he was able to do it is by relationships with Democrats and Republicans I can tell you that Sam's predecessor would say the exact same thing and I can tell you that Sam's predecessor and his three roommates so I was able to live with back in the 80s would all say the same thing that it is the personal chemistry amongst people here in Washington DC that will leave to our ability to compromise professionally that is what we must develop that is why I am honored and pleased to enter into this commitment of civility for that is the first ingredient to that chemistry that we must strive for and I believe that this commitment that we have all to each other to our community into our country that will lead to our constituents confidence not just in Congress but amok but in our democracy Thank You mr. speaker

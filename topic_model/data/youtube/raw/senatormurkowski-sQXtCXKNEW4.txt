wonderful staff taking such good care of us during today's luncheon i also appreciate each and every one of you for being here your support for responsible resource development here in alaska the state continues to feel blow after blow from the federal administration and i think it bears repeating uh a coin phrase by my friend and former rdc director and our dec commissioner jason bruni i see you down there jason i'm going to steal this from you for just a moment and just remind folks that we do it better here in alaska than anywhere else on the planet [Applause] by now most of you have probably noticed that we have an empty seat here at the head table today it's there to honor congressman don young some of you may know it's been a long-standing tradition for rdc to open our annual luncheon with remarks from the longest-serving member of alaska's delegation in congress sadly with the congressman's passing earlier this year that tradition also passes and so i ask that you please join me in a brief moment of silence to honor the congressman for all alaska and the dean of the house the late congressman don young his memory and 56 years of dedicated public service to our great state won't soon be forgotten thank you [Applause] on a more positive note 2022 marks 47 years of rdc advocacy i'm proud to say that this organization has been backed by a strong and passionate board of directors since 1975. earlier today during our annual board meeting we elected the 2022 and 2023 board of directors and i'm happy to announce the return of my fellow officers and am honored to say i was asked to stay on for another term as rdc president [Applause] so joining me at the head table today are two of my fellow officers our senior vice president mike satrey from hekla our vice

of alaska's natural resources and for that we thank you if you could please stand so we can recognize you today [Applause] with that i'd just like to take this opportunity to remind folks that rdc is a non-partisan organization that uses opportunities like today's luncheon to feature important issues for our membership rdc does not endorse individual candidates nor does sponsorship of our events imply our support or agreement with their positions we are simply an organization that is willing to roll up our sleeves and work hard with those who are committed to growing alaska's economy through responsible resource development i'd also like to recognize our members and sponsors rdc's work is made possible only through your generosity and the commitment to our mission a special thanks to today's denali sponsors that include conoco phillips exxon mobile heckler greens creek mining company hillcorp alaska and nana regional corporation we also greatly appreciate the dozens of gold and silver sponsors of today's event if you could take a look at your program and the screens above you'll see it's an impressive list in total we have more than 90 distinguished companies from across alaska's economy and landscape supporting today's event i think that's amazing thank you [Applause] while their support and the board's efforts are certainly important i want to acknowledge the dynamic duo that keep rdc running on track day-to-day i'm proud to welcome layla kimbrell as our newest executive director she's now five months into the job and seated for her very first rdc annual luncheon and she is supported by our project manager kari noor who greeted many of you at the door i just want to say thank you kari for your tireless work to support rdc's mission and give a quick shout out to april cooley who is our steadfast and bookkeeper extraordinaire and last but not least a special thanks to the volunteers that gave you a swift check-in today some of you may have recognized the infamous carl portman it's hard to shake and was happy to support our effort today and with that we'll get onto our program i'm pleased to introduce and welcome alaska's senior senator lisa murkowski as our keynote speaker senator murkowski is a third generation alaska alaskan and our first alaska-born u.s senator she's a senior member of the panels on appropriations energy and natural resources health education labor and pensions and vice chairman of the indian affairs committee senator murkowski's colleagues regard her as a leader on energy and resources policy and she was named the single most effective republican on those issues in the most recent congress among her recent accomplishments are the opening of the 1002 aryan anwar to responsible resource development the first modernization of u.s energy policy in more than a decade the bipartisan infrastructure investment and jobs act which has already brought close to two billion dollars to alaska and the alaska tourism restoration act which allowed cruise ships and visitors to return to alaska last year senator murkowski is clearly a strong proponent of all types of resource development here in alaska and she is certainly a champion of the industries represented here at the resource development council please help me welcome senator murkowski lori thank you for the introduction thank you for the opportunity to be back with you what an extraordinary uh gathering this afternoon as we look at the various sectors of our state's economy that are represented here i think this is this is really testimony to to the commitment that alaskans have to not only our our our broader state's economy but really what it means when we're talking about our resources our natural resources and so it is good to be back with the rdc governor it's good to share the uh the head table with you here um it's also nice to have my friend and former co-worker leila kimbrell who was my state director for a period of years but is now rdc's executive director we miss you but we know that you're being put to excellent use here and you're doing great things for our state so we appreciate that leila i also want to acknowledge the uh the absence of our late congressman congressman don young and lori thank you for the moment of silence that you provided for all of us thank you for recognizing him today i will tell you i miss dawn every single day and maybe even a little bit more now that we are in the midst of appropriations season i'm processing more than 1200 spending requests right now and i really miss my buddy dawn but he is his presence will be long long felt beyond any one individual project i do want to acknowledge the many sponsors that have made today's luncheon possible i think when you look through it it really is a who's who of everybody in this state all those who are making good things happen for alaska good thing good things happen for jobs for all alaskans so if you look at the program i uh as as you see the the title of my address if you will uh today i set a theme of alaska's resource contributions are just a beginning just a beginning because i want to i want to take a few moments this afternoon to focus on on how that meshes so well with rdc's mission of growing through responsible resource development and i and i i say that this is just the beginning as we're approaching how we're able to access our resource wealth because i truly believe that that is just it and some of you may be thinking well that's overly optimistic lisa um given where things stand right now and administration that that we are pushing against every single day uh you're saying well okay how can you possibly feel optimistic trust me i get it i live it every single day we're 18 months now into an administration that has been has been against us on just about everything related to resource development and i don't need to tick off the litany here because you all live with it but it includes the 1002 area it includes the npra the offshore arctic cook inlet the tongas ambler public land orders and and you could probably add some more to your list and yet you think about it you could hardly pick a worse time to be anti-development the world is emerging from a pandemic demand is reviving there's a land war in in europe provoked by an unstable nuclear power there are significant production outages in places like libya and in many other countries autocrats are are using the revenues from their exports to enrich themselves and endanger the world so at a time at a time when we really need clear-eyed realism the biden administration has largely refused to recognize alaska's plentiful resources they're working to close off access to our lands they're looking to close off access to our capital markets they've suspended and canceled leases the lease sales permits rights away and in turn in turn many of the opportunities that are needed to create jobs and to help build our state and like you we're all deeply frustrated by all of it and yet there are some areas there are some areas that we've broken through and in a year where the where the world has changed dramatically and and and perhaps even forever i'm going to continue to remain optimistic here about our future because the value of our resources is increasingly undeniable you the administration can push back on a lot of things they can delay a lot of things but the value of the resource is undeniable so let me let me go into a little more detail on this last week we celebrated the 45th anniversary of the first oil moving through the transalaska pipeline system table's sitting right over there suzanne is nodding 45 years is is a good run we appreciate that and the great men and women everyone at alieska has done a great job at keeping it operating safely and reliably but our reality is is taps is only one quarter full right now but between the good work at that hillcore is doing to to revitalize pluto bay santos efforts and progress up in pika the exciting the exciting developments that conoco has in the npra we are on track to add hundreds of thousands of barrels to taps each day we have that potential a lot of that we know depends on conocophillips willow project but i am confident it will be approved we are expecting to see that supplemental eis any day right now literally any day and i fully expect the record of decision later this year as has been indicated and believe you me this this isn't happening by accident it's happening because we've been working it we haven't been sitting in the back benches heckling it's happened because we have engaged the administration at the highest levels and really working to convince them that this is the right thing to do this is the right thing to do not only for alaska this is the right thing to do for our country so when when the time comes i would encourage all of you everyone in this room to comment in support of willow and to highlight its importance to alaska and the nation because we know we know full well its opposition is well organized they're deep pocketed you saw the you saw the article came from the washington post but it was reprinted in the adn just this week and there's a there's a quote there from an environmental attorney who said she hopes quote willow dies by a thousand cuts and then claimed this is a quote dying industry in alaska well folks not on my watch not on my watch is that going to happen i want to make sure i want alaska to be the very last place in the world where a barrel of oil is produced not the first to go offline so we are in this and we will continue to be in this for all the right reasons we need the willow project and others to go forward conoco has flyers at their table with more information i'm told um kind of walks you through how you can make your voice heard during this comment period so i really would encourage you to to stop by there but willow's not the only positive for us on energy right now as the result of the infrastructure law and my energy act which laurie mentioned there is substantial assistance on the table and that's going to help to lower the cost of a natural gas pipeline that i know the governor is going to be speaking to and that so many are working so hard on and it's going to help us deploy projects that will help to lower the cost of energy throughout our state it's also going to help us pioneer these technologies that we are seeing just emerge so if alaska if alaska wants to be a hydrogen hub if alaska wants to be that carbon hub or or lead the way on marine energy as i think that they should lead the way on geothermal energy as i think that they should or on small modular reactors we now have those opportunities and more that are right in front of us we also look to mining look to mining which perhaps has the most potential of any industry in our state right now global mineral needs are skyrocketing we all know that and alaska is that storehouse of just about everything out there whether it's gold or silver copper graphite rare earths platinum on on through to zinc you name it the odds are pretty good that we've got it we've got six major mines in the state right now but we're going to need to double or perhaps triple that to help meet the growing demand so i've been working on and it's now law the legislation that i introduced the american mineral security act billions of dollars we put on the table through the infrastructure act that will help build out our critical minerals base 500 million dollars that we secured for the defense production act these should all these should all help alaska projects get off the ground we've added or asked for an additional 400 million more in this appropriation cycle so we are we are pushing pushing pushing on minerals down in southeast timber timber highly valued industry that has just struggled just been smothered by policies out of washington dc for decades right now it is unbelievable and really unacceptable that in our nation's largest national forest the forest service puts virtually no timber up for harvest and the revocation of the tongass roadless rule exemption absolutely does not help we don't give up on that we have though completed the alaska mental health trust exchange which will make available an estimated 201 million board feet that's going to help us get through until the second growth quote wall of wood is ready to harvest in earnest but it's been it's been tough on the forest on the timber side and we recognize that timber tourism tourism has been that bright spot and certainly that growing sector of our alaskan economy but they had a brutal couple of years with kovid and we're all we're all glad that things are finally looking up for tourism people are are eager to travel i'm sitting next to them on the airplane as i'm coming home here and they want to they've saved up their trips during covet they're excited to be coming back they want their dream vacation and and that means they want to be here in alaska and the industry is primed for growth we we know we know now certainly how to work with the cdc how to work with canada to make sure that cruise ships are able to reach their ports after we pass the alaska alaska tourism restoration act last year now we're seeing the real challenge for us is is workforce and we're seeing that throughout all sectors but we're certainly seeing this so acutely within the tourism sector and it's just finding people i'm a big big proponent of local hire getting more alaskans into the workforce but we also need to ensure that more visas are able to fill those areas for job opportunities and openings where they need to be so we're continuing to work on that we're certainly feeling that within the fisheries um this is a tough one right now as we're trying to to make sure that we've got that workforce we're going to be celebrating some massive returns uh for salmon in bristol bay but many of our arcanic rivers are are not going to have that same good fortune and we know that we know that our crab populations are in trouble we're not quite sure what's causing the declines here but we uh we got to figure it out we've got to figure it out and that's where it comes down to really understanding the research the monitoring the data that is out there so that we're making good wise management decisions but we have to be doing everything we can to make sure that alaskans are able to to fill their freezers provide for their families as well as as to provide for the world's growing middle class so so much going on in these sectors but we've also got these emerging sectors that are worthy of celebration too alaskan set a goal for a hundred million dollar mariculture industry within 20 years i think we're on a good track to meet that thanks to companies like seagrove kelp blue evolution barnacle foods mariculture is really in a in an extraordinary position right now to help strengthen our coastal communities and fill some of these gaps that are created by federal burdens on other fronts another area that i think is exciting and the governor and i were mentioning it ahead of the of the lunch here is is agriculture as we know we're still importing about 95 percent of our food but we have here in this state the fastest growing agriculture sector and unprecedented opportunities to grow more here at home so whether it's a it's a farm up in the valley whether it's a reindeer farm whether it's a small business like local greens this is an industry that can scale and and make a difference i've been working on the federal side to fund what we call micro grants agriculture micro grants to help seed local projects we're going to be targeting next year's farm bill to help uh help provide further support there so i i guess what i'm saying is lori and layla and and kerry you're going to need a bigger room to accommodate everything that's going on with our growing our our growing economic base here in this state and i think that that's a good thing so i've talked a lot about reasons for optimism i think it's important that we focus on that but none of this comes without effort it's just not gonna come because we occupy a special place on the globe it's not just going to come because we have the resources it's not just going to come because we've got great people it comes with effort and what i've just described means a lot of new projects it's going to take serious and sustained efforts from all of all of us to make them a reality for one we need more infrastructure plain and simple so that's why i helped to write to negotiate and and then pass into law the largest core infrastructure bill into history that we've seen it is it's been it's been derided by some as some kind of a green new deal but i'll tell you folks it is a great deal for alaska don young saw that and he worked he worked it on the house side to get this bill into law but as laurie has mentioned we've already seen we've already seen this infrastructure bill bring nearly well actually over 2 billion now to alaska more to come and it's more to come for roads for bridges for faster broadband for cleaner water for cheaper energy for new ports for improved ferry service we're funding critical needs in in places like like no man and denali down in seward and these projects translate into better quality of life for alaskans a better experience for those who visit and a new generation of associated development but beyond infrastructure is access you have to be able to access your lands you have to be able to access your waters and we see we see that on a daily basis that access is threatened like never before governor dunleavy is probably going to be speaking to this but he's right if if we can't access our federal areas every industry will suffer and so will countless alaskans so this is a fight we've all got to engage on on all fronts to preserve what is ours to stop initiatives like the 30 by 30 which would which would truly shut down our economy and that's why we've been pushing so hard i've been pushing hard back in in washington for this sportsman's access provision in our public lands bill we didn't give up on the 40-year fight to open the 1002 area this is why senator sullivan and i are planning on on introducing legislation when we get back that would revoke the public land orders it's why i support the state taking it to the federal land management agencies over submerged lands and navigable waters you just can't sit back on this i can't sit down as we're talking about resource issues before this crowd without talking about the permitting process we have to have an objective and an efficient permitting process for all projects to follow so we've seen with the biden administration the nepa rollbacks taking us exactly in the wrong direction we did manage to codify the executive order on one federal decision in the infrastructure law which is good we were able to permanently reauthorize the federal permitting council which is good the uh the mineral security language that we have put into place into law now addresses perm permitting and and allows for timelines to be put in place but we've got those in place but it's going to be difficult to keep this administration accountable if they won't put these authorities to good use so we've got to make sure that there is that level of accountability and stay on it because if this administration doesn't doesn't implement it right we need to make sure that the next one will and as part of that we need the environmental review process to remain part of the permitting process now it's no no great secret in this room or across the state i oppose the pebble project i supported the army corps decision to deny its permit in 2020 but i also object to what epa is doing through the proposed determination that it announced last month because as a departure from the process that every project in our state deserves a chance to go through i am concerned i am concerned about precedent the the potential next targets after this one and i want and we need a fair and consistent process for all who seek to develop alaska's resources now the final aspect that i want to hit on just about done here but it is it's a recognition that in order to to succeed fundamentally you got to look to to the approach that is taken as i mentioned we got a lot of headwinds that we've been we've been bucking up against but we've got we've got to be willing to work with anyone to do whatever it is that we can to advance alaska's priorities and interests and a lot a lot of what's going to happen over this next year is is this really unremarkable unsexy day-to-day grind of legislating as as the ranking member on the interior appropriations one of the more senior members of that committee i'm working to secure directly hundreds of millions of dollars in investment for alaska and i'm also working to ensure that agency accounts can support and help expand resource development within our state and in the midst of all of this in the midst of all of it we just got to keep pushing back continuing to push back against federal overreach which has been a constant struggle and we recognize continues to be that struggle but our best option is to work together we got to figure out how we work across party lines we have to figure out how we build support with those who can help prevent the worst from advancing and this is this is an area quite frankly where my friend the chairman the current chairman of the energy and natural resources committee joe manchin has been a great ally for the state of alaska he gets it he's on the other side of the aisle let's work with those who get us who understand us who want to try to help advance alaska's interests what i know we can't afford is to sit back just try to say sit out this whole administration or perhaps reduce ourselves to working with only one side of the aisle that maybe maybe that's politically safe but i think it's downright dangerous for alaska's future we're going to make it through the biden administration and we may take some hits but we're also going to have some very real wins given what's happening around the world the abundance that we have here in this state and the determination of the people here in the state of alaska our future is as bright as the summer solstice we are we are just getting started folks we got so much to do and i look forward to doing it together with you thank you thank you lisa uh for your very thoughtful comments i know it was no mistake that you touched on each and every one of the resource industries that rdc represents here today and we really appreciate your tireless work to hold the line during the current administration and so now i'm going to turn over the microphone to layla kimbrell

Madam President I rise to discuss the pending vacancy on the United States Supreme Court and I do so on a very momentous day in American legal history may 17 today is the anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision in the pivotal case of Brown versus Board of Education on May 17 1954 the Supreme Court ruled that the promise of equality stated his paramount in the Declaration of Independence and then reaffirmed in the 14th amendment to the Constitution passed in the aftermath of the Civil War could not be denied to little schoolchildren based on their skin color the brown v board case was actually five cases consolidated together one from Virginia one from Kansas one from Delaware one from South Carolina and one from the District of Columbia while most of us know the the the issue in brown and what the case resolved few remember that the brown ruling was in serious jeopardy because of the death of a Supreme Court justice and the deep divisions on the court among the remaining eight members it was only through the prompt filling of a judicial vacancy that the court was able to come together and render a ruling in America's best interest the brown case was originally argued in 1952 and the court that heard the argument was hopelessly divided so divided in fact that they asked that the case be reordered in 1953 and then to make matters worse Chief Justice fred vinson died before the reorg you meant by many accounts his death left the court evenly divided evenly divided over an issue of the most fundamental importance had the vacancy left by the death of Judge Vinson persisted there is no way of predicting whether the Supreme Court could even resolved the case imagine how different our history as a nation would be if the Supreme Court had been unable to decide on that matter of fundamental importance but President Eisenhower nominated former California Governor Earl Warren to fill the vacancy the senate did its job held a prompt hearing and confirmed the appointment and Chief Justice Warren then used his skill to cut through the division and convince his colleagues that the court should speak unanimously and say that a child skin color should not determine which school he or she should attend because the Senate did its job the court was able to do its job and all America was lifted I've listened to my colleagues into Virginia citizens about the current Supreme Court vacancy for three months and I've come to this conclusion I think the Senate is treading on dangerous ground here we are communicating and I think the communication could be unintentional but we are communicating a message to our public that is painful and our actions in this high-profile matter are creating pain among many of my constituents and I fear that a precedent is about to be said that could undermine all three branches of our government so I offer these comments today because the Senate can correct the dangerous message we're sending and I hope that calm reflection will call us to honor the great traditions of this body the death of Justice Scalia on februari 13 created a naturally occurring vacancy on a court that is statutorily required to have nine members within hours of Justice Scalia's death the majority leader announced a blockade on the vacancy declaring that no nomination by President Obama would ever receive a hearing or a vote this hastily announced blockade had been described as follows it has been described as follows the majority thinks the American people should decide on the presidential race and that therefore this nomination should be for the next president to make even if that means a Supreme Court vacancy for more than a year I want to examine the majority rationale what is the Senate done in other instances when a vacancy has occurred during the last year of a president's term well that's easy enough to find out before Justice Scalia's death more than a dozen justices have been confirmed during a presidential year and for the last 100 years with the exception of nominees who have withdrawn their nomination the Senate has taken action on every pending nominee to fill a vacancy on the court in the past some senators have suggested that a vacancy occurring during the final year of a presidential term should be entitled to less deference than other executive nominations but thats related to the question of whether or not a senator votes yes or no and of course senators are free to vote yes or no on nominees but the refusal to even consider a nominee is unprecedented beyond the precedent of previous Senate actions let's look at article 2 section 2 of the Constitution it says that the president quote shall nominate and quote appoint by and with the advice and consent of the Senate close quote various officials including Supreme Court justices while all agree that the advice and consent provision gives the Senate the ability to reaffirm or reject a nominee there is nothing in the clause suggesting that the Senate can blockade the consideration of a nominee and there was certainly nothing in the clause to suggest that the president's appointed powers or the Senate's confirmation powers are somehow limited in the last year of a presidential term finally the meaning of the constitutional clause was extensively discussed as the constitution was drafted approved and ratified by the states and Alexander Hamilton's Federalist paper 76 also discusses the provision at length all understood that the advice and consent provision was an opportunity for the Senate to determine whether a presidential nominee for a Senate confirmable position possessed quote fit character that's the check against presidential power intended by the clause the president knowing that a Senate would inquire into the character of a nominee would not just nominate people purely for partisan or personal or regional reasons wanting to fill up the court with people from my state for example instead fit character would require that the president nominates somebody who could pass that scrutiny in the Senate and fit character is a phrase with some significant subjectivity to it giving each senator to the ability to decide what it means in a given instance but the position that the character of the nominee doesn't matter at all doesn't matter at all as evidenced by the majority's view that there would be no meetings no hearings and no vote regardless of the person nominated for the vacancy is directly contrary in my view to the intent of the provision so I look at this and I believe that the asserted rationale that we should not take up the garland nomination because the vacancy has occurred in the final year of a presidential term is at odds with the text of the Constitution with the clear meaning of the text as explained during the drafting of the provision and with the clear line of Senate action in previous cases so what could explain the blockade of Judge garland I obviously don't know and I can't comment upon motivations that I'm unaware of but i do want to discuss how it appears a perception that we are leaving possibly unwittingly based on my discussions with Virginians the current Senate blockade is variously interpreted as an opposition to the nominee as opposition to the particular president making the nomination or as some effort to undermine judicial independence so let's look at those three interpretations that are very commonly held by Virginians and others the first interpretation is it opposition to the nominee I think we can dispense with that pretty quickly the blockade strategy is not based on the character than I Manny judge Merrick garland and I can assert this safely because the blockade strategy was announced no meeting no hearing no vote before the president even nominated judge garland it was said regardless of the character of a particular nominee they would not entertain a nomination from this particular president this is ironic given that the nomination for a Supreme Court justice is fundamentally about the very essence of justice and that the essence of justice must carry with it a duty to consider each individual on his or her own merits the position that we would refuse to consider judge garland on his own merit seems contrary to me to the very notion of justice itself and now the judge garland has been nominated we also know that the blockade is not about the character of the nominee judge garland has an esteemed record as a prosecutor private practitioner federal appellate judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals he's the chief judge on that court his judicial service alone is approaching the 20-year mark on a court that most believe is second importance only to the United States Supreme Court I have not seen any member of the majority assert any credible weakness in Judge Garland's background integrity experience character judicial temper or fitness for the position indeed the majority's senior member respected former chair of the Judiciary Committee has praised judge Garland as exactly the kind of jurist who should be on the Supreme Court and in my recent interview with Judge garland I came away deeply impressed with his thoughtful manner and his significant experience as a trial attorney a judge this is no ivory tower juris but instead a man who understands the real life struggles of plaintiffs and defendants lawyers and juries legislators and citizens trial judges who depend upon the supreme court to give clarity and guidance to the rules that impact the most important issues of their lives I think we should give President Obama his due in proposing a nominee with such impeccable credentials so I reject the first possible explanation that the majority's opposition is about the nominee in fact a determination that Merrick garland was not a fit character to even receive consideration as a Supreme Court justice would Sun would set such a high bar for appointees that it's hard to imagine anyone ever clearing it since the garland blockade has nothing to do with the character of the nominee many perceive that it is instead explained by the majority's use of this president is there something about President Obama that would warrant his supreme court nominee receiving second-class treatment compared with passed Senate practice could it be the circumstances of the president's election some presidents have been elected with less than a majority vote of the American public and have thus been burdened with a notion that they did not have a mandate from the American public but President Obama was elected in both 2008 and 2012 with overwhelming majorities in the electoral college and his popular vote margins in both elections were also relatively strong in comparison with the norms and recent presidential elections so there's nothing about the legitimacy of President Obama's elections that would warrant treating this president's nomination different than previous executives this makes extremely puzzling the majority's claim that they want to quote let the American people decide the American people did decide they gave President Obama the constitutional responsibilities to nominate justices to the Supreme Court from his first day in office to his last so I may not be happy with the decision but it it's insulting to the president and it's insulting to the American electorate who chose him according to long-standing and clear electoral rules to demean the legitimacy of his election could it be the unique unpopularity of this president I think you could hypothesize a situation where a president in the last year of his term is so unpopular that a Senate might conclude that the public is no longer supportive of the executive but that's not the case with President Obama the president's current popularity is actually quite strong compared with other presidents during their final years in office so there's nothing about the president's popularity with the American electorate that would warrant treating this his court nominee different than the treatment accorded to pass nominees so what could it be about President Obama that would warrant the blockade of his court nominee in a matter completely different than the way the Senate has treated all other occupants of the Oval Office in what way is this president different to justify such treatment I stayed again what I've said before obviously I don't know the answer I cannot say why the Senate would be so willing to break its historic practice and my reading of the Constitution to refute consideration of a nomination made by this particular president but I can say that it's painful and offer some thoughts about how it appears to many of my neighbors too many of my constituents and also too many of my parishioners who I attend church with they reacted with alarm when news came that certain leaders had declared soon after President Obama was elected that their primary goal was to assure that he would not be reelected they watched with sadness as some in Congress raised questions about whether he was even born in the United States they saw some in Congress questioned his faith and his patriotism they observed a member of Congress shall you lie at this president during a televised speech to the entire Congress they noticed recently as the budget committees of both the House and Senate refused to even hold hearings on the president submitted 27 but 2017 budget the only time a president has been treated in such a manner since the passage of the Budget Control Act of 1974 in short they are confused and they are disturbed by what they see as attack on this president's legitimacy I'm not referring to attack on this president's policies which should always be fair game for vigorous disagreement and i have often attacked this president's policies but instead what people are worried about is some level of attack on the very notion that it is this individual occupying the Oval Office and this latest action the refusal to even consider any Supreme Court nominee afforded by President Obama in his final year when other presidents were granted consideration of their nominees seems highly suspicious to them when that blockade is maintained even after the President Ford's to the Senate a nominee of sterling credentials the suspicion is heightened and when the asserted reason is the need to quote let the people decide thus suggesting that the people's decision to elect this particular president twice is entitled to no respect they are deeply troubled what can explain why this president the nation's first african-american president is singled out for this treatment again I don't know but we cannot blind ourselves to how actions are perceived the treatment of a Supreme Court nomination by this president that departs from the practice with previous executives and that cannot be explained due to any feature of the particular nominee under consideration feeds a painful perception about motivations and the pain is magnified when it's in connection with an appointment to the Supreme Court whose very building proclaims in stone over its entrance the Cardinal notion of equal justice under law there is a third interpretation of the garland blockade that is also troubling some see the blockade is just sort of power politics as an attempt to slant the court the death of Justice Scalia creates concern among those who fear a natural transition on the court and so there's an effort to stop that natural and lawful transition the blockade on filling a naturally occurring vacancy in my view is harmful to the independence of the article three branch even in the three months since Justice Scalia's death the Court's rulings have shown the challenges of an eight-member court on four occasions already the court has been unable to render a clear decision in a case of great importance and since the blockade if successful will probably maintain the artificial vacancy until the spring of 2017 it is likely to happen in other cases as well and so lower courts and all persons whose rights and liberties are subject to ruling by this court are deprived of the clarity on federal issues that the court was designed to provide but it's more it's more than just a hobbling of the courts ability to decide individual discrete cases seventy years ago when Winston Churchill spoke at Westminster College about the descent of an Iron Curtain across Europe he defined the differences between free societies and those driven by tyranny and key to his description of free societies was an independent judiciary it's an independent judiciary that serves as a bulwark against executive or legislative para grams protecting the liberties of an individual from the overreaching executive or from a majoritarian legislature that does not fully grasp the rights of minorities that's what an independent legislatures in judiciary is designed to do and I think we all know that this independence of the American judiciary has been one of the great hallmarks of American democracy in my view the blockade of the garland nomination really undermines this independence the Judiciary Act of 1862 the composition of the court at nine justices with life tenure and that statute has remained in force for 150 years when President Franklin Roosevelt didn't like certain rulings of the Supreme Court in the 1930s he tried to expand the court and elbow out older justices by proposing a forced retirement age and an expansion of the numbers in that Judiciary Act of 1862 ours actions were an attempt to attack the Independence of the jeddak judicial branch and so congressional leaders of both parties stood up to stop it I think this current blockade is that is the legislative equivalent of what President Roosevelt tried to do refusing to consider an Obama nomination in order to artificially maintained a court vacancy for more than a year is as much an attack on the judiciary's trying to expand it beyond nine members and I hope we would agree with this whether an independent judiciary is attacked by the executive or the legislative branches we need to be equally diligent in repelling that attack American diplomats work every day around the world trying to convince other societies of the virtues of the rule of law in the independent judiciary but the current blockade unless corrected suggests that we do not practice what we preach by refusing to fill a naturally-occurring vacancy we send the message that the rule of law and an independent judiciary ultimately secondary day having a more favorable or a more compliant judiciary even if we have to weaken it to attain what we want Madam President I once lived in a country with a military dictatorship that held this view of the judiciary the judiciary was not prize for his independence but instead it was prized for its slavish obedience to a few in control of society by refusing to fill a Supreme Court vacancy because a partial and weakened Court is deemed more acceptable than a full and lawfully constituted court we move away from one of our best traditions to become more like legal systems that we are working to change around the world every day in doing so we weaken new judiciary by leaving this vacancy that's already affected proceedings we weaken the executive by hobbling the constitutional power to fill duly constituted executive and judicial positions but we also weaken the legislative body which has that important duty of checking these nominees for fitness of character and by doing it without even being willing to cast a vote I think we really hurt our own institutional credibility in conclusion Madam President I harken back to nineteen fifty four a matter of fundamental importance to our nation was before the Supreme Court the death of a justice left an eight-member court that had already shown it was equally divided and likely unable to reach a ruling but the Senate did its job and filled the court and the court could then render a ruling that changed the course of American history for the better we should learn from this history into our job persisting with this current blockade and sending these possibly unintentional messages is deeply dangerous the refusal to carry out the commands of the Constitution and the Judiciary Act of 1862 abide by senate precedence to fill in actually occurring Supreme Court vacancy to offer the advice and consent that as part of a senator's job description and to entertain a well-qualified nominee even for a hearing much less a vote will not be viewed favorably in the bright and objective light that history will shine on all of our actions we can fix this if the Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing cast a vote report judge garland to the floor and then ensure that the Senate debates this nomination and holds a floor vote we will uphold our responsibilities judge garland might be confirmed or he might be rejected but in taking action rather than mounting an unprecedented blockade we preserve the ability of each senator to make the judgment about whether judge garland possesses the fit character necessary for the position we act in accord with the Constitution and the Judiciary Act of 1862 track toises of the Senate practices that have served us well as the case of Brown versus Board of Education shows and we cure the painful and dangerous message that is communicated by the current blockade strategy and with that Madam President I yield the floor

thank you mr chairman thank you for uh proving to the university of south carolina health policy students that many things in america and certainly in the senate continue to happen on a bipartisan fashion there's no doubt that when you're not in washington d.c and too often you hear through the screens in your homes or in your dormitories how polarizing or divisive republicans and democrats are in the united states senator and the congress this this committee particularly consistently acts in bipartisan ways so as to serve americans not red states or blue states not republicans or democrats but we literally spend a lot of time working together to provide solutions to the concerns that everyday americans are are suffering through so i appreciate your leadership in a bipartisan fashion and certainly thank you for holding the hearing that we're having today nearly 40 million americans 40 million americans are credit invisible meaning they have no or little credit history credit invisible americans have a hard time getting approved for loans or finding a place to stay a lack of credit can even impact your ability to get a job yes 39 states including south carolina and pennsylvania allow employers to deny applicants a job based on their credit history for the majority of families having a bank account we would think of that as just a given 5.4 percent of our fellow americans are without a bank account in south carolina 41 percent of households making under thirty thousand dollars have limited or no ties to the banking system eighteen point three percent of people with disabilities and five percent of individuals who are 55 years of age or older are unbanked almost seventeen percent of african americans are unabated are unbanked 31 plus percent of unbanked earn less than 15 000 a year think about that less than fifteen thousand dollars a year twenty point eight percent of unbanked folks do not have a high school diploma unfortunately it is truly expensive to live in poverty or to be poor in america homeless individuals have a particularly difficult time opening a bank account i've heard stories from social workers who are trying to help south carolinians who are homeless find a bank account trying to get the relationship that is so important unable to do so because they lack an address in other cases a homeless individual may lack proper identification to comply with the rules of opening up an account credit invisible americans are less likely to be in a position to save for their future to save a rainy day fund or to save for their retirement people who are credit invisible do not usually have bank accounts they rely on cashiers checks payday lenders or pawn shops for their financial needs let me say that in a different way when you're using alternatives to our banking system the fees associated with those alternatives can add up to about forty thousand dollars over a lifetime think about a 40 worth of fees not interest just fees to get the loans that you need those fees for someone making under 15 000 a year over a lifetime which is 15 times 40 years of working 600 thousand dollars that's nearly seven percent of your income lifetime income going to fees that's why innovation and creativity and the space of of the credit invisible is so incredibly important one of the reasons why we highlight the work that we see in columbia south carolina from optus bank they have tried to help with this very important issue they believe that all people should have access to the american dream not just those born into the right circumstances or on the right side of the tracks this bank offers a checking account with no minimum account balance no fees even as little as a hundred dollars in an account another way that we have to continue to work towards making sure that the credit invisible becomes visible is by introducing legislation that i have with joe manchin bipartisan credit access and inclusion act in order to help more americans obtain and keep credit history it allows landlords telecom companies and utility providers to report on-time payments to the three major credit bureaus this common-sense piece of legislation will help millions of americans who do not have traditional credit histories but have demonstrated they have credit worthy behavior which will help them lower their interest rates while keeping more of their hard-earned dollars a second bill i introduced with senator cortez masto the expanding access to lending options gives credit unions more flexibility in the types of loans that they can offer to find a way to help those who desperately need assistance chairman once again thank you for holding today's hearing and to the university of south carolina go cox

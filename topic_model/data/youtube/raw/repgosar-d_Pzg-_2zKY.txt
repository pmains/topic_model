hello folks I'm Congressman Paul gosar from Arizona I'm sure by now many of you have seen the shocking project Veritas video exposing the medical staff at the Phoenix Indian Medical Center admitting that they do not report side effects injuries and illnesses caused by the Cova vaccine Federal Law requires all hospitals and health care providers to report adverse vaccine events to the vaccine adverse event Reporting System also known as theirs this system does two things one the FDA and CDC can monitor the potential risk to the Public Health by seeing firsthand these problems if a vaccine causes too many injuries the vaccine can be pulled off the market this has happened before secondly it allows an injured patient and their family the ability to file a claim for compensation with a federal compensation fund this is a legal right and it is time sensitive like all legal claims after seeing this miscarriage of justice and the medical negligence documented by project Veritas I immediately wrote to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to investigate this matter and to remedy the problem immediately look I'm not pro-vaccine I'm not anti-vaccine I am Pro patient choice and informed consent and I am pro-truth and transparency the American public is not protected by Health Care Providers deliberately lying or withholding evidence they don't like thank you project Veritas for your work America thanks you as well

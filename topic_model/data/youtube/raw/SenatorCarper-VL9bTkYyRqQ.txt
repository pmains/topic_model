hi everybody we try something different in car purrs quarters and what we're going to do is pick from other many letters emails and phone messages that we receive every week and try to answer one of the questions one of the issues it's been been raising we picked a letter here in a question from woman named Sharon she lives in bear delaware and here's what I Sharon what you wrote the the the upcoming battle over the debt ceiling is an important issue an important moment for future generations of America I'd agree with that she adds I understand that making spending cuts can be difficult and painful but pray that you have the courage to make the right call and so for sharing thanks for for that question it's got a couple of comments if I could I like most people I have core values that I try to adhere to among my four core values the first is figure out the right thing to do just do it not the easy thing not the expedient thing but the right thing and I'm trying to do that for a long time the second is the golden rule treat other people the way I want to be treated and the chaplain a senator likes to say it's a cliff notes the New Testament we should try to use that to guide us and almost everything that we do and the third one is really focusing on excellence and everything that we do I I say everything I do I know I can do better and that the same i think is true of federal programs and with that in mind figure out the right thing to do do a treat other people we want to be treated and then focusing on excellence and everything we do in trying to do things better if you look at every every federal problem we have well obviously me I know I can everything I do I know I can do better I think that the same is true of all of us is it turns out the same thing is true of most federal problems whether their defense programs or domestic programs whether they're Oh entitlement programs whether they're always so-called tax expenditures which are tax breaks and tax credits and all that kind of thing what are they one of the things I've sought to do is share a little subcommittee on the federal financial management in the Senate is to really drill down on domestic programs defense programs entitlement programs and tax expenditures and ask this question how do we get out go get a better result for less money how can we get a better result for maybe the same amount of money and to find out what's working and do more of that and we really have to take that that approach to to spending across the board I our subcommittee partners with the Office of Management and Budget with the general Accountability Office with the inspector general's across the federal government with groups like citizens against government waste and what we do is to focus on what works do more of that and what's not working if we can't change things that it works better than do less of less of that that's a really good approach and one that we were actually now partner with the Obama administration Democrats and Republicans in the in the Senate the my own view on as you try to wrestle with a 1.4 trillion baht dollar budget deficit this year everything needs to be on the table the defense spending domestic spending entitlement programs and those tax expenditures the tax expenditures those tax breaks now add up to 15 trillion dollars over the next ten years and they are just another form of spending so and and the the idea is to look at them and say which of these are working which are not do more of what what works sounds simple it's actually a pretty good approach so thank you for thanks to the question I hope we hear from you again look toward a senior bear bye bye

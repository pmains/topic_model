our nation's critical networks a homeland security subcommittee today is looking at cyber attack threats and ways to reduce the risk Texas Concha Michael McCaul is chairman of the oversight investigations and management subcommittee that's having this hearing this afternoon congressman McCaul nice to have you with us my face Jenna thanks for having me so you're talking about setting standards for federal computer networks like computer networks that are used by the CIA NASA the Department of Defense how vulnerable are these networks right now they're under attack every day we have a hundred thousand hits per week on the CIA's a website probably a million hits in the House of Representatives every federal agency has been hacked into an enormous amounts of data have been stolen primarily by the Chinese we're talking about military secrets the f-35 Joint Strike airplane blueprints were stolen this poses a serious threat to our national security and we need to harden these federal networks imagine if agents of a foreign power were caught in the Pentagon stealing paper files yet in the virtual world that's what happens every day every single day so what what's in place right now and and what more do we need to do well I'm holding a hearing today to illustrate the threat i think the cyber you know cyber theft of intellectual property a trillion dollars have been stolen from the united states without difficult to be competitive when they're stealing that amount of intellectual property the espionage is is really over the top from China and finally the cyber warfare piece is a piece that keeps me up at night the most in terms of the idea that they can bring down power grids financial institutions really wreak havoc in the United States to bring America to its knees and so we have a historic legislation on the floor this week to deal with the issue of hardening the federal networks information sharing between the federal government the private sector on these what they call signature threats to better protect both the federal government but also the private sector which controls about ninety percent of that critical infrastructure out there well definitely a lot of concerns you mentioned the two trillion dollars of intellectual property that that is estimated to be stolen i was looking at your website and you have our 15 trillion dollar a debt clock up and ticking as we speak right now and so this is a time of austerity how do we prioritize and how much money do you really need if at all to to update some of these systems and make sure that the federal government in particular those systems are secure I think the good news is most these bills will be working within the existing budgets in an intense partisan environment this these bills are actually very bipartisan so I anticipate they're going to sail through the Congress this week and that's good news I think the information sharing piece is really just using a pilot study that NSA worked on and use that to work with the private sector to better protect again these critical infrastructures we're talking about energy financial institutions power grids all these sort of things anything connected to the Internet is subject to being brought down and I can't emphasize that enough i think this this is an issue that has been long overlooked when i talk to the director of NSA i asked him when he expected or was it possible we could have a cyber Pearl Harbor his response was the answer is not if but when right then the Secretary of Defense had got to say as well he echoed that but but how much how much money will you need to do what you want to do again I think a lot of this we can work within existing budgets I see nothing and I think that also the information sharing piece is just getting the relevant stakeholders together with the federal government to make sure they know about these cyber threats that are out there and how better to protect themselves the information sharing peaches is something else that our viewers are very concerned about just as far as private property and making sure that their data is protected as well everyone's for the safety of the country but there's also that peace and we'd love to have you back congressman McCaul to talk more about that side but this is a great introduction to your work and we look forward to having you back thank you very much a place Jenna thanks for having me five states are holding presidential primaries today Mitt Romney is pushing to win more delegates and try to come close

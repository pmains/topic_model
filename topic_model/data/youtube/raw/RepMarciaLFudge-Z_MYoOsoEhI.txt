and I now recognize the gentlelady from Ohio I miss fudge thank you very much mr. Chairman I thank you all for your testimony today I guess maybe I'm one of the few people that really lives in the real world here hiring is based on need people hire people because they need them they don't hire them out of the goodness of their heart and so if you don't need a person you don't hire them you're making it seem to me that you are doing them a favor by hiring them and then making them work a lot of hours and not paying them it's not how this business works it's applying to man that's just basic simple economics uh mr. Eisenberg is there any data that you're aware of that supports the premise that higher wages causes job loss no I I think that one of the big problems with our economy right now is that wages have been held down so long that the power of consumers has been reduced and therefore businesses are not hiring they don't have the customers they need and that's what that's what every survey of small business says by the way that the problem is not regulations that's not the first thing that they all right their first problem is we don't have the customers we need thank you very much and so so mr. Williams's premise that overtime pay is a penalty and I believe I wrote down exactly what you said is actually not accurate is it well in a sense he's right it's a it's a penalty on employers who work their employees excessive hours that's what makes it more expensive for them to do that Thank You mr. Williams you say you have about 75,000 plus first let me congratulate you for working your way up I think that that's the American dream I appreciate that I started working at McDonald's I understand the process you have 75,000 employs approximately how many of them are management employees it would probably be about thirty percent the microphone so thirty percent of your employees are management employees you don't mind paying the other seventy percent over time correct that is correct great okay work over 40 hours they get and so what is the responsibility of a manager just a regular line manager what what are their duties as a general rule exempt or nonexempt exempt what exempt manager has to pass the duties test and so they would have to be a bona fide executive they would have to have the responsibility of hiring and firing they would have to be the person that manages the business according to the duties test department of labor okay so basically you have very trusted employees people that do a great job just as you do with your people that work with your children and I think that's a great thing that you have people that you trust that you believe in that you trust with the lives of kids but you guys don't want to pay them that's what I don't understand you have these valued employees in which you have put a lot of time and a lot of money a lot of energy you trust them and then you want to restrict their pay when you make them work 60 70 hours a week it just doesn't seem to mesh to me that you value your employees if you don't want to pay them um miss fudge me I just correct the record on yes it has been said that this is the biggest increase you know that we've ever had in the salary threshold I just want the record to reflect that it's been 11 years since the last increase from nineteen thirty eight to nineteen forty nine was 11 years and the increase in the salary threshold for administrative employees went from thirty dollars to seventy five dollars a week which was a hundred and fifty percent so that is not true and I think that we need to keep it in perspective thank you at least I you know I very much appreciate mr. kuchen talking about the fact that it is time for wage increase I appreciate that because it is the very people that you all represent low-income people they're the ones who need it the most I appreciate that you hire young people in communities of need but they are the people who need the increase is more than anyone else so yes you're helping them in one respect but you're holding them down and another so I just want to thank all of you for your testimony I am hopeful that as we go forward we can find some way to come together to try to help the people that all of us I believe want to help mr. Chairman I yield back

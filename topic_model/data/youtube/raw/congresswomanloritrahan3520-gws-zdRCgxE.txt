well greetings everyone and thank you for tuning in today on this historic day i'm congresswoman laurie trahan and i'm honored to be joined by this incredible panel of change makers for a discussion about our national movement to address racial injustice it's so important that as we begin this conversation we acknowledge this day and the significance of juneteenth a holiday which commemorates the freeing of slaves in the state of texas two and a half years after president lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation this day serves as a reminder that change required by law doesn't automatically convert into the change or the progress that we intend 155 years later that's certainly never been more true and that's what brings us together uh here today to uplift the voices of the change makers in our community and to expedite justice before i turn it over to my co-moderator masada i'd like to briefly give an update on what's going on in washington in the wake of the these demands for change that we've heard from every corner of our nation and from so many peaceful protests in our own communities the the murder of george floyd was a breaking point in our country the horrific footage of his strangulation at the hands of a minneapolis or of minneapolis police officers exposed law enforcement that has gone unchecked for decades and the deep wounds in our nation caused by centuries of racial injustice and failed policies it's easy for it to seem to some like these issues are just now resurfacing but for many black and brown americans discrimination and race racism have been a painful part of everyday life for too long what has been particularly painful is the fact that a black man or woman's account of racial injustice or police brutality often isn't enough it still takes visual displays of racism and brutality for people to wake up to the fact that in 2020 america still isn't a land of equality in the 1950s news cameras and photographers brought the images of legalized racism into homes across our country and for the first time it became impossible to turn a blind eye to the inequality that persisted for black americans 70 years later it was cell phone cameras and social media that are used to capture and broadcast the continued pattern of indefensible use of force by police who are disproportionately targeting african-american communities you all be returning to washington next week to vote for the justice and policing act of 2020. this legislation led by the congressional black caucus will overhaul policing and communities across the country by ending police brutality requiring increased transparency and making sure that officers are not only held accountable for their own conduct but also empowered to hold each other accountable without the fear of retaliation this comprehensive legislation is long overdue had the justice and policing act been law years ago uh george floyd and eric gardner they wouldn't have been killed by chokeholds because they're banned under this bill briona taylor wouldn't have been gunned down in her apartment because police wouldn't have been able to execute a no-knock warrant and the officer who killed tamir rice wouldn't have even been a policeman because a national registry would have exposed his long history of misconduct that had previously gotten him fired from another department this bill is historic but it's important that you know that i don't view this as the solution to injustice in our country passing this bill is a necessary step in the right direction but our agenda goes far beyond law enforcement we've always encountered excuses as to why we can't tackle disparities and who does and doesn't have access to health care good quality schools clean air and drinking water a fair workplace affordable housing and a dignified criminal justice system but we're working to change that pattern because we're tired of inaction committees in the house are already hard at work looking at racial inequality in all areas of life from our military judicial system to the classroom we must confront structural racism in every facet of our lives and ensure that this moment is a turning point for action okay so now i'd like to turn it over to my co-moderator masada jones masada is the founder and executive director of the kindred project where she works to strengthen and increase the visibility of the black community in lowell in addition to her efforts at the kindred project she's also the co-founder of free verse an organization that uses the power of poetry and performance to enrich the lives of young people so masada thank you for being here it's nice to see you again thank you so much for having me i'm just so glad that we're having this conversation on juneteenth juneteenth is a massive holiday for um black americans if you do not know what the holiday is also known as june 19th i urge you to read up on it um i don't believe in always giving the information to folks i believe you have to go and search for it yourself the internet is vast and wide um i'm not going to talk too much um let's get get into it um thank you all for joining us um so with us we have from haverhill hannah bessette a junior a junior at howard university studying political science you want to wave to folks hannah and from lawrence we have ricardo ricky rios a recent graduate in political science from skidmore college you want to wave to the people and from lowell we have terrell brown a sophomore at robert morris university studying criminal justice and playing for their men's basketball team and i'm going to kick us off with our first question so what was the catalyst for you to become an organizer in this movement rather than a participant and you all can just unmute yourselves at one at a time and let's get into it um i'll go i think um for me personally the catalyst was being born black i think it's kind of an inescapable struggle if you are you know a black a person in america or a person of color in america um obviously it was catalyzed by coven 19 happening a lot of people being out of work and thus their attention they had to look up from their daily lives and see what was happening around them and everybody had time which we usually don't have um so i think that was a catalyst for why this movement got so big so quickly but i think the catalyst for me getting in the movement i never felt like i had a choice not to be awesome thank you i would say uh when i started off i was just doing like kind of my part as like a as a young as a youth kind of posting and like you know retweeting and trying to talk to people and give them like insight and stuff like that i would say i kind of fell into this kind of activist if you would say i went to a protest in lowell and there was an opportunity that came up and i just there wasn't a way for me to pass it up and i kind of just like went there and took it and then i just continued to move forward with that and i just i've been using my voice to try to make a change so awesome yeah for me uh more generally i became an activist um i guess in back in 2012 here in lawrence the boston globe released a um in an article about lawrence called city of the damned and those were kind of my first um that was my first moment where i realized that you know the community outside of the community there is these perceptions that don't align with my reality my experiences here and so i've been an activist since that moment and more recently with the blm movement i've i i wanted to re-envision the way that we we think about activists i think people automatically assume that activists are just people out there with um with signs and you know screaming at the top of their lungs but there are so many different ways that you can do activism and so for me personally um more recently i've decided to do more you know crowdfunding um through my personal contacts as a form of activism um as an independent activist and um i i got through i was able to do that because of a lot of the the push from my fellow peers that's great you know as a as a young person uh you know i've always believed and and i don't think i'm alone uh but our young people are our greatest asset right i mean it's just that is what gives so many people hope and optimism in the future is watching all of you um you know in the streets on the commons and parks um sort of speak your truth from such an authentic place but i'm sure you're often told that you don't know what you're talking about or you don't have enough life experience or you're naive i mean those are some of my favorites uh when i hearken back to being an outspoken young adult myself uh what message do you want to convey i can start yeah um honestly i'm tired of hearing that message uh just because if you look if you look around us you'll see with the environmental movement you have um folks you have gotta thurmberg but you also have other folks um like uh um ilhan omar's daughter who are at the forefront of these of these um political uh movements then you have you know the blm movement um i've gone to four protests um in the last two weeks and all i see are teenagers from high school and from college um all you know advocating and mobilizing in support of this and when i bring up these issues at home um to older generations a lot of them say well this is a status quo that's how things are and so that's why i'm less um i guess i'm less uh swayed by that or i listen to less to that kind of um that message because i understand that the people around me that are actually you know acting on this are people who are young so um i i definitely think that we should be cognizant of that and pay attention to the to the youth in this moment because they are the ones making the change yeah yeah yeah i definitely agree um i mean youth have been at the forefront of many movements and as for the kind of you the age and intelligence question um i think it's really interesting to grow up in environment like massachusetts which is such a white space and so even with i mean i have white family the majority of my family is white and so even having to turn around from such a young age and try to educate my own elders per se is um challenging and i think that i've just had a lot of practice in doing that and then i've just had to take that into my real life as well i mean i love to read i love history and i think if you don't if you're if you're not able to admit that history and educating and educating yourself has a huge part to do with it then you don't necessarily understand i mean the the school system and its curriculum has obviously been very whitewashed and i think adults have grown up with that as their norm and now that we have access to google and the internet in these computers in our pockets we have so much more information and that's why the youth and social media are becoming more and more reliable than huge news agencies owned by you know the big five and so i think being able to record being able to get a message out quickly when you have something to say is um really important i think we don't get enough credit for the way that we've been able to creatively uh be activists yeah yeah terrific i agree exactly what both of them said because like as i was growing up my parents tried to integrate me into kind of like the white community and so kind of like so when i was when i was in high school and younger i went to like catholic school i went to brooks when i was in high school and so obviously like 90 of my school was all white people and so kind of being a young person like we're already we're so like so so intertwined with different races and we interact with different people all the time and so we kind of have perspectives that our older generation does not really know because they might be like staying with the old things that they understand like that they're used to uncomfortable with but kind of like us like like they said with the protests and stuff like all the processes i went to they were all led by youth like the youth let you set it up we all like like social media is such a big thing with us so we use the social media to interact with each other and kind of bring each other closer that way we can kind of like use our voices better and just like kind of make it like keep going and so like i would say that the the whole naive thing is like i think they think that we might not understand what they've gone through but they also don't understand what we're going through right now so our communication together can help make a big change in that way so that's great masada yes word all of which all said everything thank y'all um so we're hearing you i know that i'm i always look to young people um and i want you to know that i am hearing you and for those that are listening what do you feel um is still being missed i think um something that's being missed is the fact that this isn't a bipartisan issue this isn't politics that we're debating um i think it's been obviously racism is systemic and it's very deeply ingrained it's our innate sin as a country and we haven't even recovered or repaired that um i think what's what we're missing is that it's not a bipartisan issue it's not patriotic it's not i mean to to fight against the black lives matter movement because we're americans and i think people that still back ideals that were so heavily enforced by the confederacy are and and then claiming patriotism behind that is like well no they were trying to secede so if you're american you know if you really want to be truly american then come fight with us i think it's important that um we recognize that just because a racist politician says something racist and puts that racism into law does not make racism politics and so hiding your racism behind your political affiliations just isn't a valid excuse anymore because we see right through it i wholeheartedly agree um i think that with i i keep saying that time and time again that you know black lives matter isn't a political issue it's a it's a declaration of humanity these are black people going out there and saying i am human i am an american you know and so it's always been ludicrous to me to think that that people actually thought that that statement was you know political of itself um when they're just saying i want to live and i want to be free um but i also think that another thing that's missing is um the fact that there's a and i guess this ties into the misconceptions um question but the fact that you know everyone's trying to interpret defund the police i think that's something that we gotta we gotta talk about because it literally means what we're saying defund the police it's talking about taking allocating those funds and putting them into resources for the community into social workers into education into um art into all these different things i mean just in lawrence um i read an article from the equal tribune yesterday that said that there were there is an intention for the fiscal year uh budget for 2021 they're intending to put six hundred thousand dollars towards youth programs and police training and in that in in that article they they quote dan rivera saying oh you know we've listened and we've you know we we hear you and we are listening clearly um but you're not because all the protests that i'm going to everyone's screaming defund the police but the first thing the first thing the first action that you take is to add more funding to the police even though it's the largest budget for uh you know lawrence and it's by by a lot it's i believe the next uh budget would be towards education and it's like eight percent of what the police budget is you know so it's like why are we funneling all these resources into the police force when you know that's what we're we're advocating against right um because if it's an inherently violent uh uh system you know it's it's it's rooted in um in incarcerating folks you know through racism through slavery you know that's how they that's how they responded in the south is okay we we freed slaves so now we're gonna incarcerate them so we can use their bodies for labor that way you know so i think i think um we we have to you know stop saying okay how are we interpreting d from the police and just take it for what it is at face value it means taking that money and pouring into resources i would also say like um one thing that people maybe are like one thing that's missing would be like like kind of like seeing that this is not just a now this has been before and will keep going until until change happens and so until i can walk outside and feel comfortable driving by a cop and not freezing up exactly so if when we got to understand that us as people of color and people and also the people the white people that are also in this movement who are ready for like to make a change we're not gonna stop like it's not a it's not a thing that okay yeah someone died let's let's protest for a month now we're gonna go back to regular lives no we're not doing that we're gonna keep on going and all the things that we're doing is it's beautiful like they're all the peaceful protests all the the different like like um black lives matters like paintings all over the like the world like the country and stuff like that like that's what like people need to understand that just because you you step in for a little bit and do your part and then you go back home and think you're good like you have to put yourself in our shoes if when i go back home i still have to figure out how the next day i walk outside if that might be the last day i walk outside so kind of like that kind of understanding that this is not gonna stop and it's gonna keep going forward until change actually happens yeah i love that message uh you know masada and i were recently on a call together and it's funny i grew up in lowell and uh and it was the first time um i heard someone criticize the term melting pot um and she did it uh you know because it's a connotation that people often use to show uh you know their pro the pride that they have in living in a diverse city except that it implies as long as you assimilate which is the point that masada made uh you know in in the work i did before coming to congress i worked on diversity and inclusion initiatives in boardrooms and you know private companies and we would have actually emphasized exactly the opposite it was authenticity over assimilation you know we don't need more group think we don't need more common information effect we actually need to hear perspectives that we wouldn't think of on our own uh or experiences that we haven't lived if we want to perform better have a better economy all of that and like you all embody that i mean i saw hannah i've never seen a a young woman so comfortable in her own skin uh she was like up on uh up uh you know up on a you know a deus uh outdoor theater you know just commanding over almost a thousand people in haverhill last weekend and it was like the exact opposite of you know assimilate and so i guess it's not really a question more than a comment but you know it's great to see our young people like um you know being themselves i mean we can handle it right i mean and we we must handle it we must hear you and uh and it's just it was just incredible to see uh and you clearly are uh change makers in your own right because uh that's just who you are uh and that is um probably the the greatest thing that i've seen um in in these last few weeks is how uh this has been youth led um i don't get the feeling and i don't think anyone does that this is going away anytime soon as long as you all have uh you know the baton and i and it's it's it's exactly what we need right now so maybe speak to sort of the assimilation versus the the moment that we're living in in terms of like that's not that never worked for us yeah definitely i think um one of the this kind of ties into misconceptions um or just things that people don't think about um but just kind of like terrell said where it's great that we have such um support and such intersectional support there's every different type of person is coming out to protest with us you're seeing everybody at um protests but it's important to recognize that just because you've come in as a non-black person or a non-person of color and done your part for the day that's not enough to be satisfied and i remember saying that um last week where this just isn't enough and i as as great as the movement is i'm not going to thank any non-black person for coming to protest because it's your responsibility and i think that i'm i'm very over the gold star for behavior that we should be doing you should care that people are treated as less than um and i think with the assimilation kind of question oh yeah it's never worked i mean we've tried um black people have been forced to adopt eurocentric beauty standards have been forced to adopt um eurocentric mannerisms code switching um kind of switching off that african-american vernacular english to try to sound more articulate i think all of those things we understand they don't work because there's no tricking someone into thinking that any of us are white and none of us will ever receive that that the treatment that we would if we were and so i think what's important to remember is that we have to we're born into the struggle and it's our obligation as black people to have to fight through it every day and to be black in america is to actively be attempting to be peaceful every moment of every day and to let anything that happens roll off your back and so i think what we need to be doing is just letting black youth especially lead the way um because we haven't done enough and even if you are a non-black person responsibly it's your responsibility to show up every single day that you can because we can't opt out of being black for a single day that's great anything else to add massage oh go ahead um yeah i i will hardly agree with what hannah said um i also think it's hard not um but i also i also think that into the notion of assimilation i mean if we pride ourselves on being a country that's multicultural that's a melting pot of sorts like why why do we want to to i guess eradicate that diversity and so for for me assimilation has always been you know something that i've thought a lot about because of my experiences growing up you know from lawrence around latino too um you know one of the key things um you know i grew up going to a lot of um white led programs um like summer programs out throughout high school and then obviously attending a pwi for for college um and the one thing that when i told people i was from lawrence um was that you know you're a survivor wow you made it you know they're talking about my community as a as if it's a developing nation right that's not even a part of the us um and so that's something that we have to constantly think about and you know we're all constantly being reminded are we are we um are we the product of um affirmative action are you here because of affirmative action are you here are you here did you get this job or were you hired for tokenism these are all different things that we constantly have to think about in assimilation you know and and that's actually one thing that i'm uh right now uh fighting against in my own my own company my own law firm that i'm working for now um is you know how do we personally i don't wanna get into the details about that but just you know how do we support our employees of color um and how are we making sure that they're not only being hired and they're being incentivized to come into the workforce but how are they being elevated how are they how are they are they being given opportunities and resources to grow within the company and are they giving um are they being given support in moments like these where you know a tragic incident like george floyd happened and you know is there any support to kind of have a dialogue because you know companies and and schools don't exist in the vacuum you know they are affected by the context of in the communities that they live they are in so so yeah i think that assimilation has never worked and i don't think that we should even strive for anything no closely but you know there used to be a time when like the advice would be you know even with women like just go along to get along right like it was uh you know a lot of women even to um you know succeed in business that you know they they more adopted uh what men did than like bringing their own you know sort of authentic voice and perspective to the table and the reality is is when you don't actually harness that diversity when you don't actually harness like the different perspectives you actually don't get the benefit of you know having diversity right diversity is our power but like the challenge is like the inclusivity right the bringing all trying to get it all out and um i couldn't agree more it was the first time uh you know um masada had sort of reframed you know melting pot to me because it was like that's a it didn't it implies a blending and that's not what we want we want distinction right so anyway um masada i'll let you ask the uh the next question but i really appreciate um your moderating thank you um so i think all three of you have mentioned that this movement is is not just a moment it's it's going to be a while and um the fight continues so what do you intend to do to take care of yourself to keep your yourself healthy and your sanity intact because i know that the struggle is real so what do you intend to do to make sure you're healthy and sane i'll be completely honest um i don't i'm tired all the time and it's just uh it's just a wait i wake up every morning and i just can't even go back to sleep because i'm saying there's too much to be done and um but i think that that is just the current black experience um i haven't found a particular way to be able to rest or relax i mean i i think the best way to do it is to celebrate black joy and surround ourselves with black people and black happy and everything black i miss my hbcu dearly in these times and um i miss kind of being able to see us happy and carefree and not have to worry so i don't i don't have a solution yet except for fixing these problems um i would say for me well obviously i play sports and i i write so like the kind of the way i kind of kind of bring myself to like a little those peaceful places i either i'll go play basketball or maybe i'll just sit down and kind of write the words that are coming out of my head and put putting my own paper maybe wait make something up or or spend time my family that's one thing that my family is of like a stronghold and they're they just they have my back and regardless so whenever i'm i'm twisted or down or whenever something isn't like right i just kind of just lean on my family and i also i also have god with me as well so i whenever things aren't right you know open that bible say a prayer just ask for peace and then kind of keep it going step into the rest of the way so yeah what i think is apparent in what both tyrell and hannah said is that you know self-care is is um subjective it's you know something that we're gonna have to individually find for ourselves um i know for me personally i like to run so i try to go my runs and just not think i just run and then i also spend like 45 minutes showers just singing i love to sing so that's something that i found you know to be to be relaxing music art um so i think that you know as as much as we can sit here and and give you a bunch of different things you can do to help you know immediately you're gonna have to everyone's gonna have to figure that out for themselves i'll tell you the last the last trip i took before i um before covid struck the nation was i brought my family down to the civil rights pilgrimage uh we did brian stevenson's equal justice initiative uh tour for a weekend and um i it was in the greyhound bus station where the freedom riders uh you know would get together and they broke out into song there were a bunch of you know freedom riders there and uh and uh one of the vocalists incredible um looks and looked at me and said you know this movement's missing music and i'm i'm like i don't know if i can help there um but um you know it's so true that uh so much a part of like you know the the 60s uh and the civil rights movement was rooted in song i got to listen to them all you know weekend so you know maybe we can inject some music into uh into uh black lives matter um i have a question around you know resources for people who want to dive deeper or or even know what they can do to help the movement i mean hannah you were very direct in your eloquent way to say you know show up it's your responsibility and i love that um but are there other things that people can do um to you know continue uh this work i think that um people should to ask questions i've had a lot of my white friends who i've been confused and not sure what to do text me like yo terrell i'm not gonna lie to you i don't know what to do right now what do you how do you think i should go about this and obviously sometimes i don't know the right answer i don't know everything to say but if you ask questions if you ask those your name look like that black kid that lives down the street that you're cool with if you say okay like listen i don't i'm not sure kind of how to kind of pro like kind of work through this but i really want insight and i really want to do my best to help so being able to ask questions and be able to step out of your comfort zones because we we're not comfortable yeah so you got to step out of your comfort zone to be able to make a change right i agree um completely i think asking questions is great i think it's important to emphasize that if you want to for me at least if you want to approach me and ask me a question then be completely and utterly ready to just listen and like just listen or add a question i think a lot of people they come to ask a question and then their intent is actually to tell you that whatever information you're giving them is incorrect and you're like okay so why'd you ask um i definitely agree with masada though do not i i would say don't rely on your black peers to do your educating for you i found it really frustrating trying to go over kind of the basics with a lot of people which i understand is is necessity but the internet is a is a beautiful thing most of the time and i think that we can utilize that and i think that part of being a part of the movement is taking responsibility for your own lack of knowledge or taking responsibility for um not looking not asking questions during your education because if you had asked the right questions then they would have told you oh well lincoln's teeth they really weren't i mean washington's teeth everything went wood you shouldn't have asked though because it'll gross you out and i think that um a lot of those things and taking responsibility for your own education taking responsibility for your own um intellect is important read read history written by black authors buy black support black businesses support black people um call out intolerance when you see it in your day-to-day life because that's a part of the discomfort because black people they do we do it all the time anytime somebody says something off it's like and i think that we see we see white people doing that a lot less just because it's uncomfortable it's like oh but my friend i don't want this political issue to get in the way it's not political yeah and so it's right for you to call out something that's dehumanizing or demeaning sign petitions donate to bail funds for peaceful protesters and yeah and that's it yeah i just wanted to re-emphasize that point about you know making sure that if you are reaching out to someone who is of color about these issues that you preface it with are you okay to answer this question you know because you don't want that's a lot of energy and a lot of you know effort to put into it and just you know living these experiences is enough it's already daunting as hannah mentioned it's it's a weight it's a weight on us every single day so then to have to sit here and even though we didn't go to school for education you know to stay here and be teachers to everyone so i would just i mean google is a great thing like hannah said um i obviously use caution in where you're getting your sources make sure that they're reliable it takes a minute to look up where the article is from or who the article is written by you know google search that author to make sure that it's a credible source but there are there's a plethora of different um you know articles and and documentaries 13th we just had a viewing um with um marianella rivera who's um running for state senate um and you know i i think that it that'd be a great way for um other members of political um uh members who hold positions in our communities to start having more discussions of those having more maybe uh documentary showings or book clubs you know revolving around um these issues so yeah you i think that most people are capable of doing the work themselves especially people so um and they usually have the resources to do so so just make sure that you know if you are doing it so make sure it's coming from a credible source such great advice uh i think it's so important uh for uh folks to hear like show up prepared that's that's your responsibility to stop stop putting it on on me i'm i'm busy trying to change the world for crying out loud so um that is awesome uh you know i'm i before i you know sort of close us out and sadly i know that's all the time that we have although i can't wait to just continue these uh conversations um both online and offline masada what do you have for parting words um i would like to say thank you all for your time and your insight and contributions um i think that we definitely have to normalize the conversation around race and white supremacy um you all are doing that in all of your respective ways and i appreciate you i see y'all thank you same uh i hannah terrell ricky uh thank you so much for taking the time to join us this afternoon uh this was such a great uh discussion masada i know how incredibly busy you are so thank you for always being a willing co-conspirator and uh it's my hope that you know you will be willing to continue this conversation i firmly believe that you know we can't let this moment become just another news cycle um i uh i keep every story every thought all the advice that you know i've i've heard in the in the last few weeks with me not only as i you know work on federal legislation and do what i'm supposed to do uh as a representative but also as a mom as a friend as a community member as an activist myself so i want to thank everyone who joined us today um stay tuned you know we are going to continue this discussion series uh well there's um we're going to be talking about a number of key issues uh where racial injustice and inequity are especially prevalent and we're going to have some really powerful informed guests with us and i think we kicked it off with the best uh panel we ever could have uh our change makers so thank you so much and uh and please do stay in touch stay healthy as i'm you know i have to do the mom thing take care of yourselves uh really your self-care is uh you know something that we don't always think of because you're youth and you've got boundless energy but please take great care of yourselves and uh and keep fighting okay

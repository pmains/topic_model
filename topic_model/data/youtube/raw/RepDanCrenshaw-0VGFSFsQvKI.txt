let me start where the president left off do you believe that he did nothing wrong well let's let's back up when you back up out of all the process and and all the tit-for-tat between the House and the Senate and the process that Republicans complain about and with what the Democrats did in the Intel committee and the Judiciary Committee when you back out of all that this relies on one fundamental question can the president ask about it inherently corrupt on its face conflict of interest between bite and burry smell is it okay for him to ask about that because that's what happened and I would say yes why isn't it okay and nobody's actually answered that question well let me take you at face value there let's say we accept your argument the issue is then millions of dollars in aid that the United States Congress has said needs to go that gets held up mm-hmm in a quid pro quo that's the the heart of the issue the proven a quid pro quo that's also at heart of the issue so you were simply not convinced that the President did anything improper in the house I've been convinced when I didn't see any evidence right I mean really like how can you be convinced of that there was a lot of issues at play and a lot of the people who came and testified what they said was we presumed there was something going on here right we presumed but nobody actually provided any evidence so so how are you going to impeach based upon that weak case it's a thin case and we're making a very drastic decision based on that case so you don't believe anything that you heard from these these witnesses these career civil service have to show me some came and said this is how this showdown wouldn't you think that the implementers of foreign policy because these are the civil servants who are supposed to implement the policy so wouldn't you think that they'd have I don't know something in writing like an actual statement that says if they don't do this we're not going to give them this wouldn't wouldn't you think that they'd available to providing perhaps but that's often working federal government for ten years in the military that is exactly how it works and so and so to not be able to provide any really hard evidence I think is concerning and when you're doing we're looking at how this is played out with with respect to sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate Pelosi has basically said she wants more witnesses she wants more documents for the Senate's trial so the implication there is that she didn't have enough in the first place that she wants to make the case stronger well why did you vote on so let's take John Bolton as an example who refused to testify before the House of Representatives has now said if the Senate subpoenas him he'll come and tell what he knows and they have insinuated very strongly that he knows something and has something to add do you want to hear what he has to say I'm not afraid of of him but also I'm not afraid of what he has to say but but it also begs the question why didn't we subpoena him in in the house why did what there was no deadline here for impeachment right we could have actually gone through this we could have gone through the subpoenas we could have had him come and testify the house when you've already voted on it the implication is that you should have waited for the courts to rule on Bolton before they ever who I wouldn't Ben Schmidt fair enough however that's not how it's played out now Bolton is saying if we subpoena him in the Senate you as an American and I'm not afraid of what he has to say why is the White House afraid of it I don't know that they are okay I know I think they're talking about executive privilege and things like that but even with McConnell's the process that he wants to play out the Senate can still vote and have people come and testify so you know the the Devils in the details there there's some implication that that's not what's happening but it is you can still vote to have witnesses come and testify

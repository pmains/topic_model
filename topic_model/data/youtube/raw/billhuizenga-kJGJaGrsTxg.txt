mr. speaker small businesses and entrepreneurs are what drive the American economy and I meet with them in my district to the second District in Michigan all the time and I know my colleagues do as well back in their district and we see them firsthand we see firsthand the benefits that their dreams their innovations their inspiration their hard work provide to our communities these innovators these entrepreneurs these risk takers are critical for our country's economic growth and prosperity and in fact small businesses are responsible for sixty percent yes sixty percent of the nation's net new jobs over the past two decades not two years not not ten years over the last twenty years over the last two decades so if our nation is going to have an economy that provides opportunity for every American then we must promote and encourage success and growth in our small businesses and our startups it's this notion that brings us this legislation we're discussing today HR 1343 the encouraging employee ownership Act would simply level the playing field for small companies by updating federal rules that allow small businesses to better compensate their employees with ownership in their own businesses currently the Securities and Exchange Commission rule 701 permits private companies to offer their securities as part of written compensation agreements to employees directors general partners trustees officers or certain consultants without having to comply with rigid federal securities registration requirements the SEC rule 701 therefore allows small companies to reward its employees despite the SEC having the authority to increase the 5 million dollar threshold disclosure via rulemaking the SEC is once again in my opinion chosen to prioritize highly politicized regulatory undertakings instead of focusing on its core and that mission includes facilitating capital formation the SEC if the SEC cannot or will not focus its priorities Congress will it is imperative that small businesses in West Michigan all of Michigan and across America have the ability to compete a critical element of competition and success is for those small businesses to be able to offer compensation packages that attract and retain top-tier talent in today's world that includes rewarding employees and stock options to me this just makes common sense small business employees have a clear invested interest in success of their employer by increasing rule 701 to the threshold of 10 million dollars it will give private companies more flexibility to attract reward and retain those highly valuable employees this simple change will allow companies to offer twice the much twice as much stock as their put to their employers annually as they currently can without having to trigger these additional disclosure informations to investors about compensation packages that include these securities offerings by reforming this regulatory burden startups small businesses and emerging growth companies will be better equipped to attract highly talented individuals from companies that are better capitalized and able to maybe provide some additional cash ins and set incentives and compensation so by incentivizing employees with stock options these small businesses will now be able to compete on a more level playing field with older and larger and maybe more established companies and they're going to be able to retain their invoice value employees as well so this bill is an example of a positive bipartisan results that can be achieved when Republicans and Democrats reach across the aisle I commend the sponsors of the bills representative Hultgren Delaney Higgins MacArthur cinema and Stivers for their leadership on this issue I encourage my colleagues to support HR 1343

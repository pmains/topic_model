throughout the past 55 town halls I've done the 75 roundtables we've done people have purified main themes that have motivated me and given me direction people would always talk about number one was national security and international security they would talk about challenges with healthcare specifically the cost of healthcare they would talk about the economy and immigration those are four very constant themes and those those challenges are what very much safer I spent my time and effort you know first of all when it comes to national security we spent a lot of time making sure that we're adequately funding our military for the first time on the economic front I don't have to tell people back home this is the third year in a row depressed prices for commodities so I worked very hard on trade and been too late and I've been to China and back worked very hard on opening markets there I think you know getting this tax reform done happens Aliya maybe the most important legislation of this entire century that this should turbocharged the economy we've given significant tax relief to hardworking Americans hardworking Kansans the average family of four in Kansas is going to get to keep $2,000 more of their hard-earned money ninety percent of Kansans will be able to do their income tax on the back of a postcard and by lowering corporate taxes we're gonna grow jobs and grow wages so this tax reform absolutely has to be the biggest victory that we've seen so far you know beyond that I think the victory that we've opened up some new trade markets and again I'm gonna give the president most of the credit for this broking up South Korea to poultry holding up China to be opening up Colombia to rice and Argentina to floor those are all victories for Kansans biggest adjustments we absolutely just being away from my family away from my wife we've been married now for 34 years and really since the day I met her we have not spent many days apart what I'm looking for in 2018 not excited to work on health care I'm excited to work on bipartisan solutions to immigration lots of great opportunities ahead of us [Music]

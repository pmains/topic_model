mr president it has been my privilege to serve on the senate aging committee since my very first days in the senate and i'm honored to have been elected to chair this committee for the 114th congress i want to welcome the presiding officer senator cotton of arkansas to the committee he will be a new member on our committee and i believe that he will enjoy his service as much as i have mr president my service on the aging committee is particularly appropriate since maine is the oldest state in the nation by median age many people would guess that florida would have that distinction but in fact it's the great state of maine throughout its history the aging committee has spurred congress to action on issues that are important to older americans through its hearings its investigations and its reports this is the first time that a maine senator has chaired the committee since the 1990s when my predecessor mentor and friend senator bill cohen served as chairman mr president i want to share with my colleagues today my priorities for the committee as we begin this new congress i have three major priorities for the committee's work first retirement security second investments in biomedical research targeting diseases that disproportionately affect older americans like alzheimer's and diabetes and third protecting seniors against financial exploitation and scams i'm increasingly concerned mr president that our seniors will not have adequate savings and other financial resources during their retirement years the committee where will therefore focus on retirement security and in particular on the need to encourage more savings and better financial planning according to the non-partisan center for retirement research at boston college there currently is an estimated 6.6 trillion dollar gap between the savings that americans have today and what they should have in order to maintain their standard of living during retirement nationally one in four americans has no source of income beyond social security in the state of maine mr president the number is one in three social security provides an absolutely vital safety net however with an average benefit of just sixteen thousand dollars a year it certainly is not enough to finance a comfortable retirement for many americans according to a survey published in 2012 more than half of all americans are worried that they will not be able to maintain their standard of living in retirement that's up sharply from 34 percent two decades ago and the boston college analysis demonstrates that their concern is warranted there are many reasons for the decline in retirement security facing american seniors including the demise of many defined benefit pension plans in the private sector the severity of the recent financial crises which wiped out much of the worth the net worth of many seniors at least temporarily rising health care costs the need for long-term care and most of all mr president the simple fact that americans are living far longer than we used to many americans reaching retirement age also have more debt than retirees of previous generations i remember when my parents paid off the mortgage on their home and had a mortgage burning party well today mr president people that were are the age that my parents were when they paid off their house are taking on new debt and new mortgages we founded the aging committee that there are seniors who are still paying off their student loans or the student loans of their children these are all issues that i look forward to the committee exploring in depth in this new congress another priority will be highlighting the importance of biomedical research on diseases like alzheimer's and diabetes that take such a devastating toll on older americans and their families investments in biomedical research not only improve the health and longevity of americans but also provide benefits to our economy and to the federal budget for example nearly one out of three medicare dollars is spent treating people living with diabetes according to multiple economic analyses there is roughly a two to one return on investment in federal support for biomedical research this investment at the national institutes of health and at research centers across the country spur job creation and are also critical to america's competitiveness in the global research environment mr president is senate co-chair of the congressional task force on alzheimer's i am particularly committed to helping to spur breakthroughs in an alzheimer's disease which has had such a devastating impact on 5.2 million americans and their families in addition to the suffering it causes alzheimer's cost the united states an astonishing 214 billion dollars a year that includes 150 billion dollars in cost to the medicare and medicaid programs these costs will only skyrocket as the baby boom generation ages fortunately there is promising research that holds hope for alzheimer's patients and their families the research community is poised to make important advances through clinical trials and investigating new therapeutic targets but adequate funding is critical to advance this research to achieve these breakthroughs at a time when the united states is spending more than 200 billion dollars a year for alzheimer's patients we are spending less than three tenths of one percent of that amount about 600 million dollars a year on research surely we can do more for alzheimer's given its tremendous human and economic price the national plan to address alzheimer's has as its primary goal the prevention and effective treatment of alzheimer's by the year 2025 to meet that goal the chairman of the federal alzheimer's advisory council says that we need to devote two billion dollars a year to alzheimer's research well think about that mr president that is only one percent in fact it's less than one percent of what we as a society are spending to care for people with alzheimer's that investment will lead to better treatments and ultimately a means of prevention or even a cure for this awful and expensive disease mr president the aging committee will also continue its focus on scams that target our seniors such as the jamaican lottery phone scam that we exposed in the last congress this nefarious scheme which is estimated to have cost americans as much as 300 million dollars a year particularly targeted seniors in the northeast some seniors in my state lost tens of thousands of dollars to the scam which involved a con artist calling a victim to tell him or her that they had won the jamaican lottery but needed to pay fees to process the winnings well mr president i don't need to tell you that these seniors had won nothing of the sort but this was a very sophisticated scheme in addition to educating seniors to help them avoid becoming victims of such scams the hearing resulted in the jamaican government passing new laws targeting the scammers and promoted and prompted federal law enforcement to extradite and charge several of these con artists the aging committee will also continue its fraud hotline to help protect seniors from these kinds of scams and financial exploitation and the phone number for that fraud hotline which is toll-free is nine 1-855-303-9470-1855-3039 seven zero mr president in addition to these three major priorities it is my hope that our committee in the second year will also take a close look really scrutinize federal programs that are designed to help our seniors such as those authorized by the older americans said we want to make sure that these programs are as effective and efficient as possible and that their benefits reach those seniors as intended so we will be performing that oversight function and sharing our findings with the committee of jurisdiction the health education labor and pensions committee on which i am also privileged to serve mr president the senate special committee on aging has a long history and tradition of bipartisanship and my work on this committee during the past congress was particularly rewarding because of the strong partnership that i forged with the committee chairman the senior senator from florida bill nelson i look forward to continuing that bipartisan tradition with my good friend and close colleague senator claire mccaskill of missouri who will be serving as the committee's ranking member in the 114th congress finally mr president i would encourage the presiding officer and all of the other members of the committee to not only be active participants in the committee but also to share with us your thoughts on issues that we should pursue thank you mr president i yield the floor

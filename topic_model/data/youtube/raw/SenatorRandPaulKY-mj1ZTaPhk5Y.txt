joins me now senator paul thank you very much for being here uh we are waiting for the president to walk in but i want to get this question to you because i thought of you first thing when i read this report this morning from the cleveland clinic what's your reaction to it well you know it has significant public policy ramifications so for example in india they can't keep up with the demand so they don't have enough vaccine so you can save probably hundreds of thousands of lives in india right now today if you'll vaccinate the people haven't gotten covet already if you've already gotten covered the vaccine likely won't hurt you but you don't necessarily need it we can prioritize the vaccine unfortunately india is following dr fauci's advice and they are discounting natural immunity completely and they're saying everybody gets it no matter what you get the one size fits all we're not going to think about this don't make us think but in not thinking about it people will die because they're not prioritizing the vaccine the same thing happened here inevitably there were lives lost in our country because there was some delay in getting it not much fortunately but there was some delay in getting it to the appropriate people because we were vaccinating people who already had the disease and the studies are now showing that it really isn't necessary to be vaccinated if you've already had the disease particularly if you're in a low risk category yeah i wonder what you thought when you went through that cleveland clinic report because i thought you know the headline really grabbed my attention if you've had it you do not benefit from getting the vaccine but then you read through it and at some point they say you know but you still should be vaccinated so i mean how did you interpret that well this is the problem we have nobody's really well willing to be an independent thinker on this it's sort of like your 12 year old child your 12 year old child let's say had coveted three months ago and they're saying has to be vaccinated or can't go to school and you're thinking what does he really need to be and then they send you a report out saying well there are some myocarditis inflammation of the heart you can get from being vaccinated with children but you know you should just go ahead and take it and you're like well do i really need to take it can't we look at some science and this is my biggest objection with falchy he's all over tv complaining we're not obeying the science he's not paying attention to the science the science has been out there for a long time the immunity is good from natural infection vaccine likely won't hurt you but the thing is is we should treat it seriously because this is how we got to herd immunity we are at herd immunity in our country because of a combination of vaccines and at least 100 million people who got the the disease naturally yeah there are reports that there are some j j vaccines that are in the window of probably expiring in some places in this country what would you recommend be done with those high priority people around the world if we can get them to people over 65 or over 40 and overweight that's what i consider to be high priority anybody around the world i would try to get them to people around the world we have done our job here largely and it's good if more people want to get vaccinated in our country but i think we have achieved herd immunity the numbers are going down dramatically and it's because not only vaccine if you only count vaccine people saying it's not enough it's not enough we got to vaccinate the two-year-olds but if you count those who have got it naturally guess what we're there yeah we should definitely have an antibody passport that is equivalent to a covid vaccination passport and you know maybe you have to be tested on a regular basis to prove that you still have those antibodies but we we really haven't seen a push for that last quick question this delta variant what's your what are your thoughts on it well the good news is when you look at the studies those who got the disease naturally their immunity is good against all the variants it's also good news that really the vaccines appear to be working as well there's some studies that say natural immunity may cover the variants better but both natural immunity and the vaccines are working against the variants i i don't think we should be alarmed about this we should be reasonable rational but we shouldn't jump the gun and say immediately oh everybody's got to get vaccinated again we don't know that yet and let's let's look at the bright side almost all the studies show the vaccine works and so does natural immunity thank you very much senator great to have you here today senator rand paul

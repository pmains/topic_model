thank you madam chair miss Sweeney welcome congratulations on your nomination and thank you for taking the time to visit with me welcome to your family I believe it or not I have spent some time in Barrow Alaska and let me just say Eskimo ice cream is not the ice cream that I know so I we've had a great conversation and let me just point out one of a chairman tourists from Nevada she is with the Walker River Paiute Tribe is here and I have as you well know we had this conversation so many incredible tribal communities in the state of Nevada who all had the same concerns that you've heard from in a bipartisan way from all of my colleagues really that that we needs an advocate somebody who's going to fight for our tribal communities we have a system that appears to be broken and we need to fix it so I'd like to start with an issue that has come to my attention and I'm disappointed that I don't have more information so I'm hoping you can help me with this so the Department of Interior is a fiscal to 2019 budget justification includes almost 18 million to begin the process of reorganization of the Department of the Interior along 13 regional offices yet the department has provided little information to Congress this request includes roughly 900,000 to support the department's migration to common regional boundaries I have seen only a draft of the map which would cut my state in half and I have been hearing from my constituents from farmers ranchers ranchers conservation groups and our tribes who fear that the creation of a joint management areas would create another bureaucratic layer or an additional level of authority a question I have for you is one have you been briefed on the reorganization plan or know anything about it and how would you to address the concerns that I'm hearing from my constituents and I'm sure across the country as this reorganization occurs thank you for your question I have not been briefed on the reorganization so the actions that have been taken by the department to date I'm not read in on I'm so I'm not familiar with how they have arrived at the decisions that they have made moving forward if confirmed as assistant secretary again I've stated it before but I want to be boots on the ground in Indian country I want to sit down and meet with tribal leadership to understand what their needs are and engage in meaningful consultation and with a reorganization effort that may be underway then it warrants that engagement I appreciate that and I the next question I have for you is can you describe what you consider appropriate tribal consultation in this area and let me just couch you at this very hearing at the same table we had representatives from the Department of Interior who basically said they haven't even had any tribal consultation yet they haven't talked to the tribes about this reorganization even though it's been an ongoing plan for some time so what do you envision that tribal consultation to look like I would envision not a check the box mentality I have sat on the other side of consultation meetings before and in the past in the private sector in my professional experience at times depending on the department the mentality is very different and I'm not going to bring a check the Box mentality I truly believe in stakeholder engagement and I believe in going local first because that is the the the de-risking agent to any policy project is understanding that local perspective and that is the the background that I bring coming from the private sector and the advocacy work that I have done on behalf of our people on the North Slope and in Alaska and I want that to translate into Indian Affairs and so meaningful consultation means engagement with tribal leadership meaningful consultation means listening and hearing the message but also working with the tribal communities to find the appropriate answers to advocate for inside the department and as assistant secretary my role inside the department will be to advocate and aggressively advocate for those policies and so can I also take that as an to be an advocate if you're not invited in to the boardroom to be there to represent tribal communities that your force your way in or at least try to be there to be a voice if you're not invited in to represent the tribal communities in this reorganization I wish you knew my granny I would take that as a yes because well let's just say I'm persistent good good that's what I'm looking for and then a commitment that you would be willing to come back to the committee as well and share with us always information that you need in I think my colleague Hyde senator Heitkamp said it best what we're looking for is an advocate here as well we need to know what we should be doing we are all here in a bipartisan way to support our tribal communities to support getting the resources where they need to be so our goal has been to ensure that we are hearing from you but you need to also let us know what you need I welcome the opportunity to work with this committee on such policies and I have one more question I know my time is running out if I may and it's just a follow-up on ranking member you dolls question on monuments Nevada as well has two monuments new monuments that's Basin and Range National Monument in gold Butte and both of these national monuments also contain important tribal cultural resources in need of protection one of them gold Butte is one that has been recommended by the Secretary of Interior to change its boundaries and I guess my question for you is how will you defend against executive action proposing to diminish or eliminate these national monuments so while I again while I have not been involved in the making process to date I certainly understand that this issue and the monuments designation issue is important to you and other members of this committee and I look forward to learning more about that thank you thank you madam chair I appreciate the extra time

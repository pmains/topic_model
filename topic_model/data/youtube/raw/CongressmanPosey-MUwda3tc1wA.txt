mr speaker i've been reading the covet unrelated relief bill at least president trump was borrowing money to keep the economy from crashing he was creating jobs making america energy independent lowering gasoline and fuel prices for every american family lowering unemployment protecting our borders rebuilding our military and so on now however with the assistance of this chamber this administration is doing just the opposite it sounds like something right from the pages of solinsky's book rules for radicals how malcontents proposed to destroy america this coveted unrelated relief bill is more about keeping america closed and funding liberal policies than getting past this virus and it is outrageous i yield back

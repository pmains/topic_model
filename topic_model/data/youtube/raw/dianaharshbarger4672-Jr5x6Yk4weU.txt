I'm Diana Hershberger I started my pharmacy here in kingsport over 30 years ago you have to work hard and be pretty tough to succeed but mostly you need to care about the people you serve they have to trust you to give them what they need the right medicine that means listening and putting them first which is why it's a really good thing politicians aren't in charge of making medicine they spent too many years not listening prescribing the wrong things pushing impeachment putting us last and now Democrats say socialism is the cure no way President Trump has a right prescription for America more freedom more opportunity the courage to fight for what's right but he can't do it alone we need to cut career politicians out send more Outsiders to Washington people who've run a business you know how to get things done and will put us first that's the right medicine for America I'm a business owner a health care professional a problem solver I'm dying a Harshberger and I'm running for Congress it's time we give Washington a dose of the right medicine

thank you mr chairman um the point you just made mr chairman uh is indicative of the fact that we need a strong consumer protection uh in the digital asset space consumer protection in the digital asset space will take a lot of forms it includes robust disclosure made by companies who create digital assets legal segregation and protection of customer assets in bankruptcy and disclosures made by digital asset exchanges about the risks and permissible transactions that may be undertaken with digital assets we have that framework for robust consumer protection standards for digital assets and i believe my responsible financial innovation act with senator gillibrand achieves that across the board i look forward to working with mr chairman the ranking member and other members of this committee to ensure we get this right ms lubin thanks for joining us today the securities and exchange commission has previously stated that digital assets can transition their legal status between securities and commodities and that digital assets may or may not embody an investment contract depending on the facts far from being settled law this is the first time in the history of the sec that it has taken that position i know this because my staff has reviewed hundreds of circuit and district court cases on the howey test we need to have an honest discussion on this committee about what the howey test does and does not mean so ms lubin do you think there are significant investor protection issues when market participants cannot effectively tell the difference between a security or a commodity especially where the sec has acknowledged that their legal status can change thank you senator for that question clearly it's very important for people to be able to assess and determine whether something's a security but when you have a securities lawyer look at the products that are being sold we understand what the howie test is we understand how it's applied and we can look at it and say yes that looks like a security it's not just the howie test doesn't only apply to crypto it can apply to any kind of investment so our job is to take the law and to take the facts and take the case law and the statutory law and apply it to what's going on in a given situation and most securities lawyers would take a look at that and say yes that is an investment contract and it needs to be regulated well i would welcome your review of the lemus gillibrand bill and your comments on how we addressed it in the legislation um ms walsh thank you for being here today as the primary self-regulatory organization in the security space does finrail believe a role for self-regulation should be part of the conversation around digital assets thank you for that question senator um finra has not taken a public position on whether there should or should not be a self-regulatory organization in the digital asset space but i will say that you know the the self-regulatory model that congress enshrined in the federal securities laws when it passed the maloney act um has led to robust regulation in the brokered dealer space finra um and its predecessor organizations have have been registered and in fact are overseen by the securities and exchange commission there is robust oversight so while self is in the name the the legislation that congress passed did not envision that finra would be so low in regulation we absolutely are overseen we also um the way finra is set up we have a majority public board and so we are informed by but not influenced by the the industry that we oversee and i think that's another important element that sort of contributes to continued investor protection so finra would be delighted to work with you with other members of the committee on legislation and to share our expertise and our history with the self-regulatory model well i would welcome that as well you know we want to get this right senator gillibrand and i want to make sure that this piece of legislation we have that's very comprehensive but that has jurisdiction uh that spreads across multiple committees in the senate uh has been thoroughly vetted and that we can piece it together does finra feel that it would have a role in the digital asset sro or do you think an sro that's specific to digital assets would work better again uh senator thank you but we haven't um come out with uh any kind of position on that however um most of what is happening in the digital asset space currently is happening outside the broker dealers within broker dealers finra has robust examination mechanisms review of advertising materials review of customer communications tools at its disposal because those are part of our regulatory tool kit and so we would offer those as you're considering the steps to take thank you i thank our witnesses and i yield back thank you senator

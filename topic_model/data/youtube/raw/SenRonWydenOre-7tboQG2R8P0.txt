what well Senator Merkley thank thank you and I'm sure our guests and certainly senators know that the person who went to the border and really woke up the whole country to the lack of transparency and accountability was my colleague from Oregon Senator Merkley so I just want to let him know again how I appreciate his leadership now I'm the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee which Senator Cardin sander McCaskill and I all are part of and we place a special emphasis on child welfare in the Senate Finance Committee because we have jurisdiction over a number of programs that relate to the safety of kids so I'm gonna ask you this question ms Underwood and I appreciate all of you so anybody who'd like to chime in the two questions that I asked secretary azar were I thought pretty straightforward the first was how many children has the Department of Health and Human Services reunited with parents or relatives that was question one question two was how many parents have been told where their children are and that is a special concern of Oregonians because Senator Merkley and I and our house colleagues went to the prison in Sheridan and we heard from one father who said specifically he did not know where his daughter was 18 month old daughter by the way so as my colleagues know senator McCaskill the secretary did practically everything but answer the question he bobbed and weaved and he had all kinds of sort of deflecting kinds of answers you know there were hotlines I thought he was gonna then say cold lines he just kept talking about portals and I kept trying to picture the individual senator Merkley and I had seen the detainees at Sheridan and I just felt that the Secretary's responses were connected from reality and parents are clearly having problems getting access to the hotline at one point ms underwood we were told that the detainees were given phone numbers for their lawyers but they were in the clothes that they had brought to the prison and then the phone numbers weren't given to them when they gave those clothes up for the detainee uniforms and mr. Hayes are also gave me different answers as to how many children are in the agency's custody according to the number he gave me in yesterday's hearing was 2047 so as of last night at the rate the agency's going based on our estimates these kids wouldn't be reunited with their families until 2025 so that is obviously a shocking assessment based on what happened yesterday morning now we got news that I think all of us would consider potentially positive last night where the judge ordered the administration to reunite the families within 30 days so I think miss Underwood because we've got colleagues here from all of the relevant you know committees I think we would be interested in your view given the fact just between the finance hearing in the morning and what happened late at night and we've had other things that we're trying to stay on top of in terms of holding down healthcare costs give us your assessment of what you think our committee with jurisdiction over a number of these child welfare programs ought to be doing now because we have champions of kids like Senator McCaskill very much concerned about the next steps and I think we'd be interested in your thoughts yes thank you so I think for the next steps with the children and I think Heidi also shared is definitely releasing the currents from ice detention in order to facilitate reunification and I cannot stress enough that reunification needs to happen within the community safely and appropriately and I think that that's the larger concern here and the one the one question that many of us are asking of how will the children be reunified and so the office of refugee resettlement has a process a family unification process when a sponsor is identified but again as Heidi also stated and and others the identification of the sponsor who they were traveling with is currently detained so the next steps here are in order to reunify individuals in the community reunify kids with their parents in the community would be releasing expeditiously releasing their parents from detention to facilitate the reunification you are being way too logical or what senator McCaskill and I heard yesterday in the Finance Committee and I I had a sense you might have some practical recommendations like that how do we somehow square your practical recommendations with that 30-day timetable because and perhaps your colleague would like to get get into this there's a far cry from the 30 days and what we thought when we left yesterday's hearing room that you know changing the number by six which is what we thought you know in a week took us to 2025 so tell us how we use those good recommendations in the kind of 30-day context well as I as a physician I just wanted to add in terms of the 30-day context what the science shows us is that every day that a child is separated from their caregiver puts their health at risk and I believe that the the judges injunction that asked for reunification rightly recognizes the science that the cumulative adversity and every day that these kids are away from their parents we as as Americans are putting those children at risk and and we have to live with that so yeah I my time is really about up that I want to give other panel members a chance to comment that point with respect to the toll it takes on kids in the more we learn about neurological research and you're a physician is if you don't get there early for kids like that 18 month old little girl who was taken from her father and the day before father's day he was telling senator Merkley and myself new Oregon congressional delegation there's no question that is going to do a lot of damage and it will be playing catch-up ball from that point on trying to repair the damage you know done all the more urgency to make the 30 days I'm work I'm Way over my time that my colleague has indulged me and do any of you let's do this if you have any recommendations for us on the Finance Committee sir McCaskill sander Cardin myself I'm sure they've been others who come we would very much welcome them because I've been trying overnight to reconcile that number that we were given yesterday morning we wrapped up at noon and then the staff went and calculated that rate kids would be reunified with families in 20 20 25 that changed in the evening but I don't know how they actually carry out that that 38 especially if they continue to use these fantasyland assessments of what their they're doing so Senator Merkley again thank you for being our leader on this

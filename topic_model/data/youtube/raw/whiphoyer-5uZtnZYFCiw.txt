does look tenuous and they're making changes on a bill that will not have had an independent analysis by the CBO or by other nonpartisan groups or the joint Tax Committee so to be continued Garrett thank you so much for all of that and joining me now from the other side of the hill Democratic congressman Steny Hoyer the second ranking Democrat in the house thank you very much for joining us mr. leader your great to see you to be with you a lot going on now a motion to proceed Mitch McConnell is just it seems as though the president has rallied the troops that the Republicans in the Senate are going to hold firm so far at least with promises TBA what say you on the house side do you think you can stop this in conference do you think this tax bill is now going to become a reality well I'm hoping that it goes to conference because if it goes to conference it is not just blindly accepted by the house if in fact the Senate passes something but if that happens it will be bad for the country it's a bad bill and what is happening is that senators are not deciding on policy they're deciding on politics they're deciding on the proposition that if they don't pass a bill politically they will be badly damaged but they have neither taken the time nor the care to review this bill and as you just pointed out it's being changed as we speak so that when it comes to a vote if it comes to a vote this week senators are not going to have the faintest idea what the ramifications of this bill are and the harm that's going to cause to the American people and the millions of people who are going to lose health insurance as a result of some of the provisions and the fact that some 82 million Americans are going to get a tax hike not a tax cut in this bill and the wealthiest Americans are going to get over 60% of the benefits none of that really makes any sense in terms of growing the economy creating jobs and making sure that middle-class Americans can succeed so that I think it's very very unfortunate the way this bill is being considered and I would hope that senators would take the time and have courage to slow this down say no to things they don't like and say we ought to work together with Democrats to come up for the bipartisan tax reform bill as we did in 1986 now there were two empty chairs at the meeting with the president yesterday as if we had Nancy Pelosi's of course and Chuck Schumer's chair boycotting the meeting because of the what Pelosi described is an abuse of the verbal abuse from the president in his tweet earlier in the day accusing them falsely on immigration on tax increases and the like that said are you now dealing yourselves out of this equation what leverage do you have when you when it comes to budgets and the dreamers and everything else that are part of your your agenda well what we've had historically is two votes historically over the last seven years Republicans have been unable to come to an agreement on pursuing fiscally responsible pieces of legislation they simply have not had the votes that's giving us the leverage not a lot of sense on their part that they wanted to work with us although I hope that would would come about but it was simply that they needed the votes so when you asked where the leverage is the leverages were the votes what happened yesterday was unfortunate the meeting was set up leader Pelosi and leader Schumer were prepared to go down there and have a discussion as they had to have as they have in the past to talk constructively about how we could move forward and in fact the result of the last meeting was that we had a no-drama continuation of government funding on the last September the problem here is that the president said in his tweet not only accusing us of wanting to people flood across the borders that is certainly baloney that is not true we know we need secure borders we know we need controlled borders we know we need to know who's coming into this country we also not soft on crime at all we know that that threatens average working people as much as it threatens anybody in the country and it threatens all of us and so we need to confront that but then the president said therefore no deal is possible therefore no deal is possible he hadn't met he hadn't sat down but he was over no deal as possible so leader Schumer and leader Pelosi were left with a sense that they were just being used as pawns to pretend that they were pursuing bipartisanship and in that case that was not something I think they thought they ought to lend themselves to this tax bill and that in the Affordable Care Act repeal bill are exactly stark evidence of an unwillingness to deal in a bipartisan fashion let me ask you about a partisan well a democratic issue which is what's going on in inside your own caucus on the sexual harassment question congressman Conyers former spokesman Bob Weiner came out last night to talk and defend the congressman's behavior let's watch this his closet is right and his office right here he changes clothes in his office accidentally without knocking and have seen him in his underwear big deal big deal should congressman Conyers resigned I don't think we want to be first of all get into rationalizing behavior which is really unacceptable so I'm not going to go there the fact of the matter is that he has stepped aside from being ranking member of the committee mr. Nadler of New York is now the acting ranking member of that committee we need to make sure you ask what we need to do we need to make sure a we have a safe working place working place for all of the women who work on Capitol Hill as well as the men that's the first objective be everybody needs to know how to redress a grievance that they have without feeling threatened now being victimized by the process itself so that they need to know exactly what to do we need to do have training on that we've been we're adopting a training mandatory training for our members but we need to do much more than that jackie speier has a bill which is going to provide a better process but we need to do even more than that and we need to make sure that we have a process that works for the victim as well as the accused that due process is follow but that at the end of the process which is done relatively quickly and with very great consideration for the victim in this case because it is terribly difficult to come forward in these kinds of cases and that's why the credibility of those who come forward it is so high and we need to have that done in a quick fashion well as ability needs to be exercised speaking of a good fashion congressman Clyburn told one of our colleagues on the Capitol Hill last night that there are five instances so far at least should congressman Conyers resigned I'm sorry Clarence said there are five instances the accusations against congressman Conyers should he resign from his position as an elected official should he leave Congress I understand that my own view is and the reason this is difficult to deal with it because we all believe in due process I hope we all believe that people have the opportunity to say look I didn't do this notwithstanding the credibility of the witnesses we have a process to determine were these allegations founded and if they're founded yes he should resign thank you very much Steny Hoyer thanks for being with us today

thank you mr chairman thank you mr secretary for being here i'll be somewhat brief here uh i'm a small business owner i'm a main street guy i employ a lot of people i'm a job creator and i'm an auto dealer uh and i would say this just real quickly i heard you say earlier that uh before we could address the 50 billion dollar or under banks we need to get dodd-frank completed first well i would just ask you don't wait that long uh it's the worst legislation i think we've seen in a long time and you can't wait that long because if you wait that long you're going to lose you're going to lose small businesses you're going to lose banks we're going to lose jobs so i just humbly ask you to think about uh addressing that before you totally ramp out the complete level the dodd-frank because i can tell you from a banker standpoint people are actually they'll tell you they're hiring more regulatory officers and they are loan officers that's a real problem uh so that being said let me say this uh you said the u.s economy looks like a well-oiled machine when compared to foreign markets and when i would just say too an 18 trillion dollar debt that's not a well-oiled machine and that statement bothers me the long-term outlook i believe for the u.s economy is not that great it could be considered bleak just last week the congressional budget office issued a report that estimated that president obama's budget would add near nearly six trillion dollars to the deficit over ten years uh let me repeat that six trillion dollars added the deficit we have now that's debt held by the american public it's projected to grow rapidly as a share of the economy grows in the years ahead rising from 74 percent today to 106 percent into in 2039. now the rising cost of debt uh will have a significant consequence as we all know on the economy in the federal budget so let me ask you this you stated that every week we roll over approximately 100 billion in u.s bills and if u.s bondholders decide that they wanted to be repaid rather than continuing to roll over their investments we could unexpectedly dissipate our entire balance now with that being said do you think it's healthy for the treasure to be forced to rely on reissuing securities to make principal payments on securities coming due and how is that any different from taking out cash advances on a credit card to pay bills other than another credit card on another credit card congressman we have the the deepest treasury market in the world i think that if you look at the progress we've made on fiscal policy in the last seven years six years it's been enormous we had a deficit that was just about 10 percent of gdp it's now coming below three percent of gdp in the 10-year budget window we stay that way i think if you look at the challenges we have in the near term for this country it's that we do the things we need to keep our economy growing and that means investing in people and education it means investing in infrastructure and frankly it means investing in defense one of the problems i have with the budget that's being unveiled today is that it it short funds uh the critical things we need to defend our country and to pre and to build a strong foundation for the future what we need is a bipartisan conversation about how to maintain a responsible fiscal path but with all respect the fiscal position today versus when the this administration took office is vastly improved and i think we've done a lot of hard work to get there i know in the past you and i have discussed you have never really been in the private sector i've only been in the private sector i'm going to tell you the economy is not that good when you have the high unemployment we got the people on food stamps we can get into that it's not that good but you didn't really answer my question uh when you said that if the if the bondholders decided they wanted to be repaid could we do it the the the the challenge that we have is making sure that we remain able to fund all of our needs that means funding new debt it means rolling over old debt if you look at the way our trajectory looks you're going to 2039 the budget for the next 10 years for the the period immediately beyond that we stay in the sustainable level of both deficit and debt as a percentage of gdp and there's a lot of work we still need to do going forward on a bipartisan basis but we've made enormous progress let me ask you one other question for my time's up uh cbo projects that interest on the national debt will make up 90 of the deficit in 2023. that's a huge figure how can we expect to see balanced budgets if future interest payments on debt will continue to force deficit spending for decades when we say an 18 trillion dollar deficit is a well-oiled machine well congressman the the goal of reaching what's called primary balance is to not have anything but debt payments that are the reason for a deficit so it will become a larger and larger percentage of the deficit as we approach primary balance that that's what that statistic reflects if you look at the international standard primary balance is the goal that most countries look at and that international institutions look at for sustainability i yield back mr chairman thank you

joining us now for reaction is Molly Hemingway a senior editor at the Federalists and Fox News contributor and congressman brad Sherman a Democrat from California great to see both of you congressman what's your reaction to what President Trump said specifically about the DNC allegation that Donna Brazile makes it in a new book about what mrs. Clinton did to perhaps disenfranchise Bernie Sanders well the president doesn't want to talk about it the details of his tax plan wants to shift over to here when you talk about a job-killing deficit exploding tax plan that's going to crush our economic growth and you want to get a shift over to the fact that the DNC may be favored Hillary you know what the RNC didn't favor Trump favored his opponents but it was rigged both ways he often talked about how the Republican Party was raked the fact of the matter is I don't think it influenced things very much and if you look at the details of what Donna Burrell Brazil's talking about it's mostly how she was constrained in her efforts to build state and local party organizations there were not expenditures from the DNC that helped Hillary before the nomination but look very aware and I campaigned with him and he was campaign you know I I just think it's fascinating that that Democrats after all this time and dealing with all this muck from the Clintons you guys still defend him like after all this time they put the party through an impeachment and he lost his bar license you had the whole era of big government is over thing with the Republicans then it was on to them one of the most embarrassing losses for a Democratic candidate that I can remember and you all still like carry water for Hillary even but even people who like Bernie I mean that to me is stunning it also seems that this piece was a really strong signal that people are sick of Hillary Clinton that they wish that they wish you weren't out there so much I mean this is the type of piece they Donna Brazile knew all this going you know throughout the entire campaign he kept quiet about it until now the reason why it's coming out now is not just that she has a book coming out but also that there's safety and going after Hillary Clinton and there's frustration I think in how Hillary mismanaged her campaign and cause general problems for the party it's interesting that congressman Sherman you know he may he's making the the Democrat case against the tax cut Rand Paul actually today on my radio show made a conservative kind of criticism about the tax plan let's listen let's watch you're going to have an immediate cut to twenty percent the corporate tax rate that's going to be huge for the individuals it's not as good as I would like I would like to see every individual up and down get a lower rate and particularly on the the top part of the spectrum because the top part of the spectrum pays most of the taxes yeah I'm getting him not cut the top 1% you don't you don't really have a significant tax cut not a significant tax cut there are a lot of concern I'm getting a lot of bingbing being like this is not real this is not real tax cutting because if people pay most of the taxes of course are the upper income earners it's not to say that there aren't really good things in this in this bill there are but this is not that dramatic I mean I think people were looking for something really big dramatic reform its ability to destroy our economy by taking a billion and a half trillion or a trillion and a half dollars out of the capital pool unavailable for investment by business it's gonna be spent what are we talking about we're gonna each each family's gonna get eleven hundred eighty dollars back like this so so you believe that the economy is going to what plummet because of this is a dramatic reduction in investment in infrastructure a dramatic reduction in money available for business expansion you don't think the value of homes by 10 percent according to the Moody's 10% cut in home values in major metropolitan areas so you actually think you think you think the economy after this tax cut is passed and it will be it's some form like this it will actually contract no I'm saying that the rate of economic growth the anemic two to two-and-a-half percent we had under Obama a mint and that we continue to have into trouble you have two consecutive quarters of 3% GDP what are you talking about 26:17 worse than 2016 in terms of economic growth look at the statistics and Douglas when did when did Obama have three percent economic growth for two consecutive quarters it's not it's per year there he never had two consecutive terms and this is without yes but you're excluding February and March which were that which was that was coming off the Obama years I mean we're wait a minute claims credit for the taxing deferred for the stock market increase that occurred before he took the oath of office but he won't take credit for the economy after he took oath about you actually did he become president in November do you become president so the the the tech industry in northern part of your state Northern California is booming record corporate earnings consumer confidence soaring trade deficit down which is hugely up it's been booing up it's ten percent better than it was it on last year month to month the trade deficit for the first time in years is actually starting to contract and we actually have a it's going to do trade work now which you agreed with when you were with Bernie Sanders he's finally doing trade and does nothing he's done nothing except kiss up to she and we have a much every single month he's been in power we've seen the trade deficit we're trying to grow you seen grow until we actually until we actually actually put tariffs on Chinese good way to do it well I certainly hope we do Mali on this issue of let's move on to Rex Tillerson I thought it was interesting when I asked the president is he going to be with youth for the duration he kind of well we'll we'll see and he didn't really want to confront the issue of the the positions in the State Department which are still not filled with his own nominees right it is true that he kind of hedged a bit on that but he always had jizz when people asked about Rex Tillerson and there been rumors about Rex Tillerson departing since Rex Tillerson came it came they do they continue to talk there have got this big trip planned I think it's premature to look for his departure of course no Secretary of State lasts the yeah but I've got to say I think after 360 days there's a federal rule that a career person can assume a position after three I think it's 360 days of an empty position position not filled that's actually gonna work against the president if those positions don't get filled that's what I'm worried about congressman on the on the issue of the Democrats today and where the Democrats are going obviously resist Trump we get that resist is agenda we understand that but you are with Bernice so I actually really admire in many ways for his stance for the working people I don't agree with some growing government part of it but I like the fact that he was out there fighting for what he believed in and I think he had more integrity in his positions than the Clintons had in their entire political career frankly so on this issue of the working class what will the Democrat Party do to disentangle itself now from the old Clinton Wall Street ties well I and and Bernie Sanders have our bill to break up the big banks because too big to fail is too big to exist we need a trade policy it doesn't just talk big and act like you're gonna do something well do renegotiate after like he promised he would at the beginning of his a campaign he said he and Hillary both said we're gonna go read negotiate NAFTA obviously that wasn't done but now if it hasn't been renegotiated they're doing it right now let's see if they do anything trade deficit with China has grown every month growing every ma every year for the last 16 years yeah that's actually not true but it has been join the WTO which month didn't it grow every single month it grow no their every single sixty billion dollars at yes a huge amount right and it's bigger now per month than it was last year and we've done nothing but kiss up to she and basically let him know that he came up we have a North Korea problem as well chain migration Dhaka will it be part that I thought he was most passionate today about the Dhaka issue and he wants this chain migration done and it looks like there's some traction on this there's actually a really good opportunity because so many people aren't opposing sides want things done whether it's taking care of the delay making it permanent for the people who are brought here as children but also there are so many problems in what we've learned just even this week with the Visa Lottery system that nobody thinks is a good idea and needs to be taken care of chain migration just in general we have an incoherent immigration policy that has been left to chance when it makes total sense if you care about the American worker the security of the nation that you would have a policy that makes sense where you bring people in based on how they'll be able to earn a living and their English language skills and their track record of success that's something you owe to working-class people and the entire country it's amazing congressman that one person if the number that President Trump cited is correct one person who's brought here on a lottery visa can then act as a magnet of sorts for his or her family members and it could be mother father on to uncle brother's sister who have no connections to the United States except for that lottery winner so it could one person could bring in ten and then those ten can also bring in each of them it becomes this web of of chain migration and that is is is what has exploded immigration in the country when you look at the chain migration when I think the president is right that until this became kind of a recent issue not that many people were talking about what an immigration is great and if you look at you know other countries like Canada American graduate base I mean it's not about the numbers even per se although you can have debates about that but just the quality of people how they are brought in and how they work with the people from your chain migration is not new to discussion they used to use the the term anchor baby which is the set which is the same issue it's just a different marketing term and one's talking about the extended twice removed in any case what we need is comprehensive immigration reform I supported it eight Republican senators supportive of scams and it's one of the reasons George popularity plummeted in the last two years of it what we have now is a complete nonsense immigration system where people in my district live in fear they're part of our community what about the fact that 20 percent of your prisons are illegal immigrants does that bother you by twenty percent of California prison inmates are illegal immigrants what a nightmare that is for your taxpayers in your state don't you feel any sense of obligation I would have to check that figure are you are you shocked at that you didn't know that I that's not a figure I'm familiar with I well I mean the state of sanctuary state correct well a few Democrats had come down Fox every time somebody turns out to me with a figure turned out to be wrong no I love the fact that you congressman I love the fact that you come on and I also really appreciate the fact that you're willing to exchange ideas and all the topics because frankly there are a lot of Democrats who won't and I don't think that helps them and I don't think it helps the country I think it's really good that you mix it up I'm happy to be here and the comprehensive immigration reform will at least provide for even RFI it will provide for more effective border enforcement it involved the abolition of the lottery so there are a lot of things in there that you agree with but we cannot turn to people who have made their lives in the United States at the invitation really of our employers at a time when we deliberately didn't try the American workers are obviously the most most important focus that you have as a congressman in the American citizens not illegal immigrants you don't represent illegal immigrants do I represent a community that includes people that voters who are I'm I don't fail to represent somebody just because they're a legal immigrant and they can't vote yet so you actually say that you're a representative of legalized the Constitution is very clear I represent all the people who live in my district counted by the census and the census allocates members of Congress and representation based on everyone who lives there excluding I think the term is Indians not taxed and we haven't had that I'm sorry I mean I think people just feel so hammered by the government like people just like middle-class workers who are American citizens like is anyone representing me we just worried about soccer kids with 35 years old are important and we work together as people and we have a shared set of laws and we need to make sure that we enforce those that we have if we decide to change that change this just what everybody's come across the border and have no border I mean we should just change the law and like having no borders at all obviously that's not what I support but when we had a system 90s that welcomed people with the wink and a nod at the request of Wall Street you cannot bankers are there a lot of people wanted cheap labor but it's great to it with great conversation with both of you thank you so much up next

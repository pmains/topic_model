thank you mr chairman to our wonderful chairwoman ross delauro to uh representative mike levin for summarizing this bill and the importance of it you know and i'm really glad that we're working to address this incredibly serious issue of rage theft in this country and in response to some of the earlier comments i don't think any worker no worker appreciates having their wages stolen so this is about those who work and then are not paid for their work because the employer is in essence stealing their work and gaining an unfair advantage over other businesses and which is one of the important points that chairwoman adams made and for which i agree i have also heard this frustration from businesses in my district so we are indeed responding to an issue that both businesses and employers employees recognize is wrong and these crimes because it is a crime to steal somebody's wages to steal somebody's labor the hard work that they put into their job and then did not pay them for is simply wrong and they hurt all communities but i would note that they especially hurt latino communities according to the joint economic senate committee hispanic workers are concentrated in sectors considered by the department of labor to be low wage but high violation industries these include construction and agriculture pervasive wage theft is sadly rampant in these industries hispanic women in particular are directly affected by wage theft and they are disproportionately harmed on top of that by their gender wage gap and they are also remember mothers or grandmothers working to feed their children and grandchildren and we are allowing employers to take the money out of their pockets that must go into those children's lunch boxes last week i met with domestic workers from new mexico this was a group of hard-working women who provide essential care and services to families in need we all need these workers they do every family or service by caring for our children by caring for our elderly but too often they are treated like second-class citizens one woman shared with me that when her employer learned that she was a migrant they immediately lowered her rage even though she had been a hard-working employer for years sadly this type of incident is common for immigrants last year the center for public integrity analysis of the labor department and the u.s census bureau data found that industries with higher percentages of foreign foreign workers had higher rates of wage theft so i am thankful for organizations like somos a new mexico worker rights and immigrant-led organization somos provides legal services to rage theft victims and educates workers about their rights and remedies they work closely with the attorney general's office and with the law enforcement to bring these uh cases to bear but the fact is that the federal government needs to do a better job at standing up for our own workers we need to give organizations like somos and the workers themselves better tools to defend themselves the wage theft prevention and wage recovery act makes it harder for employers to commit rage theft and puts a harsher penalty on those that do i encourage my colleagues to vote yes on the ans and support vulnerable workers with that mr chairman i yield back

for years popular media has attacked animal Agriculture and suggested that we cut back on livestock production and related food products in the name of mitigating climate change these suggestions are very misleading and climate activists love to blow the livestock sector's contribution to greenhouse gas emissions completely out of proportion and disregard the essential nutritional benefits of animal protein and this cinnamon is creeping into our school systems where it has the potential to irreparably harm the most vulnerable in our society our children and I read that for an example in Edinburgh Scotland recently became the first European city to commit to eliminating meat from school Hospital and Nursing Home needs I know that's another country but this similar initiatives are underway in the United States and some of our nation's largest school districts in recent years large Public School Systems in the Northeast have announced meatless Monday and vegan Friday initiatives school systems on the west coast are doing the exact same thing and it's apparent that animal sourced foods are the most complete and bioavailable sources of protein are full of vitamins and nutrients such as Vitamin 12 zinc iron and all of which are essential for healthy development in children and I recognize that Americans have the right to make their own dietary dietary choices and I want that to happen but we have to consider what is in the school meals we provide to underserved children who in most cases do not get to choose for themselves the health and well-being of Americans children should not be sacrificed at the altar of climate activism

other winner on primary night was Jim Hagedorn he's a Republican running for Congress in the first District in southern Minnesota he faced a primary challenge from state senator Carla Nelson but one fairly easily on Tuesday and Jim Hagedorn joins me now mr. Hagedorn congratulations thanks for coming on well thank you very much it's a pleasure to be with you today what was it that won it for you so convincingly on Tuesday well I think that we stood out as far as the conservative message to the Republican voters and we were on the ground working all 21 counties for some time now you know it's my third time in a row on the ballot and we had the party's endorsement was 76 percent on the first though we have a lot of friends down here and I think they're just ready for us to win what are the big issues that you'll stress now heading into the general election campaign well essentially I mean the Democrat Party including our opponent dan seeing they move so far to the left Iowa City kind of like Reagan said about Mondale they've left America and it's the race sets up as a clear contrast I mean it doesn't matter on every Democrat a major Democrat in the state is running as keith Ellison they're all for open borders they're all for socialized medicine they're all for gun control late term abortion things like that and we're on the other side we want to keep moving the country in the right direction I tell people I'm prepared to partner with President Trump to get that done in Washington and the voters will have a clear choice as you mentioned you've run a couple of times before and you came pretty close to winning in 2016 president Trump ran strong in the district do you think support for him in the district has stayed strong or will it be you know more of a window you're in your face instead of at your back this time around well I think people in southern Minnesota are still they like what they're seeing this as far as the progress on the economy they like what they're seeing as far as America regaining its standing around the world rebuilding our military getting rid of these onerous regulations like waters of the United States having Pearl US energy policies to keep downward pressure on the cost of energy and to protect our basic rights you know one of the big big issues in the last campaign who was going to control the Supreme Court was Hillary Clinton going to stack the court with radicals to take away our basic liberties what was Donald Trump going to put strict constructionists on the court to make make sure that we were protected so on almost council southern Minnesotans are pretty much a vast majority on those issues they want to see secure borders they want to make sure that our economy is humming and they see the difference between the two parties having run a few times against Tim Walz what are you telling Republicans to expect out of him as Jeff Johnson runs against him for governor well Tim Walz has abandoned all of his positions that he took to get reelected and in southern Minnesota he used to want the NRA's endorsement now he's for gun control now he's very far left politician he always has been we we kind of smoked him out in the last election we came to forty nine point six percent of the vote maybe that had a little bit to do with what he wanted to you know move on and try for another race but you know Jeff Johnson is a great guy he's worked very hard he says he's a good conservative but he's a common-sense guy that wants to reform government and I have every confidence and he and his team to get out here and meet the people and show the difference between you know really a radical leftist in walls and somebody who's going to be more common sense and and after these eight years of the Dayton administration with all the failures that the Democrats have piled up the Obamacare the mnsure problems the things with the Somali day care the the licensing tabs and all that I think people are looking for competent leadership in a change at the top so very confident that Jeff Johnson can get the job done on the other hand the economy is doing pretty well we saw in the news today Minnesota's unemployment rate is I think an 18 year low and a full point below the federal unemployment rate well it doesn't have anything to do with the massive regulation coming out of st. Paul the high tax policy here in Minnesota I mean look at the the bill and we're talking a lot about the governor's race instead of mine but look at that bill that all our fine Republican legislators put together to make sure that we could conform with the national tax cut and now Minnesotans are in a tough spot so we'll let them deal with that but down here in southern Minnesota I think people are looking to keep the country moving the right direction and our opponent is a far left liberal way more liberal than even walls was when he ran down here so I don't think that's gonna fly will you debate Dan Fein we'd love to have you do it on the air here someday oh heck he called for three debates I said that's a little modest you know that's only one per month coming up that's not enough so we should have Oh eight or ten it's a big district of 21 counties let's get to all regions to the district I would love to debate on your program or any of the others on your network and be happy to do it all right Jim Hagedorn thanks for coming on appreciate it thank you appreciate the chance that's Jim Hagedorn he's the Republican candidate for Congress in Minnesota's first District marine how do you sighs that one up you know I think a Jim Hagedorn has run with a clear message three times and he's built on that support every time and I don't see him moving off that and he made a clear contrast today with his opponent and frankly he is running as a trump republican and in that district we're going to test this theory in Minnesota

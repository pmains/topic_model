  CITIZEN. WE ALWAYS SAY IF IT WAS YOU AND  ME, HE WAS JUST YOU AND ME. YET WE ARE STILL WAITING.  >>> I WANT TO DIG DEEPER AND  BRING IN ILLINOIS REPUBLICAN  CONGRESSMAN, ADAM KINZINGER, A  MEMBER OF THE JANUARY 6th  COMMITTEE. HE JOINS US NOW. THIS HAS BEEN SUCH AN ORDEAL. THE WHOLE POINT OF YOUR INQUIRY  IS TO GATHER INFORMATION. HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU THAT WHAT  YOU'RE DOING RIGHT NOW GETS YOU  ANY CLOSER TO GETTING THE  INFORMATION YOU WANT AND THIS  COUNTRY NEEDS? >> WELL, I'M ABOUT AS CONFIDENT  AS I CAN BE. I MEAN, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE  FUTURE HOLDS ON THIS. LET ME SAY ON THE BANNON SIDE OF THE HOUSE, I THINK IT'S  IMPORTANT THAT ANYBODY THAT  REFUSES TO COME BEFORE CONGRESS  FACE CONSEQUENCES AND THAT WE  CAN COMPEL THEM. THAT MAY TAKE SOME TIME. I RECOGNIZE THAT, BUT THERE ARE  MANY, MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO  RESIST SUBPOENAS FROM CONGRESS,  THAT ACTUALLY SOME OF THEM HAVE  NO INTEREST IN RESISTING  SUBPOENAS THAT CAN GIVE US  INFORMATION THAT CAN BUILD UP TO STEVE BANNON, MAYBE EQUIVALENT  TO WHAT HE KNOWS. HE IS NOT LIKE THE LIMITING  FACTOR THAT SHORT OF US GETTING  HIM BEFORE THE COMMITTEE WE'RE  NOT GOING TO KNOW ANYTHING. WE ARE PURSUING LOTS OF FRONTS.  >> I WANT TO PLAY PART OF WHAT  YOUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUE ALSO  ON THIS COMMITTEE, LIZ CHENEY,  SAID YESTERDAY ABOUT BANNON'S  REFUSAL TO COOPERATE. WATCH THIS. >> MR. BANNON'S AND MR. TRUMP'S  PRIVILEGE ARGUMENTS DO, HOWEVER, APPEAR TO REVEAL ONE THING. THEY SUGGEST THAT PRESIDENT  TRUMP WAS PERSONALLY INVOLVED IN THE PLANNING AND EXECUTION OF  JANUARY 6th, AND THIS COMMITTEE  WILL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THAT. >> OKAY. AT THE VERY SAME TIME, THERE'S A NEW POLL OUT THAT SHOWS MORE  THAN HALF OF REPUBLICANS BELIEVE TRUMP BEARS NO RESPONSIBILITY  FOR JANUARY 6th WHATSOEVER. HOW DOES THAT SET THE STAGE FOR  THE NEXT PART OF YOUR  INVESTIGATION? >> I MEAN, LOOK, THAT'S A  DIFFICULT NUMBER TO LOOK AT, I  MEAN, QUITE HONESTLY. I ATTRIBUTE THAT TO A COUPLE OF  THINGS. NUMBER ONE, WE ARE STILL  TRIBALISTIC IN THIS COUNTRY THAT I THINK PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO  KNOW FACTS BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,  IT'S WHATEVER NARRATIVE PUTS  THEM IN THE TRIBE. SECONDARILY, IT SHOWS A LACK OF  LEADERSHIP IN MY PARTY TO STAND  IN FRONT OF PEOPLE AND TELL THEM THE TRUTH. IF YOU HAVE A BASE VOTER THAT  HASN'T HEARD ANYBODY BUT ME AND  LIZ SAY SOMETHING, WE CAN'T  REALLY BLAME THEM FOR NOT  BELIEVING. I GUESS EVERYBODY'S RESPONSIBLE  FOR THEIR OWN BELIEF. MORE PEOPLE NEED TO STAND UP, I  THINK WHAT THIS SHOWS, WHAT THIS SHOWS MY FRIEND ON THE OTHER  SIDE OF THE AISLE, WE MAY NOT  AGREE ON ISSUES, THERE'S A LOT  OF ISSUES WE DON'T AGREE ON,  THAT'S FINE. BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE UNITY WHEN  IT COMES TO DEFENDING DEMOCRACY, OR WE WILL FIND OURSELVES IN A  BAD PLACE. THAT NUMBER TO ME IS VERY  CONCERNING.  >> BUT THEN STAY WITH ME HERE. AS WE'RE WAITING FOR THE HOUSE  AND THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT I  WANT YOU TO HELP OUR AUDIENCE  UNDERSTAND THE STAKES. THERE HAVE TO BE CONSEQUENCES  FOR IGNORING CONGRESSIONAL  SUBPOENAS. CONGRESS IS GOING TO VOLUNTARILY LOSE ITS POWER IF YOU BASICALLY  HOOK UP A GUY BECAUSE HE'S BOYS  WITH TRUMP. >> YEAH, LOOK, I THINK YOU'RE  100% RIGHT. THIS IS ACCURATE. THIS IS WHY IT IS IMPORTANT FOR  US TO MAKE SURE. IT IS IN THE JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT'S PURVIEW NOW, AND I  HAVE EVERY EXPECTATION THAT ON  BANNON, YOU KNOW, ONCE WU PASS  THE REFERRAL OUT OF THE HOUSE ON THURSDAY, WHICH I THINK WE WILL, I HAVE EVER EXPECTATION THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WILL PURSUE  THAT. WE HAVE OTHER, YOU KNOW,  METHODS. THERE'S CIVIL CONTEMPT. THERE'S INHERENT CONTEMPT, BUT  THAT TAKES A RULES CHANGE IN THE HOUSE. BUT THE STAKES ARE HUGE. NOT JUST FOR THE POWER OF  CONGRESS BUT BECAUSE IN TEN  YEARS WE WANT OUR KIDS, I'LL  HAVE A SON WHO'S 10 BY THEN, WE  WANT OUR KIDS TO BE ABLE TO READ THE HISTORICAL NARRATIVE OF  JANUARY 6th WITH ACCURACY, NOT  SOMETHING TAINTED BY PEOPLE WHO  SAY IT'S ANTIFA AND THE FBI. THAT'S WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT. >> DO YOU ULTIMATELY THINK  YOU'LL BE SUBPOENAING DONALD  TRUMP? >> I DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW, I THINK WE CAN GET TO  ALL THE INFORMATION WE NEED  WITHOUT HIM, BUT I THINK WE'RE  CERTAINLY WILLING TO DO IT. THAT'S SOMETHING I WANT TO MAKE  CLEAR. HE'S NOT OFF LIMITS. BUT I ALSO THINK, YOU KNOW, IF  WE CAN GET THAT INFORMATION  PRIOR TO HIM AND OBVIOUSLY YOU  RECOGNIZE THE SECOND HE'S  SUBPOENAED IT CREATES A WHOLE  CIRCUS, WE'LL DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO, PERIOD. BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO JUST CALL HIM IN FRONT OF US TO FEEL GOOD. WE'RE GOING TO GET THE  INFORMATION FROM MANY OTHER  PEOPLE SOME OF WHICH HAVE  ALREADY VOLUNTARILY COME IN AND  TALKED TO THE COMMITTEE.  >> CAN I ASK YOU WHAT HAS ALL OF THIS BEEN LIKE FOR YOU  PERSONALLY? RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE GOT DEMOCRATS TRYING TO REDRAW YOUR DISTRICT  AND REPUBLICANS NOT ACROSS THE  BOARD, BUT A LOT OF THEM ARE  TAKING EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO  ATTACK YOU. >> I THINK THERE WAS A SAYING  ATTRIBUTED TO CHURCH HILL, IT  WAS LIKE SO YOU HAVE ENEMIES,  GOOD, IT MEANS YOU ACTUALLY  STAND FOR SOMETHING. I'M AT PEACE. IT'S NOT FUN, BUT I'M AT PEACE. AND I KNOW THAT, YOU KNOW,  WHETHER THIS -- IF I END UP WITH NO PLACE TO RUN IN ILLINOIS,  THAT WILL BE FINE, RIGHT? IT WILL BE OKAY. I'M GOING TO JUST STAND IN FRONT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND DO  THE RIGHT THING. AND THE TOUGH THING IS I  UNDERSTAND IT BECAUSE GETTING  KICKED OUT OF A TRIBE OR FEELING LIKE YOU'RE OUT OF A TRIBE, IT  HURTS, BUT WHAT WE NEED ARE MORE PEOPLE THAT ARE WILLING TO STAND UP TO DEFEND DEMOCRACY. I'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE AND  TELL YOU IT'S NO PROBLEM, IT'S  FUN, I ENJOY IT, I DON'T. BUT I ALSO KNOW IN 20, 30 YEARS  WHEN I LOOK IN THE MIRROR I'M  GOING TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT  MYSELF LONGER THAN SOME OTHER  PEOPLE WOULD BE ABLE TOO.  >> AND YOU MIGHT SAY I DON'T  WANT TO BE IN THAT TRIBE NAME. THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME THIS  MORNING. I APPRECIATE IT.  >> YOU BET.

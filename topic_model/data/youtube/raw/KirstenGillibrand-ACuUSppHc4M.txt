I am running for president to fix what's been broken [Music] Gillibrand Gillibrand is it Kristyn Balaban Kirsten Gillibrand I've come from a red part of the state of New York I grew up in a family where I have really strong female role models my mother was a lawyer and I kind of followed after her she was only one of three women in her law school class I had incredible grandmother loved politics she thought if he ever want to be heard we women need to use our places the first campaign headquarters I ever was in was about ten years old with my grandmother and a lot of ladies sat in a campaign headquarters and they were stuffing envelopes and in my brain I'm thinking I want to be just like that someday I wanted to be a senator but the funny thing about girls since we have so much girlhood bravado music and so I never admitted that again until 30 years ago I left practicing law because I felt like God put me on this planet to help people I was raised in a family that everyone matters everyone matters it doesn't matter who you are where you live or who you love if we are not helping people we should go it rhymes with duck not very polite you better believe I'm not very polite I've taken on the Pentagon twice I passed a lot of legislation I want to get money out of politics I will pass marijuana legalization I will pass something you know I will pass that here for all whether I'm standing up to the Pentagon or Congress or Wall Street I have taken on the fights that no one else will and one my grandmother taught me that being brave doesn't just mean standing up for yourself it means standing up for other people who need you [Applause]

campaign 2012 washington journal continues representative bill heisinger is republican from michigan thank you so much for being with us today my pleasure libby thanks we'll take your calls for this segment democrats 202-737-001 republicans 202-737-002 independent callers 202-628-0205 we'll also be taking questions from students from the university of southern mississippi that's through the c-span campaign 2012 bus visiting the school today they'll get their questions to you as well we'll also have callers but to start out with you serve on the financial services committee you are the highest ranking freshman on that committee talk to us about what you're hoping to see come out of the the so-called super committee the deficit reduction panel i mean have you heard anything everyone's talking about how tight-lipped the committee members are being they are very tight-lipped and and coming from michigan my district actually touches both dave camps and fred upton's districts i serve on the excuse me financial services with jeb hensarling i've gotten to know them uh them all well uh and they're pretty tight-lipped and that that is not unusual i think for this kind of thing i'm not saying it's necessarily the ideal but uh not too terribly unexpected representative heising is a former realtor and small business owner does that give you any different perspective on the us economy as a realtor uh you know did you get a sense early on at how the housing market was faring at how people's pocket books were doing yeah very much so and additionally uh i own a sand and gravel company which is connected to a ready mix concrete company that my dad and my uncle started my cousins now on that uh we're very sensitive to what's happening in the housing industry so having a background in real estate having done housing development and then of course still being tied in with uh with construction um yeah i've had a front row seat to what's been going on especially in michigan over the last decade looking at the unemployment rate in michigan uh 11.1 percent the total unemployed is 3.9 million and there were 14 200 jobs lost from august to september yeah it's uh it's been a tough tough decade for michigan i served in the state house i was elected in 2002 uh and michigan has term limits so i did three two year terms was done in 2008 and uh that was excuse me that was probably some of the most volatile uh depressing years that michigan has seen since the great depression and uh it cut across all all areas fortunately for my uh for my home county uh we're about two percent below three percent below where that state average is but i've got other counties in the district second district which runs about 250 miles along the lakeshore of of michigan on the west side where we've had nearly 20 percent unemployment in some of those counties so uh it has been very difficult you mentioned the collegiality you have with members of the deficit reduction committee they represent areas right around you and you you mentioned of course that they're still tight-lipped despite how close uh you might be geographically but you've been one of the freshman house republicans who've been critical of the the secrecy surrounding the super committee how are you weighing in on this and how do you feel like your viewpoints are getting heard yeah well that was a washington post article i believe yesterday that that sort of outlined some of that and i made no secret right at the very beginning i was one of those freshmen that signed a letter asking for open hearings open meetings uh just like what we would do with any other committee um and you know i understand that uh that there are times where you may have to go into some sort of closed executive type type hearing into it but i think overall ultimately sunshine and transparency would bring a better product my understanding is is that what what's happening internally is not much more different than what we're seeing externally with the discussions that are going on we have a philosophical difference about the size scope and role of government and that's really what's driving uh the debate some of the comments are guests made in this washington post article i don't think anyone would view this as a completely transparent process and then towards the end of the piece and you say i've told our members i love you guys and i've got great confidence in you but i've got little confidence and the ability of this structure to work yeah i i really do and and i i know uh obviously the house members the best i've met a couple of the senate members um and uh i i believe that they are going in with good intentions that they want to solve this what i'm afraid of libby is that uh that sort of the deck is stacked against them the system is stacked against them to ultimately reach the goal of what they're trying to do can they get there possibly i think they possibly can uh but uh you know as i said i guess you know i've told them all i love you but i'm not sure that the way that it's structured it's going to be able to be successful the way that it was intended to be and you have to remember this was a senate initiative uh not something that the house necessarily thought of or thought was a great idea the senate had insisted this as part of that budget reduction act let's get right to the phones ed democratic caller in santa fe welcome hi hi um good morning to to all of you um congressman i'm not real sure what you would think about it but um i know that that if somebody causes through their actions and through their through their leadership um a a company to to end up losing losing a whole bunch of money from beginning with a surplus and ending up with it with a huge deficit that that company would go under and that that owner of that company shouldn't shouldn't get get paid for for uh for failure well i believe that in the last 10 years this country was led to the to the woes that we are in right now and yet during the the whole of the 88 years of the bush administration for seven out of those eight years congress granted itself a raise i believe that congress should take that raise and reverse their salaries and that of all of federal government i'm not talking about getting rid of jobs i am simply talking about reducing the salaries of all federal employees back to the year 2000 because i sir do not believe in rewarding failure i appreciate that caller and it's something that when i was in the state legislature in michigan i actually advocated for um at my understanding of being 10 months into this my understanding is that constitutionally there is some protections in there for the members i'm not sure that that should necessarily be there frankly i agree uh you know as a business owner i've had to make those tough decisions and have had to look at employees and say sorry we're not going to be able to do a raise this year partially because guess what i'm losing money or my my income is going to be coming down from from what we've been doing in the company and i don't think that should apply any differently with government whether it's local state or federal level this morning c-span's campaign 2012 bus is visiting the university of southern mississippi in hattiesburg mississippi and we'll hear this morning from some political science and journalism students who have questions for our guest congressman heisinga first up is katherine wilson student at the university of southern mississippi hi there joining us by skype hello good morning good morning hey kudos to you i'm not sure i'd be up at 8 30 when i was in college to go ask a politician question so i'm glad you're with us my question for you congressman is how do you predict the relationship between the united states and europe will change as a result of the financial crisis oh that's a great question and i think it's kind of a question mark we're not sure exactly what's going to be happening obviously the president has just flown to uh to france for the g20 summit uh and you know the interconnectedness that we have with our with our economies is a reality it might not be something that we want to acknowledge or that we even particularly like but it is the reality of it and i think it's really kind of an unknown um and we're somewhat limited here in the united states as to what we're going to be able to do to directly influence what is happening with the european recovery and what they're doing with greece uh but have no doubt there is going to be ramifications for us uh economically as well as i think possibly politically so but i'm not sure exactly how that's going to be playing out let's go to william republican in marion indiana welcome hi william are you with us hello go right ahead is this representative buildings of the state of michigan yes it is yep hello yes good evening i'm calling from marion indiana and i worked in uh florida for about two years and was a marketer made about 400 000 and was sent back to indiana from florida and i've been on ssi that is directed to representative mcgovern why is the ssi not taxed on the persons under 60. i've been on ssi for 40 years i haven't paid any federal income tax and i've only lived in the state of indiana and my question to you is why is the real worth of industry not put into buildings of construction or isn't there a state that escrow between the contractor and the contractor of a real estate agreement uh i'm not quite sure i understood uh fully exactly what uh what you were getting at there william with uh with with escrowing those accounts and those kinds of things but uh for your question regarding ssi that's something we'll take a look at and i'm not familiar exactly with what the history of whether that's taxed or not taxed certainly it's tax dollars coming in to somebody who's collecting that so we're going to go back and tax that again would be uh would be kind of an interesting question so appreciate that albertville alabama charlotte joins us on the democrats line hi there hi good morning charlotte good morning uh i would like to ask the furniture is congressman heisinger go right ahead i would like to ask the senator how many block grants that he and his family have gotten since they started their business and who authorized the super committee to do our congressman's jobs all right uh as far as block grants none uh they're uh we've had absolutely no uh no federal grants of any kind um the uh the question about the genesis of the super committee uh that super committee came out of the agreement that was connected with the debt ceiling increase that was uh that was something that the senate had wanted to put into the package kind of the house part was having a forced vote on the balanced budget amendment something i think is very very important and the the senate had wanted to put in the the super committee or the joint select committee so that was the genesis of it our last guest was representative mcgovern of massachusetts who was concerned about cuts to food stamps and other nutrition aid programs that go to families and children do you think programs that help the poor should be on the cutting block well first of all uh we need to make sure that we have a safety net that is there but i also do believe that that safety net begins with me personally i'm a person of faith and believe that my uh my responsibility starts within my own church within my own community within my own greater family uh and we ought to be the front lines not just expecting the government to uh to do that is there a role for government absolutely uh we but we need to make sure that uh that safety net is there for those who truly cannot help themselves and doesn't become some of uh some of crypto doesn't become a hammock uh that that others are just taking part in or taking advantage of a program um i thought it was a little uh a little unbelievable that uh that there was an assertion made that there's really no fraud uh in the uh in the programs uh earlier and uh that i think i think that just simply isn't the case i mean we've seen study after study uh where uh where we know that waste fraud and abuse is involved in all of those uh but we've got to go through and prioritize that should be a priority but we need to make sure that we are using every single tax dollar to its highest and best use a top official from the consumer financial protection bureau visited congress yesterday i'm looking at a story from the hill it says that the house financial services subcommittee covered well trod and ground at a hearing devoted to the cfpb's first 100 days and as we look at the 100-day anniversary mark here you said that the bureau needs more transparency and accountability how would you grade them in its first 100 days uh incomplete uh partially because we there is no head of the cfpb yet or i'm sorry just just uh newly newly appointed um but uh you know there is a lot of sort of building the airplane as it's rolling down the runway here uh we under dodd-frank this congress this previous congress i've been now part of this uh getting inserted into it while it's being implemented uh has been kind of making it up as it's going they've been trying to write the rules and trying to figure out exactly what they're doing uh what's uh what's disturbing to me libby is that if you uh if you sit in the committee uh you'd think this is holy writ from on high that you know they can't change a jot or tittle in this bill without without a human cry coming up from the other side and uh my my time i had been district director for my predecessor peter hoekstra um i i served in the state legislature now being in here yet in my uh involvement with government have i ever seen a perfect bill that's come out and never needs to be changed uh so we know that there are some reforms that need to happen in it uh and one of those sean duffy from wisconsin has a very common sense bill that would uh that would say okay instead of the cfpb the head of this uh being able to just implement rules there's something called the f sock which is another group of people that it has to kind of filter through we need to make this uh we need to make this more of a democratic view of implementing these rules so that there has to be an agreement on it and not just one person coming in and saying hey this is how we're going to do it and and no questions asked let's get back to our skyped in questions these are students from the university of southern mississippi we've got justin mitchell joining us good morning good morning hello good morning john and why did the seat and i have the g20 meeting happening in km today how do you fill it up to reject the euro and what role should you ask me a little bit but uh he asked about greece rejecting the euro what would the implications of that be and what is the us's role we see president obama there right now he's in can at the g20 summit yeah it uh this is big i mean this is big for uh for the g20 it's big for for the european union obviously the eu in the eurozone slightly different there's there's not everybody who's a member of the eurozone is uh takes part in in the euro or uses the euro it's kind of an unknown as to what really is going to be happening here there's obviously a pretty uh uh a pretty robust reaction to papandreou's uh call for a referendum within his own country um that uh that seems to be rejected by his own party uh the socialist party in uh in greece uh he had somebody quit the government and he only had a three-seat majority he had somebody quit the government and two of them say that they absolutely would not support it and uh and now that even though greece is not a part of the g20 they're not their economy isn't that big actually it's not even quite as big as the michigan economy overall uh but uh it uh they they've asked him sarkozy and angela merkel have asked him to come to cons uh to talk about this um so we're we're gonna see what's gonna happen uh with with what's going on but it is amazing libya that uh that an economy that in relative terms is that small smaller than the state of michigan's overall economy could have that much global impact uh and uh that that's kind of the indicative of the integrated uh economies that we have on world market looking at a story coming in this just from a few moments ago from fox business the greek prime minister may resign george papandreya reports are saying that he could step down and fox is looking at how stock futures are rallying on that report if he does resign it could potentially scuttle the referendum that has put europe's solution to its debt crisis in jeopardy well you know it's interesting uh having served now for 10 months on the financial services committee somewhat familiar but i've gotten much more familiar i've been to chicago a couple of times which most people don't realize actually sees as if not more activity than new york does when it comes to derivatives and futures and those kinds of things anything pretty much anything related to agriculture runs through chicago but same thing in in new york and and uh and then the international markets around the dax the hang sang others they want stability they want predictability uh and i would argue in in a way sometimes uh what what may be a good move long term uh they would view as negative short term and that's something that is uh is is challenging to this whole system is we've got to make sure that we're not just looking at the next day the next week the next month the next quarter we need to look at the next decade and what is the atmosphere for job creation for example are we doing here in the united states and sometimes that takes some very tough decisions same thing may be applied to uh to greece i'm not sure that uh when you're running at over 16 percent unemployment as they are nobody wants to lose their job but clearly they have to trim the size of their government and and the number of governmental employees that they have those are very difficult decisions and at some point or another the greek people are going to have to make up their mind are they are they not willing to accept sort of the parameters that the european central bank and the european union are putting on them let's hear from tom in los angeles independent line good morning good morning i'm also a realtor bill been one for 35 years and in between that time i've been a a legislative bill reader for the association of realtors in california so i follow things pretty well does anybody in washington on the other side realize that we sort of have a national emergency is a time for austerity there are people in the government there are programs in the government that need to be cut back that would be number one number two on the people that are being foreclosed on there is a negative amortization program that was very popular some time ago could the government not institute this allow people to reduce their payments say 50 have that money added on to the end of their loan go for a period of five to seven years while the economy turns around maybe they can get their jobs back they keep their houses and eventually uh the values would will be back up uh i'm i'm pleased to see somebody here that is a realtor because we've sort of gotten a bad end of the stick here um chris uh chris dodd and barney frank did nothing to uh but exacerbate the problems with the with the people who got loans that really didn't require them so uh i'd like to hear your comments and i i thank you very much for your time and it's it's good to see some of them understand the hard-working business all right well hey i appreciate that call tom and uh and it's interesting you've been in uh real estate i got my license about 20 years ago uh and it uh it was interesting back in that time when we were doing housing development you needed to own your lot you used that lot as collateral to go get a construction loan or you needed 20 percent down that's a little different than when my parents bought their house they had half the money but what we saw happen is that twenty percent which was kind of the norm uh became fifteen became ten became five became two percent became zero suddenly we saw a hundred and twenty percent hundred and twenty five percent loan to value and uh it you know it's crazy when you go to closing and you'd be across from the uh from the closing agent they say well here's your check thanks for buying the house here's your check and uh because we know you're gonna have to go get some furniture you know and and some of that is generational as well you know i'm i'm 42. i'll take some blame on this my generation wants it now and we're looking at it and saying hey of course i got to have the three-stall garage and the master bathroom suite and all these other things and we uh we haven't had the same sort of uh view of what our as our parents have had and i'm not saying that people ought to be buying a house and can only buy that house when they have half down uh but pretty clearly we saw people that were outside their uh their scope of paying and when i got into real estate i was taught people aren't brown they're not white they're not yellow you know they're green and they're green because they can either afford it or they can't afford it and i think that really needs to be the standard that we have so i appreciate that we're going to take a look at that reverse amortization uh idea as well this morning c-span's campaign 2012 bus is at the university of southern mississippi and we're joined by some of the students there this morning we had some issues with skype so we'll go to the phones now and hear from tundra patterson good morning good morning good morning go right ahead good morning congressman um upon graduation how will students be insured jobs within the workforce oh well tundra i'm not sure what your major is if you're one of our poli sci majors or one of the journalism majors but uh unfortunately there is no guarantee i i graduated with my political science degree uh did not have a a specific job was working in my family uh gravel company uh as which had been my summer job continued that afterwards and uh and it was uh it was an interesting day the day that i decided i needed to go into real estate full-time i had started to do developing and i i snapped a drive train on one of our trucks when i was uh when i was backing up and i i was i had had it and i sort of had it decided to go get my realtor's license and uh and started that career and i think oftentimes that's what's gonna you're gonna find happens uh there is no prescriptive box to check oh i'm a journalism major or a political science major or a history major or whatever else and you go out and here's my slot of jobs that i'm going to do it's about going out and also being entrepreneurial what do you want to do what's your passion so ultimately though we've got to make sure that you've got some options and choices and that unfortunately hasn't been the case and and i can tell you there's been a lot of criticism uh about republicans not having a plan well here is uh here's a something i carry around my pocket america's job creators plan the first one is empower small businesses reduce government barriers to job creation and uh please go to my website and you'll be able to see this or go to jobs.gop.gov and you'll be able to see this as well but it's about creating an atmosphere that's going to allow you to go have choices and and clearly we don't have that we don't have enough of those jobs and it's i think it's our job here in government state local federal level to create the atmosphere for the private sector to go out and create those opportunities story this morning on npr reported by education correspondent larry abramson college students are borrowing at an all-time high and here's how the story starts students are borrowing more money to pay for college than ever before new data shows that students who graduated in 2010 carried five percent more debt than the previous year an education debt is expected to grow in the coming years as students struggle to pay higher tuition costs well it's it is a problem uh you know we uh my wife and i have five young kids uh we employ a lot of a lot of babysitters uh who are in high school going into college and coming out of college as well so we hear those stories on a regular basis and uh and and people have been focused on uh on on the on the debt that that's been piling up i think we also need to look at the other side of the equation what's the cost of education we've seen education just dramatically increase in its expenses and that is something i think needs to be looked at now i know in the state of michigan for example a lot of that is dealt with within the state legislature uh there's there's not a whole lot we can do but we do need to make sure that we have some some programs like those pell grants and others to try to help students let's go to a michigan caller hilda joins us on our independent line where are you calling from hilda from colt mike but i'm in wexford county i'm coat is home to the uh uh to the truffle festival a mushroom festival up there so it is and you're you're my guy down there i've called your office before okay listen um i'm so glad that i got through and yes i am at the edge of my seat you know um okay just two questions and i tried to call and i ran my phone bill off um trying to try okay how they keep saying about those tax cuts that went in and what 201 and 202 i think it was and it was supposed to be for 10 years and when they were supposed to expire they sound like it's news to all these big business it was a 10-year deal same thing they do with credit cards or whatever else and you know now i live up north but my i've got my best friend was downstate and you know about 202 or 203 it was noticeable how things were falling apart down there i mean business is closing up and all that okay that i'd like to know why they make such a it's like it's news or something and it was a 10 year thing and it didn't work so that don't i'm not the smartest thing but that don't make sense to me and the other thing is how they keep saying well the health care that's why businesses can't hire people you know what i'm like a cape queen i take cc and i did it so much and i've got all these tapes in here and it must have been from the late 80s or early 90s they actually had congressional hearings because the um the insurance companies were just ripping people off there was people that testified that it paid thousands of dollars nothing qualified for their spin down or whatever so that's nothing new either i i appreciate it and uh hopefully we'll see up in the cadillac area soon at some point we'll be doing a town hall and hopefully we'll be able to meet face to face as well and if you do have questions i hope you're not uh calling my office down in holland long distance you can call our cadillac office uh as well so that should be in the local phone book but a couple of things one let me tackle the health care one first of all that was kind of what you finished up on it was 20 years ago this year i was a college intern on capitol hill and you're absolutely right it was a hot topic and uh something that's been growing and and oftentimes people say oh well you know healthcare just kind of came onto the scene well it's that's not true uh if you go back to the first uh the clinton administration uh in the quote-unquote hillary care debate that was going on uh that was something that uh that was uh was a big issue at that time uh and it's continued to be a big issue and and uh caller it's it's clearly going back to what we have had i would not view as success however for me i don't believe that uh that the the the health care reform that was put in place the so-called obamacare is is the right solution either i think we need to make sure that we are creating a different system and again we've we've had some number of alternatives that have been passed in the house that are sort of sitting over in the senate uh with uh with little to no action on them uh but we we can't just go back to the status quo that uh that is not success uh your discussion about the tax cuts you're right it was a ten year it was intended to be a uh a permanent tax level that was the intent of both the president uh at the time and and uh in the republican house uh the senate however didn't want to go along with that and the only way to get those tax levels put through was to put that 10-year sunset on then to have the have the debate again which they did and president obama along with the democrat house and the democrat senate uh extended it uh so that's sort of the the world that we're living in right now and the debates going on what are we going to be doing because if we do nothing those tax rates will go be we'll be going back up so that that's going to be happening here in the next couple of months story from the ap fewer people applied for unemployment benefits last week a hopeful sign that the job market might be picking up the labor department said today that weekly applications dropped 9 000 to a seasonally adjusted 397 000 the lowest level in five weeks it's only the third time since april that applications have fallen below 400 000. the figures come a day before the government issues the october jobs report economists expect it will show a net gain of 100 000 jobs with the unemployment rate remaining at 9.1 percent good news uh um well only now do we see flat uh as good news uh that uh that unfortunately libby is is the new reality in a way but as we discovered in michigan and if you dig a little deeper into these into these numbers uh the numbers that we talk about uh in that youth site and are cited in this article are not including those that either no longer qualify or frankly have just given up and that's what we see in michigan you know we have 11.1 percent unemployment in michigan we know it's significantly higher why because of the sort of elongated time period here that michigan has been struggling and it's been tied as that caller from from back in my district was talking about her friend down state well in all likelihood they were tied to manufacturing not just automotive we have three largest office furniture makers are in michigan hayworth steel case roman miller we've got a number of other manufacturers in aerospace and others and and michigan's been going through an entrenched time period here of of a depressed economy and people just have frankly given up and uh and whether it's voluntarily or whether they just the time has expired they're no longer on those roles so we've got a lot of work to do in helping to create create a better atmosphere for job creation let's hear from us another student at the university of southern mississippi rachel beach joins us good morning congressman hi good morning rachel do you agree with bernanke's assessment that our fragile economy is in the state of recovery uh you're talking about uh fed chairman ben bernanke okay all right okay uh very fragile um i i think it is uh there's there's signs of life uh but it's interesting when you come to washington uh you get to know a number of people and i've gotten friends uh from around the country uh and as i was just talking about michigan and what we've been going through i think michigan sort of uniquely situated for this recovery uh we have trimmed back expenses if you have survived over the last 10 years in michigan you you're employing some pretty sound business practices and uh and we've seen an uptick uh pretty uh pretty significant uptick in manufacturing back in michigan that is all good when i talk to some of my other friends from the carolinas or georgia or texas or down south or out west they're sort of now on only one or two or maybe three years into what michigan's been going through for eight or nine or ten years and uh and i think that uh it's more of a sense of fragility there uh than what we have in michigan um and again i think it's just because we had brought it down to such a base that that we're uniquely situated for that recovery but it is very tenuous and frankly could go off the rails and we'll see exactly what's going to be happening in europe because that may influence us you know the simple uh this simple complicated but a a rather small company like mf global has has dramatic ripple effects and in fact i got calls from constituents in the agricultural community that had derivatives and other things that were flowing through mf global and having having things cleared through there that came to an absolute stop because of what was going on so that just underscores sort of the interconnectedness that we have a story from the website mlive.com everything michigan looks at donations made to you and one of your fellow congressional members from michigan by the family members of the anway corporation you've received some pretty sizable donations in the 25 000 range does that have an influence on policies does that gain your ear well i actually my relationship with the family goes uh way way back back to when i was in high school one of the family members and i went to high school together so it's a small community over there but clearly they're global leaders in manufacturing from all over and they are essentially an asian company based in ada michigan just outside of grand rapids so they lend a perspective uh but being a realtor lends me a perspective being involved in the construction industry lends me a perspective having agriculture be a huge uh a huge part of the district uh lends a perspective as well so you know i i am i am not one uh who who takes orders or direction i take input and then i make decisions which i think is exactly what the people of the second district elected me to go do samantha raybourne joins us student at the university of southern mississippi welcome good morning good morning samantha how are you i'm doing great how are you good okay of course my question to you is congressman do you think the u.s will drive c-10 g-20 discussions on the u.s crisis given its current economic state i'm sorry i i lost you there for a second are we going to drive the g20 discussions is that what you said yes i think it's somewhat limited i mean obviously we are uh uh we are a significant part of that conversation uh but uh but we're not the only uh we're not the only uh significant player in that organization and i think so much focus has been on europe right now uh in many ways you've seen uh you've seen that policy being driven by angela merkel in in germany and nicolas sarkozy in in france uh and uh you gotta remember back when we were doing our first stimulus package it was actually germany and france that uh that scolded the united states saying hey you know you can't just keep piling on debt and if you look at bond rates for example um now this this was from yesterday's uh wall street journal journal eurozone divided talking about all the different bond rates germany's at 1.779 percent on a ten-year bond which is actually less than what uh the us uh bond rate is and uh and i think it's a recognition of their uh uh of their uh sort of uh you know sound policies that they have had there same thing in the netherlands uh they they're very very low they're number two at 2.2 percent uh but uh that's why they're afraid of what's going to be happening in greece and interconnectedness there but i i i think in a way sort of gone is that portion of us showing up and telling all the other countries what's going to be happening i mean that that uh that clearly is not going to be the case janet's democratic caller in atlanta hi there hi good morning hi good morning how are you okay senator i got a question since with your family history working in with the gravel the you as a realtor you work in an agriculture why is it more being done to control farm subsidy being in atlanta we're surrounded we're on the red belt some of the biggest states that's breaking in the most money in farm subsidies are the republican states in the south before they had a great article it's about south florida alone over nine and a half million dollars went over to an inverted dead people the farm subsidy money needs to be regulated and the deadline is regulated and earmarked for the agricultural needs of this country don't you think this without yeah waste fraud and abuse whether it's in the department of agriculture whether it's whether it's in the department of defense whether it's in hud doesn't matter we need to make sure that we are using your tax dollars uh in a fashion that we can be proud of and you can be proud of and unfortunately i can't look into this camera or look libby in the eye today and say hey we are using your dollars to their highest and most efficient use it just simply isn't the case so getting specifically to the farm subsidies uh question that you're that you're bringing up uh with the new farm bill that's coming up uh it's my understanding that there will be a dramatic re-uh re-shifting of uh of how those programs are going to work i think that should be the way it is when i talk to my agricultural producers and in my district it tends to not to be the corn and wheat and the major cash crops there's some of that but tends to be dairy blueberries cherries apples i've got a heinz pickle factory gerber baby food is in my district so it's very connected in with agriculture but not just those big sort of cash crop type things those producers are asking for for the system to revamp as well and i think we're going to give it to them let's hear from one more student at the university of southern mississippi michael sims joins us thank you morning michael good morning representative my question is this are there any short or long term effects of a greek default that should be cause for concern among the general population uh yeah certainly uh there are uh and especially on that short term the the problem is is that we might not know exactly what they are until it happens uh and uh that is that's really kind of the scary part i think that ripple effect will hit our shores it'll hit europe more significantly than it will with ours though but uh yeah there are going to be some of those ripple effects now the question is long term what is uh what is better for us you know is it better to go through some short-term pain and and and and deal with this um to then shore up our uh financial situation in the long run uh that's that's sort of the unknown but it is scary michael anytime that you're going into something that you don't know what the outcome is going to be uh that that causes everybody for uh to pause latest news from the ap out of athens greece's conservative opposition leader is demanding the formation of a transition government and the immediate ratification by parliament of the new eurozone debt agreement prime minister george papandreya came under growing pressure to resign after calling for a referendum on the deal and he's holding an emergency meeting with his ministers well it is uh it's going to be fascinating to watch and not just from an academic side uh but uh from the business side and uh it it's again it's hard to believe that a country that has an economy a gross economy smaller than the state of michigan may have that kind of effect on the world economy but it's it's a reality congressman bill heisinger making his first visit to washington journal thank you for coming here republican who represents michigan's second district as a freshman thanks for having me we'd also like to thank

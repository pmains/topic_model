we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw welcome back folks okay today we're going to talk about your gas prices which i think is something everybody wants to know about and uh i've got an expert here to help us with that car ingham carr thanks so much for watching congressman we were at that uh an oil and gas conference sat next to each other said lots of smart things and audience loved it so uh here uh let me give you some back give the audience some background on who you are you're uh you're from amarillo uh your texas economist uh which is different than just a normal economist i agree i don't know texas anything is different than any other kind of anything i don't know it's just written here for some reason it is the uh you're the owner and president of ingham econ llc which is an economic analysis and research firm specializing in statewide regional and metro maybe that's why you're a texas economist okay because you specialize in this economy um oil and gas and you specialize in oil and gas and energy economics so perfect guy to be talking to about this and uh you've you've got a long story career that i i could get into um but you you know what you're talking about i think is the point um been working in this industry quite quite a while and um really appreciate you being on the lend us my pleasure your expertise my pleasure um let's just get straight to the the core of the issue which is why gas prices are high um and maybe you could i'm sure you could also answer in general why why we're seeing record inflation as well um a lot of theories about that probably a lot of misconceptions why is it happening you got to know why it's happening if you if you have any hope of fixing it right sure well so the the the other thing that i do and frankly spend most of my time on is i serve as the chief economist which is say only economist for a statewide oil and gas trade association called texas alliance of energy producers so these are just people who are in the business of producing crude oil and natural gas every day for the country and for export for mexico for other countries all the place our energy goes to lift up economies and lift up people and make people's way of life and their standard of living better never more so than has been the case here in the u.s so because of that work i pay a lot of attention to these things all day every day watch crude oil prices energy prices uh try to understand why we have movements in these things and then just do things that economists do wonder why uh and and then set out to learn why or or know why we have these phenomenon phenomena various phenomena in our economy like inflation and how does all of this how does this all work against a backdrop of what we've been through over the last couple of years a lot of it's tied to that and so first and foremost crude oil prices and gasoline prices are just tied together always when crude oil prices are higher than they were at some previous period gasoline prices are typically going to be higher as well it's the primary input into a gallon of gasoline so that's always going to be the case um gasoline is a product a commodity unto itself so you certainly have market events that cause gasoline to do one thing or another it's typically sort of short-lived like a kind of an interruption of of refining because of hurricane or something like this some other regional phenomena but but typically gasoline prices move with crude oil prices well so were gasoline prices the highest they've ever been really well in in mid 2008 when we had crude oil prices sniffing 150 bucks a barrel gasoline prices four dollars ish in texas much higher than that in other parts of the country where they do really goofy things with markets and have gasoline price gasoline taxes at the state level that are much higher than they are in texas and so so that's when gasoline prices were the highest they've ever been and particularly when you go back and kind of adjust this for inflation and restate those two thousand eight dollars in two thousand twenty dollars they were even higher same is true for crude oil those are the highest crude oil prices we've ever had and uh fantastically though uh our oil and gas producers in texas in the us but really led by texas responded to these prices and frankly i mean if you just want to cut to the chase u.s oil and gas producers led by texas just flooded the market with crude oil we had a recession of course as you know 2008 2009 nationally and in texas so that's in crude oil prices tanking uh crude oil prices came back uh after that never got that high again and then we set about um more than doubling u.s crude oil production quintupling texas crude oil production actually over the next five years it's just during this period of time with that we flooded the market with crude oil with a little help from opec as well and so this is very instructive for what we're looking at now in other words what's the cure for higher gasoline prices to consumers to raise the supply of crude oil relative to current demand well we're we seem to be everything we seem to be doing everything we can be doing in the u.s to keep that from happening at least at the governmental level and the in the in the mind of the current administration the democrat majority in the house and the effective democrat majority in the senate there's a hostility toward raising crude oil production in the united states but this is what pushes gasoline prices down for consumers because ultimately it pushes down crude oil prices is there a chance that that increase in production will happen um because of higher prices how long does it take for for for investors to get back to work on this oh very much a chance i mean this is what operators do they respond to higher prices they go drill more wells they bring more production uh online and move it into the marketplace and so given perfect freedom to do this this is exactly what would happen and i think there's a solid chance that it can but we're working against ourselves right because we're pinching up production um on federal property which thank goodness we don't have a lot of that in texas but uh just messing with these leases on federal lands and waters it creates uncertainties i mean it creates a ton of uncertainty federal judge reversed that decision says that the administration does have to lease federal land right now now the question is when did they start that because they have other ways to slow roll that process just by losing paperwork you know i mean it could be as simple as that it's their bureaucracy after all and and then i think the next question producers probably have is what regulations are coming down because if i invest now in the current environment maybe it's a good investment but this administration seems to hate me so what uh democrats certainly hate me and they have majorities um so you know does that investment make sense and what do you hear from you know from the oil patch oh it it it creates a tremendous amount of uncertainty and it keeps some activity sidelined that would be flooding to the marketplace right now i mean with 70 to 80 crude oil we probably ought to see higher levels of drilling than we've seen thus far i mean it's a tremendously uncertain political environment a very hostile environment so so even though the you know this decision was reversed um you know the the oil and gas community out there has i mean why would you rush into uh into uh and then try to acquire new federal permits now i mean you might do it if you've uh you know if you've had activity there and of course the other thing we did is kill off the keystone which was a supplier of canadian crude oil into this marketplace canada is a terribly important supplier of crude oil into the u.s marketplace somebody pointed out in a tweet the other day that uh we import about 800 000 barrels a day from russia uh which is also what the keystone pipeline would have given us well precisely i mean none of these things make sense i mean why would you be hostile toward u.s production and texas production these people who have delivered what you professed to want which was much higher level of us domestic crude oil production resulting in much lower reliance on crude oil from places not north america a lot of people don't understand this either which is because i'm sure people's question is often okay we export oil but we import russian oil what the hell is going on here um so can you explain that sure we we we export and we import obviously and the simplest answer to that question is that all crude oil is not same we produce a lot of crude oil in texas it's not terribly well suited for our uh refinery structure we'd have to rebuild our refineries yeah certainly retool them pretty considerably so we can send a lot of this light sweet stuff that we produce out of texas and the permian send it to somebody who can use it um but the thing we got from canada was crude oil that is very well suited to our refineries and so what we accomplished you know we didn't get to perfect energy independence which is to say every barrel of crude oil that we use is produced within the united states and frankly we don't need to do that we need to be able to trade to make things work for everybody and trade always works for everybody if it's unfettered what we did was have a nifty little north american partnership where we're producing most of what we're consuming getting a lot of it from our friends to the north moving a lot of natural gas and other petroleum products into mexico i mean we were very nicely set up with uh with let's just call it north american energy independence and we still got some product from elsewhere and so man here we go we're we're cutting off a sizable portion of the canadian stuff coming in um exhibiting an overt hostility to u.s domestic production and then suggesting we're just going to go somewhere else in the world of people who don't like us at all yeah and get that crude oil so we can produce that stuff here so why not is there any uh economic reason to retool our refineries so i'm assuming the reason we had our refineries are the way they are is because for years we were not energy independent we were importing uh the the heavy stuff that our refineries were fine as that changed over the last couple decades and we started producing a lot more of the light sweet crude oil from west texas you know there's an investment that must take place to retool those refineries doesn't seem to be any point in doing it for those who own it but is there is there a long-term uh benefit to doing that well i i think there probably could be a long-term benefit to doing this i mean we understand um that that these things happen because the people who are in that business and their investors decide that this is a worthy thing to do so what are the obstacles to this well just an obstacle just again this kind of hostility to towards such things now the permitting process to do that sort of thing is just monstrous and if you decide you're going to do that today i mean it's 10 years down the road or more before you can get that done so it's it's really hard to take off down that path without knowing what's going to happen between uh between now and then so so somebody asked you right now what do you think oil prices will be gas prices will be this is what really people care about uh in a year or in six months or next month uh what what what's the trend what does it look like you know i i i hate to uh i hate to qualify every statement if covid doesn't get us and kind of goes you know on a path where it doesn't result in kind of a demand scenario that looks anything like what we had last year which we're not but if it starts to cut into global domestic demand at all it'll kind of move the move these targets a little bit but you know what we should see and we have seen and this is part of the reason gasoline prices are higher as well is a return of demand both domestically and globally as people have just done their best to get over covid i flew down here today and then both of my legs and my flights were full unlike a year ago people are all over the place um it looks like the the world looks much more like it used to or at least the parts of it that i've seen did some traveling over the summer a lot more people moving around and so you've got demand that's actually increasing pretty rapidly and supply that's not quite keeping up with it we sidelined a lot of production capacity in 2020 and we blame well should have i mean we had a demand collapse of 25 or 30 percent virtually overnight and so we just had to move this stuff offline we've had even before that happened though we were having sort of a decline in capital investment and new exploration production activity so this was beginning to slow us down a little bit as well and so what the market is screaming for right now is additional crude oil and we should be moving a little faster to supply that crude oil instead of asking somebody else to do this i'm um that was infuriating especially because they virtue signal so much about the environment um which which gets to another uh point of conversation well okay so i obviously have two questions and i'm going to lay them all both out we can we can start with either one one was in hindsight is there anything more the government could have done in this case the trump administration could have done to soften the blow at the time it's difficult without legislation because democrats would not do a single thing to help the industry in legislation they wouldn't um wouldn't add any other economic packages related to the oil and gas industry uh we fought for a few things um you know additional purchases into the strategic reserve uh which they did do some of that i believe um or they did some version of it or just uh changing the the way that bank loans were given to uh to so to the the industry and i'm not explaining that really correctly it's kind of difficult an economist might be able to explain it better but um and then i want to move into this question of should we have opec just uh increasing production to make our gas prices lower and if you're an environmentalist which they all claim they are on the radical left what is that what does that do for the environment and how are industries different when it comes to environmental regulations and protections and just uh you know protection of the environment um but but let's start with what we could do better to soften blows in the future well hopefully we don't ever have another blow that's quite like that one or anything close to that one i mean this was a perfectly utterly unprecedented turn of events we've never seen a demand contraction of that magnitude over any period of time much less over the course of a month or two and so it's virtually impossible to kind of know what to do with this and respond to this on the fly we spent a lot of time talking to your office to other offices talking about this as it was playing out in real time and so the the spr purchases and things of this nature and on the bank loan side of things i mean what our operator members were telling us is that listen i mean we've got we've taken bank credit and all well and good under a different set of market circumstances but now the regulators are coming in and they're saying listen this is all of a sudden a non-performing loan because crude oil was um you know 60 or 70 bucks going into this thing and now it's about 10 and so we were really pressing on on federal bank regulators occ fdic uh to just quit thinking about that for a little while you know just a little regulatory forbearance and what in terms of what they're forcing the banks to do yeah so because if you make a bank classify that as a non-performing loan then you have to you know kind of start figuring out how you're going to collect this or write it off or whatever the case may be screws up the credit of the borrower and all of these sorts of things so we were present for a lot of that and we got some of that um ppp was uh was a big help to a lot of our guys i mean we represent a small we represent a lot of small independent operators that are just fabulous operators they're great they're sophisticated they're companies whose names nobody's ever heard before but there are hundreds of them out there in texas and thousands of them out there nationally and so we'd be very protective of those and not do things that disadvantage them relative to the larger guys who can absorb a lot of this nonsense and so uh but but again i mean when you've got demand collapsing like this there's not much to do other than for operators to have the perfect freedom to respond to this in ways that they need to so they were shutting down wells in a hurry and you know just based on the notion if i pull this next barrel out of the ground there's no place for it to go so this is what we're going to have to do stop drilling uh drilling the the the rig count went to the lowest number it's ever been since they started keeping the rig count and now we're frankly we're not that much higher than that we've recovered some but we're not back to where we should be with 70 oil and so it's a matter of writing it out but and then kind of making sure doing everything you can to be sure that your government's not working against you there were some calls of course um and we were a little split on this uh oil and gas associations you know nationally and around the country were a little split on this i mean should we should we at that time institute crude oil import restrictions from you know places we get crude oil from other than canada right that's kind of a hard trigger to pull i mean uh really you just have to have supply to have the freedom to respond to this demand crater i remember that conversation going on yeah um okay but then so let's get to the current times joe biden calling for opec to increase production um because you know he knows the high gas prices are bad for re-election turns out also destroying um our foreign policy uh in alliances and um completely bundling the afghanistan withdrawal is also bad for politics so maybe he's a little bit more worried about that now but um nevertheless what's interesting is again the environmental perspective here can you talk about some of the differences between production here and production in saudi arabia russia well first of all just the flawed economic notion that we we in the u.s who operate the in what has historically been the premier market economy ever on the face of the planet looks less like that now than it used to and if i suppose if they have their way it'll look much less like that in the future because an environmental environmentally justified takeover of the economy is still a takeover of the economy and so um so it's a perfectly flawed economic notion in 2008 when these prices were going sky high the conventional wisdom was listen these price increases aren't going to matter because price increases are designed among other things to stimulate additional production but the rock's not going to permit this i mean the geology is not going to permit this we can prices are going to go sky high crude oil production will continue to go down well we turned that notion on its head and indeed entrepreneurial genius people went out and figured out how to produce crude oil out of shale with horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing and then we just explode us onshore domestic crude oil production and so we know that operators can respond to now they're just kind of spring-loaded to respond in a hurry to the demand increases that are implied by rising prices and so uh so not only we do we do this i mean we do this in generally appropriately regulated fashion in texas as you know we're regulated principally we meaning the texas oil and gas industry by a state agency and that is the texas railroad commission and so we generally just kind of prefer this notion of texas texans being regulated by texans and to try to keep epa and other federal agencies at bay in terms of doing things that really don't make a lot of sense make it more difficult and expensive for operators to operate smaller independents in particular but all of this appropriate regulation means that our operators are are operating responsibly we're not polluting we're not um uh we're we're producing crude oil in much cleaner fashion than is being produced anywhere else on the world i mean i think this is virtually undeniable and so there are a host of reasons not to trade u.s production for opec or opec plus production saudi arabia russia that's only one of them but it's a big one i mean if in fact what we're doing in the u.s in a policy sense with this hostility toward the u.s domestic oil and gas industry for the benefit of the environment all you're doing is trading um trading cleaner production for much less clean production you're actually raising global emissions and it's a global emissions number that counts if that's what you're looking at and so there's there's just nothing about this that makes sense it doesn't make economic sense at all it doesn't make political sense but it's just such a flawed economic notion i mean let your market economy your your fabulous capitalistic market economy do what it does respond to price increases and bring a lot more crude oil production online which again in fairly short order would push gasoline prices down pretty noticeably um you know one thing that comes up along those lines on the environmental side is uh methane emissions it's a big thing we're dealing with right now the the administration wants to roll back the uh trump administration rollback of the obama era methane regulations um bigger producers are fine with it because they have all this fancy equipment that that does exactly what the what the regulators want them to do what's your take on that smaller producers are not so excited about it um you know it's funny just as a general thought republican economics tends to be small business economics lower taxes and less regulations uh it's as it turns out big corporations aren't really fighting for those things that's the dirty little secret it's the smaller companies your startup that really need smaller uh small lower taxes and lower regulations just that's what's interesting about that i think we should start branding ourselves as the uh as small business economics um in any case methane emissions can we can maybe speak to that issue for a little bit and what if america and how much better american companies are reducing in methane emissions and say russia saudi arabia venezuela if venezuela is still producing any oil or iran you know right oh uh much who's watching over there i mean who's who's watching regulating who cares about what they're doing they don't care over there nobody uh we have people watching it here but again this is not just the epa at the federal level i mean we've got railroad commission and we've got the texas commission on environmental quality but it's also just i mean but our industry i mean our private industry too private industry is it also you know methane escaping is money escaping so there's an incentive in place to to reduce that right um you know is there technology that we use that they just don't use um abroad or are there practices that we use that they just don't use abroad oh sure uh uh uh just better equipment and and and uh and practices just make sure that that is not leaking out there but because it is money lost i mean that comes out of the ground i mean methane is natural gas so you'd just prefer to sell it if that's what you could do so uh it's not as though there's never a a leak in a tank system or uh or at a valve or at a uh at a seam in a pipeline or something like this so these things do occur but um but when you're talking about smaller operators um our and we've because of the methane rule and where we're sort of headed with this and now this proposal for a methane tax um we've kind of surveyed our operators about what this looks like and um i think it's fairly clear at this point first of all if you just add all of those up from smaller producers it's not enough to matter in terms of methane release accidental release of methane into the atmosphere you know you've uh you've got bigger guys um who who are able to pay attention to this put equipment into place that smaller guys are not able to do i mean do you want to put at risk a goodly chunk of the smaller operators in texas and then some of them may be startups a lot of them are companies that have been around for 40 or 50 years and again they are great successful sophisticated operators uh but not operating on high margins uh operating on smaller volumes operating wells that produce much less per per well in terms of both crude oil and natural gas so the things that we've fought for and talked about are our small volume or small operator exemptions for these things and that's what trump did we kind of had this off ramp when a well is ticking downward in production when it gets to about 15 barrels a day or less and it kind of goes out of the system in terms of what's being regulated by methane so that's all been tossed aside now with congressional review of the trump rule and uh and the coming rewrite of that methane rule from uh from this administration will regulations like that make it even harder to get gas prices lower i would assume because that's going to take a bite out of increasing production everything everything we're talking about here and we haven't even touched on taxes yeah yeah i was going to ask you about carbon taxes so you know carbon talking about a methane tax what about in general a carbon tax as well well carbon tax is a popular flawed uh economic policy uh particularly if it is a u.s only policy i think that's the key because i mean you can argue with the con our economists will argue with each other about what i generally hear is if you're going to do this carbon tax is the most efficient economically speaking but they leave out that it does have to be global if it's not global i really don't see how i'm not even sure you'd really take a bite out of global emissions well frankly you don't i mean our i mean we're a big country and we're a big economy um you know and we've got a chunk of of uh activity that i mean you know even if you're just operating as an economy with cars driving around and trucks delivering things and planes going from here to there and generating electric power and all the things that you want a mature develo advanced developed economy to do it does generate emissions but even at that i mean we're a relatively small portion of global emissions and so my problem with the carbon tax as an economist is that it uh it is it's very regressive for one thing i mean it's really hard on lower income it's just with a stroke of a pen you're raising the energy costs of people that you profess to be want to uh that you want to be looking out for and all of a sudden you're not which just suggests you may not care about them all that much and they they retort with well we're going to do a carbon dividend so we're going to take that money from the carbon tax and then we're going to redistribute that based on your income um well i would simply sell them just like that he wants to operate in that kind of environment i mean all it does is put your household uh even in more direct connection with the government increase my costs with a with us with a with a vague promise to send me a check later and it's like just how about just don't increase that and do you want to you know inject yourself into the system so you can do this i mean what do you have to do what do you have to provide to the government that proves to them that you spent right this much money on a lot of bureaucracy seems like a ridiculous system to me uh and it's not a system uh in which a free people ought to have to operate and deal with what is a system that they ought to get to operate and deal with is one that simply allows the economy to work that and do what it does that doesn't mean there are never high crude oil prices and they're never high gasoline prices it does mean that the economy has the and the players within it u.s domestic crude oil and natural gas producers the freedom to respond to these things and of course consumers respond to them as well when gasoline prices go considerably higher especially in a short period of time they tend to spend a little bit less on it which kind of pushes the demand for it down at the same time trying to raise supply i mean this is the economy this is the economic system at work trying to bring things into balance every minute of every day has always been very successful at this um you know cars cars energy policy is pretty simple just get out of the way and uh let the economy do what it does um yeah but you know but there's still another side to that which is we want to increa decrease global emissions so i mean i see where they're coming from the question is what's the best way to do that um one thing that actually piqued my interest was in the recent democrat uh spending i'm not sure which bill this was in but this is one of their proposals which was an import tax on carbon intensive goods so basically a carbon tax but on others as opposed to the u.s and i'm like that's not the worst idea i've at least i'm at least willing to talk about that as always with everything there's second third order consequences really it's just a tariff that's all we're we're talking about now tariffs are for it yeah it really terrors our taxes on us um but if if you have to do something it would seem like uh like a carbon tax on chinese imports would be the would be the best way to do that because look i mean we don't have free trade in the world you know and i think republicans have have now have this internal debate about free trade and it's actually a very healthy debate um because laissez-faire economics and kind of libertarian economics globally is a myth i mean it's a utopia that doesn't actually exist never has uh because the reality is is that we trade with people who subsidize their goods and and and engage in less environmental practices and less regulations that less labor protections that make their goods cheaper in an unfair way you can kind of battle this out in the in the in the um in the wto but you know that has maybe there's some benefit maybe that has some wins for us but for the most part there's a real argument to be made that the the factory workers in ohio have a real bone to pick with with laissez faire libertarian economics and global trade okay so it's the premise here so what do you do about it um you try to equalize that to the greatest extent you can again unclear whether that really has the benefits we're looking for but if you make it about carbon intensity you know at least at least you're maybe hitting at some of the the real polluters in the world which is the chinese i don't know what are your thoughts well i you know i could i i that's at least a discussion as an economist i would be i would be willing to have i mean if you want to single out the u.s which frankly is exactly what we're doing in terms of regulation in terms of uh not just a carbon tax proposal but proposals to do away to change the tax treatment for oil and gas operators in the u.s eliminate these idc's intangible drilling costs another thing for smaller operators called percentage depletion if you want to do away with these things i mean again you're just punishing a a very important sector of the u.s economy i mean i get the midwest ohio steel guys and the auto guys in all of this i guess our sense would be that the us domestic oil and gas industry is certainly no less important than those things and um and uh not really not looking for too much other than to just kind of leave things alone in terms of the tax treatment and let them again do what they've done which by the way has revealed you've skirted my question quite definitely let me let me get to it um uh this at least it's kind of moves beyond singling out the u.s domestic oil and gas industry right because it looks like that's what we've done so it's at least a conversation worth having and i think this is a healthy debate i mean the libertarian economic types i mean they they will grant you that that we that we compete in the global arena with countries that do things wrong they they subsidize their stuff they do all sorts of things to dump their production into the u.s um so they they're not naive to this uh their question would be uh what do you want to do about this in ways that don't raise prices to u.s consumers for the goods and services that they that they get this is principally what's important to them right right and that's a valid question mean there's obviously cost to it it's a tax the tariff is a tax right the question is um here's the here's the real question it's like the jones act okay so the jones act is a is a hot topic the cato institute hates it um people like me who represent the gulf states uh were in favor of the jones act okay why because it protects our maritime industry and and it does it does seem like a pretty reasonable argument that our american maritime industry here in these kind of intercoastal waterways would not exist without the jones act they're just not competitive enough globally and we have an interest whether it's national security or just jobs or an economy we have an interest in having an american-led maritime industry we are a maritime superpower or at least we used to be i think we'd be good to get back to that um so we need more ship building we need an industry there that's that's the argument there um but the jones act probably makes consumer costs higher generally maybe it's maybe your sugar is like three three cents higher per pound than it otherwise would be so the question is is it worth having sugar that's three cents lower per pound um if that means cutting out jobs in louisiana um in intercoastal waterways and and and taking a knife uh or maybe a hatchet to our maritime industry and that's that's just one example but it's a question i think is is broader that we're not going to solve here and i think it's a very healthy debate at least we're getting all the facts again it's at least that and it's a conversation i i would not mind having as an economist at all and frankly as an oil and gas guy again just just thinking about the u.s domestic oil and gas industry and it's fared very well for itself in terms of raising production grabbing global market share uh you know frankly we've slapped opec around pretty good over the last number of years i mean we we uh we we hate what they do i mean they just don't operate in a market sense at all but they have found themselves utterly baffled by these dramatic production increases by the us and so um so i think uh if your purpose is not to punish uh and somehow restrict the activity of the u.s domestic oil and gas industry and if that means kind of shifting this notion of how you price carbon um somebody else turn it into a global thing rather than just a us domestic thing i mean i think this is what gets operators riled up and it and and it ought to i mean why single out us let other others produce and by singling them out too it's again like you've noted many times it doesn't really decrease global emissions because global demand remains the same and and even biden recognizes that because he's asking opec to increase emissions it's it's ridiculous uh i want to move on a couple other questions about um electric vehicles is you know this is something you look at um how realistic is it i mean you know from an economic standpoint how realistic is it that we really transition to electric vehicles in the future in any meaningful way that the infrastructure will support it that the technology will will support it in a profound way um my question is always and then what economic what environmental benefit are we really getting from evs uh you know this widespread use of evs it doesn't always seem to me as i understand it um different studies show different things of course but it takes about after about it takes about 20 000 miles of driving for an electric vehicle to finally have a better carbon footprint than a gas-powered vehicle uh just because of the production necessary to create an electric vehicle and the fact that your base you know it's really a coal powered vehicle depending on where you live or natural gas yeah natural gas so you're still burning fossil fuels to even charge it it's just that that's just true um so you know that that's why it takes that amount of time to really to really make up for that benefit or make up for that carbon footprint um i don't know what just i laid it out for you what are your general thoughts so we got of the vehicle fleet out there in the us two maybe a little over two percent uh are electric vehicles so that means all the rest of them are just you know combustion engine driven uh vehicles so i mean just think about it going from two percent even to ten percent much less 30 40 50 majority evs out there this is a transformational shift in a transportation economy and it's really difficult to force a transformational shift like that in a really compressed period of time and it's really difficult to make it happen artificially so i you know i i think there's a scenario whereby over a a considerable period of time our economy naturally transitions to this frankly back in 2008 when crude oil prices were going up and up and up and getting close to 150 a barrel as an economist i began to think to myself wow this is it i mean this is the time where the market realizes we're kind of running out of this stuff and the market will sort of figure out what comes next which is a car that runs on something besides a petroleum energy direct or indirect and so to sort of figure this out over a period of time i don't know how to do it you don't know how to do it they don't know how to do it this is how market economies progress and transform but again it happens naturally rather than being forced by by by the government in some way so i absolutely can foresee a time where our our electric vehicle fleet as a share of the total is rising and rising and rising how long does it take to get there well we'll see that's where the market takes us 2008 turned out not to be that time because then you know our oil and gas guys figured out how to produce a lot more crude oil because they like getting a hundred and forty dollars a barrel for crude oil cevs getting any cheaper too because right now they're they're really for the rich well again over time they would just because the technology would get better we would scale these things there would be more of them but this is what always happens i mean new technology that is expensive just takes time and then but we're talking decades for that um who who can afford one of these i mean not many um and then you've got problems even if you've got one it's just not as easy as driving up to a gas station you've got to pre-plan whatever you certainly do but mostly it's just a cost issue it's a feasibility issue never mind the fact that you still have to generate enough power way more power than we're generating now i mean i think there's virtually no understanding of what it takes to supply enough uh particularly if you don't want to use natural gas to do it i mean you have to fill up a country with windmills that's what's so ridiculous like let me get this straight so in our two largest states california texas we both have problems with our grid california has more let's be honest we got a lot of crap for the texas freeze but look it was a ridiculous freeze what do you want from us sure um and we're making improvements on that as we should learn those lessons um but in the end it's it's an insane um anomaly not the point the the point is the reason that that happened and the reason it happens in california is because there's too much demand and there's not enough energy being produced it's really that simple and then they have to do rolling blackouts to preserve the grid uh that was that's what happened in in texas during the freeze that's what happens in california every time you know the temperature increases a couple degrees above the norm and they're not expecting it and so you already have this generation problem where you're just not producing enough generation and um again california and texas are very similar reasons for that it's because we over invest in renewables and sometimes renewables work that's great but when they don't well they don't um so the question is as you pointed out okay now what happens if we add another 100 million cars or something like electric vehicles which is the goal to that grid that's already struggling and then they have to charge off the electricity nobody has an answer for this i mean nobody's really spun this out in terms of what the renewable which is say wind and solar would complex would have to look like just to supply that much power to the marketplace and even if it does it's it still has this notion of being intermittent and at times unreliable i'm not remotely even as an ole gas guy i'm not remotely anti-wind and solar but again if if they develop as a market consequence and outcome over time i think that's just fine but what we've done is as you suggest over incentivize these things to where we have much more capacity installed for wind and solar than we otherwise would absent these fantastic subsidies at the state and federal level for these things which means if those incentives did not artificial incentives did not exist we would have uh more capacity for natural gas primarily some to coal a nuclear frankly and less capacity installed out there for wind and solar which means you have a better and frankly more reliable mix i mean i'm i'm just convinced that this scenario would have looked somewhat different than it did but as you suggest this is just a crazy anomaly but you also sort of run into this in the peak heat of the summer time where you start talking about you know having power companies trying to just guilt their consumers and to turn the air conditioner down or whatever the case may be just to save us a little power my goodness do we not have enough natural gas to generate a lot of electricity we we certainly do i mean we've got natural gas we're just washing the stuff we could do this for decades to come we've lowered emissions by doing this by shifting from coal to that it's just a great way to power an economy on the on the power generation side of things and is that then translated into generating electricity to power an electric vehicle fleet yeah probably over time trying to make this happen within a five-year time frame 10-year time frame even before 2050 yeah it's just asking for it it's irresponsible you're going to get a lot of costs there right and go back to the coal versus gas that's why we've we've replaced a lot of our coal with gas and that's largely because of fracking um china is doing the opposite china is actually planning on building more they're building more new coal plants than we even have in our entire existing fleet so that's not only is china responsible for i believe it's like 30 percent of global emissions it's double what we are um they're on track to probably be responsible for more if they're really building that many new coal plants now they're doing no avoiding this they're doing that to produce electricity uh for mining and and and manufacturing of solar panels which is like the irony of it right which we import um this ends up taking three percent of the entire entire world's electricity production that's an amazing statistic um what would it take for our industry to export a lot more of our natural gas and in a cheap enough way that the chinese would you know do their basic economic justification and say let's stop building coal let's let's use american natural gas well we've made a lot of headway toward that i mean some of this was just technology you know i mean you can load a bunch of liquid crude oil onto a big mess of really big boats and send it everywhere around the world it's much more difficult with natural gas but but again we've made a lot of headway in this technologically and figured out sort of solve this problem of how to do that with natural gas just kind of change the physical property of it and load it on a boat and start shipping it around the world we we pipe a bunch of natural gas into mexico i mean we pipe a bunch of natural gas into mexico so we're doing this for them it's tremendous export for texas and u.s natural gas but getting it to places like china places like europe other places that just need natural gas we can do this i mean what we have made tremendous progress toward is scaling uh natural gas export and the ability to again load it on a boat and take it somewhere else around the world so this will only continue if it's given the opportunity to and frankly you know natural gas was pretty expensive leading up to this 2008 recession uh but the but but the response to this higher price for natural gas i mean it was really natural gas that was first affected by hydraulic fracturing right i mean we this was all done in the state of texas by the way the barnett shale up around the north texas area was the laboratory for hydraulic fracturing and so natural gas prices went pretty high and during katrina and rita back then they went really spiked upward what would government have to do if we wanted to accelerate like you know because as far as republicans go what we call the new energy frontier is our response to the green new deal and whether we like it or not all conversations about energy in the united states are centered around the environmental question these things are clearly related so we need a response to the green new deal and part of that response uh is investments in newer technologies newer nuclear technologies carbon capture [Music] you know hydro things like that the democrats are for some reason against it's very odd but they are and but related to that is more exports of of natural gas so the industry will always be looking for that edge we can rely on them for that uh what can government do to get out of their way or improve upon their competitiveness to get our gas to china and india because i'm a firm believer if we got our gas cheaper to china china and india that would be the single biggest reduction in carbon emissions the world has ever seen without a doubt so allow u.s producers to condemn to continue to produce responsibly but uh generally unfettered which is to say don't make natural gas production more expensive with additional regulation that doesn't make sense or with tax treatments that don't make sense so keeping prices generally low enough to sell to consumers elsewhere around the world to have this price competition to what you refer it's number one number two whatever it takes to permit facilities uh along the coastline to uh uh uh put these players in build out that infrastructure uh so it's just a permitting issue it's not an investment issue we don't need government money to do any of this it's really just let it happen well uh i i don't i mean personally i don't think uh i mean everybody would take government money sure given the opportunity they'll make a good argument every time they do it quite just don't get in the way i mean if you create a a generally certain environment the investment will find its way there i mean that's what our economy's always done and always will the investment will find its way there i mean we've got great public companies that are that are leading the way in this i mean chenier is everybody thought they were nuts years ago when they thought okay we're gonna we're gonna compress this stuff and liquefy it and put it on a boat and send it somewhere else it took a long time for them to generate a return at all but but this is happening now now other companies are doing the same thing so certainly permitting issues i mean it's expensive and it takes too long so it's just too long for that industry and its investors to respond but uh but also just a more certain environment about this i mean there's you know the government's playing with this stuff all the time and so uh so don't don't burden that process down with taxes don't burden it down with uh uh with uh inappropriate regulation and don't make it more expensive to get from here to there i mean whatever that may look like on a day-to-day basis or week to week basis that ought to be the policy yeah because at least we you know we we we didn't always produce more natural gas than we use it's been in relatively recent history that we've done that but we exploded u.s domestic natural gas production before we did it with crude oil and now we've got enough to suit our own needs for literally decades to come and never mind the rest of the world and by the way if the rest of the world is not burning natural gas or u.s natural gas what are they doing uh they're burning wood they're cutting trees down i mean they're doing things to get power into their house even if it's very primitive but it's very dirty it's very unhealthy i mean who in the world wants to envision a scenario out there never mind the fact that we're just kind of depriving our global neighbors of the things that we now have the benefit of that's just morally indefensible it seems to me but again what are they doing if they're not using natural gas and kind of building out a somewhat modern electricity infrastructure with our help they're doing things that are much more harmful to the environment much more harmful to them and their households individually and much more restrictive in terms of a mature uh developing uh economy uh that kind of you know uh the that uh that doesn't leave people at this kind of substance subsistence third world kind of level right um these are the natural gas can do all of these things for us but again we have it we we want to be free to send it to other nations around the world to use uh to their benefit and there's there's no reason this can't happen no reason it shouldn't happen great conversation car appreciate it thanks congressman yeah appreciate being on always

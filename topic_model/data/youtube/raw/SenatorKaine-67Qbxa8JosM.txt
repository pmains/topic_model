6 45 now we're back and we told you we're all over the countdown to sequestration here at hampton roads and in washington and now we show you senator tim kaine is up early to talk with us live from capitol hill senator thank you so much for joining us you bet katie glad to be with you well you're not in newport news with the president today because you obviously have a lot of work to do there in washington house speaker john boehner said earlier he's waiting on the senate so are we going to see a vote tomorrow you're going to see a vote within the next uh 48 hours we have a plan on the table that uh the democratic leadership put on the plan before we went to recess that basically uh finds a year's worth of deficit reduction the same amount as the sequester but finds it in a balanced way targeted cuts rather than across the board cuts and revenues fifty fifty uh and then what that would do is get us through year end we're writing the fy twenty fourteen budget right now i'm on the budget committee we have a meeting today and then what we would do is we do the first year's worth and then let the normal budget process take over and that's so important congress has slipped away from normal budgeting and gotten into gimmicks like sequester the best way to make these decisions about spending taxes and deficits is part of the normal budget so we're going to have votes this week and it is my hope that we're going to be able to find some compromise we shouldn't give up on that we have to keep pressing a senator in the middle of this decision making prog process president barack obama is making a trip here to hampton roads he's going to be in newport news and republicans keep calling his trip a campaign stop what's your reaction to that um i completely disagree you know katie i was at the shipyard last tuesday i came down and i hope every member of congress and every senator you know goes to a shipyard or a military base or a va hospital and sees for themselves what the impacts of these cuts will be so when i was at the shipyard in newport news last tuesday or when i was talking to ship repairers the smaller ship repairs at a meeting in portsmouth i heard about people who are having to issue warn notices to 300 of their 450 employees at the shipyard you see what happens when maintenance gets deferred and then the whole schedule for the maintenance over the next few years gets messed up we can't afford to jeopardize our economy jeopardize people's jobs and and weaken our national security because congress won't work together so when the president goes and he's going to have congressman scott and congressman ridgel with him what it does is it shines a spotlight on the real consequences of congressional gridlock and i hope that will create a sense of urgency to find a solution now senator everyone is focused on sequestration hitting friday but to clarify will the cuts hit immediately or will they happen by the end of the month or kind of filter in you know there will be some that will be effective immediately so there's already companies that are issuing more notices to employees the dod just one piece of sequester sequestration is furlough of dod civilian employees ninety thousand in virginia are going to get furloughs that could start as early as the end of march and they could be furloughed as often as once a week for twenty weeks now these are employees i mean as an example i was at a an army hospital at fort belvoir uh that treats wounded warriors about two weeks ago and the wife of a wounded warrior said to me hey my husband's nurses are dod civilians that their their you know strong care is part of the way that he's going to get back to health and are they going to get furloughed this is a big deal and there's no reason we should let march one come without finding a path forward the elements of the compromise have been on the table for two years i think the right thing to do is find targeted spending cuts and find revenues as well so that we can reduce the deficit but do it in a smart way all right senator tim kaine live in washington thank you so much for joining us today so many people on edge because of sequestration hoping congress can reach an agreement soon again thank you absolutely

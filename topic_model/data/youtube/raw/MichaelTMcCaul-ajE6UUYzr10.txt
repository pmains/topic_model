i'll start with you mr winkowski cbp you know the allegations of border patrol agents cbp officers working with drug traffickers to facilitate their business is just unconscionable and you know the threat from a national security standpoint and you know that they're trying to infiltrate our organization i want to first start and ask you about your polygraphs that you do conduct with employees prior to employment if you can elaborate on what some of your findings have been in terms of these pre-employment uh screenings yes uh thank you very much mr chairman for that that question as i mentioned in my uh oral interview uh we've begun we began doing uh polygraphs uh um in 2008 and we've done about 10 000 polygraphs about 400 a month uh come uh january of 2013 under the anti-border corruption act that we're mandated to do all law enforcement officers and we will meet that mandate of 2013. matter of fact we'll meet that mandate sometime this uh this summer so this summer we'll have 100 percent of our law enforcement officers undergoing a a polygraph prior to uh coming on board as a uh as a law enforcement officer so of those ten thousand uh polygraphs that we've done um we we have uh discovered a whole host of of individuals that applied to be the border patrol agents or our customs and border protection officers and and and the polygraph was able to identify individuals that had a very very questionable past and let me just give you several examples mr chairman we had a case where between 2002 and 2009 applicant smuggled several bundles of marijuana within the united states was paid 200 on at least three occasions the applicant personally unloaded duffel bags of drugs from vehicles and stored them as as residents and and the applicant also accepted a thousand dollars in exchange for allowing vehicles loaded with marijuana to be stored at his home so the polygraph was able to uh identify that and and obviously the employee was not uh hired for for a law enforcement uh position um in another example in march of 2009 the applicant and a friend became involved in transportation of cocaine and marijuana the applicant's friend profited an unknown amount of the transportation of marijuana and he profited from 3 500 for the transportation of of the cocaine so we have these individuals that in some cases i i believe their sole purpose of of wanting to become a a customs and border protection officer or border patrol officers that infiltrate us and and and the way in which while we have robust uh background process while we have amsco type systems that i talked about in my oral reply and data mining and looking for anomalies we really believe that the polygraph is is going to be a real game changer for us um so we're we're ready for that uh we've been doing polygraphs but come this summer everybody undergo one i think one of the things also that both the you and the ranking family member has had talked about the national security positions uh i view the cbpos and and the border patrol agents as national security pro as national security positions and as such i think we need to take a different view of of that position so for example while we're starting the polygraph prior to their employment and weeding out those individuals that are deceptive our data indicates that really a a an officer goes uh um on the other side about 8.8 years into service so the question becomes well we have data mining and we're doing amp schools and doing looking for anomalies and we have the periodic reinvestigations every every five years i think we need to be looking at polygraphs throughout the employees career i i think that is a very very important and we'll work with the office of personnel management towards that end but i i couldn't agree more with what you said and mr keating said about the national security positions let me say i agree with you that it it really is a national security issue and i think the cases that you discussed in terms of pre-employment screening with polygraphs uh demonstrates that they are trying to infiltrate uh our law enforcement there are other law enforcement agencies that require post-employment polygraphs um and you and i talked about this yesterday can you tell me some of the hurdles because you know as a former public corruption prosecutor usually the corruption occurs after employment after they've been down on the border or points of entry where they're then corrupted by organizations with high dollar amounts to infiltrate the united states with drugs and human trafficking so can you elaborate on what would be the challenges and hurdles to require post-employment polygraphs one of one of the uh challenges that we have um is um um working through um the hiring policies uh that we have and and the office of personnel management and i'll make it very clear we have not approached the office of personnel management on this particular issue but but we will do that i have asked my staff to begin the process of of identifying what those hurdles are so you know the the anti-border corruption act clearly gives us the authority on the on the pre-employment um we need to work through internally with our personnel office as well as the office of personnel management to look at what it will take to do polygraphs from the standpoint of at the time of the periodic reinvestigations and in between those periods of time whether it's looking for reasonable suspicion or looking at more like a drug screening type of process where randomly we do polygraphs i think we have a lot to learn uh from from other agencies that that employ uh polygraph on a more uh routine basis and and we're gonna undertake uh that that endeavor well let me just say i'd like to work with you in cvp and i hope the ranking member would like to join me in this in terms of changing that policy and certainly if any legislation is required to look at making that change i think this is vitally important and i'll try to keep my time limited but mr duncan it turned into tsa allegations and indictments of tsa employees stealing personal belongings of passengers improper luggage screening which you know if we saw the latest attempt out of yemen to potentially smuggle a explosive device onto an airplane again a national security issue we can't afford to have corrupt tsa officers so what is tsa doing to to to address that sir there are three aspects to tsa's efforts to prevent and detect the kind of corruption that the committee is justly concerned about the first echoes what mr winkowski has discussed in terms of background checks to make sure that we're not hiring people into tsa who are going to be problems in the last three years our background checks have actually disqualified uh more than 5 600 applicants who were subject to criminal history checks financial checks and other mechanisms make sure that we're not bringing people in who have vulnerabilities the second aspect really has to do with prevention and we've undertaken various prevention initiatives in the wake of scenarios such as honolulu where we did determine that there was a large number of bags not being screened or subject to security and some of the working groups that we've we've created in the wake of honolulu have focused on identifying tools that local leadership can use to prevent and detect violations of our security protocols and i know there's some recommendations that they've come up with working in conjunction with our investigative office and those recommendations are focusing on on metrics and on other kinds of reports that can be used by field leadership um so that we can you know identify difficulties before they uh blossom into full-blown corruption now let me because my time is limited at 22 count indictment tsa employees took payments to provide drug couriers unfettered access through the los angeles international airport so drugs could be smuggled into the united states that is outrageous and really unacceptable i understand what you're trying to do pre screening as i understand it you mentioned a system a tracking system that you're implementing to basically a systematic tracking system to look at these this misconduct you have 400 different offices out there yet it's not integrated into one system uh i understand you're trying to develop that when do you anticipate that that will be completed i don't have a specific time for him for you sir but i know as a result of the ig audit that has recently been released that the tsa is working not just on coming up with a workable single definition of security breaches but to overhaul its reporting system so that security breaches are reported consistently that they're validated and that headquarters gets the information from all 450 airports so they can study it and come up with more comprehension what's the time frame when this would be completed um i'll have to get back to you on that sir okay i'd appreciate that and moving on to to ice accepting thousands of dollars in bribes to provide documentation you know ties to drug trafficking organizations this is exactly the kind of thing that terrorists want to exploit getting documentation to get into the united states uh and attack the american people again this is uh just really unacceptable what are you doing within ice to remedy this mr chairman we have a vigorous uh pre-employment screening process and a thorough background investigation to try to weed out those individuals you know on the front end of uh prior to employment subsequent to that uh it was constant uh all new employees go through ethics and integrity training we have an annual requirement take an integrity awareness program uh which is a policy for all employees to to kind of uh refresh uh responsibilities and roles of conduct the the all new supervisors um attend uh get a extensive integrity training at the ice academy as well as all law enforcement officers much more extensive integrity training we put out constant guidance regarding the the guidelines reporting employee misconduct oftentimes information is received from a from a co-worker or a colleague that sees that something is not doesn't seem right or they have actual information so we're kind of constantly going back and and educating the workforce and making sure that they know um what the standards of integrity what what the agency expects from them and and the proper ways to report that uh then then we i discussed briefly about we have offices located uh nationwide uh you know upon receipt of the allegation we are required to refer to the dhs oig and either maybe work in the investigation collaboratively with them but if they decide to uh not retain that for investigation referred back to our office and and you know we would address it as swiftly as possible and in conclusion um we need to move on i i didn't looked at some of your manuals there's really doesn't seem to be any any overarching policy within ice and there's no specific ethics policy for ice employees it's very very generic and i would ask that you maybe go back and look at that in terms of specific ethics policies that you could direct towards your employees a lot of this is just common sense though and you know as i said a public services of public trust and when you see that violated in in these egregious examples it's just unacceptable and again they're overall though the majority of employees are honest and hard working do a great job every day

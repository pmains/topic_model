thank you wow it's a pleasure I tell you we have had we have the youth the unity and the energy on our team and we're gonna win this election in 2018 now as many remember we were here a couple years ago and we went on I was honored to have your endorsement and we went on or to do our best and because of all the work that you put in all the contributions everything you did for our campaign we came very close we had forty nine point six percent of the vote and as Julie said if only twenty-one you know in all the 21 counties it's just 61 people switched from Tim to jim we win it was that close but you know it wasn't meant to be but I have to tell you that next morning we were in a tower election we were at our election party like 3:30 4:00 4:30 in the morning and it was a long night and we were disappointed but I woke up that next morning a happy American I woke up the next morning a happy American not because we didn't want to win and it wasn't important we did well I woke up happy because our race as important as it was wasn't the most important one on the ballot the most important race was the one for president in the United States and Donald Trump won and we've saved America you know if Hillary Clinton wins that election she stacks the Supreme Court with radicals who take away our basic liberties they turn us in to California basically move us back to those Obama type policies I don't know how we recover from that one and I got that going into that election and that's why I was always proud to say I supported Donald Trump and I encouraged everyone to because I truly believed that we would lose the country if he didn't win the way the forefathers put it together but we live to fight another day and that's why we're here today right we're ready to get going and you know when you think about it all that's done you made a great victory even though we came up short the great victory is that you transform this race from safe Democrat to the best GOP pick up opportunity in the nation and we're gonna get the job done for our party Oh No look around no hands but no Tim Walt's not on the ballot aim where he's gone doing something else I don't know what he's up to but we're gonna beat him at that too god bless him in all those Charles you know but you helped us also in these last year and a half or so since the election become a stronger campaign and I really appreciate it because of your contributions we raised six hundred and thirty seven thousand dollars thus far the most of any other candidate in the race by far we have three hundred and thirty thousand in the bank we're in a good position moving forward to the general election we also went out and worked the district as many people said we walked 54 aides and you were there walking the streets with us we went door-to-door we went to all the all the county fairs people like my friend Otto over there and from the Rice County Fair reading us and helping us introduce people we really appreciate that but we've worked very hard to try to unify this party going into this election and so we went out and we tried to get as many prominent national state local people to support our campaign and to have someone like congressman Tom Emmer who's a rising star in Washington a terrific guy support us means everything but also having icons in Minnesota it's like Senator Rudy Boschwitz congressman Gill guten ik Congressman John Klein that means a lot and in our friend Jeremy Munson and Bob Gunther and Bob Vogel and state senator Julie Rosen and state senator Draheim who's here and straight state senator Weber from Rock County having that type of support is awesome but let's move one step further I'm so humbled to have the support from chairs and county chairs of 18 of the 21 counties of this district it's working together is how we're gonna win this race in November now of course the biggest change is that walls isn't on the ballot the Democrats have lost a lot of that advantages of incumbency name ID things like that some of its wings to us but you know another part of that is I don't think the Democrats who are there in Lasorda day that kinda nominee but I don't think that they got the memo Tim Walz left for him on the way out I just happened to have a copy of it here and it said dear comrades [Laughter] don't forget to cynically take at least a few conservative positions and try to hang on to this Republican plus five seat best Tim there you go so and what I mean by that the Democrats trying to replace walls they're not following the malls model when he was running for Congress they don't want the interets endorsement they want to fight the NRA they don't want to stay away from single-payer in a district with the Mayo Clinic there they're all for socialized medicine they come out and they're openly for things like waters of the United States late term abortion transgenders in the military when you look at what these guys are running on these resistance candidates reminds you of what Ronald Reagan said about Walter Mondale these Democrats are so far left they've left America now by contrast and they've and they've done us a favor instead of muddying the waters like walls they've created a clear contrast the Democrats running for the seat want to resist President Trump they want to replace President Trump they want to return us to the Obama policies and then some that were failed and rebuked not just in southern Minnesota but across this country folks I'm on the other side I'm running for this seat to represent you to be a conservative reinforcements in the US House to partner with President Trump and like-minded colleagues in order to continue to make the big changes necessary to keep America safe to make America prosperous to protect our god-given rights and to sustain agriculture in our rural way of life some of the some of the policies that are most important to me that I would work on your behalf would be a peace through strength policy in the military with secure borders and protection from radical Islamists when it comes to the economy we have to reform the government more tax reform and make the code simpler fairer and flatter regulatory reform get rid of that Obamacare with free-market health care work for welfare which is something that I truly believe in merit-based immigration that's important and then US energy independence to keep the price of energy moving downward when it comes to our god-given rights the three that I think are fundamentally under attack in Washington that I would be out there serving for every day the right to life the right to keep and bear arms and the right to religious freedom and finally when it comes to agriculture in our way of life this is where it gets a little bit personal for me I was born in Blue Earth Minnesota where I reside today when I was a very young kid my parents moved over to Truman just outside Truman they had a farm my father grandfather and great-grandfather all southern Minnesota farmers those those years on the Truman farm were the best in my life I don't know how to say it had it made a profound impact on my life and when I look around the room and I see my my mother my sister the years that we spent on the Truman farm those were the best but there are people here delegates others who've supported us like Rachelle Krusemark from Truman tri Monteria l'enfer Shaw who I went to school with in Truman and Neal Breitbart who grew up fence row to fence row and 50 years we've known each other and it's that type of a background and the experience and the things that make it personal so yes we have to do everything we can to sustain agriculture to help our farmers to make sure our rural communities are ok I see over in Rock County where they lost 200 poultry jobs you know Albert Lee is losing its hospital in West Sica County lost 300 print shops this is happening all across this enormous pressure our smaller communities Rochester Mankato a lot of money flowing in there they're doing pretty good but I'd be somebody it would advocate for rural Minnesota and fight every day I'd like to serve on the egg from committee and that would be a major priority of the of the next two years in Congress oh well you know they say the third time's a charm and sometimes when you look at this race three times on the ballot you go well that seems like a lot of work but it's happened before the House of Representatives is filled with a lot of people that have had to go three and sometimes even more elections in order to get it done our neighbor to the north here John Kline who represented part of this district he had to run three times against bill Luthor congressman Peterson up in the seventh district actually ran five times for when I was working for stanlon so that's where I saw the perseverance thing and realized in a big district sometimes that's what it takes the most famous cases Newt Gingrich who actually ran three in a row but the third time has to be the charm also for our party and for our conservative movement this is the third time in the last hundred years that the Republicans in Washington have been given all the keys to the cars the House the Senate and the White House this is the third time really in our lifetime where we have an opportunity to make conservative change we did it under Ronald Reagan we did it under Newt Gingrich and now we have to do it under Donald J Trump this this is our best chance this is our time to make sure that we go out to Washington and we support our president we support our philosophy because if we make the big change necessary we can give our country another 20 or 30 years of life just like Reagan and the Republicans did in the 1980s folks you know where I stand I stand with you and you stand with America you stand with our president you stand with southern Minnesota I humbly ask for your vote for endorsement today let's unify this party and work all the way to November together let's win back the seat and restore America's greatness friends let's go get them [Applause]

here i wanted to bring in nikki because she's been waiting patiently i really appreciate you being on so nikki with her hr company uh is representing small business and we kind of talked about at the beginning but from your perspective any concerns if the mail ends up getting delayed because of political decisions at the top of this organization what would be the impact on small business locally owned business here in arizona and around the country yeah thank you congressman i'm happy to be here so this is nikki ramirez and you know i think when we take a moment to step back and look at just overall what's happening here it's the erosion of a trusted system right so of course when we see our mail carriers when i see mine every day passing through the neighborhood i know she's going to be there i trust that she's going to be there i don't worry about that but when we start to erode foundations that we never even thought of before right you know we just know that the u.s postal service is going to be there like we know our heart beats and the sun rises the postal service is running it's created this need for small business owners across arizona to take a step back and look at the way that they're doing business and say okay i am doing business with the us postal service not only because it's economical because it is the most economical way to to get your parcels out i recently co-authored a book i send every piece out through us mail it would be cost prohibitive for me at the price i sell the book at to send it out any other way and i trust the postal service to get it where it needs to go you know when we start to erode these trusted systems like sandra said it just creates like a funny thing in our mind right like as an hr person i talk about how people think all the time and it makes us worry where there doesn't need to be any worry at all small business owners are worrying that they'll have increased costs for getting their parcels out whether it is a notification that you're eligible for cobra benefits or a final paycheck that goes to an employee that does not have direct deposit on their account they've moved out of state they need their final pay we owe them that final pay by law we have a certain time to pay that final pay if i have to fedex that final pay sometimes the fedex cost is going to be more than the final check you know so if we get into these habits in our businesses our bottom lines will also erode with those trusted systems and so i think you know as small business leaders we have to look across the the landscape we have to remember that we build small business within our communities and our communities are built on things like trusted systems like the postal service we can't rely on fedex or ups or amazon to just do the right thing and we we just can't they're a for-profit company that operates in their own you know very large bubble and we know that if they decide to pull the plug on something we don't have any recourse there's you know there's nothing that we can say about it and we know on the other hand that if we do business with the postal service that there is an ethical proposition that's already been decided upon and so we know that we can trust the u.s postal service to get our important pieces where they need to be they're not going to drop off because they just decide to pull the point that's great

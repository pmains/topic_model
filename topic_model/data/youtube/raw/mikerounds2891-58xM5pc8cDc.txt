and i will now turn to senator rounds for five minutes of questioning thank you madam chair and and look for first of all let me just say thanks to ms vogel for uh taking the time to to speak with us today as well as our other two panelists um it your information is critical that we share it and that we look at ways to improve housing across this country for those individuals that simply don't have other alternatives ms vogel i'd like to thank you for taking the time out of your day to join us all the way from eagle butte in south dakota you may be familiar with a member of my personal staff kyle chase who is also an enrolled member of the cheyenne river sioux tribe he's also my chief legal counsel and he's been a real asset in terms of providing us with additional information about working through some of these issues but i want to begin by inquiring as to the unique vulnerabilities that native american communities face when it comes to housing safety ms vogel can you expand on the specific housing safety issues facing tribes today and how those issues differ from off reservation public housing thank you for that question senator rounds um the unique um threats that are uh facing our um our the safety of our families is of course one the rural isolation of our communities the response time for any first responders you know not having um fire fighting equipment stationed locally that's one another is the meth contamination of our units we have an epidemic of matthews in our tribal communities and the residual effects of the use of meth in our homes leaves our elders and our young children those with compromised health conditions in very vulnerable positions that is also a big concern of ours others is you know that the um overcrowding creates um a lot of stress on the house mold is a problem you know from just all the moisture in the house and not having proper ventilation um you know the the heat lack of heating and upgrades to keep up with um with the demand you know we we face you know serious problems with uh heating and cooling costs uh making you know families choose between you know do i pay my light bill do i pay my a heating bill or you know do i buy groceries so there's a lot of stresses because of the threats that uh face our families to ensure and and that aren't the same as what the others testify there isn't enough enough money to address every threat and so we too have to prioritize thank you ms vogel thanks for that i'd like to follow up a little bit you indicated earlier that uh chair smith and i have um promoted the re the reauthorization of the hazda and uh part of that is is the uh it reinstates the hud drug elimination program i am curious sometimes i don't think folks realize what an impact a meth house is or what impacts that has in terms of getting somebody new into a home that has had meth in the past could you talk just a little bit about what it takes to rehab a home where meth has been a problem yes that that is and that has been an increasing cost um you know when we discover when when we have a vacant unit we test that unit to see if it's a test positive for men so if it takes positive for math then it's the cleanup cost the remediation before we can even start to address the um rehabilitation of it but the condition of the homes that when there's meth use and um the behaviors of the tenants themselves is there's a lot of tenant damage to the unit and so you know we have gone into where we've had to strip the sheetrock down and because the holes in the walls we find dirty needles behind the the sheetrock and so we have to be very careful in in removing things um doors are missing uh there's broken windows so the there's just structural damage to the unit so you know when we go in we have to replace cabinets we have to replace vanities um doors we have to re-sheetrock they're just an extensive a lot of damage unfortunately because of the drug use and and the behaviors violent behaviors that come with that so we uh always have um ketchup so we try to do as many as we can you know throughout the year but at the end of the fiscal year we're carrying vacant units into the next year thank you for that and i my time has expired but i think you lay out some of the additional costs that maybe a lot of folks out there aren't aware of that go into trying to rehab a home that in the past worked but with someone on meth or using methane at home the type of damage that it does to the home and what it takes to to get it all put back together thank you very much for participating this afternoon

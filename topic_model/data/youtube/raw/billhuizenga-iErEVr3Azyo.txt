yield myself such time as I may consume gentleman is recognized for such time as he may consume Thank You mr. Speaker I rise today in support of my bill HR 685 the mortgage choice act as someone who has worked in the housing industry this is a very important issue to me and more importantly to all of our constituents across the country last year the FIDE mortgage or QM ability-to-repay rule has mandated by the dodd-frank wall street reform act went into effect nobody has a problem with that but the QM rule is the primary means for mortgage lenders to satisfy its ability to pay requirements additionally dodd-frank provides that a qm qualified Mortgage may not have points and fees in excess of three percent of the entitle loan amount as it's ambiguously defined currently points and fees include among other charges fees paid to affiliated but not unaffiliated title companies and amounts of insurances and taxes held in ask escrow as a result of this confusing and problematic definition many affiliated loans particularly those made into low and moderate income borrowers would not qualified as qms and would unlikely be made or would only be available at higher rates due to heightened liability risks consumers would lose the ability to take advantage of the convenience and the market efficiencies and choice offered by one-stop shopping I along with my good friend representative Gregory Meeks from New York reintroduced HR 685 a strong bipartisan bill that would modify and clarify the way that these points and fees are calculated the legislation is narrowly focused very narrowly focused actually to promote access to affordable mortgage credit without overturning the important consumer protections and sound underwriting required under dodd-frank's ability to pay provisions having been a licensed realtor and coming out of that industry it didn't it didn't take those of us who had been in the industry long to see that there was significant problems with the structure of what had led to the housing crisis in the last number of years and I tell the story often times my first closing that I did and where a check was slid across the desk across the table to the seller and then a check was slid across the table to the buyer and the client really didn't even know what to say it was the first time that they were starting to get into these zero down or even hundred and twenty percent loan-to-value zaz what was happening and I thought to myself this is not going to end well and and that is the case and we need to have it that tightened up system but I think it's important to know that that we have some issues with that dodd-frank provision this is one of those I do also believe mr. speaker that's important to note that when we first introduced this bill in 2012 in the last Congress it looks substantially different however working with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle I made the decision to make the changes necessary to gain their support of the legislation as a result it's been a truly bipartisan effort at every step of the way in the legislative process that is why this very legislation unanimously passed both the House House Financial Services Committee and the House of Representatives last Congress in fact as we dealt with this bill again the new bill HR 685 it passed out of committee 43 2 12 after I think some had decided that they were going to be against it after they were for it and it seems that the White House and others in in capitol hill and on Capitol Hill have decided that rather than taking care of consumers and rather than trying to make the bill work they've decided that it is a citadel that cannot be breached and not a jot or tittle of dodd-frank can be changed otherwise they label it as bailouts and helping out Wall Street and all these other things the real truth of the matter is mr. speaker is we are trying to make sure that real Americans can obtain the American Dream and buy and own their own home specifically our bill HR 685 would provide equal treatment for affiliated title fees and title companies and clarify the treatment of insurance held in escrow when things are held in escrow they don't belong to the owner they don't belong to the bank or the title company that's holding it all they are doing is holding them to then pay for those into that insurance bill that's going to be coming do they pay for the insurance or that or the property taxes that may be coming up and and what happens when someone writes that check every month they're putting a 12 of that total payment in every month into that escrow and it it just begs to be clarified while these common-sense changes will promote access to affordable mortgage credit for low and moderate income families and first-time homeowners by ensuring that a safer properly underwritten mortgages passed the QM test whether or not you support dodd-frank overall or specifically within this area it's clear the law is going to require some tweaks to ensure qualified borrowers aren't locked out of home ownership and the beneficial features of a qualified Mortgage the QM represents the safest best underwritten mortgage availability on the market it's the gold standard Mr Speaker we should want more people getting qms not fewer quite frankly this is something that we should all agree on and as I pointed out we did last term and our bill doesn't touch any of the CFPB's strict underwriting criteria it doesn't in any way suspend the legal a lender's legal requirement to determine that a bower borrower has the ability to repay that loan and mr. speaker this body has the opportunity to help more Americans realize a portion of that American dream as we talked about you know what the best part of it is mr. speaker we don't need to pass a grandiose law or decree all we need to do is work in a bipartisan manner and I think the American people are begging for that and here's an opportunity to do that we have done it and to reform a burdensome regulation that is negatively impacting our constituents is something that we should all strive for so I'd like to thank my colleague a representative Meeks along with many of the others on both my side of the aisle and the other side of the aisle that have worked tirelessly to help fix this flawed provision currently being implemented in dodd-frank I urge my colleagues to vote in support word of HR 685 and I may can help make the dreams their constituents come true in a reality by ensuring that all consumers have greater access to mortgage credit and more choices in credit providers reserve the balance of my time

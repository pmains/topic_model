Thank You senator Fisher thank you to all of you what a what a fun project this has been look let me begin by saying to my wife and to my best friend Melissa to our kids and our bus mates I don't know what the right word is for people you've lived on a bus with but Corrie and Alex and Breck to the volunteers and to the staff who by partnership and parade walking and prayer made this team of volunteers and campaign staff the best campaign Nebraska has ever seen and to my opponents thank you for a great campaign democracy in America is a beautiful thing we don't fight wars for succession when a king dies a free people freely choose their leaders by debate and today by ballot it has been a great privilege for our family to be a part of this process and it is a tremendous honor for me to be chosen by the people of Nebraska to follow Mike Johanns in the George Norris US Senate seat thank you this is simply the reason that we're here tonight to say thank you to the voters of Nebraska the farmers and the ranchers the moms and the dads the pastors and the teachers your vote has given me and our entire family a new calling a vocation to serve Nebraska and to serve this great Republic which we love and for that we are truly grateful and in Nebraska we show gratitude not just with our words but with our service and so I stand before you tonight to make three very specific pledges about how I intend to start serve first I commit to be about the big challenges before us for we do not have time for the small issues second I commit to focus on our duties for the long-term not to be obsessed with short-term popularity and third we commit to celebrate the enduring American beliefs that unite us far more than the policy debates that sometimes divide us for in our house we are grateful for America's glorious past and we remain optimistic about our shared future as Melissa and I committed the very first day of this journey more than a year ago we were not going to start thinking about commuting back and forth to Washington DC just to fiddle while Rome burns and that fire in the belly about the biggest challenges that face us has really been the story of this entire campaign I'll be honest we were a little bit ambivalent when we first started thinking about this we have loved the life that we have had at the college and we weren't looking for a new job but ultimately because of the crises that our country faces we decided that we were going to run but we were gonna do it with one big condition we were only gonna run if we could go big on ideas such that our campaign which started with 3% name ID would either catch fire or we were gonna fail in spectacular fashion and frankly we were ok with that one advisor to our campaign at the very beginning said I don't know about this Big Ideas stuff but I think that sounds like breaking your own ankles at the opening gun of a marathon he said in the cynical environment in which we live today you can't possibly run a campaign like that based on town halls we countered that the only reason anyone would conceivably think about living for 13 months on a smelly RV would be if you were gonna boldly fight to talk about American renewal and as time went on the phrase go big or go home became a daily battle cry of this campaign and you responded we are so grateful to Nebraskans not just because of the outcome of one passing election but more fundamentally because of the ways you repeatedly told us again and again that you want politicians in Washington who know that it isn't sufficient for us just to trim around the edges and if there is one great lesson of this election of 2014 tonight across the country it is this that the American people are desperate for real leadership they the American people the American people are sending a new majority to Washington tonight but they are not sending a new majority to Washington tonight for post office naming bills in January because it is no longer good enough for one party to use fake math to simply ignore the big problems we face it's also not good enough for the other party the party that I'm a part of to simply be against whatever President Obama is for and so my pledge tonight is that I want to stand with and engage and debate and wrestle together with the bigger issues that we face and we are going to keep on living by the go big or go home motto for the next six years in the United States Senate my second commitment relates to fighting for that next generation our children didn't get a chance to vote today but I believe that you elected me to serve on their behalf as well to propose what real long-term solutions to the entitlement crisis we face even in the face of short-term near-term unpopularity sometimes for doing the right thing for tomorrow's voters will not always seem popular today sadly in our current politics we are often obsessed with short-term popularity with permanent political incumbency but one of the great lessons that we've learned this last year-plus on this stage and on this campaign trail is that Nebraskans are actually much more comfortable with principled disagreements than with constant finger in the wind attempts to pander and be popular stated differently we know that there are gonna be times when we're gonna take votes that many Nebraskans might disagree with me on and I'm okay with that but I want you to know as my bosses that I will always seek to vote my conscience even if it might be against the stream for a time and as importantly I prej pledge that I will always try to explain why we voted the way we voted even when we disagree for I want to be accountable to you for you are the bosses third and finally I pledge that we will spend our time not merely debating policy but more often celebrating the Nebraska work ethic and the enduring American beliefs that unite us for when you listen to Nebraskans in our town halls at church picnics walking into Memorial stadiums as you tour people's businesses and farms and ranches all Nebraskans know that the policy differences between right and left between Republican Democrat Republican and Democrat are not nearly the most important issues we talk about as a people what we need to remember is that there are far more things that unites us as a people centering on our commitment to leave a great and free and opportunity filled country to the next generation I'm a rookie at this but I believe one thing that we heard clearly and my family across the campaign trail these 93 counties is that Nebraskans believe too often political campaigns emphasize our policy differences at the expense of all of our shared ideals and the American idea is not chiefly about some particular outcome for DC bureaucrats it isn't about a particular tax rate it isn't about a specific regulation that is rescinded or promulgated it's rather a celebration of the value of life it's a cherishing of our Liberty and it's an acknowledgment of the sources of our true happiness the fount of which is not in the federal government I'd also like to speak directly tonight to those of you who didn't vote for me and to you I say we didn't get you on our side this time and that's okay I hope to be a good senator for you too for I want to spend the next six years as Mike Johanns has and as Deb Fischer does working as hard as possible for you and your kids too - but that's what Nebraskans do we occasionally argue about specific policy but we agree about most of the things that really matter protecting the American identity and reaffirming the Nebraska work ethic that made this state in this country great we we had a reporter with us at one point on the bus along the way and my daughter Alex said to this reporter we want all the votes you were right that is what we wanted that's how we want to communicate we want to talk with and listen to everybody we set on primary night that we might not win every vote but we were gonna seek to speak to every Nebraska heart and that's what we made such a concerted effort in this campaign to reach out to Hispanic voters by going to places like Lexington and South Omaha not just talking but spending a lot of time listening and learning and you know what we found out we found out that the paradigm created by the national media is really not reality the way the national media reports the only thing Hispanic voters and citizens supposedly care about is immigration policy well that simply is not what we heard on front porches we talked together about jobs we talked together about getting our kids great education and we talked about trying to build opportunity for everybody we talked about the American dream for everybody of every race of every ethnicity of every national origin of every socio-economic class and of both political parties we tried to go to neighborhoods that Republicans don't usually go to and we talked and we listened and we got to know each other my party needs to get better at sending messengers who can stand on their principles and yet who also want to articulate a shared vision of the American dream for everyone and and so tonight I say amigos creo in El sue√±o americano juntos podemos crear una bien teh incall todos tengan mas oportunidad A's that is the vision of America that I pledge to preserve and fight for we're all racists and all ethnicities and both political parties are a necessary component to fighting to secure our shared future Nebraskans know that weight makes our country great is not it's government it's our people Oh Alexis de Tocqueville came to America in the 1830s to try to explain American dynamism not only economically but culturally to Europeans and when he got here he was supposedly gonna write home about how government made us great instead he ended up writing a 1500 page book report on the rotary he wrote about American volunteerism he talked about local community about families about town hall meetings and he described how the greatness of America doesn't Center on our central government but it centers on a free people who build community together out of a heart of gratitude Washington DC does not make America great and all of the time we spent on the campaign trail I never once heard anyone tell us that they thought NASA could build a better iPhone than Apple we never once had anyone say that they wished IV operated more like the DMV and no one ever said they wish the Sunday sermon sounded a little bit more like traffic school Nebraskans know that bureaucrats in Washington can't make better healthcare decisions than doctors and nurses and patients and families that advocate for each other the signers of our declaration didn't plethora pledged their lives and their fortunes and their sacred honor so that the federal government could helicopter parent of free people America is a place where our people across the country accomplish far greater things for their families in community than any government could ever do and our government which obviously has some fundamentally important duties and we need to say that more clearly our government performs best when it is seeking to empower of free people so that they might flourish and I have some good news Nebraskans all across this state remain optimistic about the future of our country but it is precisely because we believe that the most important things in life happen and are built in here in Lincoln and an alliance and in Chadron and in Norfolk and in Fremont not in Washington DC that's the good news but insofar as there is some concern insofar as there's anxiety amongst us it consists in this it's the fear that the government in Washington no longer cherishes the fundamental American idea that our politicians and our civil servants are no longer sufficiently humble but they believe that they can mandate how a free people in the flyover States ought to live their lives and that's not what America is about it's time for our leaders in Washington DC to become optimistic again about us as a people about what we can accomplish and build together in our local communities we need to recover and rediscover and remember and reaffirm the greatness of that American spirit for this freedom and the grand purposes to which it should be put is not transmitted through the bloodstream it's not in our DNA it's something that we teach it's something that our kids learn and we must constantly retell the American story to the next generation and so we want to tell you thank you for retelling the great story of America to us again and again and again across 93 counties for 13 months this year and that and that American optimism is what I pledge to recite back to you and to be celebrating with you every single day for the next six years as your senator thank you

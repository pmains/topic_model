you thank you Congressman Biggs for putting this forum together I think it's very important I do not believe that the majority has given us enough time to discuss issues of importance like this to our nation's veterans I'd like to focus my remarks today on our veterans access to care and to their choices our policy should be centered on the veteran and not on red tape in my opinion as a combat veteran myself with 11 years Act of 17 Reserve including three deployments into a Iraq and Kuwait I understand the importance of Quality Health Care and accountability within the VA both my my father was a veteran World War II veteran Korean War veteran my brother was also a veteran um so you know I understand uh what it means one of my top priorities in Congress has been advocating for the veterans in my district and Nationwide by demanding more access to Quality Community Care transparency and accountability I've also made it a priority to stand up for both the veterans and those currently serving on active duty who have had their careers ruined and due to President Biden's disastrous covet vaccine mandate now that Biden has admitted that the pandemic is over the vaccine mandates must be rescinded immediately you know every religious exemption must be approved right now and as it is having a disastrous effect on both military Readiness and Military morale you know as everyone here knows military recruitment numbers are way down wait times and issues in the VA are way up and Biden has been chipping away at president Trump's effective reforms which expanded quality Community Care in the VA including the important reforms that were passed by Congress in the missions Act when Congress and President Trump passed the bipartisan Mission act in 2018 it was a vital step to ensuring Americans who defend the United States can access Quality Medical Care after leaving the military however the implementation of the mission act by President Biden has been a disaster and the bureaucratic process has ramped up over the past two years due to his administration's priority of retaining patients within the VA instead of prioritizing what is best for the veteran the VA according to their own data only covers 38 percent of medical procedures that our vets actually need Community Care is not more expensive and helps the VA fill gaps in their coverage in my own District the average wait time for our veterans to get care through the VA is between 22 and 44 days and that is only counting the wait time from when an appointment is actually scheduled you know that doesn't mean the time when you actually ask for an appointment to when you actually get an appointment I hear from veterans all too often that it takes even longer just to schedule an appointment add to that the average wait time numbers provided by the VA and you could have months of waiting for vets in my district to get the care they need I had a vet come in my office and he said um you know I called for an appointment in February and finally got one just a general practitioner appointment in September foreign places like my district where Drive times to VA facilities can be prohibitively long more flexibility should be provided for access to local private practitioners thank you again Congressman Biggs for holding this important hearing and now I would like to direct a couple of questions to Mr selney Mr selnick under President Biden keeping veterans within the VA system appears to be their top priority instead of expanding options for Community Care would you agree with that assessment yes I would the uh besides anecdotal evidence from providers telling me this themselves it's in the foia documents where there are specific instructions and perform performance measurements of reducing in community care so it's it's a fact uh why do you think that is because that just doesn't seem like the way it should be I mean you know having proper and and the best care we can possibly give to our veterans I think should be the number one priority here not simply keeping a veterans facility open to keep it open I mean is there something behind that that depending on who I talk to a number of things plus the testimony from under secretary um a veterans Health the poos but the bottom line is this is mostly coming from management and management the Community Care budget and the facility budgets are two two separate budgets but each year each facility gets its money based on how many veterans they can count as using the facility and every specialty and as more veterans use in community care and less victims use the facility they're concerned about how much money is going to come to their facility and and the VA Management's concerned about how much money Congress is going to give to the va's facilities so that is their major concern it's about keeping their budgets and keeping their staff um rather than having good health care the the providers themselves are actually getting in trouble oftentimes for putting veterans in community for long wait times and the operations have really Fallen apart since covert had not recovered and providers tell me that some of them are telling me they're seeing as he was six patients a day six patients a day which is one of the reasons why their wait times are so I mean that that is the big big problem um it is it is all about um uh saving the institution and not saving the budget I think they have their priorities uh mixed up there I think it should be about saving the vet

uh thank you mr chairman i'd like to turn the focus back to our children you know my husband and i have five our uh our oldest is 27 our youngest is six and over the years i've noticed how technology has been increasingly designed to capture their attention the more time my first grader spends scrolling through an app the less time she is playing outside or enjoying face-to-face interactions with us google and facebook are not only doing a poor job of keeping our children under 13 off of youtube and instagram as my colleagues have already mentioned today but you are actively onboarding our children onto your ecosystems with apps like youtube kids facebook messenger kids and now we're hearing instagram for kids these applications introduce our children to social media far too early and include manipulative design features intended to keep them hooked mr pachai when a child finishes a video on youtube or youtube kids does the next video automatically play by default and i think this one is a yes or no sorry i was muted uh congresswoman i have children too i worry about the time they spend online and i agree with you it's an important issue yes we design youtube the autoplay function by default that's a yes on the main app it is there and for each video there's a easy on off toggle users have preferences the default setting is yes um when a user who is predicted to be a teen is watching a youtube video are the number of likes displayed by default yes or no please uh on all videos i think we do have uh across all videos we have great and mr zuckerberg will the recently uh reported instagram app for kids have endless scroll enabled yes or no sorry uh congresswoman we we're not done finalizing what the app is going to be i think we're actually still pretty early in designing this but you know i i just want to say that are you not are you not sure or you're not sharing features um because or and look another feature of concern is the filter that adds an unnatural but perfect glow for my ten-year-old to apply to her face is that feature going to be part of instagram for kids congresswoman i i don't know i haven't discussed this with the team yet well you know i look i please expect my office and many others to follow up given what we know about instagram's impact on teen mental health where you know we're all very concerned about our our younger children and you know just uh i just want to speak mother father for a moment fathers because leading experts all acknowledge that social media sites pose risks to young people inappropriate content over sharing of personal information cyber bullying deceptive advertising the list goes on and those risks are exacerbated with more time uh children spend in these apps and mr pachai you mentioned that you have children uh and that i've also read you limit their screen time what do you say when one of your children doesn't want to put their phone down uh congressman the struggle is the same particularly through covet it's been it's been hard to moderate it and i do take advantage of the parental controls and the digital well-being tools we can limit the time on their apps and so we have provisions in place i don't mean i don't mean to cut you off mr pachai you know but the last thing overworked parents need right now especially right now are more complex to do's which is what parental controls are i mean they need child centric design by default mr zuckerberg i understand your children are younger but when they start using social media what will you say when they're craving their tablet over spending time face to face with you or with friends well congresswoman we haven't gotten to that point yet but we're designing all of these tools we design messenger kids that the parents are in control i think we've proven that that can be a good and safe experience and i think that was one of the things that that made us think that uh we should consider doing this for instagram as well by having it so that um we have a parent-controlled experience um and as you say child i am going to reclaim my time only because connecting with others uh is one thing adding filters no breaks for uh for kids to take um and you know manipulating the design of these apps for our children is is another look this committee is ready to legislate to protect our children from your ambition you know what we're having a hard time reconciling is that while you're publicly calling for regulation which by the way comes off as incredibly decent and noble you're plotting your next frontier of growth which deviously targets our young children and which you all take great style great strides with infinite infinitely more resources in protecting your own children this playbook is familiar as some of my colleagues have already pointed out it's the same tactic we saw from alcohol companies and big tobacco stardom young and bank on them never leaving or at least never being able to but these are our children and their health and well-being deserve to take priority over your profits general ladies time has expired

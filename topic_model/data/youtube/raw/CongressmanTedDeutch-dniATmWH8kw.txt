thanks everyone for joining I appreciate everyone tuning in this early I'm pleased were able to make this work and to do it from a safe distance I'm grateful to all my self Florida colleagues for joining as well I'm not going to take a long time we have great speakers I want you to hear from South Florida residents who have been struggling with the state unemployment system for weeks and for months according to data published by the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity one point for two million Floridians to file the unique out of ployment claims but only half of those claims less than half have been paid that means that hundreds of thousands of Floridians who lost their jobs and their incomes because of this deadly virus are still waiting for checks and for answers these are families who are just trying to manage they're trying to manage distance learning for their kids they're trying to put food on the table Congress came together to to do its part we all did our own part and staying home and finding a curve to save lives but that took a tremendous toll on Floridians who lost their jobs and needed that assistance when they first apply we passed the cares Act on March 27th we knew that it was only going to get worse got employed Americans which is why we provided the three major unemployment benefits the extra $600 on top of the paltry 275 the state provides the thirteen additional weeks for those who've already exhausted their state benefits and for the first time extending benefits to Gig workers contractors and self-employed workers but there are two problems one the state isn't processing these claims fast enough and two we can't even tell what part of the cares Act benefits are being paid in short Congress was there there for Florida's unemployed but governor de santis hasn't been there are a whole host of questions about how the state handled these claims whether Floridians are getting the correct amount of people eligible for federal benefits or even giving them we these hundreds of thousands of fer idioms waiting for their benefits won't be able to participate in any reopen economy right away they're still tightening their belts withdrawing on savings they're using funds they save for retirement every Floridian waiting for their benefit to arrive is one less potential customer for our local store and restaurant when it reopens and for those business owners who have struggle to stay in business they'll obviously need all the business they can get every day my office hears from hundreds of constituents who are deeply frustrated their applications are pending or they've been denied as specific questions they try to call to get answers but it takes hours or days to get through and then they get conflicting information between what the governor says and what the d EO says the d EO spent over a hundred million dollars to make changes to the system and still hundreds of thousands people are still waiting we we know the system is broken we just don't even know how badly it's broken governor DeSantis owes the public honest answers of what they can when they can expect their benefits instead of spending all this time trying to figure out what happened to the unemployment system the governor needs to get Floridians who are waiting the assistance that they need we've helped with the cares Act but the governor is number one he's the governor and he's left hundreds of thousands of Florida's families desperate and frustrated and angry this is a failure of leadership period we want to help but the governor needs to lead and with that I again appreciate everyone being on the call I'd like to invite congressman Hastings to say a few words I'll see I'll see if you're on you can unmute if not congresswoman Wasserman Schultz please write Eddie you're kept on mute thank you about that as I said I want to thank my colleagues for organizing this important alarm-bell that we are continuing to sound on the crisis that exists in Florida with our unemployment compensation compensation system being completely broken and a governor who is unwilling to fix it the starters most calls and in my office since this crisis started are still desperate frazzled Floridians trying to get jobless benefits Mike and you know we are not the officials at the federal level who can help them directly with that yeah yeah every single day in spite of that panic there is some spit out your coffee story tied to the state's unemployment system this week there were conflicting messages by Governor DeSantis MDE Oh official that currently is in charge of it on whether applicants need to log into the flawed connect system every two weeks the plan benefits experts are recommending to do it just to be safe but no one is clear and directions are not being provided specifically state senator Jason Rizzo a state senator who covers part of my congressional district just shared unreal messages from inside the de / call centers the new call centers that governor de santis was supposedly standing up to help with processing jobless claims where new inept supervisors interact with powerless workers who essentially can do nothing to help the people process their claims and they leave desperate callers with no health yet the callous and inept response from our governor manages to outweigh people even more everyday DeSantis incompetence and mismanagement triggers mass misery among struggling families who can least afford it he'd bungles the daily operations of the DDL sure but the worst part is that he ignores the long-term problem there the unemployment relief that florida managers provide makes it america's cellar dweller and we are still not able to fully process and provide the pandemic unemployment assistance that Congress provided to make sure that we had Titan and lead that safety net so that there are not holes through which people are going to fall where among the lowest in the nation when it comes to the length and level of benefits yet the Santis still refuses to do anything to address that even though he has the power under Chapter 252 to do that and of course the Santa wants to lay these problems at the feet of his Republican predecessor and Senator Scott certainly deserves a lot of the blending for how we got here and he should also by the way be glad he's not on the ballot because I'm sure he being tossed very quickly for the nightmare that he set up but um at the end of the day the reason that he did that was to falsely inflate his own jobs numbers the Santa's though owns this blog quagmire the buck stops with you he's in charge and he owes it to all civilians to provide swift relief and real reform of the system if this coronavirus will not be defeated in a few months people are gonna need assistance well into next year and DeSantis cannot continue this pattern of callous indifference and incompetence the numbers are bone-chilling when I see 222,000 new plans were filed in Florida alone now we've got just under 700,000 people who have received benefits more than that are still awaiting to get them and three hundred and thirty thousand people have didn't reject it and he's there telling people to reapply but this is an endless vicious cycle of callous indifference and incompetence that has to be fixed the Santas needs to be bring real confidence and manpower to bear and he needs to raise and extend benefits not tomorrow not next week but now Thank You Ted you have to unmute one good turn deserves another it does sing if there rose paying attention we have a lot of people who have nine o'clock so I'm gonna go to Jessie I'll introduce you in a second then the members who need to leave and dr. Holman needs needs to leave we'll try to give everyone an opportunity before you do Jessie seeking of Pompano Beach was for a little March 23rd his employer asked him to wait to apply for benefits he did on April 13th and is still waiting to receive those benefits Jessie thanks for joining us hi guys good morning can everyone hear me huh yes we can alright thank you so much and thank you congressman Deutsch thank you guys for having me and for inviting me today's morning meeting um yes just exactly as you said I was furloughed due to Kovac 19 my brother actually tested positive he resides with me I was a former resident of Boca actually were where I was employed with my previous employer I now live in Pompano Beach from March 23rd um wall was furloughed I tried everything possible I think like that be touched anyone in the line of unemployment until I see who I was able to get through with a callback number just was perilous just had nothing that they can offer just but they were able to call you back maybe once every so often but with no option for helping you unlock a claim or tell you why the claim is pending to verify identity so two weeks after being furloughed two weeks after I resubmitted my claim again again through the FedEx took that option I know may have not been the right route but I did whatever was possible I was also able to get in touch with district 92 with um Patricia Williams the Hearst legislative assistant Natalie Charles which I'm sure you guys have met with Patricia before great office she was able to send over information as well just as your office did for me to try to get information which also didn't work so as of now approximately five weeks later I still have a pending claim that's locked I don't know what lock means but I've done everything from faxing letters over to calling on a daily basis with the same result just no money and no income coming in so at this point feels like it's two months in of no chance of seeing unemployment benefits and obviously note I believe I'm not returning back to my company after this I was firmly let go after being furloughed for that amount of time so you know that's pretty much my situation right now it's pretty much a waiting game and leaving it up to the hands of whoever reviews my my form at some point sorry there we go so I couldn't thanks thanks very thanks very much for joining us this morning if you can stick around to answer questions it shouldn't have to be a waiting game left up to some unknown person the whole purpose of unemployment benefits are to help people when they need them so appreciate your being here and next I represent of shillelagh is on the Rules Committee and needs to head to the floor so we can prepare the heroes Act but represent later please thank you very much representative Deutsch Social Security is not a new program it's been around since 1935 it was established exactly four major crises like this and we're not getting calls to our offices we're getting cries people are weeping on the phone because they can't get access to the UI system there is no excuse the governor is playing with the data even here we have no idea what checks people are getting people are calling my office isn't saying they got a two hundred and seventy five dollar check but they didn't get the six hundred dollar check our data doesn't tell us how inefficient and inexcusable this system is in Florida and the governor is responsible thousands of Floridians thousands of people in my own district our unemployed have applied for UI benefits and and like Jesse they can't get information they haven't gotten their checks and they're desperate and we're pleading yelling jumping up and down screaming their behalf we've done our job the money is there the state needs to get it out and there's no excuses that are acceptable when people in our community are hurting when they don't have the money to buy food for their children they don't have the money to pay their rent or to pay their mortgages but more importantly it's their money we've brought this money back to Florida this tax money that they paid in over the years and they deserve to get it back since 1935 we've had a UI system there's no excuse for Florida not to be delivering these checks to the people of Florida thank you very much thanks for gelila next we'll go to my doctor Steven almond who is the department chair and professor of health management policy of the University of Miami Steven specializes in among other things economics and health care policy dr. almond please morning thank you very much representative joy and actually and let me thank you Jesse because you're indicating some of the issues that we're seeing out there one of the areas that we're looking at is trying to open up our economy again and opening up our little local stores in the state of Florida the realization is that we're sitting now with the labor force that was ten point three million in the economy but now as of this morning there are two million claims for unemployment and again as indicated less than a third of them are currently getting their benefits but let me talk to you about how this affects in terms of the retail market as well so we are talking about reopening the economy but unless you have demand for those providers you're not going to have any opening of the economy you need people in demand things so the stores can stay open and that's one of the issues going on right now you can look at it in terms of a of a almost a snowball affected you can get things going if you can get people with their unemployment checks purchasing stuff let me give you an example just called the multiplier effect if I now get some benefits and I go out now and again I have kids and I take my kids to get their haircut because they have not had their hair cut for a while that barber shop now has economic activity in the barber shop now has to hire an additional barber and that barber goes out now and says I need to buy some fish for my kids at the local aquarium the aquarium hire individuals and the purpose people who are hired by the aquarium go out to the sub shop for lunch and the sub shop now has to hire additional workers and they have to hire people to deliver and so delivery people are hired and they go then to get coffee at the convenience store on their way to make their delivery and on and on and on this is the multiplier effect if you can get things going with these people now in there benefits in purchasing initially in the economy you start opening up and growing the economy store by store by store and consumer by consumer my consumer that's what you want to get going that's the multiplier thing thanks very much it's exactly the point as the governor continues to talk about reopening the economy Steve we we're very appreciative of your your insight because the point is aside from the fact that represented shillelagh said that everyone who's applied is entitled to receive for all the people who are telling to receive it they should be getting these these payments it also has well have a profound impact on the state as a whole and I don't understand why this isn't more of a priority in getting this fixed and giving people what they need next representative Debbie McCall Powell I think is on line Debbie are you are you with us yes can you hear me I can't yes please alternate overview thank you good morning everyone thank you so much congressman Joyce for putting this together look this we've had several of these press conferences and we have all been sounding the alarm now for weeks since we passed the cares Act it's been it we did that too at the $600 benefit to include gig workers and independent contractors and like my colleagues have mentioned we are receiving those are the calls that we're handling on each of our offices every single day hundreds of calls asking for help because they cannot get they're either denied gig workers and independent contractors cannot get their applications process people are not receiving the benefits that they need and they can't pay for their food and for their rent and that was the main purpose of the economic relief cares Act now we conducted a survey which I release the results yesterday asking my constituents to provide details on their experience applying for benefits through the FDA oh and the survey results made it very clear that the system in place is completely dysfunctional it's inadequate for those that are trying to apply for an employment benefit specifically we surveyed almost 4300 people and almost 88% of them almost 98% said they were highly and very unhappy with the FTOs handling of the sharp increase in unemployment due to the pandemic and nearly 90% listed their application experience as very negative so this the survey results really confirm what we already know we're discussing here that the Florida's unemployment system is a complete disaster like congressman Deutsch we have absolutely no leadership from this governor he's had weeks to fix the system and he's had several state senators and congressional delegation that is willing to do whatever it takes to help Floridians accents these benefits now today we're gonna be voting on legislation that actually enhances unemployment benefits then were also including hundreds of millions of dollars to support unemployment systems across the country so we would like to see the governor take swift action so that he can put the structure in place again there are experts all over the country the governor of Rhode Island was just talking about what she had to do to fix an unemployment system in her state and she got private companies tech companies to come in a sister and they have fixed that system very rapidly I would suggest the governor to maybe give her a call and see what she did to fix her system but with the millions of dollars that were passing today the heroes Act he can hire staff and to do whatever it needs to bolster our unemployment results in the state of Florida hope I'm hopeful that we're gonna be passing with as a station later today and that the Senate will put partisan politics aside so that they can do what is right for communities and pledge this has this much needed aid for our communities in Florida so that we can get back on track great thanks very much my personal towel we'll hear from just to know we'll hear from congressman hastings next and then and then out or welcome to you too SLC thanks so very much for doing this I don't know about in your respective offices or I have talked with some of you but calls that we are getting from people that are in pain or seeking our unemployment compensation and they have been for quite some time some of them staying on the computer for protracted periods of time into the morning and not being successful and then the other thing is this stuff runs out in 12 weeks and they pretty much right back where they started from now my honest assessment is oh and I think you put it best all congressman thought when you said it that nevermind about who's that Blaine let's fix the thing you know and I can't believe that a state as resourceful as ours or cannot pull in the necessary people or to address flaws in the Florida and adequate unemployment benefits system and there's no question that everybody feels that it's down we have leaden written letter after letter or trying to get an understanding and to prod them and to tell them I've even turned to my state senator Perry Thursday who most of the cases our districts overlap and most of the cases are people that he can address in the state system but everybody that's calling him we are getting hundreds literally of our calls about this and people feel very strongly or that the whole government is not working and that is not a good thing it's quite simply unacceptable I will continue to urge the governor to make the changes necessary to get benefits to those who are desperately in need all that have been denied or are still waiting for their application to be processed by the state's overwhelmed sister I stand as this delegation does and you have demonstrated that tear to assist the governor should he choose to exercise his authority to make the long overdue overhaul of this broken system including expanding access to these benefits there the reality is that every single day that Floridians have to wait to receive unemployment that is a day too long we are working actively and assiduously in this regard and I demand as a citizen of the state that people be treated better than they're being treated in this particular tranche of money all and I'm saddened by the fact that the people who need it the most seem to take the shaft the most thank you thanks representative Hastings next up we'll hear from an Alvin torment of deerfield beach Alvin works as a limo driver he applied March 29th for unemployment benefits and and it's done many weeks without a paycheck still waiting on the state Alvin keep it please share your experience with us i if you could you might be are you muted you done all right without yeah all right we're going we're gonna go out Jason from my office will be in touch to figure out what's wrong with your connection and in the meantime we'll go to congresswoman Wilson Freddie good morning I represent district 24 in miami-dade County the district lines were designed and drawn by fair districts a democratic organization and consequently we are the most suffering district in the nation not the state the nation number one in everything the most hiv/aids cases the most koban 19 cases the least testing the most unemployed than these access to unemployment compensation the least access we suffer and I'm always angry you could call me an angry black woman who is screaming to date or help the struggling Democrat Democratic district 24 it's very very poor people african-americans and every day my office is flooded with desperate pleas from people crying out from help for everything they're having difficulty they've lost everything their jobs their healthcare they're losing their cars and will lose their homes and they cannot navigate the state's unemployment system I tried to call the governor with no success so I recently wrote the governor a letter urging him to make much-needed improvements to the unemployment system specifically I asked him to hire more representatives to help applicants navigate the unemployment website I asked him to overhaul the website so applicants can efficiently navigate the system without technical difficulties I asked him to increase the weekly state benefits from the current 275 dollars I asked him to implement clear guidelines for applicants to x axis expanded unemployment benefits provided under the Care Act I asked him to allow self-employed and gig workers to exit the state employment benefits and to retro actively provide benefits from the date applicants lost their employment well businesses are preparing to reopen next week many of our unemployed workers will still be without jobs and I asked him to hear my cry hear my plea governor set is on asking you today to do your job Karen Wilson thank you very much for your powerful words I think that we're gonna go to congresswoman Frankel next and then now it sounds like we just about having back so cumbersome when Frankel please hello as you might need to unmute you know you would think I would have learned that by now anyway thank you thank you everybody good to be with you good morning and thank you for putting this together here so you know like like my colleagues our office has been flooded with calls of people crying desperate for help I want to tell you a story of a young woman who called me personally yeah she's an she's an adult but she called me back her mother a mother who has been working since age 15 is has her own house housekeeping business and you could imagine that that business has really gone away over the last several weeks anyway I thought both what's their job and you know this woman who's now about 45 years old had never in her life had her hand out for any kind of charity at all and she was when her when her daughter checked in on her she was actually too embarrassed to tell her that she had run out of food there were thousands and thousands of people like that here in Florida who have been working their entire lives and now we're unemployed I no fault of their own and you know it was it was bad enough that we had a bearing least stingy system that was designed not to work now he's just become plain cruelty it is just plain cruelty not to be able not getting these benefits out to workers and I just want to urge you know my message of the governor is you know I I know you trying to do so we openings around this state but we all know this the virus is not going away anytime soon we are headed towards more and more unemployment only some jobs will come back and please the governor should not do should not divert your attention away from the thousands of thousands of desperate Floridians who need to be able to pay their bills to buy their food and I join my colleague representing Marshall Powell and saying that I you know we're all here in Washington the members of Congress were here in Washington we're going to vote force more needed benefits to for our constituents and challenge our the Senate to follow our lead with that I yield back Thank You congressman do it before we continue I just want to remind everyone if you'd like to ask a question please use the chat function to message the host or email Jason thank you Jason thanks Lois thanks very much thanks for your comments and thanks for being a linear leader on this from the start al I think we can do we have you my audio now well and you can you hear me perfect yes thank you so much okay thank you very much come to indict for for holding this meeting I'm I don't have a tremendous amount to add because you've heard this story thousand sort of many thousands of times but the website is impossible it is getting better but that's the only good part about it but I have been denied or declared ineligible three different ways first way with not even that had no excuse at all just ineligible then it was told I was not eligible because I did not have enough income and when your have no income then you don't have enough income and and I don't even remember now what the third one yet so right now it just happened yesterday I just looked on the website I have applied twice like anybody who applied before April 1st had to do which is silly enough and I also applied through the P way I think the first one was because I'm a self-employed that I was not eligible for normal unemployment benefits but I reapplied for the PUA and I'm still going through the same thing I'm trying to be patient and I just have no idea what else like to do so I again I appreciate you and and all your colleagues for having this meeting and hopefully pressure will help well Ally I appreciate your joining us I'm sorry that you have to go through this I'm sorry Jessie you have to go through this and and the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of Floridians who have families who are impacted by this who who aren't eligible to access the benefits that that you're entitled to the additional benefits that Congress passed this is not will go to questions in one second I'll just make the point that all of us know this is not the first call like this we've done we've sent letters we have offered to help we have most of us on the most emember of Congress have reached out personally to the governor's office seeing what we can do to be helpful we're all in this together but while it's it's perfectly well and fine to think about whether or not we're going to be able to have Major League Baseball take place in our state as the governor was ruminating on just earlier this week that's that's not what's on the minds of Floridians we want to know why Jesse and Al and hundreds of thousands of other people do not have access to the unemployment benefits they deserve so with that Jason please go ahead thank you our first question comes from Alex tardy hey thanks for doing this wanted to ask you know I know understand the issues with the state system but are there any additional federal benefits that you think are necessary that need to be passed in Congress now to help alleviate the unemployment crisis nationally and in Florida and if so what do you think can be reasonably agreed to by all sides in Washington given that I know the heroes Act likely faces and I'll fill battle in the Senate and likely Beto from the president I have thoughts I've been talking a lot I'm happy to defer to my colleagues first on this Debbie or Lois or Freddy here I'll just briefly say that the heroes Act which you know don't count don't count it out yet I mean it's a framework for negotiation and we do have additional assistance lengthening the time in which we are going to weave that safety net of the PUA the pandemic unemployment assistance payments because obviously the economic situation that we're in is not short-term we expect that we're going to have a very challenging economic environment for some time to come and so making sure that those $600 a week payments continue while the economy is very fragile and while you know the economists that spoke mentioned that you know our economy is demand based and so in spite of the fact that we have we openings people are smart that they're they're voting with their feet in Florida there was a story earlier this week that that showed that even though Governor De Santis irresponsibly refused to shuts they found when he should have people was beginning to stay home and like the responsible people that chose to make bad decisions that helped flatten our curve sooner than we it might have people are also likely not going to rush back into restaurants and rush back into businesses so making sure we have that extended unemployment assistance past the additional 13 weeks from when someone becomes unemployed in their state benefits don't continue and the PUA assistance and extending their state benefits expire we're going to need to make sure we have that safety net in place and so that's part of the heroes enact and we'll have a medium additional small business and other assistance provided as well and hopefully the Senate and the president will agree that we can't just leave people twisting in the wind yeah so you know our our package which is a big package which which is really and hopefully it's going to be enough where I'm gonna have more packages I mean we have economists have already told us that we're heading towards depression like numbers in job loss so this is just the start not the beginning and we yeah I think one of the objects of this scares this I'm sorry it's new heroes package is to get money to folks other than just through an employment yeah we are going to extend the benefits which is a good thing but we're also going to have more direct payments $1,200 per person for both adults and and children up to $6,000 per family that will be direct deposit money or checks in the mail we're going to supplement health benefits so Cobra benefits we're going to extend the period of the ACA and and send more money and we're going to also do more money on scholarships so I'm people people hold from having to pay their scholarship their scholarship money back and most importantly this package is going to send money to the states and local governments and prevent a whole new group of people being unemployed and that's teachers and firefighters first first responders the people who pick up the garbage people who work for local cycle government whose budgets are shrinking so this this package will do a lot to try to make people a much more financially secure as well as there'll be money for its more testing and so we're going to try to keep people healthy and keep it keep them financially secure Jason just before there the next question I just want to I want to pull us back to why we're here the heroes Act is is going to do all of take all of these really important steps to help our communities and help the people of the state of Florida especially but for Jesse and for Al we can talk about extending unemployment than $600 a week through January we can talk about extending it for the next ten years but if the governor can't figure out how to make our unemployment system work so that people who are unemployed right now and get the help they need none of that matters mr. chair yes Herschel Russell come on there was money in the second package for states that the governor could use to hire people he could have hired them by now he's had the money long enough and there was talk of him hiring hundreds of people throughout the state to help manage the the unemployment compensation process because we we all knew that it was going to be overwhelming I don't think he did that so it's not money it's just his will its will to do what is right for the people of Florida and he doesn't want to do it he doesn't want to do it because what what the Republicans are saying is if they get unemployment compensation of too hundred and seventy five dollars and six hundred dollars from the federal government they will never go back to work that's too much money eight hundred and seventy five dollars so this is all about the will to do what is best and he doesn't have the will so we must I thank you for having this call today because we have to shame him publicly to give him the will so as I said before so he can pull up his big-boy pants and do his job he's not doing his job Thank You Carol Ann Wilson uh Jason next question next question comes from Wendy Rhodes might be please send me yourself thank you so much uh I think y'all pretty much answered it already so I'm good thank you okay great okay our next question comes from Joel Malkin Joel please I'm yourself Ted can be yep yeah Here I am okay I'm sorry about that I couldn't find the unmute Florida use network a lot of blames being thrown on Governor De Santis but it's been shown the website was set up to fail for years I think going back at least five years could someone speak to the need maybe for an investigation into that sure do we want to figure out what happened and how this happened sure of course we want to know that but it's the details we know that it was the system as you point out that was set to fail we know it's it's one of the stingiest in the country it's one of the hardest to access the purpose seems to be to try to dehumanize people who have lost their jobs and who need unemployment but I don't want to spend our resources right now resources that could help Jesse or Al or the other hundreds of thousands of Floridians who need their unemployment figuring out what Rick Scott did to screw up this system I to spend all of our resources figure out what Rhonda Santa's can do to fix it so that people can get the help they need sorry anyone anyone else Debbie yeah I just we have been as a delegation looking into having a federal investigation of the unemployment system in Florida and the what led to it as well as the system breakdowns within states across the country and so we'll be we'll be able to announce the details of that relatively soon but we've come together a to to try to focus on that and I expect that will be you'll be seeing federal a federal look at specific problems in Florida and what led to them as well as other states Debbie thanks and before it's 9:15 and so we wrap up that before we wrap up al or Jesse do anything else you'd like to add I don't want to interrupt it al if you want to go first you're welcome to go first if you like oh the only thing that I would like to see everything attacked from all different angles I just don't understand why the website is so difficult and and and why it's so unresponsive and I know that's what we're all saying but it's it's that's really all I have to say it's very frustrating I'm gonna I mean I'm gonna quickly again thank you guys for this I mean it's nice to take a break from the stress and kind of relieve it through conversation but I'll tell you that there I'm 32 years old I have a twin brother that lives one with me he got tested positive for Kovac on March 26 in the beginning of all this and we're both laid off currently from our work because of that one reason which is really unfair after five years are working in the same companies but I'll tell you this is the first time I feel really hopeless I mean I've been unemployed before in Los Angeles working to get my dream job but not for something like this you know unfortunate have no control over this but this really is difficult and I don't even know what to make up the situation at this point it's just day by day trying to figure out where the next dollars coming from you know I again I just hope something comes through this at the end the day I know my biggest concern I asked a question regarding rent I don't know what the steps are for um you know the moratorium regarding rent here in South Florida and what's gonna happen with that but with regard to me I you know I'm not looking forward to facing eviction you know I've never had that happen and I don't want that to happen but I'm getting to a point where you know I'm just losing my mind at this point I have no other other sources so anyways guys thank you so much hopefully you know this gets out there and make some sort of change for everyone like us okay Jesse thank you thanks very much for joining out thank you to all my colleagues appreciate all of us getting on this soon call together the frustration and desperation and anger they hear from us is a direct result of the frustration and the anger and the desperation we hear from our constituents and literally every single day and Jesse and Al you've helped put put a face on on that frustration for for all of us and we appreciate it and thanks everyone for joining we'll keep fighting and we stand here willing to help as we said the very first time you brought this up the members of Congress brought this up with the governor we are willing to help in any way we can but we've got to figure out how to get this dicks to help the people of Florida thanks everyone for for joining this one

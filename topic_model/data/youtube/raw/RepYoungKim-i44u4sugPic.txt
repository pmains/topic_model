is now recognized thank you chair love grant and ranking member lucas for holding this hearing i want to thank the witnesses for being with us today too you know unfortunately uh wildfires in my district and the rest of california where congressmani ibera and i are from we seem to be more prevalent every year and with 85 percent of california in extreme drought the problem of longer wildfire seasons has been exacerbated by the dryness of our landscape and the record-breaking temperatures and adding insult to injury the wildfire smoke and ash negatively impacts our air quality and drinking water and i hope we can work in a bipartisan manner to better coordinate our federal efforts in predicting wildfires and adopt cutting-edge solutions to detect fires as soon as they start mr geisler you know i represent california's 39th district where we have unfortunately seen the devastating effects of wi-fi not only in my communities but across the state of california so how can we ensure coordination between federal state and local communities to share available information and tools to better predict and respond to wildfires thank you for that question congresswoman i appreciate it the one thing that i will emphasize is is that you really should be proud of the national system and that we do have currently uh the the interaction that we have between federal state and local agencies is is something that actually other countries come to try to duplicate but there's always room for improvement getting to common operating systems being able to share data being able to share and communicate effectively is really some of the items that if we can address those uh it is it's critical a lot of times it's just the difference between two computer systems or or uh literally the links that we might be able to get through broadband that prevents some of the sharing and so it sounds kind of kind of basic that the need but the willingness and the ability to do it is there a lot of times it is just making sure that the connections are made whether it be introducing two people literally just doing that all the way to making sure that our systems link together and operate effectively the the system that was just described that cal fire had is absolutely amazing and it's in test and it has been doing some uh great work part of the basis of that is its ability to start communicating across jurisdictional authorities and that's what we're all looking for is that ability to effectively share all of these resources that we currently have you know so uh noaa has matched the process of designing the next generation of satellites in its clip so i have any of your colleagues engaged with noaa in designing these satellites to improve wi-fi detection abilities if not what advice would you give to noaa to help make the future satellite relate more effective in wi-fi detection and prevention so i i will say that i am unaware if any of my colleagues have worked directly with noaa over satellites i will tell you that in my past life i was able to work with the national severe storm labs in norman uh oklahoma and i know that the interaction between the national weather service and state agencies is very strong and we utilize a lot of that satellite technology and that there have been conversations about how effectively those could be used at the noaa level also but i'm unaware of anyone that is speaking directly to them but i do agree it's it's a huge opportunity for us all so you're familiar with the uh the experimental uh high resolution rapid refresh smoke model have you had input on that development of any of these models and in your opinion what further research and development is needed to make existing models more effective yeah a lot of input has been really coordinated through the wildland fire leadership council where we do have all of the partners at the table so you not only have state foresters but you also have mayors and and other members of the various uh levels of government uh really having those discussions so it's it's a really powerful uh uh forum to kind of discuss the needs and where we go forward uh so going into the future we're really looking again to try to enforce that and try to get more of the outreach there's a very recent memo even in fact between cdc and epa discussing wildfire smoke and actually being able to address all of the research and coordination that was there and all of that was was actually made possible through the interactions that we've had at that wildland fire leadership council so again i it sounds like i'm a broken record related to uh potentially solving a lot of these problems but there's basic funding we need for research but then there's also just the social science of communication and effectively making sure that we share resources across the table thank you very much i see my time is up so i yield back thank you

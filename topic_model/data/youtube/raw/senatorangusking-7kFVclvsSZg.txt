mr. Thompson I've been following this I've been impressed I've been impressed I've read your references but you lost me in the answer to mr. senator Heinrichs question are you telling this committee that you've lived in the United States for the last three years read newspapers participated in the practice of law and you don't know the meaning of the term deep state the more accurate answer then that long rambling non answer you gave was no don't do tell us what you think you're not you're not helping yourself by obfuscating and and avoiding these questions you also avoided senator collins question which was exactly the right question and everybody in the country knows what happened in that case it's a very simple question should that complaint have been forwarded to Congress yes or no the complaint by michael atkinson the complaint the whistleblower Quizlet was the basis of an impeachment hearing right don't tell me you don't know all the facts we know the essential facts you know what the complaint was should that have been a forward into Congress yes or no the senator I you know fully understand your concern and okay you don't appear to want to answer let me move on were you interviewed by the president for this position the president United States yes no sir you said no correct were you interviewed by personnel at the White House the White House Counsel yes sir was there ever any question that suggested to you any issue of loyalty or reminding you of your subservience to the president who was appointing you so senator I'm gonna answer that collection I will preface it the you know the generally conversations that I would have with the White House Council I think are confidential however what I can tell you that state but what's the basis of the statement of life you were asked in terms it's just my under suitability for this position it's my understanding but I will answer your question I think no one from the White House ever gave me any kind of a litmus test or or loyalty test to the president at all did they suggest that was a significant concern or question or no one the word loyalty ever arise in no one conversation I will tell you senator no one at the White House ever gave me any to my knowledge or III never perceived any kind of loyalty test at all with regard to the president senator let me let me answer this I would absolutely I would absolutely have confirmed do my job in an independent way if any pressure was brought on me by the White House then I would consider that to be absolutely inappropriate and notify this committee of that if I had pressure from the White House or any outside external source like that I would notify the committee thank you you understand that one of the critical importance I think the IG position is one of the most important in our government generally but in this particular case it's especially important because we're dealing with with a secret agency which is an anomaly in a democracy it's not doesn't have the usual watchdogs of the press or of interest groups or of outside people who know what's happening therefore the position is especially doubly important than it would be in the Department of Agriculture or another not to denigrate that but that's it that's a special role here and the also the other piece is the obligation as you have acknowledged of reporting information to this committee because we're the only committee that follows what's going on in those agencies so I hope you appreciate that this is a an extremely important position and this president has made plain his desire to politicize the intelligence agencies that he doesn't like the intelligence agencies and the vice-chair read off the list of all the people that have been removed I guess all you can do is tell me that you'll stand up to that but I certainly hope that you will because it's important for the country whether it's this president you may well be in the AG of the IG on another president if any president who's trying to influence the preparation of intelligence is harming themselves in harming the country will you commit unequivocally before this committee to notify us of any such pressure and to resist any such pressure center if if any such pressure was brought on the I G's office to alter its product or how it evaluates something or from any other source I would consider that very serious I would report that to the CIA director I'm sure and this committee and I will say senator you know youyou you're referring to you would hope that I would be independent and resist you know we don't we really don't know one another but if I'm confirmed I I think within a short period of time after working with me and work in my office I think it would be absolutely convinced that I'm not going to give in to any kind of undue inappropriate pressure that I will always always stand firm to my convictions I can absolutely assure you that and I know I know anyone who and and up here intelligence being the possibility of being fired I'm sorry I didn't up to and including the likelihood of being fired senator if if you look if I was fired for doing my job in a lawful way in an appropriate way then then I would be fired thank you Thank You mr. chairman

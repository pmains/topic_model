let me say there are more there are more uh coming and one of the reasons for that is just the excessive weight of the regulatory State on our economy I mean this Administration uh if you talk to anybody in the stakeholder community in the regulated Community it's a it's a daily basis they are just being pounded with more regulations and in many in case like what what Mike's trying to do with this uh would be incredibly detrimental to literally millions of Americans and that's going to be true on some of the other CRA votes that will come up in the future there are other regulations that are also going to be targeted for this very reason and I think you'll find on some of those just like you will today there will be some Democrats who will vote for it because they recognize that um the the adverse and detrimental impact does it have on ordinary Americans

senator from Oregon I don't want to make this a bouquet tossing contest but I also want to understood that my colleague from Oregon has done an invaluable service to the country by showing the importance of what is happening at the border where there is an effort in effect to traumatize children and separate kids from their parents I look forward to working with my colleagues we're going to do some work on it in Oregon I certainly don't want to hold up my friend from Virginia and appreciate senator Murphy as president and colleagues before I came to the Congress I was co-director of the Oregon gray Panthers senior citizens group for about seven years and back then we were talking about ways in which to move forward on health care to advance the rights of our people to improve the quality of life in this country and there was often a bipartisan coalition to do that to make those advancements in the last year however there has been an unprecedented effort to turn back the healthcare clock we see it with the effort to sell junk insurance which in effect involves the Trump Health and Human Services Department saying to States well it's really pretty much okay to discriminate just don't be too obvious with it and then we saw the effort to strip away the Medicaid guarantee of nursing home coverage for older people and now senator Murphy Center Kane and my colleagues are here on the floor to talk about the Trump administration's effort to unravel the law the current law that bars insurance companies from beating the stuffing out of people with pre-existing in conditions that's the way it used to be folks if you had a pre-existing you know condition and you weren't healthy or wealthy and that's what you face if you have a pre-existing condition you were just really in bad shape you're healthy you pay your bills and you don't have bills if you're wealthy you pay the bills but millions who had pre-existing conditions would just get clobbered clobbered with premium hikes or they couldn't get coverage at all so finally we said in the Affordable Care Act we're actually gonna start moving the clock forward and we're going to bar insurance companies from discriminating against those with pre-existing conditions this is particularly important for the 67 million women under 65 an enormous number of women in this country who have a pre-existing condition and they have over the last few years counted on the health care protections I've just described in the Affordable Care Act as a health care safety net as a backstop protections that say they can't be charged more because they needed maternity care and other essential services protections that say they can't be denied coverage due to a pre-existing condition that means everything from ovarian cancer to asthma every year those who switch jobs or stop working perhaps to take care of a loved one and women often perform those roles they now have the assurance that they can have the mobility of being able to move up in the workforce if they live in Virginia or Connecticut or Oregon and they see the opportunity to get a better job they have a pre-existing condition without these protections they're locked in they're locked in to the workforce what we're doing is saying that we want these protections to stay so that women and all Americans have the opportunity to secure advancements when they have the skills and the talents to move on to another job so these fundamental health care rights disappear if the president and the Republican state attorneys general are able to unravel the law of the land this is really a head scratcher folks it's one thing for an administration to say senator Kingston or Murphy they want to come to the Congress they want to come to the appropriate committees my colleagues serve on one of them I serve on the other and say we want to pass a law that changes pre-existing condition policy we wouldn't be for it but at least that's a legitimate debate they're not talking about doing that they're not talking about coming to Congress and you know why they're not coming to the Congress because they know that their effort to unravel pre-existing condition policy would not have a pulse up here they wouldn't be able to get any traction for it so what they're doing is going through the backdoor they're trying to use a very complicated legal process and it's going to be very hard to follow about the Supreme Court and the purchase requirement and the tax and the like but make no mistake about it this is an effort to unravel the law of the land to deny protections to women protections that ensure that if they have a pre-existing condition they don't have to go to bed at night in pure panic worried that they could wake up in the morning and they could lose everything so mr. president I'll have plenty more to say about it this is especially important because it escalates the Trump administration's campaign of healthcare discrimination against Americans women and this is really gonna take a toll on 65 million 67 million women under 65 people who as I said without this protection are gonna go to bed at night in my view with an enormous fear and an enormous sense of uncertainty of what's ahead where they could lose everything if they got out its president with that I thank my colleagues for their courtesy senator Murphy for bringing these efforts to the floors so frequently and I yield

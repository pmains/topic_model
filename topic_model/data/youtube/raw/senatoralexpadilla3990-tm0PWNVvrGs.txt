BACK TO YOU. >> NOW IT'S US. WHITNEY WILD WITH THE DETAILS OF THIS BULLETIN. THANK YOU. >>> LET'S BRING IN NOW SENATOR  ALEX PADILLA, A MEMBER OF THE  SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THAT  MET TODAY. SENATOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR  BEING HERE. I WANT TO PLAY A LITTLE BIT MORE OF WHAT THAT GRIEVING SON SAID  ABOUT HIS MOTHER. SHE WAS ONE OF THE VICTIMS --  THE OLDEST VICTIM AT THAT  BUFFALO SUPERMARKET MASS  SHOOTING. SO, LET'S LISTEN TO THAT. >> WHAT I LOVED MOST ABOUT HER  WAS THE WAY SHE LOVED HER FAMILY UNCONDITIONALLY. SACRIFICING EVERYTHING FOR US. OUR LIVES ARE FOREVER CHANGED,  FOREVER DAMAGED BY AN ACT OF  PROFOUND HATE AND EVIL, BUT  WE'RE MORE THAN HURT. WE'RE ANGRY. WE'RE MAD AS HELL BECAUSE THIS  SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED. >> AND SENATOR, I'M SURE THAT  EVERYONE IN THAT ROOM IS MOVED  BY, YOU KNOW, HEARING A PERSONAL STORY. THAT'S JUST ONE VICTIM. I MEAN, JUST ONE LOSS, AND WE'VE SEEN SO MANY. BUT DO YOU THINK THAT PERSONAL  STORIES LIKE THAT DO MOVE YOU  AND YOUR COLLEAGUES TOWARDS  ACTION? IN OTHER WORDS, LIKE, WHAT COMES OUT OF THIS HEARING TODAY? >> YEAH. IT'S -- NOTHING COULD BE MORE  POWERFUL IN TERMS OF TESTIMONY  THAN THOSE PERSONAL EXPERIENCES  AND HEARTFELT EMOTIONS, WHETHER  IT'S MR. WHITFIELD, WHO'S  TALKING ABOUT HIS MOTHER, YOU  KNOW, FOR WEEKS NOW, WE'VE BEEN  REFLECTING ON THE TRAGEDY IN  UVALDE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN  COVERING AS WELL. ANYBODY WHO'S A PARENT AND SEES  THE IMAGES OF YOUNG CHILDREN AS  VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE HAS TO  BE MOVED. AND WHAT THE HEARING TODAY WAS  ABOUT, IT WAS REALLY THE  CONVERGENCE OF TWO SIGNIFICANT  CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE IN  AMERICA. NUMBER ONE, YES, THE  RADICALIZATION AND RECRUITMENT  OF DOMESTIC TERRORISTS, BECAUSE  THESE CONSPIRACIES AND --  THEORIES AND LIES THAT ARE  RAMPANT ON THE INTERNET, NOT  JUST ON SOCIAL MEDIA, BUT  ESPECIALLY ON SOCIAL MEDIA,  THAT'S BAD IN AND OF ITSELF. BUT WHEN YOU COUPLE THAT WITH  THE LAWS ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT MAKE IT FAR TOO EASY TO GET A  WEAPON, PARTICULARLY ASSAULT  WEAPONS, YOU KNOW, WEAPONS OF  MASS DESTRUCTION, THAT'S WHAT  LED TO THE TRAGEDY IN BUFFALO AT THE SPEED AND THE NUMBERS THAT  WE SAW. WE HAVE TO GET OUR ARMS AROUND  IT, AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE  BUILDING SUPPORT FOR THE  DOMESTIC TERRORISM PROTECTION  ACT IN THE SENATE JUDICIARY  COMMITTEE. >> OKAY, BUT LET'S ALSO TALK  ABOUT THIS VERY SMALL BIPARTISAN GROUP OF SENATORS THAT'S TRYING  TO WORK ON CUTTING DOWN ON GUN  VIOLENCE IN THIS COUNTRY, AND  HERE'S, AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL  FROM OUR REPORTING, FROM WHAT  LITTLE THEY'VE ANSWERED SO FAR,  HERE'S WHAT'S ON THE TABLE. SO, THEY WOULD INCENTIVIZE  STATES TO PASS RED FLAG LAWS. IN OTHER WORDS, TRYING TO KEEP  GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF PEOPLE  WHO ARE SHOWING TROUBLING EITHER MENTAL HEALTH OR JUST SOME SORT  OF SIGNS OF BEING UNHINGED. THEN, THAT WOULD SORT OF  NECESSITATE A POTENTIAL WAITING  PERIOD FOR 18 TO 21-YEAR-OLDS,  AND THEN THEY WOULD BEEF UP,  SOMEHOW, SCHOOL SAFETY, HARDEN  THOSE SOFT TARGETS, AND INVEST  MORE IN MENTAL HEALTH CARE. I KNOW THAT YOU AND SO MANY  DEMOCRATS WISH THAT THESE WOULD  GO MUCH FURTHER, BUT IF THAT'S  ALL THERE IS, IS THAT GOOD  ENOUGH? IN OTHER WORDS, IS THAT  SOMETHING YOU WOULD VOTE FOR? >> YEAH, I THINK THE QUESTION  MAY BE BETTER PUT AS, IS IT  WORTH PASSING EVEN IF IT'S JUST  THIS? THE ANSWER IS, YES. YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD. DO I BELIEVE AN ASSAULT WEAPONS  BAN IS IN ORDER? ABSOLUTELY. WE HAVE IT IN THE STATE OF  CALIFORNIA, AND THE RATE OF MASS SHOOTINGS AND VIOLENT INCIDENTS  LIKE THIS IS A FRACTION OF WHAT  IT IS IN OTHER STATES. DO I BELIEVE WE SHOULD BAN  HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES AND  STRENGTHEN BACKGROUND CHECKS? ABSOLUTELY. WE'VE SEEN IT WORK IN STATES  WHERE IT'S IMPLEMENTED. BUT WE'RE DEALING WITH THE  POLITICAL REALITY OF THE UNITED  STATES SENATE. PUT THE FILIBUSTER RULE ASIDE,  LITERALLY A 50/50 SENATE. IF WE CAN MAKE PROGRESS ON  BACKGROUND CHECKS, ON THESE RED  FLAG LAWS, AND AT THE SAME TIME  INVEST MORE IN MENTAL HEALTH, I  DO THINK IT'S WORTHWHILE, GET  THIS DONE, HELP COMMUNITIES,  HELP TRY TO PREVENT ADDITIONAL  TRAGEDIES, AND KEEP WORKING  TOWARD THOSE OTHER POLICIES. BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR OR  MAKE SURE VOTERS KEEP THIS IN  MIND WHEN THEY GO VOTE IN  NOVEMBER. >> YEAH. >> IF YOU WANT STRONGER GUN  SAFETY, ELECT MORE DEMOCRATS SO  WE CAN GET THIS DONE. >> SENATOR JOSH HAWLEY, WHO'S A  REPUBLICAN, AS YOU KNOW, HE  DOESN'T LIKE THE IDEA OF RED  FLAG LAWS. SO LET ME PLAY FOR YOU WHAT HE  SAID EARLIER. >> I DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE THE RED FLAG LAWS. I THINK THAT THIS IS, WHEN  YOU'RE TAKING AWAY SOMEBODY'S  SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS, WHEN  THEY HAVE NOT YET COMMITTED A  CRIME, AND THEY'RE NOT THERE TO  DEFEND THEMSELVES, MOST OF THOSE PROCEEDINGS ARE EX  PARTEPROCEEDINGS SO THE  DEFENDANT IS NOT PRESENT. I GOT A LOT OF CONCERNS WITH  THAT. >> WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT  LOGIC, AND HOW HARD DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO BE TO PASS  SOMETHING? >> WELL, THANKFULLY, WE DON'T  NEED ALL 100 VOTES TO GET  SOMETHING DONE. WE GOT TO HOLD OUT HOPE WE'LL  GET MORE THAN THAT BECAUSE OUR  KIDS DESERVE NO LESS. LOOK, I, DEMOCRATS, RESPECT THE  SECOND AMENDMENT, BUT THE SECOND AMENDMENT AND THE LIVES, THE  FUTURES, THE SECOND GRADERS IN  AMERICA, ARE NOT MUTUALLY  EXCLUSIVE. WE CAN MAKE PROGRESS ON SMART  GUN SAFETY LAWS THAT RESPECT THE SECOND AMENDMENT BUT ARE PROVEN  TO WORK TO MINIMIZE MASS  SHOOTINGS AND OTHER VIOLENT  TRAGEDIES IN AMERICA. THIS HAS GOT TO STOP. >> WHILE I HAVE YOU, SENATOR, I  WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE  PRIMARIES, PARTICULARLY IN YOUR  STATE OF CALIFORNIA TODAY. OUR -- ONE OF OUR POLITICAL  GURUS, RON BROWNSTEIN, BASICALLY SAYS IT COULD BE A REFERENDUM ON DEMOCRATS FOR ALL OF THE PEOPLE  WHO DON'T LIKE THE POLICIES THAT THEY'RE SEEING IN EVEN LIBERAL  CITIES LIKE SAN FRANCISCO, LOS  ANGELES, WHEN IT COMES TO CRIME  AND HOMELESSNESS. HE WRITES, THE OUTCOME WILL  AGAIN UNDERSCORE HOW MUCH DANGER A PARTY IN POWER CAN FACE WHEN  VOTERS FEEL THAT CERTAINTY HAS  BEEN STRIPPED FROM THEIR LIVES,  A DYNAMIC THAT EXTENDS BEYOND  CRIME AND HOMELESSNESS TO  INFLATION, SOARING GAS PRICES,  CONTINUED DISRUPTION FROM COVID. DO YOU THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A REFERENDUM FOR DEMOCRATS? >> LOOK, I THINK THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN. LET'S SEE WHAT THE OUTCOMES ARE  OF TODAY'S PRIMARY ELECTIONS IN  CALIFORNIA, AND THEN THE  NOVEMBER GENERAL ELECTION AND  SEE WHO CALIFORNIA VOTERS PUT IN CHARGE TO LEAD AT THE FEDERAL,  STATE, AND AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. I AGREE WITH YOU, WITH ALL THESE ISSUES, WHETHER IT'S RISING  PRICES, HOUSING AND  HOMELESSNESS, STILL COVID  CONCERNS, AND SO MUCH MORE, BUT  I DO THINK DEMOCRATS HAVE THE  SOLUTIONS. I KNOW IN CONGRESS, WE'VE BEEN  PUTTING FORWARD A LOT OF IDEAS,  BUT TRY TO GET -- BRING  REPUBLICANS AROUND TO MAKE THE  INVESTMENTS IN

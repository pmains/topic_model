thank you thank you very much I'm delighted to have you here and I want to talk to mr. Doherty from the DEA all of us on this panel we're involved in hearings on the ensuring patient access an effective Drug Enforcement Act and it passed out of this committee unanimously I was one of the co-sponsors along with mrs. Blackburn in mr. Costello and that was the subject of a commentary or a report by 60 minutes in the Washington Post both respected journalistic organizations and those of us who supported the bill and that's all of us here we're very concerned and we want to get to the bottom of it in fact I've sent a letter to mr. Walden the chairman asking for a full investigation allowing the whistleblower to come in allowing the DEA to get in because bottom line we're on the same page we want to do everything we can to stem the tide of illegal opioids and we want to pass legislation that by no means handcuffs the ability of your organization to do its job but I've got a chart here because I want to ask a couple of questions the focus of that invent of that report had to do with the fall-off in the use of immediate suspension orders and as I understand that that order was one where pretty much on any suspicion that the DEA had they could close down a distributor but if you look at the chart the reduction went from 65 immediate suspension owners in 211 to 2011 down to five that was a low point and that was in 2015 correct and it went up to nine and 2016 so the law that we supported was signed into law in 2016 so here's my question unless the effect of the law occurred before the passage of the law the law that we passed was after there had been already a decline in the use of that tool one of many tools by the DEA is that correct that is absolutely correct so is it fair to say because I think we need some reassurance on this that the law we passed whatever its issues and I want to get to those was not responsible for the pre-existing decline in the use of that tool the immediate suspension order sir to answer your question the law that was passed in April of last year it's too early to tell what the the monster of impact of no wait I'm asking something else because I want to get to that yes sir but isn't it irrefutable that the demonstrable impact on immediate suspension orders that those started declining before the law was in effect in 2016 you went from sixty five to five before the law had passed that's correct so the law obviously was not what caused the decline in the use of that tool you had many other tools and we're using them vigorously thank you correct we have many tools you're correct sir yes we are using right but the immediate suspension are because this is the heart of the question and we really have to know we have to all of us have to know that law that we passed occurred after immediate suspension orders had already declined from 65 down to five right that is correct and then after the law was passed it went up to nine that is correct okay so we all want to help and do you have some specific legislative recommendations for our committee that we could take that would give additional authority within the Constitution to assist you in getting a job done sir thank you for that follow-up in let me say that from the diversion control perspective we use a variety of tools the tool you mentioned is a is an administrative action and we certainly look forward to working with Congress with Department of Justice oversight to ensure we have a tool we really we really look you've got a very important job we support it you have recommendations including any specific things you suggest we should do to amend the law we passed or even repeal the law we passed mr. Chairman I bet I speak for every single member of this committee we want to know that information because we would take that up immediately yes sir and DEA shares you're concerned and that matter is under coordination with the Department of Justice as we speak all right we need a date certain I mean times marching on this story shocked folks and it's a in in rightly so because everybody in America is just devastated by what's happening to friends to family to loved ones okay so we're ready to go and mr. chairman I'll leave it up to you but we're having a hard time at times getting the responses back and now that this question is out though out there about a law where the suggestion is we did harm not good I think all of us want to correct that correct I'll leave it to you yeah mr. Welch and behalf of the committee

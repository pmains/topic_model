Congressman Andrew Clyde Congressman great to have you on the show sir well thank you it's great to be with you I appreciate being here you are in involved in so many things but I want to get your take on the top news of the day WNBA star Brittany Greiner traded for an arms Merchant that was of Great Value to the United States uh your think on whether this is an Eco your thought on whether it's an equal swap or not well well you know I'll tell you it's great news that Brittany Greiner is coming back to the United States I think that that's fantastic but I'll tell you this is another example of failed leadership on the Biden Administration he left Paul Whalen behind you have Victor bout all right The Merchant of death the greatest most lethal arms dealer in the entire world that was an Ace card that we had and what did we get we got Brittany Griner but he left Paul Whalen in Russia that was a huge mistake he should have been able to get both of them back for uh Victor bout uh and I just think it's another failure just like Obama failed back when he brought our service man home for five uh terrorist Generals in exchange for five terrorist generals you know uh it just shows you the weakness of President Biden uh he should have been able to get way more than that for um for Victor bout but um but you know I'm glad that Brittany Greiner is home yeah exactly yeah absolutely and I'm I'm glad you brought that aspect out because one of the things that President Biden said this morning uh he said that it wasn't possible to bring home that Marine Paul Whelan um he wasn't a a situation where they could do both it was a situation of either this or nothing at all do you think that that would have been the case under someone like President Trump no not at all I think president Trump would have gotten them both back uh you know you saw you saw weakness in Afghanistan uh and as a result of that I think that contributed to the Russian invasion in Ukraine uh is you showed he uh Biden showed weakness there so um uh it just you can see the domino effect across major foreign decisions across the world of of our president's weakness on the world stage and uh it's really sad to see uh I I wish you were stronger and I wish that people uh respected this country more uh the foreign countries did but they don't because we have a weak leader yeah so true uh Congressman you have been one of the Clarion voices on the crisis at the border another border agent killed last night during a Pursuit uh the Customs border patrol agents seem like they're really short of the resources they need to do their job well again you have lawlessness at the southern border this is a self-inflicted wound by the bind Administration and uh you're we're going to have have you know criminal activity and we're going to have a tragic events at the border because of this uh you know President Biden could seal that border just like President Trump sealed that border he could finish the border wall which is necessary uh he could better fund uh the Customs and Border Protection and and we could put more agents down there if we had a wall the agents would be more effective with a wall but he refuses to do that and now we're losing title 42 I think on December 21st it's going to be a complete disaster on our Southern border and we are going to see more tragedies like what we saw this week what we've seen this week yeah and that's a shame okay absolutely and I want to stay on the topic of the Border because there is another issue that relates to a porous border that affects Georgia I think more than it does other quote unquote non-border States even though we know that pretty much every state is a border state and that's the issue of human trafficking Hartsfield-Jackson airport at least as of five years ago or so was was a major major hub for human trafficking is this something that Georgians care uh I know they care about it but but is it something that's really widespread and therefore affects their vote uh well I'll tell you that human trafficking is one of the things that the open border exacerbates we see that when the folks come up from the south uh and and uh the coyotes that bring the young the young teenagers the unaccompanied children uh that have been coming in by the thousands it's incredibly concerning to a state like Georgia and then you have the bind Administration flying uh you uh unaccompanied children and and aliens uh illegal aliens to the various to all the other states uh making each state a border state and it's certainly concerning for Georgia because uh you know Atlanta is a hub of of traffic uh just of all sorts of people and so you know that human trafficking is going to exist there too and that's something that we have to uh shut down as best we can because it's an evil very very evil thing and President Biden uh is literally responsible for it you know I consider the federal government to be the fine final Link in the chain of human trafficking when it comes to what they have been doing on the southern border that's it's a true story when you put it all together he really is the end responsibility for this Congressman uh there are many troubling statistics about the border the one that's most striking to me more people with terrorist ties across the border in the last few months than the entire presidency of Donald Trump what is Homeland Security telling you about why so many are trying now what their ties are and what potential danger may be lurking in the country from people who have already gotten in uh well you know the uh the border patrol has caught over a hundred people on the terrorist watch list we know that just during the bind Administration that's over five times what was uh just during the Trump Administration you know that is so so concerning to us and you've got to wonder why are these people coming from the southern you know who are on the terrorist watch list why are they coming into the United States and then but what's even more concerning are those we haven't caught uh you know there were 900 000 what are considered to be uh gotaways and those are people that we know actually cross the border but we didn't have the resources to go and detain them so if you're gonna if you're gonna terrorist and you've got a uh you know a nefarious plan then uh you're not going to be one of those who gives yourself up you're going to be one of those uh who evades as best possible so of those nine hundred thousand gotaways how many more have not been caught who are actually on the terrorist watch list uh and um you know President Biden again his policies are directly responsible for this it all goes back to Biden's policies and um you know our country is going to suffer for it but we will take back the majority of January and and we're going to do our best to shut that down through the power of the purse yeah and and another thing that affects National Security and safety here at home uh Inner City crime the crime surges that we are seeing Across America one of the the four pillars of the commitment to America by House Republicans is improving safety in America um for you what are what are some of the most important things to to alleviate that that crime pressure um you know well the federal government uh honestly needs to worry about our borders uh that's its primary responsibility you know and then supporting law enforcement we have we have Sanctuary cities across our country that are magnets for these illegals coming in and we have to be able to get rid of sanctuary cities and I think we can do that through the funding mechanism of the federal government but uh but you've got local support of law enforcement which is so critical to reducing crime and when the when the politicians those elected by the people are not willing to support their their law enforcement um then you're going to have problems and we're seeing that in the democrat-led city not the Republic but the Democrat one

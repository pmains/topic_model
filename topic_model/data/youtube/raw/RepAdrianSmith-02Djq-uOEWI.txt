all right well good morning thank you everyone for joining us i would imagine we'll have some folks continue to join us but we're going to go ahead and get started really grateful to have this opportunity to hear from you and and also uh for our panel today to share their perspective i think they bring a fantastic perspective of where we want to go a little bit of where we've been over the last last few months but obviously things are not what they used to be and it would be nice to get back to where we were with a strong economy growing economy uh um but there were some challenges even then too on labor shortages and so forth but i am very anxious to hear from our panel today uh given uh the fact that where we are right now obviously we've we've had the cobit relief going back to last spring and moving forward we don't know what the next uh next step will be speaker pelosi had some priorities that she was insisting on and and would actually uh reject anything uh other than those priorities and um she has less leverage now in in the house so um it's it's going to be a different scenario i think uh but i i'm i'm fairly confident we can come up with something reasonable appropriate um interestingly enough you know i heard from from an employer who was so appreciative of relief from last spring and even though challenges still remain uh he told me that the relief doesn't need to continue in the same in the exact same form so i hope that we as elected officials can really do what we need to do to get the targeted relief so with that i certainly want to thank our panelists here today today we have leon mylabar he's the nebraska district director of the small business administration very very integral part of the ppp and relief last spring also joining us is star lail she's the economic development director for the city of scott's bluff uh star actually we sat beside each other on city council back in the day on the gearing city council also we have oscar gomez the assistant city administrator for south sioux city and really appreciates all of you being on the on the panel here today and if uh what we'll do is we'll have each panelist kind of give their perspective and insight and ideas and then we'll throw it open to two questions so uh leon mr malabar would you like to begin thank you congressman uh one of the things i like to tell everybody uh behind the scenes things look pretty uh pretty good one of the things we do is we follow up with all of our our lenders this last year was a record year for our agency and for uh for the state you know at the end of the day we did 58 936 loans for about 4.4 billion dollars and all of that and yes we did a lot of pvp loans and idle loans and idle loan program is still open right now for our disaster we have 18 uh disasters here in the united states that are actively in addition to the um the coven 19 disaster one of the interesting things behind this scene that was our is our traditional own program you know we did 153.7 million dollars in and loans outside of the ppp in an idol interesting thing when we drilled down to that to that uh over half of them were for companies that were looking to expand and they took advantage of our 504 and 7 eight program the other thing that we saw about 45 percent of them uh businesses were startups or businesses in transition we're seeing quite a few uh throughout the whole state and especially outside the metropolitan area where businesses are being sold to the next generation or a third party and it's somewhat complicated if the uh the seller has a pvp loan but we've all figured that out so we're still seeing that growth out there the other thing is a very important that many years ago we did not have we have this micro loan program uh we did only 107 loans uh but for 1.8 million dollars our average loan for micro businesses have gone up my major concern is going forward if i uh looking at all of that is um we want to make sure when it comes to economic development we assist those businesses that are in transition from one generation to another we do not want to lose the hardware store the grocery store um the various services that that that we have we want to be able to go ahead and move them sba is providing the financing we do have money to go ahead and finance these uh these projects i think uh the lenders are telling us they have not seen uh their only things they're concerned about is hotels restaurants and a few other businesses that uh because of the the cobit the lockdowns and all that other stuff and they have had added impact my other concern a major concern is those businesses that have gone through this lockdown and all of that that where business has not come back uh one of the things i'm recommending that uh for all economic goals chambers to reach out to their customers their businesses out there and see who needs technical assistance you know that could be uh the nebraska business development center because we have offices across the state uh could could we score there is they need to do financials to see where they're at and see what they need to go ahead and do different so to make sure they uh survive so there's money there's technical assistance out there um those that who are marginal businesses they are my biggest concern we lose a business it's very hard to go ahead and get that back and the cost of getting it back is is tremendous um i'm always encouraged uh you know and and if you run into businesses on the other side who are looking at uh business transition and all of that nebraska business development center and carnegie o'neil yourself and sarah do a wonderful job with that help with that business transition you need a valuation uh we've had less problems with business transition especially if sba is involved with financing and lenders are uh involved with that because we can get an adequate picture of what the businesses is worth and or uh if you're selling and or purchasing in it um i'll save any additional uh issues for uh questions that that people may have uh congressman is that is that enough for uh for an intro yeah we'll we'll uh likely have questions and uh so we'll we'll come back on that a star would you like to go next yes um good morning everyone i just want to talk about a few things that the city of scots bluff has been doing as far as workforce development there's been a lot of changes here in western nebraska as everywhere but first of all a shout out to nebraska business development center i work really close with spencer ryan when people call me and they don't know where to start on a business plan or financials or anything like that i send them directly to spencer at the nebraska business development center and our committee that makes our economic development loans is very comfortable with the way spencer puts together the package and he brings it to us or the the company brings it to us and we know that it's fully vetted and that it's a good a good plan so thank you to nbc that's just one of the partners that we work with here at the city of scott's bluff i had a local citizen actually bring me an idea um i guess it's been about a year ago that south dakota is doing it's called their build dakota program and she said why can't we do this more on a local level and help our employers that are looking for the skilled workforce because that's still the number one issue out here in western nebraska and i think across the state is a skilled workforce so we put a committee together and we just started talking about how could we scale this down from a state program down to more of a local program and how were we going to going to get that funded so we are calling our program together we grow and um we haven't launched it yet we're very very close to getting the funding actually through the city of scots bluff um we're going to start with 250 000 but we think that is going to disappear rather quickly uh what the money will be used for is the um the business will actually be the applicant if they have an apprenticeship um or an internship or something like that or even a job to fill and they hire someone that has you know no training in that particular field whether it's anything from a bank teller to um an electrician a plumber anything like that um they can hire that person at maybe a a lower wage maybe it's um 10 to 15 but that's not really a living wage so our what our program will do is help supplement that person's wage and get them up to maybe a um 16 to 20 an hour wage while they're learning and while they're an apprentice and then after a few months and years that person that um individual becomes um more of a an asset to that company and the company can actually afford to to pay them that that full wage so we're working really closely with our businesses we're working very closely with our community college western nebraska community college we're going to try to get our area certified in the the career readiness program the all 11 counties in western nebraska are working on that there is a certification test that they take it's like 60 which again our program would pay for to see what skills that particular person has and um where they would fit within our workforce one of the huge issues that we have right now in western nebraska is housing we have very very few houses on the market and the ones that are on the market are dated or dilapidated in some way and so we are going to apply through the state through the um workforce housing grant program and we've also applied for an owner occupied rehab program for 750 000 and we're hoping to know about that um fairly soon so we have a really housing shortage right now and it's really hard to um you know build something or get a development going in a very short time so par and part of that problem has been we have had a lot of people if you're familiar with our area we're about 200 miles from denver so a lot of the the unrest and the things that are going over going on over in colorado and in denver people have just had enough and we're having a lot of people move in from the front range and from colorado not only as residents but i'm working with a couple of smaller manufacturing companies that are interested in moving over here as well so um just working really closely with not only nbc and bbc but wncc our college usda real development there's so many tools out there i think that businesses aren't aware of and then also the nebraska department of labor they have a program for displaced workers if someone you know has been laid off from one job and they need to be retrained and another job there's funding out there from the nebraska department of labor so what's frustrating is trying to get that information out into our community and let them know about all of the resources that are out there another grassroots program that that we started is um called community connections and that is for newcomers that move into the area connecting them with either a volunteer civic organization somewhere where they can they can volunteer and become a part of the community because a lot of times what happens is somebody moves here they don't know anyone they go from work to home from work to home and they say oh this this isn't for me so making that initial connection with newcomers and with that that potential workforce and then also having something for them to do and i know it's it's difficult in smaller communities that's why we try to promote our entire region so there might not be a be something going on right here in scots bluff but there might be something going on in one of our neighboring communities um there it is 20 miles away bridgeport's 30 miles um you know mitchell's about six miles so trying to as far as tourism and things to do trying to promote the entire region so that people especially young families have something to do and get out and um and take advantage of those things so um i can quit talking i have a lot more stuff but i'll let oscar go ahead and visit thank you star appreciate that i too am a big fan of the nebraska business development center i think they just do fantastic work um so uh mr goldman's oscar you want to take over now sure sure thank you very much congressman and uh uh just like star i think we're we kind of have the same kind of similar issues in our community so we can talk about some of the things that that we are dealing with especially with the scovid definitely hasn't been easy our industrial district obviously has not been affected so much other than you know lowering the hours that they're working with and obviously that affects their sales budgets and all that stuff but um obviously the the small business new restaurants your small stores they're the ones that being affected the most so obviously working with the state department of labor ded to come up with some of the ideas how to help these people out because they are the ones that are suffering the most and especially now that all of a sudden now we're back to 25 capacity so that is uh that's definitely a struggle here in our community workforce obviously with these companies uh the major industries like tyson for example uh currently they can probably hire 200 people uh today if we if they want to but at the same time with the low unemployment rate that zooland you know our community has you know where they're going to get them from right now pretty much the big companies are fighting with each other trying to get the employees into their facilities to work there so that's becoming an issue where the tysons the wells blue bunnies the sea for seabourn uh food uh are competing with each other where they're just stealing uh customers or employees in this in this case so we are talking with them as far as what we can do as a community to help them out what are the one what are the things that they're looking for what kind of jobs they have because obviously we can promote our community as far as what we have for housing schools um you know or jobs that or the companies that we have in our communities but we really don't know what kind of jobs they have within their industry so it's always nice to talk with them and say okay so if you're looking for a specific trade what is it that you're looking for do we need to get together with the schools colleges and make sure that they are doing the trade jobs or having the tools to teach this um people to work with you to make sure they stay in our community so so that's something that we are uh dealing with in our uh in our community for the uh for the workforce one of the things that we started to do was to meet with the big industries and talk about you know uh how are we gonna um how we're gonna promote our community our community has great uh jobs has great housing and uh has a great school system but how do we promote that outside of our community so somebody's looking at a new job if they're not happy at their current job and they're looking to to for for a better job and if they have to move their families it's like what are the things that they're going to look at obviously housing is one of them the school system for the kids you know how do we promote that so we are talking with the tysons and the ingredients and empiricals here in our town to make sure they let us know what they have to offer and why these people should pick them to work for but as well we have to promote our community to make sure that we have the right housing we promote our our school system which i think our school system is great and uh and we also do a better job of just not promoting parks you know entertainment things that yeah those are great once you're here in town but what's going to get the people to come in here our housing obviously has an issue like star wars mentioned in that we have very low amount of houses that are for sale or in the market if they do a go in the market within a week they're already sold but they are houses that need a a lot of money to put into it and if you build a house you know obviously that's going to cost a lot more than build than buying a 200 000 home so so it is a it is an issue on that so we are addressing that we have contractors that are willing to uh to build homes but but they don't have the capital to do that so we are working with uh with ded with the nebraska affordable housing trust fund that you know and see if that's an avenue to perhaps if we get some funding we can do the infrastructure for the contractor and then maybe they can build the houses without any need from any financial need from them from the city another issue that we see in our community once we start talking about workforce jobs you know attracting people into our community is child care we don't have enough child care to to meet the needs of the people that are working in this industries some families are working in the morning you know the wife is working in the morning the husband is working at night and they're doing that so that way they don't have to have the expensive child care expense so that is something that we are looking into it uh dakota connections here in our town is a group of nonprofit organizations that are taking that on and see how they can help the communities as far as getting another you know facilities for child care or or anything that the companies may need so so those are the things that that we are seeing so so obviously it's uh working with the state and some of the funding and avenues that that they are out there they're great to work with and uh so we appreciate the fact that they're willing to work with us especially in these tight tough times so very good thank you oscar for your perspective there those of you who would like to ask a question or make a comment you can just go into the system there and and register your question and i will read it to the group um while you're doing that let me just say that you know that this workforce issue is um of course it was a challenge in another form uh last winter uh even before covet hit uh now there there's a new twist to it and so it's very important for us to to really at the federal level let me say really get this unemployment thing right um speaker pelosi her i think her highest priority is going back to the 600 a week unemployment enhancement i hear from employers all the time that that can be very damaging to a local economy actually in terms of what it does to the workforce into the workplace we have supply chain issues up and down the line talk to car dealers who can't get enough inventory i talked to appliance uh stores they can't get the inventory that they that they could otherwise sell so you know and it all boils down to workforce housing shortages that boils down to workforce issues as well so i'm glad that you guys are working overtime to to really get in there and and address the workforce challenges the the training that's needed and so forth so all right we have a couple questions here the first one from jill ping uh for leon uh jill says she has a client that received a ppp loan sole proprietor only and then died about one month later how does the estate handle the forgiveness application well okay leon you want to take that okay i've got it uh one of the things i suggested the estate go ahead and call our our office uh you know we get into a whole variety of details they're gonna end up having a file as any estate i i've been executive of a number of states and all of that they still need to go ahead and file a file on a timely basis too with the with the lender uh whoever the accountant whoever is the administrator of the state needs to go ahead and one first contact the bank and let them know uh the financial institution that this has happened and then we can walk them through the rest of the process that needs to be uh uh takes place the state ball will uh will file um and uh uh basically whatever records that they um the sole proprietor have that we'll use those to um uh get them released from the loan and all of that so yeah we we've had a number of those situations that have happened as in business transition but you know don't be afraid to call our office 402 221 46921 we've seen everything under the uh that possibly could happen has happened so um so much from what we what we see uh is uh so individual and there's other things that we may not be able to uh cover on in this uh conversation but we can handle that that's not a bad thing uh that it's not insurmountable we could take care of that for you that and and again leon um you want to give it just kind of an update on the overall forgiveness issue in general well uh uh yes what are the things we're still waiting for uh first of all our our lenders are taking um the application for forgiveness there's a number of different applications if you go onto sba.gov the kova 19 there are they there are outlines on forms if your sole proprietorship do not have a lot of employees there's an easy form so to speak there's another uh form also that there were that they're using and we're invent that you do have employees um but uh for loans generally under 150 000 worshipping seeing some individuals already uh have already uh applied with their financial institutions to get their uh their loan everything released and all that all of that uh i suggest uh as uh you know i've worked with the computer cpas out in the scottsbluffair area uh and we've talked about that because i talk across the state um go ahead and apply get everything ready my only concern and there's been a little bit of a hold back we were waiting to see if congress was going to go ahead and change the rules and do a total forgiveness on the uh in the event that somebody got an idol loan for a thousand dollars or ten thousand dollars so we were looking for possibly some of those changes and all of that but some of the financial institutions or business is being sold or there's been some other uh significant change so we'll take calls we'll take calls from businesses the accountants and and the bankers and that's one of the things we we do we're very good at taking phone calls and getting those uh questions answered for you you bet thank you uh we had another question from sean uh in terms of how many attendees on the line today versus yesterday that numbers vary a little bit throughout the the program uh but uh throughout the time but we uh in the 20s uh we've had consistently so appreciate your participation certainly other questions feel free to weigh in there certainly uh we want to encourage anyone to ask questions if you want more information and and um i i do want to uh elaborate a little bit more on on the workforce issue we had a hearing in the house a while back that focused on transitioning folks actually from when they were incarcerated into the workforce and actually though like for example the arizona home builders actually went into the arizona prison system and started training the prisoners while in prison so that they could be prepared for the workforce upon leaving the prison and we actually heard from a participant it was i mean it was really a fantastic perspective that he shared about uh how he went through the the training to be an electrician became that electrician uh got a job less than a week upon release from prison and immediately began seeing an increase in in wages i think he started at like 13 an hour and then quickly climbed into the 20s um just a fantastic story and then he he also shared you know not just about the paycheck but what it means you know what that dignity of work means and and providing for his family and being involved in the community and just so many different things that that are that are so important and an integral part of of why uh we we structure uh work the way we do and and the value of work and and what that what that means um any any questions if you don't mind i was just gonna um i forgot i've got all these notes here but um both of our high schools in scotts bluff and gearing um have career academies um gearing's in their second year and scott's bluff's been at it for maybe four years now but that is another great resource for um to get kids into apprenticeships and um get them into to working with some of the local businesses there's a lot of great partnerships here in scotts bluff and gearing where high school kids are actually working in some of our businesses and again go to them you know let the height both the high schools and the community colleges know what the need is in those high-wage jobs the there's a need for plumbers there's a need for electricians carpet layers you know all of those jobs that pay really well yeah they might start out at 13 an hour and you know again your example ending up at twenty dollars an hour that's where our grassroots program could help um pay that difference maybe they started at 15 you know we could pay that that difference in their their hourly wage for a while until they are go through this certification for to become a certified electrician and then also the department of labor has the certified apprenticeship programs we have two businesses here in this gus wolfgearing area that have become certified and we have a couple of others that are going through that now so there's a lot of resources out there [Music] another again thing that we did here in scott's bluff we had a facade improvement program for the southeast part of our community the city has put in about a hundred and excuse me 253 000 into that program it's a matching grant program it was up to ten thousand dollars it really helped um that corridor of our community so we're now opening it up to the entire uh community in our blighted and substandard area to apply for grants to help um improve the facade or the outside of their their business so and a lot of these will be small businesses that are that apply maybe a new coat of paint a new um just fixing up their facade and making them look more appealing i think will really also help the local businesses but we've seen a lot of innovation through this covid on you know especially the restaurants delivery pickup you know coffee shops all those kind of things a lot of the smaller businesses on main street have gone online and now are selling and selling their um their things online um that that weren't before um so there's been a lot of innovation out there right well i i think it's fair to say that uh downtown scott's bluff is alive and well and very vibrant and a lot a lot of choices for for customers so let's go to our next question here from dawson brunswick and what does the funding look like for those programs is it mainly local businesses funding it to further develop the future workforce school funds um and then some secret state and federal funding i don't know how about how secret that might be but uh from my perspective there's going to be a combination of uh of funds um would any of you want to elaborate on that with our program we're starting with local funds 250 000 from the city of scott's bluff and eventually you know we're looking at applying for funds to keep the program going including our economic development fund um just kind of kind of put it out there and see how it how it works and once we've kind of proven that the program works then we're hoping for buy-in from the employers in the area all right anyone else want to add to that on on our end i think we're just doing the same thing which is just the local funding from the city or the what we call the community development agency which is our economic development arm of the city and then we're reaching out to the companies to uh you know to make sure they let us know what they need so that way we can go to the state and say here's what the issues are and then they tell us what the avenues that we can take so that makes it easier for us to make sure that we nail down what they need and then go after those funds right very good another question here mentioning that both the oscar and star talked about partnerships and then asking what kind of advice on forming regional partnerships would you have in the promotion of jobs tourism economic development opportunities and so forth i can i can start on that um some of the partnerships that we're doing obviously for those who are on the on the sioux meeting if you don't know lance west he's one of the guys that thinks outside the box so he's always thinking of what's out there what can we do better than what we're doing now so so one of the things that we're doing we're partnering up with uh local tv stations so tv station pretty much has all the they can reach out to multiple communities uh so for example this tv station can just say well there's an industry that closed in the midwest they can target the city and just uh shoot a bunch of uh ads to social media tv ads radio stations things like that that you know obviously social media is huge on what they do if somebody's looking for a job uh they'll see uh they'll see our advertising saying why south su is a great place to move to and once they click on that obviously they'll see all of it all of our companies that are needing people to work and as well as having a promotional piece for the school system because that is uh that is obviously a huge piece in our community so so we are partnered with people that actually have the tools to reach out to other communities uh and uh and obviously have the industries or the school tell their side of the story of why they are such a great place to work for or why their kids should be in our community schools okay and to me economic development has always been about relationships so forming those relationships are are very crucial not only from service the service provider area you've got that that network but you also have to have reach out to the community and have those relationships with your business community so that they feel comfortable coming to you if they have some type of an issue and that that way you're aware and it doesn't catch you off guard um also the relationship with the school district is is huge so um forming those relationships and just checking in with everyone once in a while um really does not does not hurt at all and you know if there's if you've got an issue going on in in your community chances are someone in nebraska someone across the state has dealt with it before so i guess not don't ever be afraid to reach out and ask your peers for um for advice on different issues so you're not out there spinning your wheels and trying to invent the invent them excuse me reinvent the wheel that there's a lot of help out there from service organizations [Music] business development center again the rural enterprise assistance project um there's there is just all kinds of help out there and our area this is another thing that we're doing with the college with wncc and also the rural enterprise assistance project is we have about a 20 hispanic population here in our area and i really feel that um we're that we're missing an opportunity there for some entrepreneurship within with our young hispanic and hispanics and so we're going to have a leadership development series for um hispanics in our community so they're aware of how to start a business how to write a business plan and um those types of things i just think that that we're missing the boat and we have for many many years i've lived here all my life my life and i just don't think that outreach has been very strong so um that is one of my huge goals very good very good um oscar and star can you speak to perhaps you know the inquiries to your offices have they changed uh because of covet are you have you seen any surprise inquiries or something that you just didn't expect can can you speak to a little bit of what what that looks like given kobe oh go ahead go ahead oscar okay yeah um well the obviously the inquiries are still there as far as them opening up a new business or expansions but the the kind of the not knowing when to do it or whether to do it i think is where scares the the business owners so if somebody comes in and wants to do a new business here in town they inquire everything they have to do but once they get to the point that they have to pull the trigger they kind of hold back until things kind of settle down whatever that's going to be in the future but also they they always hear about cares act and there's funding available for businesses so the the education p piece becomes such a such a big piece of this because if people don't understand what that money is or who can apply for it or how it works it uh it puts it on us to make sure that we understand what kind of funding it is and who can apply for that so so we've seen that inquiries are there but at the same time they're thinking there's just money out there to be to get and anyone can get it which at that time is not not the case in most of the times i guess i've been really surprised and leon touched on it just briefly in his intro there's a lot of expansion going on with local businesses they're they're seeing the need to expand their businesses everything from service businesses to manufacturers and so that has been a really bright spot i mean we um closed our city office um starting on the 17th of march and didn't come back until june well i had my laptop at home and i actually worked seemed like i worked more hours from home than i did at the office because i could never shut it off and with us being in the mountain time zone the time difference people calling and those types of things um it's just it's been phenomenal here in western nebraska that it just hasn't stopped our projects just haven't stopped they've just continued and again a lot of expansions are happening a few new businesses but again the importance of the business retention and expansion visits to your um businesses sometimes now you can't do them in person but maybe over the phone or some type of a zoom zoom conference again keeping keeping in touch with those businesses is just vital very good very good um leon if you could comment just briefly on on workforce issues from your perspective is there anything that you think needs to be done or could be done to to address uh workforce issues or what what do you see uh with with your clientele uh relating to workforce issues that uh the rest of us uh could benefit from well uh oh i think we covered it fairly well but one of the things that we're seeing uh regarding workforce issues uh there's certain sectors some as people in the construction industry told me um across the state and we stayed pretty close to construction industry because we've seen so much uh growth in there uh in a 504 loan program there's an extra 10 million dollars in new projects went out this year in addition uh over and above what we would normally see so we had about 36 million dollars um if you've got a warm but if you're a warm body and your heartbeats and all that that and you have construction any of those skills you can get hired here because you know we see the change in the in there's just such a demand basically one of the things we've been telling individuals you've got to start an apprenticeship program and bring people in that is that's going to be the new new model and um the quote a friend of mine was a former chamber president and lincoln and it says you have to reach out to the other minority community and bring them in there's an opportunity what we're seeing i i have to have a step back a little bit i suggest you uh talk speaking with uh what is it uh zelda rendon in in grand island they've done a tremendous job of uh when it comes to skilled labor and getting businesses certified you know as electricians carpenters you know they're running a number of programs helping people start businesses uh workforce development is a a very big problem that is why this retention and growth is so important call the businesses reach out to them so we don't lose what we have right right now i other than that i have not seen any other magic bowl i i'm so much concerned about retaining what we have and not losing it and those businesses not not uh closing that's where we're getting uh we're getting the the calls right right now um and here's the other thing if you're hearing about somebody who's got a business is going to close hopefully they're doing some type of uh the areas doing some type of labor uh re-employment programs so they can find these individuals jobs uh quickly so they don't move out of the air area and all of that and don't go on unemployment only that you know most nebraskans i know we all prefer to work rather than be on unemployment so uh other than that i have not seen any any uh magic bullets uh so to speak all right let's see we have another question here uh or a comment uh from sean caskey his colleague sandra barrera is great at engaging the hispanic business community with a link there just gave a presentation on the topic a recorded presentation in a multi-state conference so can let shawn know sean caskey no if uh if you'd like more information there so appreciate that sean again that was sandra barrera b-a-r-r-e-r-a uh for any of you who want to take that down and then sean can uh also get you more information as well i appreciate that you know it's it's interesting as as we are trying to deal with the issues at the federal level um you take personal protective equipment obviously and a hugely important uh item uh throughout all of covid you know it's um it didn't happen overnight but basically all the manufacturing of that equipment found its way to china and um and i will say that you know with all that being manufactured in china china doesn't even have to act maliciously for that to be a problem during a worldwide pandemic and so i i'm hoping that we can be poised across our country to be able to bring a lot of that back and and i think we've got better trade policy now uh than we had two or three years ago uh i think that um you know we we should have an available workforce hopefully that you know they'll there will be some transition from some previous industries pre-covet uh to to what i see as opportunities moving forward that's why i want to reiterate that we we better get the unemployment policy right uh and for the workforce moving forward but i think that coupled with technology and innovation can enable entrepreneurs across america to provide for example the ppe uh for an affordable amount and with with automation and available labor we we can be very competitive on the cost of the output that china has previously uh you know that's the cost of labor over there is what is what drew so much of the manufacturing to to china but things are different now and i think uh value is placed on on other other issues uh rather than just the bare minimum cost and so we want to make sure that we we get our tax policy right too um being on the ways and means committee and handling tax policy international trade policy and a lot of workforce issues i i think we can we can get some things done the likely chairman of the ways and means committee will continue to more than likely continue to be richie neil a democrat from massachusetts he's good to work with i i think he is someone who who wants to get to yes uh on various things we are going to look at a family savings issues i believe uh that's a major issue across america of what can we do to get families households individuals to think more about their financial future that touches so many parts of our economy and begins with work for workforce once again fairly basic so i i'm encouraged to hear uh some of the positive things we've we've heard here this morning uh that um that you guys are are working on and i know uh obviously with the wide expanse of the third district we couldn't have a panelist from every county on the line here this morning but i know a lot of great things are are happening so certainly encourage any of you to to share what you observe whether it's in your own community or or wherever you might be or whatever you have observed elsewhere please please let us know so i really appreciate once again our panelists leon starr and oscar thank you for what you do i know you've been busy and so much has been happening i know star you mentioned how you still got a lot of work done from home that's a new dynamic across the workforce as well and so uh we as policymakers so we'll need to need to acknowledge that and i think above all be flexible with with what our policies are understanding that in order to encourage innovation and creativity there needs to be flexibility so uh and again thank you to all of our participants here today for engaging and we look forward to keeping in touch if you do have questions or or comments that you need to bring to our attention please feel free to do so on the line here today is jared from the grand island office many of you know jared from his work out and around the district and then also josh jackson is on the line as well he's my deputy chief of staff out of the washington office and so a lot is happening it'll be an interesting next few months but i i really believe that there is an anxiousness and in communities all across america to really grow our economy get folks back to work uh innovate in in ways that we we never imagined before but as we know necessity is the mother of invention as the old saying goes and that that can bring about some very good things i i wouldn't wish for our country to be in this situation right now with covid but i do think we there's a lot that we can take away from it whether it's innovation in the healthcare sector whether it's creativity and an expansion in the in the business sector who would have thought that there would be record rv sales uh with with that part of our economy being shut down and and yet that has that's just one example of others that um that are out there that have have uh some unintended or kind of some surprise impacts from folks uh just living life differently than they did before covet so again feel free to let us know if you have questions or concerns or want more information just my website for my official office is adrian smith.house.gov let us know how we can be helpful and we we want to get folks back to work because that's that's how you shape a better future and that's how communities become stronger in our in our country as a whole as well so thanks again to all of our panelists and our attendees and please keep in touch and hopefully we'll be able to meet in person one day soon so thanks again and take care

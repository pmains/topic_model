better deal is founded on strong values fueled by fresh ideas you will hear what Democrats have heard from the American people across the country Democrats know a better deal for hard-working men and women demands bigger braver sting to create jobs and raise incomes for American workers by creating good-paying jobs for 10 million more Americans in the next five years to lower the cost of living by taking unprecedented actions to lower the cost of prescription drugs and by cracking down on the monopolies that raise costs for our families and her competition going up on our small farm in New Mexico we didn't have much money but my family's journey taught me something important in America hard work and a good job is all you should need to experience the American dream Democrats will invest in education and job training invest in transportation and infrastructure invest in research and development invest in technology and innovation and invest in the American people we will not rest until every single American across this great land has a better deal better jobs better wages and a better future I think we need to harken back to the days where people understand that Democrats are the party that fight for hard-working men and women this agenda which we announced today which is an agenda both from the house and Senate came about as a result of doing a lot of listening listen to our members for home every weekend listening to their constituents and really understand that it's important that voters in the American people hear what Democrats are committed to do the racing school ages to create good-paying jobs that people have a bright future and the American people deserve a better deal one that puts hardworking families first again this means building an economy where people can pursue the dignity of a good paying job it means rewarding the small-business owner for her hard work an entrepreneurship it means skill training and investing in the future through apprenticeship programs and community colleges as well as making four-year college more affordable we're not only fighting the Democrats we're fighting for the country we're fighting for economic security for jobs but for living wages for health care [Music]

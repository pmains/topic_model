thank you madam chairman uh welcome administrator regan uh i want to talk uh as did mr padilla about some air issues in 1977 congress added section 169 a to the clean air act that section established as a national goal the prevention of any future and the remedying of any existing impairment in visibility in mandatory class 1 areas which impairment results from man-made air pollution in 1999 epa issued its first regional haze rule requiring states to submit plans that include measures necessary to make reasonable progress towards meeting the national visibility goal the rules been amended a couple times and epa is in the process of receiving reviewing and acting on the second round of state haze plans so this is a program to improve visibility is that correct administrator regan yes so would you agree that visibility continues to show improvements in our nation's class one areas and in fact visibility has significantly improved in most of the west is that correct i believe that's correct well thanks for your answers you know i'm i'm a little concerned that this administration is turning a program that was clearly intended to address visibility instead as a means to advance climate goals which congress has never given epa the authority to do the focus should be on visibility thank you so um another question on ozone transport the epa claims that it's committed to return scientific integrity to the agency but in 2015 under president obama the epa said in the federal register that the epa would not apply the cross-state air pollution rule or casper without first evaluating additional criteria specific to the west they recognize that applying a primarily eastern state program on the west required additional analysis some of the differences between east and west one of which was just acknowledged by mr padilla includes wildfire ramifications background concentrations altitude topography meteorology international contributions from asia and elsewhere so what western specific ozone transport studies has epa completed since that 2015 proposal i'm not quite sure if i understand the question in terms of are you looking for a specific study or are you looking at the way we approach the program because i think the program has been approached as a nationwide program so taking a look at all of the data that we've collected from 2015 up until to date and then looking at what the clean air act is requiring that epa do in terms of reducing that ozone pollution i think that's what you're seeing in the rules that we're proposing now are there any are you aware of any western specific ozone transport studies and if and and if you're not that's fine i'll submit this in writing to you so you can you know go and and check with your uh what i can say is we have considered the latest and greatest science data and and and so my assumption is if there is a specific study out there we've considered it but more importantly i think we've considered all of the data especially peer-reviewed or data with scientific integrity as we've decided to make these decisions okay well and i am anxious to find out whether uh epa engaged stakeholders to participate in and review any such studies it sounds like they have so i'll i'll just submit uh in writing a little request to look at some of the western specific data so thanks on that okay now i want to talk a little bit about a small refinery exemption so right now on the other side of the capitol building there's a hearing in the house energy committee talking about uh oil and gas prices at the pump uh and blaming the oil and gas companies so we've kind of gone from listening to some in this administration saying first they don't control the price of gas then they say president putin's response putin's responsible and now oil companies are responsible i'm having trouble keeping straight who's responsible now president biden has said he will use every tool at his disposal and he'll work like the devil to bring prices down so i want to make a suggestion of something that would help rather than asking dictators like maduro in venezuela or iran that shouts death to america to produce more oil has the epa considered simply granting relief under the rfs program because analysts are saying that that adds somewhere between 30 and 50 cents a gallon and and it would be an easy way to quickly um relax uh and relieve gas prices has that come up well i i think what i would say to two points the first is i'm would say i'm not quite in agreement that uh this relief would have that impact on on gas prices but what more importantly i'd like to point to uh the the law and and what the law specifies in terms of uh sres and i think um we've learned um in the past four to six years where the agency actually has legal authority to uh to to give these sres um i i think the 10th circuit recently spoke on how we look at these economic hardships and who qualifies for these sres and so you know i would say that the agency has taken a very close look at sres and what flexibilities we have and what we've learned from the past in terms of what the courts have told us we can and cannot do oh well thank you mr reagan i'm over time thank you i wish other agencies by the way would pay attention to their legal authority like the requirement that the department of the interior shall issue oil and gas leases every quarter anyway thank you i yield back yes

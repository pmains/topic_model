R CONGRESSWOMAN JACKIE WALORSKI. >> AND LET'S WELCOME IN CONGRESSWOMAN JACKIE WALORSKI NOW. CONGRESSWOMAN, THANK YOU FOR TAKING SOME TIME. WHY DON'T WE START WITH THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S MANDATE VACCINE WISE?  >> SENATOR BROWN. I KNOW PUSHING TO PUT AN END TO IT. YOU ALSO HAVE A BILL THAT WOULD ALSO DO THE SAME. >> WHY DO YOU THINK THIS ISN'T GOOD? >> OH MY GOSH, THIS IS DEVASTATING AND OBVIOUSLY WE'RE HEARING FROM HOOSIERS BECAUSE WE REPRESENT HOOSIERS. BUT YOU WE'VE BEEN CRUSHED OUR OFFICE HAS BEEN CRUSHED WITH SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS, CEOS, YOU NAME IT WORKERS, T.S.A. PEOPLE, PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE, ALL KINDS OF PLACES LITERALLY GOING TO LOSE THEIR JOB. AND YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER SEEN IN MY LIFETIME A PRESIDENT OR AN ADMINISTRATION THAT LOOKS FOR WAYS TO PEOPLE TO LOSE THEIR JOBS OR GET FORCED OUT OF THEIR COMPANIES OVER SOMETHING LIKE THIS KIND OF MANDATE. YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY UNCONSTITUTIONAL. I WILL SAY THIS WITH OSHA'S ANNOUNCEMENT YESTERDAY OF HAVING TO STAY BECAUSE THE COURTS TOLD THEM TO STAY AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GO IN AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO ROLL THIS PROGRAM OUT. WHAT A RELIEF.  THAT'S THE BEST NEWS I'VE HEARD IN A WEEK OR A MONTH. BUT LET ME TELL IS SOMETHING THE IN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY, THE HEALTH CARE WORKERS ARE LOOKING THROUGH HHS AT SOME JUST UNBELIEVABLE PARAMETERS THAT THEY HAVE TO BE FOUND WITHIN AND IT'S DEVASTATING TO HOOSIER HOSPITALS AND NURSING HOMES AND WE'RE FIGHTING THAT ONE RIGHT NOW. >> LET ME PLAY DEVIL'S ADVOCATE HERE BECAUSE DEMOCRATS WILL POINT TO THE FACT THAT THEY ALSO HAVE A TESTING PROPONENT AS WELL MEANING YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET VACCINATED. >> YOU COULD GET TESTED AS LONG AS YOU CAN PROVE YOUR YOU'RE NEGATIVE. >> YOU COULD STILL COME TO WORK YOUR THOUGHTS. WELL, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE IT A PRIORITY TO NOT WORK WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND WORK TO KEEP THEM EMPLOYED.  YOU KNOW, THIS NATION LOST MORE JOBS IN SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER THAN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY. SO I WOULD SAY WHAT I EXPECT OF ANY ADMINISTRATION THIS ONE OR ANY OTHER ADMINISTRATIONS THAT KEEP PEOPLE CONNECTED HELP THEM FIND JOBS, HELP THEM KEEP THEIR JOBS, HELP THEM BUILD BACK THE AMERICAN DREAM THAT THEY HAD BEFORE COVID THE LAST THING WE NEED IS TO SLOW DOWN THIS ECONOMY TO PUT PEOPLE'S HEALTH IN JEOPARDY AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW. BUT GOOD NEWS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. I DON'T BELIEVE IN ANY FEDERAL MANDATES AND I AND I NEVER WILL AND THIS IS NO EXCEPTION. LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BE T

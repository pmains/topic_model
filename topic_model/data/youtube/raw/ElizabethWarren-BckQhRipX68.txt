wealthy folks are having a root of a much having a much easier time getting access to that money that was designated by Congress then regular folks working you know smaller businesses what can be done about that so look I think of this as the central question around oversight and Donald Trump has a view on oversight he doesn't want any he doesn't want anyone looking over his shoulder he doesn't want anyone examining how he spends taxpayer money or whether he's fulfilled his obligations as president to keep us safe in the middle of a pandemic so Donald Trump doesn't want any part of that he's fired an IG he's put his cronies in charge they didn't fire his eye geez and he can put his cronies in charge but he can't fire a Free Press you can't fire Congress and he sure can't fire me so we're on top of him and we're gonna stay on top of him for oversight and that means oversight about how he's managing this pandemic and how he's managing the money that Congress has appropriated to try to help restart this economy right now what we're really pushing hard for is to get information hard data about where that money is going and to make sure that that money is not just once again in a bailout going to the tree-tops but that the money is truly going to the grassroots to the small businesses that both desperately need and that are the real backbone of our economy and that we need to keep alive so that they can help restart this economy as our health conditions permit it

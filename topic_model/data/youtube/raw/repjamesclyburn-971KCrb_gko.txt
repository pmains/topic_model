the air was decision is a decision that they studied in law schools all over the country dealing with the issue of breach of the peace that case grew out of an incident that took place in Columbia South Carolina March 1961 I along with I think 287 other students met in Columbia and were arrested for marching on the Statehouse under the auspices that what we were doing was a breach of the peace that casement all the way to the a state Supreme Court the court overturned the decision and of course reverse our arrests now the interesting thing about this is the fact that I was one of the participants but also it's the day I tell everybody that I learned a tremendous lesson when we were will gather that day together that Zion Baptist Church on Washington Street in Columbia to carry out this march on that particular day I decided that I was not going to go to jail I've been to jail on often enough and I didn't particularly want to go to jail on this particular day so when we gathered to March I went to Columbia that day from Augsburg where my latest ball three piece olive green suit go straight to the pagelet time and when Reverend Newman are the quenching them when who was the executive the Secretary of a field secretary the n-double-a-cp at the time now saw me dressed that way he knew there was not the way I was to be addressed if I were planning to test that case by going to jail and so he talked me into leading a group of high school students the high school that I graduated from Mathur Academy and I made a deal with those students that I would lead them on the March but then when we were ordered to turn around we would all turn around they made that deal except that we got now then was in front of the sit house and we were ordered to turn around none of them would agree as you turn around and all of us got locked up in jail now while we were there waiting to get bailed out he was like 2 o'clock in the morning one of those students said to me that he he was getting a little bit anxious about being in jail and he was enough for me when we gonna get out and I said to him I says well if you're gonna get out maybe by morning Reverend Newman is out there is in the bail money and as soon as he does he'll he'll get us out and so he walked away came back a little late and said my client who did you say gonna be after raising the bail money and he said I said revenue he said well is he that little man with the goatee and I said yeah he's we back over in that corner over yonder well it turns out the rubber Newman he was locked up also and as a result he was three days later before we got out of jail I learned on that day that all of us have brawls of play my role was to go to jail reven Newman's role was arrested by Avogadro's mixed up and therefore the case of itlet's against South Carolina in which I participated as one of those arrested was not just a land mob court decision for me it was also a tremendous lesson in what roles we ought to play and how not to confuse the roles you

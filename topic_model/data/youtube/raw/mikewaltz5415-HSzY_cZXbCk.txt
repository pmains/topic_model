the governor of california is gavin newsom he's running ads in florida targeting governor desantis he wants to woo residents back to california look who's here congressman mike waltz he is a floridian and he joins me now newsom says he's offering freedom what's your response to that and stop laughing yes dude hey happy birthday uh never complain about getting older it beats the alternative but listen what a joke i mean he he ran these ads over the fourth of july it's the last thing floridians want to want to see is him basically begging uh all of the californians that are fleeing i mean they're fleeing california in the rate they're going to lose a representative in congress after this census for the first time in their history i have three new neighbors from california and they aren't going anywhere governor destantis has kept our schools open our economy open and our city safe and that's why you're seeing a thousand a day flow in and we're re-registering them to vote here where their vote counts not absentee from massachusetts illinois california where they came from but the person that should be paying attention to uh to these ads is joe biden because watch that watch those primaries coming from his left uh in 2024 big deal right there quickly britain is one of our strongest allies boris johnson out does this change anything well i think that the scandals are a shame really because the relationship was in a good place the johnson administration was strong on china uh strong leading uh way ahead of the bite administration on ukraine and most importantly we were this close to a bilateral trade deal uh it's amazing that we don't have a bilateral trade deal with our closest ally now that they've had brexit uh and they've gotten out of the european union so i hope we can keep those things going uh with whoever replaces them and i would love to see a member of parliament uh tougandot uh who's a fellow afghan vet and i think with the world on fire uh we need tom tugando to take that uh to take the realm over there in the uk all right let's see how that transpires congressman always a pleasure thanks so much for being with us good stuff

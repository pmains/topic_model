hello I'm Congressman John Lewis and I represent a fifth District of Georgia Oh Monday our nation woke up to the news the worst mass shooting in our history at least 58 people will kill over 500 were injured all because an evil disturbed man was able to get his hands on a dozen deadly weapons and turned him on a crowd of innocent but I think a Las Vegas when I think of Newton and Trustin and Orlando and a rover my heart breaks gun violence is the daily epidemic a daily drumbeat of tragic in families and communities across America not always on the front pages but always someone your placeable and the love 90 Americans are killed every day every year we lose more than 30,000 men women and children to gun violence what would it take for the Republican Congress to wake up they hold moments of silence and visual they offer thoughts and prayers but they do nothing and when the medium moves on they peddle the lie that we need more guns to stop the violence and they try to rollback protection that keep our community safe I know I've been around I've seen too many guns death and I've seen too much Republican in action and obstruction and I'm here to say this must stop and it must stop now Democrats know that we what must be done their way forward is clear we call it on our Republican colleagues to join and take some simple steps to end epidemic that is killing Americans every day fresh Republican must walk away from a radical dangerous bill they were opened the floodgates to silencer and armed fears bullets second they must work with us to pass the bipartisan King Thomason field which was strengthened the life-saving background checks to keep guns out of the wrong hands third you must work with us to ban the sale a bump stop a deadly tool that enable a shooter to spray murderers automatic fire at a rate of full to 800 rounds a minute just as the shooter in Las Vegas did and finally they must join us an established about partisan Select Committee on gun violence to study and prevent the daily tragedies of gun violence but Republican have not lifted a finger they have not done one single thing to combat this crisis and worse they are refusing to even begin a bipartisan process to address the gun violence epidemic how many more husband and wives brothers and sisters friends and neighbors must die before the Republican Congress Act how many more sons and daughters will be ripped away from their parents how many more mothers and fathers will be stolen from young children the families of victims deserve more than Republican empty words and moments of silence they deserve action good common-sense proposals already on the table we invite our Republican colleagues to take a seat and work with us or real action to stop Collins I said this to my Republican colleagues we were elected to lead we were elected to be head lice another taillight we can have be silent we cannot be complacent we cannot wait for the next shooting let us this time be different let us make a down payment on any gun violence in America let us do our job let us bring common-sense gun legislation to a vote now

well thank you mr. chairman and thank you ambassador for your service to our country and for being here today a UN Security Council resolution 23 34 was an anti-israel anti-jewish resolution seeking to ethnically cleanse Judea and Samaria and East Jerusalem is it an accurate summary of your observations since taking over as ambassador that some of the nations that voted for this resolution were resentful some were apologetic and it appears to have been us-led and u.s. pushed they I talked to all of the Security Council members and told them how offended and what a kick in the gut it was for Americans what I got was some felt very arm twisted by the u.s. others thought it was the right thing to do and then you know the hard part about me talking with two three three fours they keep telling me well it's the u.s. that wanted it's us that wanted it so it's hard for me at this point I'm just saying there's a new administration this is not where we want to go and so now they don't talk to me about it because they know it's such a sore subject with us and your testimony is confirmation that the US was engaging in dangerous ugly backstabbing of our nation at nations ally in Israel and we abstained and when Ben Rhodes and others were on a conference call and this is in the White House records of quoting verbatim when asked why we abstained Ben Rhodes the taxpayer-funded White House fiction writer says quote we abstained as Samantha explained for a number of reasons first the United Nations we continue to believe is a flawed venue for this issue in that it has frequently been used to single out Israel not only was that effort us-led and us pushed but then publicly we were abstaining and we were abstaining for the reason that I just quoted from Ben Rhodes and I really appreciate your testimony to help clear the record in the history on that well and if I could just add I respect Samantha power and have and appreciate her service very much but that was one of our lowest points in our country with what happened because the international community when they saw that we went against an ally it set off a terrible tone in terms of where we're gonna go and just to let you know how bad it was when she abstained the entire Security Council and the audience got up and applauded and Israel was sitting there with their wife watching that think about what we just did to a friend what happened you don't ever applaud in the Security Council it never happens it happened that day and I think it's clear from anyone in Israel who would be listening to your testimony here today that you have the back of America's allies you understand that we should be strengthening a relationship with our friends I'm treating our adversaries as our adversaries and I'm very happy that you're there I do want to ask about the tailor force act which has now grown bipartisan support in Congress which would withhold aid to the Palestinian Authority until it stops inciting violence and financially rewarding terrorists a policy otherwise known as pay to slay have you taken any position or able to share with regards to what your opinion is on the Taylor force act so I think that with the family and yes I'm very vocal about the fact that the u.s. gives bilateral money to the Palestinian Authority and we need to have a strong conversation with them on how these martyr payments have to stop and I think that it's one of those things that by us giving money we're supporting it and we have to make that correlation with them and let them know that that's not something that we're going to accept or do do going forward and I think it's great that you did meet with the family tailor force this isn't as an Israeli it's an American who graduate from the United States Military Academy and I appreciate your leadership my remaining time I'm gonna yield to the gentleman from South Carolina

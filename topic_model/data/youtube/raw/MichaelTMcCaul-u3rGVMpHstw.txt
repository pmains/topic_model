like mccall of texas thank you thank you mr chairman um secretary kerry the the countries that know iran the best this agreement the most and the reasons why are that for the following reasons it lacks a necessary verification measures to ensure iran does not cheat it lists the restrictions on iran's intercontinental ballistic missiles which the ayatollah himself said they will mass produce the international sanctions on the iran's revolutionary guard corps its terror arm will be relieved in the european sanctions this deal could also my judgment spark a nuclear arms race in the middle east as the saudis told me when i recently visited there and as chairman of the homeland security committee what concerns me the most is this deal frees up hundreds of billions of dollars to the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism susan rice the president's national security advisor said quote we should expect that some portion of that money will go to the uranium military and could potentially be used for the kinds of bad behavior that we've seen in the region and now you're asking this congress to endorse an agreement that the president's own national security advisor admits will spread terror in the region finally iran's deputy foreign minister confirmed we will provide weapons to whomever and whenever we consider appropriate and we will buy weapons from wherever we can chairman royce and i sent a letter as served to you and the president united states asking you to first submit this deal for consideration by the american people through the representatives first before this deal was submitted to the united nations but instead you went around the congress and the american people submitted this to the united nations and then china russia and venezuela got a chance to vote on this and approve this agreement before we've had a chance to deliberate my question is this if the congress overrides the president's veto what effect effect would that have on this deal in other words would it kill the deal yes we've said that many times come back to your earlier comment um but let's just try this is a very important point will the un and eu sanctions be lifted and that will relieve iran of these burdens or would if if we override the president's veto would it collapse the entire international deal the um the sanctions rely on the international community's participation to be able to enforce them our sanctions alone did not do the job alone it wasn't until we went out and worked with other countries diligently china for instance in order to persuade them not to buy x amount of oil countries in the middle east and not be trading underneath the table or otherwise there are a lot of different things necessary to make these sanctions work if the united states unilaterally through congressional decision uh pulls away from this deal they're not going to continue to apply those sanctions they have no reason to they're gone they've already said they're gone and with respect to saudi arabia there was a ap article the other day when ash carter visited saudi arabia saudi arabia's foreign minister said iran's nuclear deal appears to have the provisions needed to curtail iran's ability to obtain a nuclear weapon well i i i'm a times i've heard otherwise from science but let me just that's very important for us very publicly for us in the congress to understand that if we override the president's veto it will stop this entire agreement i think that's important for us members of congress i've got one more question it's been debated by the secretary lou and yourself that that you did not approve the delisting of the kutz force commander the iranian terror arm from the european sanctions list that was i'm looking at the agreement right here they're taking off the list of the european list which is an agreement that was approved by you the kudz force who was killed they killed americans in iraq and afghanistan what do i gold star mothers back home whose children were killed by these iranian forces and tell them that this agreement will take them off the list tell them that the united states of america will continue to keep the sanctions on him specifically he remains designated by our country and we will not ever lift them and that the united states will be pushing back on them but look here's what i mean my final question is this too this is a secret deal between the iaea and iran there's no secret we've never seen this are you going to present that to the congress there's no secret deal there is an agreement which is the normal process of the iaea where they negotiate a confidential agreement as they do with all countries between them and the country and that exists we have briefed on it are you going to know it if that's the congress we don't have it it is not have you seen have you seen it we have had been briefed on it i have not personally seen it but can i just say something you know we hear these complaints we hear well this agreement doesn't do this doesn't stop their terror this agreement is going to give them some money this agreement's going to do this what this agreement is supposed to do is stop them from having a nuclear weapon now i want to hear somebody tell me how they're going to do that we're going to go to the disagreement secretary we're going to go to mr william keating of massachusetts the gentleman's

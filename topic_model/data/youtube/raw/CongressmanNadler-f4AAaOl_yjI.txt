Speaker I rise in support of a clean homeland security appropriations bill we're just the weekend to the new Congress and the Republicans are already back to their old games but this time they're playing politics with the security and safety of the nation we get it they are frustrated with the president's executive order which attempts to reunite families and bring a rational priority based approach to our immigration system given the Constitution the laws and the legal precedents the president's actions are clearly well within his executive powers they don't like it they can pass an immigration bill which would clearly supersede the actions of the presidents but they won't even try and that's what this is all about it's about making false statements about the president demonizing immigrants and their families and trying to score political points back home that's a disgrace but it gets even worse not only are the Republicans stalling and immigration reform and leaving millions of families in limbo they're holding up funding for the entire Homeland Security Department they're threatening the safety of Americans at our airports they are making our borders less secure and potentially leaving us more vulnerable to attack this is particularly shocking given the tragic events in Paris last week holding the security of the American people hostage to the demands of the anti-immigration fringe of their party is totally responsible this is not the time for political games we live in a dangerous world and the security of the nation is serious business reject this political stunt pass a clean homeland security bill that we all agree on and then if you want to pass an immigration bill that would supersede what the president has done but don't give us all this nonsense about blackmailing the country by threatening our safety by saying unless we get the immigration provisions we want which we know the president won't sign there will be no homeland security bill and potentially no Homeland Security Department funding and no homeland no guards at our borders that is absurd

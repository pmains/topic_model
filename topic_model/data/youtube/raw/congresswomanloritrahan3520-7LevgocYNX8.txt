well good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us uh for today's discussion on the resources available to you as we continue to combat the coronavirus pandemic i'm grateful to be joined today by the incredible leaders of community teamwork a community action agency that provides services to strengthen communities and reduce poverty in the greater lowell region before i introduce our incredible panelists i'd like to briefly give everyone an update on where we are in the fight against covid19 right now massachusetts is in phase two of reopening meaning we have hit thresholds to continue the process of slowly getting back to a sense of normalcy but today 107 000 people in the commonwealth have tested positive for the virus nearly 89 000 have recovered and sadly we've lost 7 900 people to the virus these numbers are daunting for all of us and each one represents a personal story of either triumph or tragedy the number of new cases and hospitalizations has been declining which has allowed us to reopen certain businesses and begin to gradually leave our homes wearing a mask however much of the economic devastation created by this pandemic remains tens of millions of americans are still out of work and their bills are piling up as congress continues to push the senate towards the negotiating table to get another round of relief passed it's important that you know what services are available to you and your families through incredible organizations like community teamwork for those of you who haven't worked with them in the past cti has been a staple of greater lowell since it was founded in 1965 with the mission of reducing poverty by delivering vital services and collaborating with key stakeholders to create opportunities in housing education and economic development cti is the second largest community action agency in massachusetts one of a network of 23 human services caas across the commonwealth who provide support to the most vulnerable in 2019 alone cti provided assistance to more than 54 000 people in 63 towns and communities in middlesex and six counties i'm hopeful that this conversation will allow you to help even more folks in need especially as we continue to rebuild our economy and get people back to work i'm proud of the progress that we've made getting organizations like cti additional funding for their programs and make them available remotely during the coronavirus pandemic in fact in the cares act we were able to secure a billion dollars for the community services block grant and an increase in eligibility to 200 of poverty that eligibility increase was a big priority of karen's and her teens and why we pushed so hard for it 3.5 billion dollars for the child care and development block grant 750 million for head start programs and 900 million for ly heap securing even more federal investments in community action agencies remains a top priority of mine as we continue our work to get another relief package through the congress and signed into law so with that being said i want to thank you again for being here with me today and thank you to the folks who are tuning in live i'll turn it over now to karen frederick the chief executive officer of community teamwork and a dear friend who can tell us a little bit more about the organization's work and introduce our expert panelists thank you so much lori and i am so grateful that you are my congresswoman um and that we work closely uh with you and your office and for all of the resources that are coming from the federal government and from our partners in state government and from our local government partners as well to deal with the effects of covid 19 in our communities and as you said we've been doing this work a very long time and are really positioned well to deliver resources quickly uh in our community and i want to tell you a little bit about why that is so we've really revamped our organization over the last probably five years to be an organization that people can come in any door and we have a holistic look at the needs of a person coming in so because we do housing which is carl howell's division and homeless services and we do early education and care in megan's division and in connie's we do fuel assistance and nutrition assistance and all of our resources come together in our community resource division that connie martin oversees so a long time ago we really decided that we could always run individual programs and help people or we could really help people define their pathway forward in life and help them meet that the goals that they chose for their own families and that's really the path we've taken so when people come in we look at an integrated holistic approach to the needs that people have we do a brief assessment of needs and then we really help them link to the services they need so for our traditional services people can come in and get fuel assistance still and get on we're doing it all remotely um but they can also find out what are the other resources that we have in the same call and what their eligibility is and what will help them and we know covid 19 has hit our communities hard with unemployment with people struggling to run their businesses with lack of access to education and we know there's a disparate impact to the results of cog19 for our very low income people they didn't have tablets and and the tools to educate at home so we quickly get some of those resources out to people so our job is to really look at the community needs and act and to be a catalyst for social change and we really take that part of our mission very seriously so as new resources have come in we've been able to very quickly ramp up we've had the capacity and i every time i have the opportunity i think rit i thank our i.t staff because they had already helped us get to laptops and tablets that people could take home they very quickly transitioned us to remote work so all of our services kept going and they're still going we've added additional resources to it so we want to make sure that people know we're here that people of even a higher income who we were not able to help before we can help them with the new resources that have a higher income level and in some communities where we have not had as many uh needs there are more needs and we want to make sure we link with those people so we want to make sure we're accessible uh that people know our services and that they can access them easily so we're very grateful to have this opportunity to talk to to you and to the public about how people can access and what our services are terrific um so can i just launch right into the questions absolutely you know i've uh i've been amazed at how agile uh you've been and you know i grew up uh sort of watching cti just deliver unbelievable uh services to the community and well beyond uh greater lowell but i'm wondering because i you know sometimes we use the acronyms or we take for granted that people know exactly what services you provide uh could you just give like an overview of to folks of the types of services you provide and then how is how are you uniquely positioned uh to respond to the coronavirus pandemic so do you want to each do it do you want me to just do an overview what makes the most sense um maybe if you each talk about your division services it will kind of give people the overview and then i can kind of bring it back to how we're positioned so carl do you want to start with housing and homelessness uh sure uh so the services we provide in our division uh really focus on uh homeless prevention rehousing and stabilization services for uh individuals and families uh that's broken up into i would say three different departments um my first apartment that i talked about is our emergency assistance uh shelter for families and so we serve 127 families uh in the in the commonwealth uh providing them emergency shelter case management and supportive services uh to help help re-house them using various uh state funding as well as privating um [Music] then on our then along that continuum we also uh do permanent housing uh which is subsidized housing section 8 and massachusetts rental vouchers we have about 36 to 3 700 vouchers across the commonwealth that we administer and provide supportive services to and then our third department is our youth services and in our youth services which is our newest department about two years old now we basically provide emergency assistance to uh youth that are in transition or in crisis that would be 16 to 24 year olds specifically that we provide rapid rehousing supports case management food insecurity supports and just come some some guidance underneath that umbrella is also our youth build program which the community might be very familiar with that provides vocational leadership and educational training for our youth again 26 to 24 years old where they walk away with high school equivalency as well as certification in a specific trade that we primarily focus on is construction and culinary arts and megan simbore does our early learning division so megan yes so in our early learning division we service approximately 1400 families across the the greater lowell area through a mixed delivery system we have school age programming we're in seven uh school age sites we service approximately 500 children we have a family child care system through which we service approximately 300 children and then we have our early learning center-based care um which services approximately 600 children the children and center-based are zero to five it's also our head start in early head start programming and we do have home-based early head start home visiting services as well um so we do provide transportation to all of the children in our programs um you know we really do look at you know the the full comprehensive service approach to to supporting our children and families it is early education and care however all of the assessments and work that that karen has already referenced you know we are consistently working with our families you know if we're supporting those families and those children that are going to get off to the to the right start so we're making sure that we're supporting them with all of their health needs we're supporting them with transportation as well as we have our own kitchen and are able to provide full meals and nutrition services to all of the children in our programs i've seen some of them they're beautiful centers oh they're beautiful and as megan knows you know we believe when families do better children do better so that is why it's a holistic approach to the entire family and connie martin is our community resources leader and she can tell you about community resources and you can do the you're the glue that holds us all together right connie so you can do the the how this all why we're positioned i can't pull off that [Laughter] but i as i do say you know with within the community resources division we really are uh the programming that we offer really takes families as they connect through through the housing homeless services division through child and family and we kind of provide many of those wrap around services that really are you know kind of once a family is stable these programs are able to kind of help them take those next steps forward as karen mentioned kind of in their own in their own way and based on their own goals um when we talk about some of the specific services our fuel assistance programs weatherization programs both federally funded uh very appreciative of the the increases to those funds um that you know and those are the ways that we're able to keep you know we have upwards of 10 000 families that we can keep safe in their homes during the winter months um we also provide that servicing that service all year round uh so that's one of the the kind of key bricks that we can use for building these supports around around families our wic program also federally funded through the state government you know providing nutrition services nutrition education as well as actual food security for children from zero to five uh his you know servicing again our program alone is at about 5 300 children who receive those services um at that critical time of life uh where those investments in nutrition really have a huge impact um and then we get you know we have again a kind of range of services that we build from there our financial education center has interplay with all of our different programs working to ensure that families are making the best decisions for themselves um you know we we have certified credit repair specialists we have student loan specialists we have uh individuals who've gone through training for uh behavioral social work based on financial decision making uh so that as we're doing our one-on-one budget counseling and helping people make those choices they have the most current up-to-date information um our volunteer center uh which has been part of the agency for over 50 years it was one of the founding programs of community teamwork we're working with over 350 seniors who are volunteering in various aspects throughout our community during this covet experience it's really been more about us reaching out to them and being able to provide food supports being able to provide the you know it's certainly very limited in terms of socialization and connection and these are things that our seniors really really rely on so staff has been able to move into that role and being able to keep those connections uh which has been incredibly satisfying and i know from our seniors has been very appreciated um our housing consumer education center is that key place where our housing supports uh and the emergency supports come in where we're working to rescue tenancies working to um you know again rescue mortgages having a variety of different funding sources that we can apply based on the overall family need uh and family situation so that people are staying safe we we recognize here in massachusetts we've had the um moratorium in place where no evictions can take place but everyone recognizes that as that moratorium comes to its end people are going to be left in a situation where they have back rent that will just seem even more impossible to pay now so we're working very hard with with families and clients and individuals to ensure that they're taking the steps to protect themselves moving forward keeping themselves stable and then kind of the final over you know kind of umbrella under which all of this happens uh everything comes through our resource center again as karen mentioned ensuring that people can connect with any one of our programs through this one this one portal um making the move to virtual services was i think perhaps even the most important uh for the resource center because it's been the key place where staff have been able to you know clients are able to connect go through what has always been our pre-assessment process which is really where that comprehensive holistic understanding of a family comes from the idea that we've been able to do that with staff kind of flung across the merrimack valley you know using all these new virtual methods and yet still being able to make that very personal um and and critically important uh connection i think has been one of uh cti's real victories we've been just really impressed with the the way we've been able to maintain that and the staff work in in making that happen so that's kind of the key place where everything gets tied together where uh clients and families can connect with if they're you know child care you know housing all the different fuel assistance all the different programs kind of get knit together um let's say woven together because we're here in lowell but woven together and uh to really provide that safety net for families that's that's tremendous and i'm you know so many people they don't even when we're uh picking up the phone in our office so many times people just don't know who to call or what resources are available but once they've reached out to you whether it's for child care or uh for housing you introduce them to this portfolio that is you know it's life-saving right i mean it's just incredible um so megan i wanted to ask you we know how vital uh child care will be in the reopening of our economy how are you approaching the reopening of child care centers and what are you seeing in terms of the needs of your families uh how can cti help yeah so 96 of our families currently enrolled are ready to start you know we started with the outreach we've been um connecting with our families and doing virtual learning throughout co-fed you know and two to three times a week making those connections and seeing what they need you know the job loss um the loss of being able to participate in their education programs i mean it's astounding what's happened you know and we do have 96 of our families ready to come back so what we've done you know we've really started by really researching looking closely at the guidance from the cdc from the department of early education care department of public health and have revamped a lot of our policies and procedures you know unfortunately we aren't going to be able to reopen at full capacity however we will continue with remote services for families um home visits we're working to do remote home visits for our home visiting program um you know and continuing the remote learning but for the you know the the children that we can bring in it's a balancing act you know we're coming back keeping infants and toddlers in preschoolers six feet apart social distance is so counter-intuitive to everything we do and what we know is right for children you know in that nurturing environment so it is a balancing act of keeping safety standards in place while also creating a nurturing environment that's going to support all of their social emotional growth you know and i think another focus is the reality this time these last 15 weeks have created a lot of stressors for our families so ensuring that we have enough supports in place mental health supports or you know resource and referral supports to get those families back up and running so we have been very focused on securing ppe you know we're trying to have a good stash hopefully we think what might be a three-month stash um so that you know it's not just children and families being comfortable coming back but it's also our staff you know we are asking them you know to really go you know beyond what they're what they're trained for what they're typically used to and you know i think well children and families are coming in with some fears and anxieties so are staff so we're looking at how do we create right now strong training modules we're doing a lot of virtual training we're really rolling out our policies and procedures we're going to be we're starting to bring staff back next week so that we can start doing some in-person walk-throughs you know making sure that what's happening in the centers we're trying it out first before we have little people with us um you know and we're we're really looking at um you know making sure that they feel comfortable in that we're going to be staggering our opening we're hoping to open our doors for july 6th so we will be doing two classrooms per site and location that includes our um school age sites as well so that we can slowly bring people and make sure that all of our policies and procedures are working that everything is in place and we can learn and adapt as we go and hopefully by the end of july or in complete services um you know i think another thing you know we talk about you know families needing to get back to work our staff are also needing to get back to work you know and and they have child care needs um you know we did some surveying of our staff you know last month and 39 of the staff that have um bonded have child care can't come back to work without child care so it is it is um a significant need you know 74 of those needs it's school age you know while we are facing a reduction i think the the greater reduction is to the school age programming across our community right now and something we really have our eye on our child care the independent family child care providers can open that they have a slight decreasing capacity but we're really looking at how do we maximize the capacity that we have within that system so right now we're in the throes of identifying all of our families that can come back looking at where we have gaps and holes in and and capacity and trying to just link as many families as we possibly can to those resources so we are still accepting any family in need you know accepting applications and taking a look doing that full review of what do they need so if we can't even get them in center right now we can have them on the radar and keep the remote work and support going with them so um and the transportation is going to be interesting we typically get 15 to 20 children on a bus we're looking at six um so right now our transportation director who's already a whiz at rooting is is you know really honing in to try and see how can we get as many kids in because that's often a barrier transportation's a barrier for children accessing our programs so um that's the highlight yeah it really is unbelievable i mean you all have turned into logistical experts overnight uh in terms of making these adjustments ensuring safety protocols and and frankly giving you know parents peace of mind as you know as they head back to work right i mean this is uh this is a national issue that we're all contending with uh but thank heavens that you know you're there and uh and you know this uh you know this you know this business so well um and you all lead with your heart in terms of taking care of those uh those children uh i'm gonna my next question is for carl uh you know community teamwork was one of the founding members of the lowell partnership to end youth homelessness and you've worked over the years to alleviate homelessness for both families and for our young adults can you speak to the programs uh that are working and the challenges you're facing during this healthcare crisis uh yeah so the things that that are working it you know is really around supporting our youth uh where they're at and so we even through this whole pandemic we've had our site open our youth opportunity center has been open on monday wednesdays and fridays between 9 and 12 and now we're extending those hours uh for to a full day so that youth in the in the community do have access to our food pantry do have access to our laundry and other hygiene um facilities uh as well as case management is by appointment only but we're able to really uh schedule when uh those youth are coming in and receiving emergency services uh what else is working is you know we've really uh reallocated our funding to keep uh youth housed and one of the ways that we've done that is is you know when this pandemic happened we you know we had already placed a number of youth uh into stable housing however due to the pandemic uh they either lost their job or were laid off and that and and you know that has had a you know huge toll on maintaining that that stable housing for them and not getting them into arrears uh which could lead to an eviction when the courts reopen so you know we've really diverted a lot of funds to supporting those youth to cover those kind of housing costs um through this as well um so they don't fall back into homelessness um as well as us you know food costs for our youth build our youth build program you know we've really quickly moved to an online educational system as karen has spoken about you know our i.t department really was essential in getting us to a place where we're able to do stuff remotely and our staff were really quickly able to transition from uh doing stuff in a classroom to then engaging the youth uh via zoom or or microsoft teams to do some you know classwork do some educational components uh and get them uh working towards their certifications from home uh as well as uh i think we've you know we mentioned we've bought tablets and stuff that we're getting those in the hands of our youth and our families so that they are they're still able to uh enrich themselves through educational components um without being in within the school system they're in or through our youth programming which is why the whole name of the game here is flexibility you know when i hearken back to some of the you know first meetings we've ever had it was uh making sure that the funding mechanisms we use are flexible because no one knows you know the uh the needs of the community uh and how dynamic they are better than you and like being able to respond and not having to follow you know a rigid program guideline that's developed hundreds of miles away is like is what it's all about so and i know that you've been using some of those funds to give people the technology so that they can have um access uh to enriching their education even over the summer months so i'm down for the count but connie i we only have time for a couple more questions so connie uh cti i know has received additional funding not just from the federal government but from the state government as well for rental assistance can you speak to what assistance is available and how people can access help um what are their qualifications that uh that they um you know in order to receiving that help absolutely so you know i think the key thing that we want to make people make sure everybody knows is that the key conduit to kind of access all of the the housing supports and everything else is coming through our our covid specific uh communication channels we've set up uh covid response hotline that people can call uh 978-654-5607 uh they can call it is being uh messages are being pulled off at every couple hours uh right now we've got about between a 24 to 48 hour response time uh but that's kind of you know so that's one quick way for people to get it you know to get into the system and start their process they can also do it via email uh that email is a uh let's see here covid response cti at comteam.org um again all that information is right on our website so people can can get it very easily and that's just comteam.org uh and all of this information is available there um so as they go through that process one of the key things is to kind of do the pre-assessment for their housing situation you know we find you know obviously this this is a huge it's always been a big issue during covet it is it has become even more intense um and and certainly more challenging for families as they're facing a lot of different economic realities so uh we have seen increases from from federal funding from state funding even city funding uh and in addition to that some private funding you know we've received funding from uh united way of mass bay from the greater lowell community foundation meant to be used to keep people safe in their homes uh whether that's back rent or stipend moving forward or you know any of the other things that that are necessary to keep a family housed um so between our traditional kind of raft funding that's the rental assistance for family and transition we also have some emergency services money uh that come into it i think the key thing is that all of the different funding sources have their own individual eligibilities and criteria and different footprints and you know so it can be very complicated and the key role that we can do that we can play in the housing consumer education center hcec is our housing counselors are able to take families through that whole process again getting that big picture understanding of the family really helps us to be able to decide what funding source is available which is most appropriate for that specific family um and you know because of the generosity of a lot of again private foundations and individuals we do also have some unrestricted funds when you just can't make it fit when you just can't make something fit here at community teamwork we do have additional options um because we recognize that i mean again in uncharted waters like this expecting every every crisis to fit into the same cookie cutter kind of situation just isn't realistic and our ability to be nimble and flexible um and provide those resources in a lot of different ways i think is really the key to ensuring that families uh and individuals make it through this critical time that's terrific uh so karen last question um what do you see is the greatest need in our communities moving forward and then what would be the best way for you know town or municipal leaders to refer people to community teamwork so you know it is interesting we've seen shifts in needs our immediate needs were food we had buses delivering 850 meals a day and then we added dinners because that was a need the rental and mortgage assistant needs seemed to spike like week two and three into the crisis and that will continue we know that will continue uh the data we're seeing um throughout the state um points to an impending housing crisis we already were in one um before covid 48 of the people living in the city of lowell were rent burdened we know that number is going to skyrocket right and that as the moratorium ends as connie said rent and mortgage assistance will continue to be a need of the community also connection with education training and jobs right if you've lost a job you really are going to need assistance in connecting with that and we will be using some of our funds to enhance the work we're doing to connect people to education training and jobs in a new environment and i think we have to be flexible and nimble to be able to do that as that need but i do see that need going on for the next several years in addition to the housing crisis which already we're in a market with very limited stock and very high prices so i think those things will continue and i also have to say is the kind of con agency that we are we're also committed to doing the work to confronting and ending racism uh that has been front and center for all of us we're committing our agency to do better and to also bring that work to the community when the first line of your mission statement is you're committed to systemic change and to make our conditions better then we take that seriously as does our board so that work also will go forward and i think all of these have to come together to really look at closely the needs and conditions in our community the health issues and how we can all come together to make an impact on that and we work closely in partnership as you know laurie all of our work is in partnership we will continue to do that um to be partners with other agencies with um communities um with anyone we work with municipal governments state officials people in the community and we'll continue to do that and i think for communities you know reach out to me i can figure out how to help navigate k frederick at comteam.org i'm always happy to answer an email and i think sometimes people just don't know where to start you know a lot of local officials get calls and you know you could be on a board of selectmen or a city council or a school committee i encourage people get those to us we will help and if you don't know how to navigate the system or who to get it to uh send it to me or one of us and we will help with that because you know we are getting back to our calls we're doing i i know a great job but occasionally things can fall between the cracks and we want to make sure people follow up if that does happen um and we can uh get the answers that people need and the programs connected to the people that need them well i am i so treasure uh all that you do right i mean you all have been uh filling in the gaps standing in the gap and uh and you the just the nobility that you show up with each day uh you know living and working your mission um i i get to see it up close uh more than most um and you know we couldn't ask for better partners um in terms of you know just really changing uh the trajectory of you know a situation in that when it hits a family and this crisis has just hit so many people in our community so thank you for that and thank you for joining today uh for those of you who are interested in the resources and the services that were discussed today please don't hesitate to reach out to community teamwork going online as

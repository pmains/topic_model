mr. president the senator for Kentucky I think it's important to know and to let the record show that I've been working with senator Booker's office for three months on the amendment to this bill that I'm willing to have unanimous passage of the bill today but I think it's incredibly important that we get this right a woman in New Jersey a black woman in New Jersey assaulted three Jewish women and slapped them it was terrible and she uttered racial epithets about these Jewish women she was charged with third-degree misdemeanor assault up to a year in prison which actually sounds to be pretty significant for slapping but she was then charged with a hate crime in addition to that that would be four years in addition so we do have to get this right if slapping someone and hurling a racial epithet could get you ten years in prison this is exactly what we've been fighting about in criminal justice reform that we set up a system we didn't pay attention to the penalties and all the sudden things we didn't intend it happen so we have to be smart about this I'm willing to pass the bill today as amended which would simply say nothing you even have to harm someone you have to attempt to harm them but it has to be an attempt to harm them so all of the discussion about bruising while trying to lynch someone yes that's attempted murderer would be covered by this bill nothing in the bill would stop hey NAT what would prevent the prosecution of heinous behavior that's what's it intended for what I'm intended is what I'm trying to do is to make sure we don't get unintended consequences we've fought the battle against mandatory minimums for a decade now because we tie up people in sentencing that makes no sense ten years for slapping someone would be an abomination and it couldn't happen to anyone do we want a black woman who slap three Jewish women in New Jersey to get ten years in prison if there was a group of them it's now conspiracy to Lynch we have to use some common sense here we should not have a 10-year prison sentence for anything less than at the very least an attempt to do bodily harm the statute this what bodily harm is but it could still be an attempt it doesn't mean you actually have to have it but what it would preclude is somebody shoves somebody in a bar and they fall down and they have an abrasion and they say he did it because of a racial animus towards me and you have a 10-year penalty that's not right so all of us here are advocates on the same side of criminal justice reform we all have argued on the same side that the law is screwed up and has incarcerated too many people unfairly that's what I'm trying to prevent here and so the thing is is I understand the emotions on it you think I take great joy in being here no I'm sponsor of 22 criminal justice bills you think I'm getting any good publicity out of this no I will be excoriated by simple-minded people on the internet who thinks somehow I don't like Emmett Till or appreciate the history and the memory of Emmett Till I'll be lectured to by everybody I've got no right to have an opinion on any of these things I should be quiet but we can't just not read our bills you know I have worked in an honest way with senator Booker's office for three months on this bill we have gone back and forth we gave them some some language they came back to us and said it wouldn't work and I said well what about this and then we haven't gotten any more responses so we haven't gotten responses back in a month or more and the thing is is now they're litigating in the press and trying to accuse me of somehow being in favor of something so heinous that it makes my skin crawl that it makes me sick to my stomach to even read the accounts of what happened but we also to be fair and honest about this lynching is illegal people who are saying there's no federal law against lynching are not telling the truth the law says if you kill somebody and you have racial animus under the hate crime statute it is illegal you can't do that it's also illegal in all the states this bill does not make lynching illegal so for all the discussion of that this bill creates a new crime called conspiracy to lynch well yeah I'm for it if there's a crowd let's arrest the whole mob all four policemen should be responsible for what happened to mr. Floyd but the thing is is when we do that we have be careful that we don't then put a crowd of people in where someone pushed into someone or someone slapped someone there has to be justice people are chanting justice justice has to have a brain and has to have vision and can't be hamstrung into something that could give someone ten years in prison for a minor crime this is a very minor attempt everything we left in here we have worked with senator Booker's office to make sure it is inclusive they came back and said what about attempted we said let's change the language so we have in their attempt to cause seriously bodily harm so there could be no injury but someone will have to have a discuss of whether there was an attempt and it was an attempt that looked like it would be serious so I think slapping someone isn't but under the current statute as he is people say all nobody will ever do it maybe but we're putting it on the books the mandatory minimums have kept people in jail for decades there are people in life for nonviolent crimes all of us have worked on the same side of that issue I'm asking for a very minor change I'll pass it right now I'm completely out of the way I'm for the bill I'm asking unanimous consent to pass the bill today with one amendment that just says let's be careful not to rest people for slapping someone or not to arrest somebody for pushes into someone and get them ten years in prison this isn't about someone trying to kill another person or someone attempting bodily harm those people would be included in this language even if they did not have a mark on the person but if they were rounding him up tying him up and they'd thrown a rope over the tree that's attempted murder and they would still be included under this bill even without a mark on them but what we have to preclude and what we're trying to preclude is that the bill doesn't get used for the wrong purposes we're all in the same side about who we want to punish and who we should prevent and we're also on the same side on the symbolism of this but we can't pass laws that do exactly what all of us have said is wrong with our penal system all the unintended consequences there is one here and I asked in a very polite way and I've been asking for three months for one small change and I let the bill go today on this day if we could have it and the changes have been out there they're not brand new they've been in senator Booker's office for three months and we've tried to as he's had objections work with him on his objections so I would ask unanimous consent once again to pass the bill as amended

thank you very much Mr chairman and thank you to our Witnesses for testifying today it is no secret that climate change has exacerbated the frequency of extreme weather events over the last years and these intense weather events are only expected to become even more frequent and intense Las Vegas my hometown is one of the most vulnerable cities to climate change due to its Reliance on Colorado River water the location in the warming and drying Southwest and the prevalence of extreme heat events countless studies all point to the same things heat waves have devastated Health impacts including respiratory illness cognitive effects heat stroke and exhaustion and increased hospitalizations not to mention the compounded risk for people with pre-existing conditions such as heart disease or hypertension hypertension according to the National Weather Service heat kills more people in the United States than tornadoes lightning hurricanes and floods combined that's reality but given that Nevada has one of the highest homelessness populations across the country I want to better understand what this means for people inadequately housed and homeless people Dr katri in your testimony you mentioned how high temperatures shut down your federally qualified Health Center in the state of Nevada where temperatures reach well over 100 degrees with no respite for the unhoused how has your organization examined how to best help those exposed to health high temperatures yes thank you in fact one of our health centers is a homeless Health Center and we serve people who are unhoused and are in homeless encampments uh throughout Tennessee and that has been a real area of worry for us because there is no place for people to be cool and they don't have access to water it impacts their health because there's certain medications we cannot give them because they will become dehydrated and so now housing has and housing status has to be integrated into every clinical decision that we make even if we have treatments that are effective for people we cannot we cannot use them because it's so dangerous for people who are unhoused so for us it is an absolute critical uh critical issue to deal with the housing component of the climate crisis thank you Dr Biddinger now because of the current Heat Wave we are also facing a record-setting drought in Nevada the water levels at Lake Mead have reached its lowest point in more than 85 years together Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam Supply water and power to over 25 million people not only in Nevada but also California Arizona and Mexico my state is expected to receive eight percent less water than what is normally allocated and there's no clear sense of what this will mean for my constituents water usage and quality as Dr Sherman noted the health care sector itself is largely responsible for contributing to pollution as well the combination of an out ongoing drought and incessant pollution pose major challenges in our quest for clean water so if you and Dr shank could say where in the health care sector can we make the most obvious changes to reduce the industry's carbon footprint um thank you very much Congressman I think there are so many ways in which we can decrease our carbon footprint certainly decreasing again our energy utilization is is extremely important becoming more and more energy efficient so overall our Net usage goes down obviously shifting to Renewables is another key factor I think promoting resilience in all of the other ways in which we use energy anesthesia gases and their contribution have been mentioned but promoting uh healthy transportation for our patients and for our Workforce so that indirectly that we contribute less promoting use of supply chain products that that do not contribute to climate change are really important and turn the rest to Dr shank thank you thank you and thank you for the question yes you know those figures about U.S con Healthcare contributions eight and a half percent most recently partly authored by Dr Jody Sherman refers to all three scope Scopes one two and three so scope three is our supply chain our value chain so for us 40 percent of our emissions are in what we purchase so that's beyond the energy it's beyond our transportation it's really what we're purchasing for this we need help we need help from All actors to be more transparent to be able to measure to be able to make better choices about the emissions that we are then contributing through our purchasing decisions thank you thank you so much Mr chairman I yield back

just one of the latest victims caught in a fatal shooting in new york city an emt getting shot while on the job last night as well new york congressman nicole malliatas represents that district in the last thing that carly just read she joins us now congresswoman will any of this ever change if new york's horrible bail reform laws continue to be on the books that's right that's what needs to be fixed here we know that we've seen shootings skyrocket and as you mentioned that 11 year old girl has is one of 40 children or teens who have been shot this year alone eight police officers in new york city have been shot this year surpassing already all of 2021 we saw two police officers killed and last night an emt was shot in my district by an emotionally disturbed individual who was actually in transport to the hospital in the ambulance so it's not just gun violence it is also people being stabbed to death people being thrown in front of trains people being beaten to death this is a real crime issue and it all stems from the 2020 law that was put in effect that allows individuals to be released into the streets we just met with the detectives union and law enforcement and they told us nine out of 10 individuals caught with an illegal firearm are being released onto the street and guess what only 17 percent of them are finally being prosecuted that means we have prosecutors that refuse to prosecute we have judges who refuse to set bail or when they have discretion or they're just being released automatically there was a shooting the other day in brooklyn okay the guy had 24 prior arrests he was out on parole by cuomo hocal parole board which has been releasing cop killers convicted murderers rapists and on top of it he was caught with an illegal firearm and was released back onto the street because of the bail law so all of that is coming into play right now the only way we're going to change it is that the people of new york elect prosecutors that prosecute judges who actually consider people uh who actually look listen to prosecutors who do want to set bail when they have discretion and if we elect a new governor and state legislature that's going to be serious about repealing this disastrous law that keeps releasing hardened criminals career criminals back onto our streets you hear the democrats talk about ghost guns a lot but that doesn't appear to be the issue here congresswoman thank you so much for joining us we do have to leave it there we appreciate you coming on with that fox and friends starts right now

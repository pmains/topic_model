congressman thank you so much for being with us thank you so much you've tweeted that you've spoken with republican colleagues who agree that president trump quote needs to go now are you expecting that a significant number of republicans may vote with you you know i've quit predicting what they're actually going to do when it comes time to vote all i know is that when we were there on wednesday uh under siege uh with our lives threatened waiting to go back to the house floor to finish our work there were quite a few republicans who were just as angry as i was and who were speaking in exactly the same language right now i think a lot of them are afraid uh they're afraid of their own base which is threatening their lives and they're also i think afraid of the judgment of history and they're torn between those two um those fears and obviously so they're afraid on the judgment of history that maybe they think the right thing to do is to vote against the president um what are you saying anything to them to that effect i mean are you trying to persuade any of them what are you saying i i think what i would say is that we either hang together or we hang separately that there is a a violent extremist insurrectionist mob out there that has been stoked and that has been growing uh courtesy of q anon courtesy of extreme leaders in their party including the president for the last four years and these people who stormed the capital and who are threatening to do it again next week are out for them too they were they were shouting hang mike pence they're probably more angry at the republicans right now the republicans who had integrity and who certified joe biden's election than they are at us and right now we need to find unity in this country against this threat we need to find unity to restore law and order and and respect for these rules and that is where they safety you just introduced a resolution to censure alabama congressman mo brooks for his role in the insurrection and just to let our viewers know this is some of what just some of what he said to trump supporters just before the attack on the capitol i've got a message that i need you to take to your heart and take back home and along the way stop at the capitol today is the day american patrons start taking down names and kicking ass what do you think accenture would do to the congressman is this something that you think he would take seriously it it's a serious first step what it means is that if the house votes to censure and i believe we will that the congressman would be forced to stand in the well of the house and hear the resolution read it would be a scarlet letter it would be a vote of condemnation by his colleagues and i believe i'm quite certain that many republicans would would vote with us on this but i think it's a first step we're going to need to take a broader look at whether he and potentially other members did more than just say outrageous things whether they may even have colluded in some way with these people who were attacking the capital and threatening our lives that that you know that will require due process and investigation uh it could lead to censure it could lead to worse sanction but for now what congressman brooks said to the very mob that we're marching on the capitol to kill mike pence to kill his fellow colleagues that that's easy to judge and i and i hope that we move quickly to do so you mentioned the possibility of collusion between republican members of congress and some of those who carried out this siege what questions do you have about that what evidence do you have of that what have you heard well i don't have answers and i'm not going to accuse anybody of anything without anything that serious without significant evidence but but certainly there have been uh accusations made including by some of the writers on social media who said that they were in contact with particular members that they have planned uh the uh the the massing the storming of the capital with them i don't know if that's true uh and i'm not gonna again censure or expel somebody based on a supposition but i do think there's enough for us to launch an investigation and to give these members a chance to uh to answer for what they did or didn't do are you confident that the capital will be secure during president-elect and then president biden's inauguration this was a wake-up call for america it was a wake-up call for our law enforcement agencies i think they all know now they're not dealing with quote-unquote protesters or demonstrators they are dealing with a increasingly organized domestic terrorism movement that has potentially millions of adherents at least philosophically in our country and so i think they're going to be ready um and i think ready not just to play defense by putting up fences and bringing troops to washington d.c i hate that by the way i hate all these fences going up we need to play offense we need to go out and start infiltrating these groups we need to make arrests of those who trespass on capitol grounds as the fbi and police across the country are doing we need to take this fight to them to make clear that law enforcement does not stand with them that they are on the wrong side of the law and the wrong side of history and they will be held accountable congressman thank you so much for coming on we really appreciate your time thank you very much

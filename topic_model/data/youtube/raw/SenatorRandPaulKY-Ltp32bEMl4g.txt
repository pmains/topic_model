kentucky senator senator foreign relations committee member and senate homeland and governmental affairs committee member rand paul joins me right now and senator it's great to see you this morning i want to congratulate you and thank you for holding people to account you recently held dr anthony fauci to account with a fiery back and forth on the funding of gain of function research in the wohan institute let's take a look back at that hearing dr fauci do you still support funding of the nih funding of the lab in wuhan senator paul with all due respect you are entitled entirely and completely incorrect that the nih has not ever and does not now fund gain of function research in the wuhan institute and in fact senator he is walking that back as you know now in fact admitting that oh yes we did send money to the wuhan lab of virology your reaction to what's taken place in the last 48 hours as the walls close in on dr fauci i think it's pretty extraordinary you know dr fauci for at least a year has been discounting the theory that this came from the lab but you have to ask is there a conflict of interest he was in favor of and still is in favor of funding chinese scientists the people that he gave the money to at eco health is peter desanc he's self-interested also he doesn't want there to be any kind of truth that comes out that this came from the lab do i know for certain it came from the lab no but they've been downplaying and discounting this and not wanting to investigate it because guess what if boomerangs on them all of their you know pretentiousness about taking care of us in the epidemic pandemic what if it turns out that we were funding the lab where this pandemic originated this is a huge blight on the career of dr fauci but it shows that he will do anything to try to deflect blame so senator did he commit perjury right there lying to you i think what he's doing is playing word game so he keeps saying he he acts like and the public perceives that no money went to the lab and he says well money went to the lab but it wasn't for gain of function but here's the thing we have scientists who have looked at the research who have looked at the application for the research they say the application to the nih for research included gain of function the paper that talked about taking the sars virus with a 15 mortality and putting new s proteins on it to make it infect human cells better that is gain of function and when doctor she the doctor from wuhan institute published her paper she said thanks dr fauci and she listed the nih grant number for the money she got from dr fauci and most scientists that are looking at that paper say yes that was gain of function so he has some explaining to do and he needs to do it under oath but he needs not to be part of any investigation he should be outside the loop shows at the other guy who is funneling the money to wuhan you can't be investigating it if you're the one that directed the money there because it's a conflict of interest you will not want to undercut uncover anything that you might that might make you look comfortable what about the culpability of the chinese communist party senator i mean look the the walls are truly closing in here we had a reporter out of australia two weeks ago report that she has records of conversations taking place among ccp members where they discussed weaponizing a sars coronavirus using it as a weapon five years before the pandemic showed up and then of course you've got this report from the house intelligence agencies talking about the potential of weaponizing this was this a bio weapon i don't think i don't think we're ever going to know and i don't even think we know that it was on purpose but even if it was accidental we should know they should have tried to help the world with this but this is a bigger debate than just china we have 11 labs in the united states doing this gain of function research where they take an animal virus and they make it more ineffective into humans i'm not alone in in worrying about this there are scientists in this field a few years ago 200 of them signed a letter saying we should stop gain and function research it was stopped temporarily but guess who started it up again dr fauci and dr fauci started giving exemptions so dr fauci's hands and his fingerprints are all over all this gain of function research he said repeatedly in the past he favors this research but then he comes to congress and says oh no no i'm not i'm not in favor of ever doing this he's on record with an interview with the washington post saying he's in favor of gaining kingdom function research we should not be creating super viruses it's crazy to have this in the lab let me we can go ahead yep i want to turn to the courage that you constantly and consistently exhibit and the leadership you continue to come out holding people's feet to the fire uh and making sure that the audiences and and the communities understand where the truth lies and you get attacked for it over and over again from your neighbor to the crowds in washington that you and your wife had to deal with to now a suspicious a suspicious package that arrived at your home in kentucky you want to bring in your wife kelly paul is with us as well this morning senator paul and kelly paul we appreciate you joining us to talk about what has become incredibly personal to you both you saw a package you received a package at your home containing white powder that was later deemed harmless but there was a photo of a bruised and bandaged picture of you senator with a gun to your head threatening violence kelly let me bring you in before i get the senator's comment here how did you feel when you get this got this package can you tell us what happened hi maria um well i i was scared obviously it's a terrible feeling your heart just sort of drops it was a sunny monday afternoon and i walked to my mailbox and i had a quite big stack of mail and i was standing in my front yard so thank goodness i really wasn't in the house i never brought the letter into the house i was standing sort of right up to my front steps and i started shuffling through the mail and i looked down and i see this horrible image of a wounded rand a doctored image with a gun against his head and i look down and it says you know i'm going to finish what the other guy started you mf and i just you know froze and was disgusted and so i went to sort of throw the letter down i didn't open it but as i did i could feel something that sounded like sand like a weighty substance i could feel it moving in the letter so i ran inside i washed my hands of course i was terrified you know you think of anthrax you think of the you know the poisonings that happened years ago when people sent poisons in the mail ricin or anthrax immediately called rand the fbi the sheriffs and you know everyone's telling me you know take off all your clothes because i had been holding the mail up against my chest get in the shower so i had you know several hours before i found out that it was non-toxic thinking that i might have been poisoned you know i had someone from the fbi saying you know are you having any shortness of breath you know these these there are lethal poisons it was very thin paper so i'm thinking have i absorbed something through my hands uh it was it was really a it was a terrifying day and it's pure terrorism people are just trying to terrorize us into silence you know for being a public servant yeah that's right and and senator it's not the first time you got beaten up by your next-door neighbor at one point and then you both were crowded and and and uh smushed together by crowds after the republican national convention uh when you had demonstrators surrounding and chasing yeah i think it's important there wasn't an altercation or a fight with the person that assaulted me i was hit from behind by somebody running full blast down a hill never was aware of who hit me or what hit me had six ribs broken my lung damaged and part of my lung removed but here's the point we have people on the left who think it's just hilarious stephen colbert thinks it's great to make fun of the injuries i had i had six broken ribs a damaged lung part of my lung removed and so when colbert and all these other people think they're so funny and they get everybody in the internet all gender guess what they encourage crazy people across the country cnn puts my house on google map on the on television tells everybody where i live so this has got to stop but the left thinks it's just hilarious what happened to me and they encourage other people to do it that's the whole meme on the internet all these people just think it's hilarious come and finish the job oh that's really funny i almost died and they think it's really funny and they want to do it again twitter doesn't do a damn thing i finally talked to them and they took this one down but was the guy punished no the guy that keeps saying this we got the the white powder the day after some has been a songwriter you know encouraged people to come over and finish the job and says he's going to buy drinks for anybody that will come and assault me again there was no fight i was hit from behind from a man running full speed if you've seen the images of that vietnamese guy that was killed the elderly man that was killed the reason i wasn't killed i was younger and i was on grass not concrete but the guy was running full speed and hit me from behind it was not a fight and it's important that people understand how terrible this was and how terrible the injuries were because the left just keeps going on and on like oh this is so funny uh somebody on msnbc says the funniest thing she heard of the whole year and maria yeah exactly and i just also wanted to say media has misrepresented this from the beginning before that man assaulted rand he had disgusting things on his facebook graphic horrible things that he wanted to do to president trump he was a politically motivated person he admitted to the police and to the courts that he had never spoken to rand in over 10 years never complained to us about anything his lawyer then tells the media oh it was a yard altercation and the media took his lawyers words to the to them as fact completely ignoring the fact that this man was a vocal internet hater of trump of the gop and uh had never spoken to us and we had no problems with this person in oh you know 20 years of living uh you know three acres away from it yeah but i mean there's nothing's being done senator paul i mean that that you know what's what's being done for you and your family i mean here we have nancy pelosi talking about the barbed wire around the capitol about a commission no one's focused on what actually happened to you that you broke you had six ribs broken it's absolutely outrageous yeah not not one democrat came up to me since i've been back and said i'm sorry that you're having to deal with having white powder said in an envelope to you not one not one of them i don't think ever said they were sorry for me being assaulted by someone and having six ribs broken and nearly dying and having my lung roof not one of them so people say oh it's all trump's fault well guess what the left shot at me at the ballpark the left attacked me in my house a mob attacked me in dc something's got to give and the left needs to quit fomenting this and the comedians need to say this isn't funny this is serious exactly and no comments about the commentary on the left about riling people up senator rand paul thanks for your leadership kelly thank you as well we're sorry that you've been dealing with this senator rand paul and kelly paul we'll be right back

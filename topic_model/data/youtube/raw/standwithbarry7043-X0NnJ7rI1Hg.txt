I'm Barry Loudermilk and I approve this message I ran for Congress to give our kids a better future we lowered taxes help the economy take off and improved education but I learned something more important on a field like this one when a madman opened fire on me and some of my colleagues standing for your values is important but it must be done with civility love your neighbor and treat them the way you want to be treated I try to live by those principles every day

thank you madam chair and thanks to all the witnesses very compelling testimony mr. Jin hazy I'll start with yous and she came out here in my request can you tell us I understand you recently purchased some new machines for Christian County correct what decisions led you to purchase those specific machines the original machines at Christian County had been using were purchased in 2004 and those machines like I said before the Accu votes and such TSX were purchased using hava funds that were available at that time those machines although doing well up through and including the most recent elections have seen better days they have outdated hardware that is no longer able to physically provide a dark print on the ballot tape did you use homophones to get these new machines I did not have any how the funds available to get these new machines I was able to work through the county board who had general obligation bond money available for this project say Kostya I have signed what is a six year lease on these machines I chose not to purchase and that six year lease approximately three hundred and twenty two thousand dollars and knowing the size of our cow has a pretty big impact into the county budget as of Tuesday I have twenty-one thousand two hundred and twelve registered voters in my entire county okay great when you made the decision to purchase those machines she didn't call anybody the federal government has permission right I did not okay you mentioned in your testimony too about the Illinois cyber navigator program it's a program I've talked about in this hearing room many times I think it's a great partnership between the US Department of Homeland Security and the state of Illinois and in turn all local election officials like yourself how's this program been beneficial to your role as an election administrator in Christian County the cyber navigator program is is beneficial I believe to all election authorities and in particular those that do not have the resources to maintain any form of IT staff in particular or those that just have an inability to continue to monitor all of the problems that are coming down the line and then be able to provide solutions to those problems see you know you don't have a dedicated IT staff or you're that person right correct we don't have any IT staff the county does hire an outside IT contractor to perform all T all IT related functions including patch updates firewall maintenance email maintenance etc just for your office or for the whole county and all the offices for the whole county all offices so the treasurer the County Clerk the sheriff everybody right correct you find that the cyber navigator program is partnership between DHS funded by your federal tax dollars is a good is good assistance to small rural counties like your owning I do because again with the changes that are happening the cyber cyber navigator who now is partnering with the county has given us the ability to promote different aspects of cyber security related awareness is also currently directly assisting with the installation of new hardware which will provide secure access between our voter registration database server and the Illinois State Board of Elections database server through what's called the Illinois Century Network excellent thank you for your testimony today thanks for being here Mike great to see you

hello i'm dina Titus your representative from Nevada's first congressional district today's the 20th of April or as you may know at 4:20 a date that often sparks the celebration of marijuana through the lens of American counterculture and folklore but we shouldn't just think of today in terms of lava lamps and dayglo posters marijuana can also help people suffering from PTSD epilepsy and cancer so today is a reminder of how much work must be done to ensure that we lay a strong foundation for the future of the medical marijuana industry we must continue to find the balance where patients get the treatments they need healthcare competition grows and the small-business community prospers in a few short years Nevada has enacted regulations for the growth and sale of medical marijuana Las Vegas is first dispensaries are now open for business and residents can receive medical cards after approval by a doctor so while Nevada is up and run and there is a real gap between what's happening at home and what's happening in Washington that's why I'm working to address concerns about banking research and safe access in the marijuana industry with legislation and other thing rational efforts I hope to ensure that the Justice Department won't target patients and the legal medical marijuana industry I have called on the VA to change its policy so veterans and their doctors can talk about medical marijuana as a potential treatment and last week I joined a bipartisan group requesting the government removing barriers for federal marijuana research I'm also supporting legislation to ensure that the marijuana businesses have access to banking services these are just a few of the steps that can go a long way so stand with me and tell Congress join the majority of states and pass laws that will help this in the street growth pop pub pass those bills thank you

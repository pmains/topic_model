is recognized for six minutes Thank You mr. speaker and I thank the gentleman from New Jersey our ranking member for yielding it is with regret that I must stand here today in opposition to this bill to reform the Toxic Substances Control Act we have negotiated in good faith for many months to try to reach an agreement to fix EPA's chemical program and while there are some positive aspects of this bill ultimately leave it falls short before I go into detail about my concerns I want to express my appreciation for the work that has been done by both the majority and minority colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee and wanted to commend the stabs in particular those with whom I work most closely from the minority side as we just heard from from chairman Upton the Senate passed a version in december of last year after we had voted near unanimously to support our version of a bill there are improvements over the bill passed by the senate in december with this measure i want to be clear that in some ways this bill will improve current law epa gains new authorities and resources the regulatory bar to testing is lowered allowing epa to acquire more information about chemicals and the least burdensome standard that essentially has prevented EPA from regulating chemicals even when there was overwhelming evidence of harm has been removed one of our caucuses top priorities expediting the review of persistent bioaccumulative and toxic substances or PB TS was largely retained and the bill required EPA to consider the most vulnerable populations but for every positive step to protect the public health and the environment there are numerous steps back that undermine those goals for example this bill weakens one of the few parts of tosca as it stands today that actually works stands today significant new use rules or snores EPA can require companies to provide notice of new uses of a chemical before the company can manufacture or import it a chemical that might be suitable for industrial uses should not necessarily be in consumer products this bill would make it more difficult to require notification and they for to track chemicals being used in new ways or in imported products also there is language on a negotiated rulemaking to limit reporting requirements for inorganic bipro a concept that was not in either the house or senate bills but seems to have been stuck into this version somehow the section on nomenclature represents an improvement over the Senate bill but I still have concerns this is just one of a number of seemingly benign provisions that are included to create loopholes that undermine the Public Health and Environmental Protection goals of Tosca the bill retains the Senate's resource-intensive prioritization process that largely duplicates the work EPA has done already to identify chemicals of concern and place them on the work plan and finally there has been a lot of talk about the preemption section currently states are able to restrict a chemical unless EPA decides to impose its own restrictions preemption has not often been an issue because EPA has rarely acted but states today today have a number of options when it does happen they can Co enforce restrictions apply for a waiver or ban a chemical under this bill states lose those rights to ban a chemical and waiver would be more difficult to obtain than under current law without a working federal program it has fallen upon States to lead the fight to get the most harmful chemicals out of Commerce and they have proven to be successful they have been the champions the driving force I understand there are members from states that have not acted to regulate chemicals please do not think this provision does not apply to you as well when states are able to act aggressively as they have they can move industry and they can move EPA to act which benefits our entire nation unfortunately this bill includes provisions that would severely inhibit state's ability to act in January 14 state attorneys general expressed their concerns with the preemption section those concerns were reiterated simply as last week by some seven state environmental commissioners their concerns largely revolved around what has become known as pause preemption during the pause period when EPA is evaluating a chemical up to 3.5 years states are prohibited from acting last year's house-passed version did not did not include the pause while we accepted that states would be preempted when EPA makes a final determination about a chemicals risks it would be impressive enta to prevent a state from acting before that overall and very problematically the Senate's state preemption framework is largely unchanged we know a deal was struck in the Senate a few weeks ago but i believe it is more accurate to call it a deal on prioritization not preemption because EPA would have to spend more time going through the unnecessary prioritization process during this new window of time states could rush to try to act before the pause kicks in we have heard from a number of states that acting that act by legislative action rather than regulation they have told us that 12 to 18 months is simply not sufficient the reality is in most cases states will not have enough of opportunity to protect their citizens from harmful chemicals during the years it can take for EPA to do its own evaluation let us call the pure the pause exactly what it is unnecessary and precedent-setting it may be decades before we see the health benefits of this bill but I fear it is only a matter of time before more and more bills come to the floor that prevents state regulation before a final federal agency action I can't help but ask will we rue the day that we gave a nod of approval to the pause preemption concept it is a terrible policy and we should not encourage it it opens the door to unwelcome and dangerous precedent the core attention of my this bill is the balance between new federal authorities and new restrictions on States unbalanced I do not believe that the modest improvements to the federal program not to mention the carve outs for certain industries men of which are unnecessarily broad are sufficiently positive to warrant these new restrictions you have heard during this debate that our system is broken and that the improvements of which there are some are better than nothing which is what we have now for existing chemicals but better than nothing is a very low bar I think we can and should do better the public deserves better I have no doubt that people on both sides of this debate genuinely want to ensure people are protected from dangerous and toxic chemicals I do not begrudge my colleagues who choose to support it however the record must reflect that this bill is not without its flaws or controversies we must have a strong national chemical program to protect American families and workers but the states can and should be challenged time is just remembered this beer bill severely constrains the state's rule in this effort ultimately I'm not convinced that the program will be Jones my place by this bill justifying the unprecedented limitation of states authorities 30 seconds I I'm through I'll yield back I just said generous i college to oppose the

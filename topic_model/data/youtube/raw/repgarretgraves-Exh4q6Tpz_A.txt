thank you mr bens appreciate the appreciate the time um you know mr mr chairman uh mr soto once again he mentioned this this ftc price gouging i want to remind members that the secretary of energy that was appointed by president biden actually testified before the house and she said there that the the price gouging was not an issue and it hadn't been found and i remind you after the letters nine months now um out there doing investigations chasing tails on this one and and no one has found that there's that there's price gouging mr pence talked about about permit delays i was recently in the permian base and spent time in texas and in new mexico um let's talk about permit delays a little bit i said a minute ago that we have a higher percentage of apds or drilling permits that are actually under production now than ever before why aren't those remaining permits uh being drilled right now those areas being produced and there's a reason for that the reason is is that there are things that there are other permits that are required in order for these leases to be produced and the administration in many cases is not granting those other permits secondly you have things like litigation that is holding up or preventing these areas from being able to be produced let me give you a couple of statistics new mexico again i was just in hobbs new mexico in 2020 on average it took 400 days it took 400 days in 2020 to issue a permit blm land to issue a permit for energy production in the latest quarter it's taken 650 days there has been a 50 reduction in the number of permits that have been issued i mean mr chairman there's not a leg to stand on to watch y'all continue to try to hold these positions whenever it is your policies that have caused the problems that we're facing today what am i talking about let me give you some examples build back better act this committee right here you voted to raise royalty rates i believe it was 50 what that means is to increase the cost of domestic energy production where does that money come from does it come from the money tree does it come from somebody winning the lottery no it comes from consumers it we pay more at the gas pump y'all tried to employ a ten thousand dollar a mile a year pipeline fee where does the money come from if you're a company and you're planning you're out your uh cost and your in your investments and your prices you build that in all of these were unforced errors i'll say it again you own the white house the house and the senate you own these decisions the the impact the impact on our on our constituents these are this is what happens bad policy results in this

Thank You mr. chairman Thank You secretary DeVos for being here and thank you mr. chairman for introducing into the record the January 9th and January 10th 2017 memos Secretary device when you made opening remarks you said that some on this committee suggest full relief for defrauded borrowers the point is that it's not just some on this committee it was the borrower defense unit in the education department as well people who had been working on these cases that's the point and secretary to us the mission of the Department of Education is to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence in ensuring equal access and when I look at how the department and you have been handling the borrower defense cases I just don't see that that is consistent with the message and the mission of the department with so many hundreds of thousands of students including thousands in my home state of Oregon stuck with loan balances in a worthless degree if they even got a degree I'm a former consumer protection lawyer for the Federal Trade Commission and I know fraud when I see it and these students were misled and cheated and the fact that some of them may be making money doesn't mean they weren't defrauded if somebody went into one of these programs hoping to become a nurse for example and now they're selling clothes at a department store it doesn't mean that they weren't defrauded and and I hope you can put yourself in the shoes of some of these borrowers I know it's challenging but they went to try to find a better path for themselves and instead of getting a good education they got collection notices and wage garnishments and in September the Department admitted to violating a court order by illegally demanding low payment from more than 16,000 Corinthian borrowers seeking borrower defense and that number has now increased to 45,000 and the issue came to the public's attention only after you were held in contempt for violating a court order so this is not a new problem in fact more than a year ago a court ordered the department to stop seizing tax returns of borrower defense applicants that was a Williams case so you and the Department have known about this issue for years so why did the Department continue to bill more than 16 and Corinthian borrowers in violation of the law what Congress congresswoman I'm sorry you weren't here when I talked about that earlier on but what we said what I said was it was very clear that the borrowers that made claims for Corinthian college programs were in forbearance were not accruing interest per my direction prior to the court order into a court injunction in May of 2018 since then a year later there were errors made within federal student aid and without some of our servicers human errors that once we were became aware of them we immediately immediately acknowledged and meet immediately went to work to correct and rectify the problems for those impacted I'm going to redo my time and it's a 99% I'm gonna reclaim my time and ask another question and I was here I just didn't find the answer satisfactory how many times is a court already found that the department has illegally collected payments from borrowers or Siege there what seize their wages or tax returns how many times it was have other quotes found that in relationship to the court injunction from May 2018 and general Brown can comment to the specific numbers of impacted borrowers and and frankly what were the record there were other their case you make sure that all of those cases were addressed and taken care of which they have been and and you say secretary DeVos that you care about the responsible use of taxpayer dollars so the judge in the man weakest case imposed sanctions in the amount of $100,000 for violating an injunction so who paid that you personally or the taxpayers I'm not aware that it's been paid it's an injunction in a judgment against the Department of Education so you're not aware if it's even been paid I don't believe I don't know I can and who who do you expect to pay that will you pay that personally or will the taxpayers well I think there's a there is a appeal to suggest that it's not appropriate to find a federal another federal department so in my remaining time the borrowers who discovered that the department was billing them and properly this is not a result of the department's oversight so we know there are many borrower defense claimants who are watching today how are you going to assure them that you're doing everything in your power to help them get relief and that they won't have their wages garnished or their tax returns taken in the future well I'm very hopeful that we will be able to continue to move ahead with our new methodology and assuming no challenge from is through the courts of that methodology we'll be able to process these claims that have been pending for many and that's the methodology they have someone's making money they working frauded and I that is not justice Madam Secretary and I yield back thank you before

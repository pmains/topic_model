very very best Thank You Man mr. pallazzo Thank You mr. chairman Thank You mr. Weller for being here today I'd like to discuss natural resource conservation efforts being conducted in the Gulf Coast region there's a ton of environmental and biological diversity along the coastline of the Gulf of Mexico and so I'd like to bring up a couple of questions regarding the steps being taken by NRCS to ensure the preservation of these natural resources in the region I mean we have 1.3 billion pounds of seafood comes out of the Gulf of Mexico each year how are y'all working with local fishermen and others to preserve our fish and shellfish stock while also meeting the public's demand for Gulf seafood so in parts are a we recognize the value of private land stewardship in terms of maintaining the health and the bounty of the Gulf Coast ecosystem and is one of the reasons why in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill USDA was a strong advocate for participating in the trustee council and the restore council efforts in the Gulf Coast region and really our mantra has been if you look at the land ownership in the five states of the Gulf Coast region from Texas all the way to Florida almost ninety percent of the land in those five states are privately owned and those are predominantly rural lands they're farmed or forested and the ranched and so if you care about both that the water quality and the quality of life economic vibrancy of those communities you got to start first and foremost with those farmers and ranchers so for example wheat we then launched a targeted effort which we call the Gulf of Mexico initiative you may have heard about because we like acronyms we call it go me gom i and where we identified one or two river system small river systems that went upland into the upper parts of the state but really impacted Gulf Coast resources and they were working voluntarily with farmers and ranchers to put in place conservation practices that improve their bottom line but also reduce loss a sediment and inputs off their farm fields ultimately then reducing water quality concerns down on the Gulf Coast region we think then helping to heal the estuaries that those shrimp fishermen depend upon for their production yeah and I've heard some talking about the Miss p Basin River watershed you know all the all the water from all the states along the Mississippi they come eventually and they enter into the Gulf of Mexico dumping nutrients in other human activities are going in there and it's creating as you also know a dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico and in 2015 I think it was probably one of the largest that we've seen in a long time almost 5,000 square miles the hypoxia task force only covers 1,900 square miles size of Connecticut and Rhode Island just put it in perspective so it's not just you know our state it's the entire watershed what initiatives do you have and I understand you know conservation especially in Mississippi in southern states and we take conservation very seriously we want clean water we want clean air we want to continue our sporting heritage for generations to come and fishing and so forth what what's what's is there an emphasis on trying to address how we can shrink the dead zone or prevent it from becoming larger yes so we have had some of the Gulf of Mexico initiative we've also had this what we call landscape approach to conservation in the Mississippi called the Mississippi River Basin initiative mrb I where we know we don't have the resources to treat every acre you can't provide palliative care to every farm field but what we're trying to do is then target where there's the greatest risk of loss sediment or nutrients and so we generally know if you science and state and local folks know where those areas are those kind of critical areas as priority zones we're then focusing targeting assistance to producers voluntary assistance again but it's hard when you talk to producers I'm sure you realize whether they're in Wisconsin Minnesota Iowa they don't really they don't have it I think emotional personal connection with the Gulf of Mexico but do have that personal connection to their local creeks their local watershed their local community and so for example that's why we're partnering with the state of Iowa and their Iowa nutrient reduction strategy working side by side with the REO department of agriculture and other agriculture Iowa agricultural water alliance where they're taking a proactive voluntary approach working with farmers in Iowa to address their local concerns that may be impacting city of Cedar Rapids or join ultimately that will benefit folks along the Gulf Coast but you're making it tangible and real for folks in Kentucky and Ohio in Indiana how they can be part of the solution but also see improvements in their communities but ultimately we will roll up to a cleaner water flowing into the gulf well we just need to get them to come down there and do some fishing and then that I believe they will have that emotional connection to the Gulf Coast Thank You mr. yes an invite for everybody on the committee bar

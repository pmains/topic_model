madam speaker i rise today to address the partisan appropriations bill house democrats are forcing through congress this week with a 50-50 split in the senate and a margin of just a few votes separating democrats and republicans in the house american voters clearly want congress to work together to produce a bipartisan spending plan in response democrats have ignored the american people and produced one of the most partisan budgets in history their bloated bus contains nearly 600 billion dollars a funding increase in more than 21 percent from the last fiscal year this bill is a progressive wish list it boosts funding for the white house by nearly 40 percent and the vice president's office by 22 percent it rewards the most liberal agencies like the epa and irs with massive budget increases only furthering their presence in our lives it continues more than it contains more than fifteen hundred earmarks returning us to the corrupt practice of pork barrel spending it contains harmful regulations to kansas farmers and ranchers by no longer exempting producers from greenhouse gas reporting requirements and reverting to old regulations that decrease meat processing capacity further suppressing the price of live cattle the worst part of h.r 4502 however is the absence of the hyde amendment a traditionally bipartisan provision protecting taxpayers from forced financial complicity and elective abortions in the bloated bust democrats purposely omitted the hyde amendment and instead took the opportunity to voice their support for radical abortion policies i cannot support legislation that mortgages the future of our children and grandchildren i oppose h.r 4502 and urge my call

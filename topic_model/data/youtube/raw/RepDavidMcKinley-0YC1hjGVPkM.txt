for three minutes uh thank you chairman whitfield for holding his markup today um these new regulations addressed in in this bill are emblematic i think of an administration that's just seemingly unaware of the consequences of adopting changing rules standards and regulations across america job creator after job creator who sat right there at those seats and have told us time and time again over regulation is killing our economy in this country is anyone listening apparently not the administration continues to green light the regulators how is it working out on friday it was announced that 92 million americans are not in the workforce any longer said in december for the job growth for every job that was created five more people dropped out of the workforce what's even more troubling the news is reported that one-third of all the americans have lived in poverty under this administration for at least two months and 97 of all the jobs that had been created in the last year were part-time jobs part-time jobs the income gap between the rich and the poor has expanded under this administration this is not the american dream adding new regulation after new regulation are crippling america's economy people can't find jobs excessive regulations cause job losses shuttered plants factories increased utility bills and less hope for families through dreams this is not fair this isn't what we should be doing here our priority in congress should be to create an environment where businesses want to expand and create jobs not create environment for larger and more intrusive government we need to support the whitfield bill get government off our backs i yield back the balance of my time mr mckinley thank you very much

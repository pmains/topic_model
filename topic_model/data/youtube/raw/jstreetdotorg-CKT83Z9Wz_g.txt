good evening j street i'm richard goldwasser from chicago in the latest addition to the j street board of directors and i'm hannah fishman sophomore reed college and west coast representative to the j street national student board when j street was founded we knew that if we're going to be an effective and powerful pro-israel and pro-peace voice here in washington we needed to organize back in our hometowns we had to reach out to our communities in los angeles and cleveland in austin in new hampshire and chicago and in every city in the country we needed to talk about the urgent need for u.s leadership to resolve this conflict with our neighbors and with our friends and family with our rabbis and with the editorial boards of our local papers and we knew we had to change a broken conversation at universities and colleges across the country a conversation in which it has meant for too long that to be pro-israel one makes the case that only palestinians are to blame for the conflict and to be pro-palestinian one argues against israel we needed a new pro-israel voice on campus one that recognized the aspirations of both peoples one that is pro-israel pro-palestinian pro-democracy pro-two states and pro-peace in communities across the country we are growing j street local launched on february 4th 2010 with 22 locals when we gathered last year there were 31 locals

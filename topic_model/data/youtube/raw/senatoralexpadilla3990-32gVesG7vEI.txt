thank you mr chair um glad we had an opportunity to come back uh for uh the second panel i know the first panel had a very focus an emphasis on uh us penitentiary atlanta uh but with a number of federal facilities in california that i've been hearing from wanted to take the opportunity to raise this a couple of these questions my office has received reports that uh vop personnel at fci mendota were flouting covet protocols leading to the transportation of covet positive detainees and spikes in infections now senator feinstein and i sent a letter to the attorney general seeking answers concerning these allegations back in april however the agency response we received failed to reply to our specific concerns raised concerning fci mendota and mr carvajal appreciate you looking through some notes here hopefully we can get some uh clear insight as to what's happening so my first question is how do you respond to the allegations uh that i'm raising here today that we first wrote about back in april well senator we certainly don't we expect anyone to flock covet we have very good procedures in place and they're followed i'm generally aware of that letter and we have 122 facilities and again i go back to that we have regional directors we have processes in place to provide oversight we take these allegations seriously uh we look into them and we do the corrective action the the cons the continuous challenge is that it's different people we zero tolerance for unacceptably not following policies so we look into these things and we address them so you say there's protocols and they're followed we send you a letter saying we're hearing protocols are not being followed it's a dangerous situation this pandemic and the response again is not informative or helpful whatsoever whatsoever other than we have protocols that are being followed and if not we're going to look into it and we already communicated to you months ago that we understand they weren't being followed so as part of our follow-up with you i'm aware that bop utilizes compliance preview teams to ensure that facilities comply with protocols now after senator feinstein and i raised concerns about fci mendota was a compliance review team deployed to ensure compliance with covet protocols senator i don't know in this particular instance but we do use compliance teams we also ensure that we follow cdc guidance and pro and processes and guidelines so i would expect that they were again delegated i have 122 facilities they're delineation of authority and i fully expect those follow-ups to be done and when they're not that we have procedures to address that so beginning to share the frustration with the chair here on lack of a definitive answer um given what i've described so far and if you're familiar with the letter it seems like you were perusing it in your binder would you agree that would be appropriate to deploy a compliance review team and after such concerns are being raised yes senator and i don't i don't know why we didn't i would i will ask that question and follow up i would expect that the appropriate regional director requested the team or that the assistant director with oversight for that area would deploy a team but i can't answer that right now because i don't know let me try a different issue now augmentation the bop practice involving the push of civilian employees into duties usually performed by correctional officers has long been scrutinized unless you tell me you believe otherwise i will continue as of last year nearly one-third of federal correctional officer jobs were vacant that's a significant percentage as a result staff members who serve as cooks teachers and nurses have been forced to guard detainees just this week my office received reports that at fci dublin staffing has been so low that the drug treatment program had to be shut down now this is clearly a dangerous and unsustainable situation mr carvajal what efforts have you personally taken to overcome staffing shortages at bop not what issues may be in place or efforts may be in place by others your personal involvement in addressing staffing shortages well senator my personal involvement as well as the agency is it's a top priority staffing remains a concern it has been a concern we we struggle like everyone to get employees but we are doing using incentives we're looking at uh offering more recruitment and retention incentives we need to better our training we certainly need to attract the candidates to the area one of the challenges at dublin as i referred to earlier is that we have trouble competing with the pay scale in that area so we have a hard time attracting candidates certainly staffing is a priority an institution is safer when it's well staffed and we strive to add staff i'll i'd like to address the augmentation and and make sure that everyone understands that all of our staff are equally trained they're all federal law enforcement officers they go through the same training so although they may have a primary duty as a working in food service or another discipline which we certainly want them to do the safety and security mission comes first and oftentimes we don't like doing it but we have to complete that mission first in order for anything else to happen so we have to use staff in those areas they are properly trained all of our staff are equally trained and expected to perform those functions as we call correctional workers first so so you're saying nurses and teachers are equally trained and prepared to do the duty of all other correctional officers senator they go through the exact same training that our correctional officers go through ongoing training or senator that's one of the challenges that we're trying to do to improve the agency is conduct more training when we have the luxury of doing that training we try to do advanced training we're implementing a new program for correctional officers but at this point all of our staff receive the same training annually refresher training there is no advanced training that correctional officers receive senator the uh well that should bring alarm bells here as well i know my time is running out but let me just uh sort of conclude with this and emphasizing the point why vacancies are dangerous both for detainees as well as for staff and it's crucial that critical that trained guards be available to respond to critical situations so that those who are not trained to do so are not placed in harm's way again the lives of both detainees and staff are on the line now my office has also received outreach due to a number of detainee suicides at fci mendota and according to reports the latest suicide occurred while recreation department staff members were supervising detainees recreation department staff members were supervising detainees mr carvajal i don't believe that the staff members should perform duties that lie outside the scope of their employment especially when it comes to correctional supervision i i want to ask additional questions here because the responses are a recurring theme you say it's a priority you say there's incentives but the numbers will a third of the positions vacant shows failure in my opinion something's got to change and you're the person at the top thank you mr chair

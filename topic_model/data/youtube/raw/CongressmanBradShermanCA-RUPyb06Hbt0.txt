so on video and on is yes on the on the way and I'm confident that my opening statement will take longer than it takes him to to get here I want to welcome all of our colleagues to this first subcommittee meeting of the congressional session for the Subcommittee on Asia the Pacific and non-proliferation we could not ask for a more timely hearing with the president in Vietnam income Kim jung-un having just arrived there by train and we couldn't ask for a more distinguished panel including governor bill Richardson who's famous for negotiating and negotiating successfully with North Korea as well as Victor cha who's has negotiated with the north as well I and the ranking member will give opening statements for five minutes and then whichever subcommittee members wish to make an opening statement will be allocated two minutes whether we are safer now than we were in June 2018 when the Singapore summit was held and what can be done in Hanoi that will make us safer these are the two questions that we ought to address in the first year of his presidency President Trump ratcheted up the rhetoric to an extreme level little Rocketman etc this rhetoric was matched by the North Korean rhetoric and there were the some that worried that it could lead to a kinetic war Trump stopped the extreme rhetoric now things are calm ER that dialing things up and then dialing them back is hardly a great accomplishment the facts are these when Trump took over North Korea had yet to demonstrate a hydrogen bomb now they have during the Trump presidency 20 the the North has created enough fissile material for perhaps 20 additional bombs perhaps eight additional bombs worth of fissile material created just since the Singapore summit I'm not sure we're safer now we have had a a period without testing but that's hardly unusual the North conducted no nuclear tests from 94 to 2002 and from 2007 to 2013 they suspended their missile testing from 2009 to 2013 so a pause and testing of merely a year is is not unusual what is unusual is this in the past pauses and testing may have slowed down their program whereas now Kim jong-un said last April he doesn't need any additional tests he's already developed his hydrogen weapon in his ICBM several hostages have been released by North Korea but we have with us a witness who was able to secure the release of a light number of hostages without making concessions to the North Korean government and the remains of several servicemembers have been turned over to the United States but once again we have a witness here who did that without making any concessions perhaps you should write a book called the art of the deal but more importantly much larger numbers of the remains of our servicemen were turned over to us during the Clinton and Bush administration's we have made enormous concessions to North Korea first Kim has stood on the same level as the most powerful man in the world second we've weakened our sanctions in two ways first the very act of the summit signals to businesses around the world that they can do business with North Korea and second we have not sanctioned major Chinese banks mr. Yoho and I with him as chairman both in 2017 and again in 2018 of this subcommittee sent letters to the administration demanding that the major Chinese banks be sanctioned not just this tiny ones and we've received no substantive response there has been substantial leakage and our sanctions and the change in atmosphere caused by the summit is a major reason for that we have weakened the u.s. South Korea military defense capacity during the Obama administration we had three to four major exercises per year we've had zero major exercises with South Korea since Singapore and the one there is one that's scheduled for the future that may or may not happen in any case has been scaled down as general Abrams the commander of US forces in Korea stated this suspension has led to a denigration of the readiness of our force so we've made massive concessions while getting nothing in return that makes us safer nothing I believe and I see I've gone into overtime a bit here so I'll be as quick as possible I believe we need tougher sanctions starting with those two big Chinese by the the two letters that we sent focusing on several Chinese banks large Chinese banks that would send a signal that it's not business as usual or even business under the table with North Korea second and I realize this is somewhat controversial we ought to define down our definition of success I do not think we're going to get Civet complete irrevocable verifiable disarmament of all nuclear weapons but we would be much safer if North Korea had a limited number of nuclear weapons that were highly monitored if we were in that circumstance North Korea would not be in a position to self is Isle material or nuclear weapons we would limit the amount of damage that they could do and we could move ourselves to a safer position that we have now that's certainly much better than seeing new fissile material created every day even while the summit is is ongoing with that I yield to the ranking member there you go I appreciate it and I thank you governor Richardson good seeing you dr. cha good seeing you again I had the good fortune of having breakfast with dr. Chung in Moon this morning who is the adviser to moon jae-in and his take was a little different he thought things were moving along very well and he was very impressed with president Trump what he's doing but let me go to my notes good morning and thank you chairman Sherman for calling this hearing members on both sides of the aisle share share similar national security concerns and oversights priorities in regard to the ongoing nuclear diplomacy discussions between the u.s. and North Korea this important issue is fitting for our first subcommittee hearing of the hundred sixth congress 116th congress i look forward to continuing the strong bipartisanship and cooperation that this committee has displayed in the 115th congress as you said we are on the letter together and we're going to continue to hold the administration accountable this committee work this committee works respectfully together even in some areas we may have disagreements over the next two days president Trump will conduct his second summit with King Kim jong-eun the totalitarian leader of North Korea the word historic is often used to describe this summit that that much is true u.s. dpk dprk diplomacy has never before taken place at the heads of states at this level we shouldn't forget that when President Trump took office President Obama warned him that the Korean Peninsula would present him his most urgent security challenge however over the course of President Trump's first term we moved from the brink of war to a period of diplomacy again the heads of two states first time ever as this administration moves forward let us not forget who Kim jong-un is he is number three in a family lineage hierarchy that is held to diety stature he has a lot of citizens to suffer while chasing his nuclear ambitions is the dictator who is executed over 140 members of the elite and military that surrounded his father and grandfather including his own uncle he ordered the assassination of his brother in Malaysia using VX nerve gas he also threatened the u.s. with nuclear annihilation and he sent medium-range ballistic missiles over Japan and proudly claimed that he would target our territory in the South Pacific Guam and the mainland if so desired so yes this is a historic second summit but we must call but we must call for extreme caution as we move forward keep in mind three previous administrations have attempted to solve North Korea dilemma and failed allowing the Kim regimes to advance or nuclear programs and capabilities unfortunately one fact outside of the White House control remains unchanged the Kim regime does not deal in good faith Kim jong-un appears to be using the same playbook as his two predecessors used before which is to promise peace denuclearization in exchange for sanctions relief once this is granted the DPRK continues their deceit lying and continuation of a dangerous nuclear program we need to note that nothing has occurred since the Singapore summit in 2018 in terms of denuclearization I'm extremely concerned that any concessions presented by the DPRK diplomatic outreach are hiding equally significant risks the president and his team have a giant task at the facts show us that North Korea is not taking any meaningful action to dismantle its nuclear or missile programs there's been no disclosure of the number of nuclear bombs ICBMs or even clear definition of what denuclearization means to all sides much work needs to be done during the second historic summit meanwhile Kim jong-un's international standing has never been higher as you pointed out Chairman Sherman kim's diplomatic gambit has led South Korean president moon to embrace him as a partner in its shared dream for peace and reunification it has given him the pretext of strategic coordination with China and a personal relationship with Xi Jingping Kim will also visit Vladimir Putin in Russia later this year Kim's diplomacy has cost him nothing but has short-circuited the unanimous UN sanctioned campaign although Putin and she were never reliable partners in pressuring North Korea Kim is showing he can leverage China Russian relationships against UN un-led sanctions and u.s. maximum sanctioned strategy and our goal is to hold the administration accountable the goal of this committee is to facilitate the summit to allow this administration to be successful where previous administrations came up short I believe our combined intentions are to hold the administration accountable make sure sanctions are not relieved until we get significant assurance and verification that the actions of the Kim jong-un are sincere and bringing denuclearization of the Korean Korean Peninsula we privileged to be joined by the two witnesses who have personally sat across from North Korean counterparts at sensitive talks and I thank them both for being here with us today today's hearing will be a valuable opportunity for this subcommittee and the members to develop an understanding of the specifics of this week's summit and what expectations are reasonable and what we should realistically expect and how to measure success and I yield back thank you who seeks to give an opening statement down the line here let's see the gentleman from Virginia I thank the chair and I want to welcome our our panelists especially my old friend the governor bill Richardson who has a distinguished career but maybe the most important part of his career was he served as a staffer on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee a great place from which to launch a career you know mr. chairman all of us while our president is overseas at a summit negotiating with one of the most notorious dictators in the world we wish him well we want our president to succeed nothing would be better than to have success in denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula once and for all and setting the North Korean regime on a peaceful path for prosperity and coexistence with its neighbors especially South Korea however it is important that we approach negotiations clear-eyed and I worry as too many Americans I think that our president arrives in Hanoi in a very weakened position and because he doesn't do preparation he doesn't read briefing papers he doesn't like even briefings verbally that he enters into these negotiations maybe with positive spirit but not with great preparation and what could go wrong with that when you're up against Kim jong-un and and and one trembles a little bit at the answer to that kind of rhetorical question and so I think it's really important that we be very clear-eyed about what our goals are and that there be no fudging and that there be frankly no further concessions to the north until we see specific reciprocation on the table and so I hope the success but I think we have to prepare for the worst I yield back mr. mr. Biren Thank You mr. chairman and thank both you governor Richardson and dr. cha for your service to our country along with the men and women that we have serving our country all around this world as we speak I was at that same breakfast with the the ranking member and we had with dr. moon as well as our former ambassador ambassador Stevens who has a long history on the Korean Peninsula the the one take away that you know I think they left us with is I think is my colleague mr. Connolly clear let's go into this open eyed but let's also understand realistic expectations of what we might be able to get out of this and I think those realistic expectations are maybe you get the parameters that allow you then to say okay here's what the steps are moving forward as opposed to coming out with any concrete deal etc and I think they both dr. moon and ambassador Stevens said that would be a realistic successful goal if there were the framework and the parameters of how you now proceed and you know what those next steps are again not with any promises etc but the next steps and what a dialogue would be I'll be very interested both of your expertise on the peninsula on what you think those parameters would be and and what a successful outcome of this this meeting over the next few weeks and with that I'll yield back recognize the gentlelady from Virginia thank you to the chair Thank You governor Richardson thank you dr. cha for being here the North Korean regime continues to pose a serious security threat to the United States our interests at home and abroad and ahead of the week's summit in Hanoi we must also recognize how North Korea's belligerent and destabilizing behavior in dangers our long-standing allies in the region and threatens our own country I am always in favor of pursuing diplomatic negotiated solutions however Kim jong-un has repeatedly demonstrated that he cannot be trusted and we should always view his intentions with incredible skepticism as the United States weighs its diplomatic economic and deterrence options to push back against North Korean aggression and promote peace on the Korean Peninsula we need to pursue a smart tough strategy informed by US intelligence that protects the lives of u.s. servicemembers in South Korea and actually limits North Korea's nuclear capabilities additionally we need to avoid any concessions that could jeopardize the safety of our allies and we cannot ignore Pyongyang's long record of atrocious crimes committed against its own people as talks proceed I'll keep fighting to prevent American communities from living under the potential threat of North Korean missiles nuclear weapons and cyber aggression and I'll continue to voice my support for increase US diplomatic engagement and improved coordination with our allies that protects US interests and recognizes the true threat that is currently posed by North Korean regime thank you I yield back seeing no other requests for time I'll introduce our first witness since 2010 governor Richardson has operated the Richardson Center for Global engagement a foundation focusing on conflict resolution prisoner release and environmental protection in his long and distinguished career he served as governor of New Mexico Secretary of Energy the US ambassador to the United Nations and as a member of this house for 15 years overlapping my service in the House by exactly one month before he went on to serve as our ambassador to the United Nations as Jerry points out governor Richardson started working in the Senate and then came to the house showing tremendous upward trajectory he has regularly served as an official and unofficial interlocutor with North Korea for more than two decades during this time he has visited North Korea eight times once with dr. cha securing the release of four Americans being held hostage in North Korea and helping to bring home the bodies of seven American servicemembers who died in North Korea we are honored to have you and very pleased to have you as the summit begins to open governor Richardson so my best years 14 were as a member of this house although I wasn't privileged to serve on this committee it's good to see former friends or good friends congressman Connolly congresswoman Titus you mr. chairman I haven't had the pleasure to to speak to others here but I will tell you I've been here long enough to say that I saw mr. Levin come in and I was elected to Congress in 1982 with mr. Levin's father it shows you how long I've been around and it's great to be with Victor cha there's probably nobody in this country that knows the peninsula better than dr. cha and you are right mr. chairman we went together to North Korea and brought back the remains of seven of our service members the first summit between the president and chairman King and in June 2018 produced a good moment for both leaders they struck a personal relationship an aspirational joint statement a couple of outcomes such as the repatriation of remains of US servicemen and I think the president does deserve credit for taking the meeting with Kim jong-un the region is the region is less tense there's more diplomacy there is considerable I would say better atmospherics in the entire region however the last summit failed to produce what I think is a workable framework for negotiations and like other summits there was little or no staff work on substance prior to the meeting as a result following the summit the two sides did not have a roadmap on how to proceed and what we saw was disorganized efforts to get to a framework with both sides positioning but without any progress I think chairman Kim has made it very clear that his preferred negotiating partner is President Trump not Secretary of State Pompeo not the the chief negotiator Steven vegan or working-level teams this is why once the second summit was announced negotiations and communications between the two sides were revived by the way I think that the special envoy for North Korea Stephen beigen is a very skilled negotiator who's worked with many members of Congress and I would recommend the subcommittee calling him for for briefings after the summit so what we have is a situation where I think these latest talks unfortunately the whole issues of disarmament arms control which are key have yield that a bit to what is called peace diplomacy which is good but the main focus I believe and accomplishments should have been the dismantling of nuclear weapons WMDs missiles and and my sense is that the summit will fall short in that area we should be clear about what our expectations of what is possible what is not and would be the cost of an agreement with the North Koreans point number one chances that the North Koreans will get rid of their existing stockpiles are very slim or non-existent they believe that these weapons are the reason we're negotiating with them and the only reason we have not yet overpowered them militarily point number two we can expect and demand the North Koreans cease all further development of nuclear weapons WMDs and ballistic missiles and have clear means for verification of dismantling such capabilities number three we can expect and demand the North Koreans cease any future testing of nuclear weapons and ballistic missile and have verification of the dismantling of launch and test sites point number four we can expect and demand the North Koreans cease any proliferation of operations they have on nuclear technology WMDs and determine the means to verify this in return point number five the North Koreans are going to demand the removal of sanctions the end of the war the normalization of relations and the reduction of military presence on the peninsula so an agreement with these guidelines I believe might be possible should be gradual but broken into smaller reciprocal steps thus a successful second summit between the two leaders should produce what the first summit failed to do one a detailed framework for negotiations including timelines terms of reference and routine schedule of summits number two set times for ongoing negotiations both working-level high-level and perhaps additional presidential summits considering chairman Kim's preference to negotiate directly with the president president presidential summits should not be ruled out as long as good preparatory work is done and I'm not sure because of the president's diplomatic style that we're heading into this summit with the best preparations lastly terms of reference for negotiations general guiding principles for final agreement definitions and constraints as well as timelines and benchmarks for the negotiation process number two and this is very important an agreed pathway to recover and repatriate remains of US servicemen as the chairman pointed out we we got some but there are many many more and the since this is a mutual interests of both sides it's an easy and very powerful outcome for the summit many of you I'm sure have relatives or have constituents that are affected directly with the remains of our soldiers very compelling families that have come together to organize and ask that the US administration over the years try to bring back the remains of several thousand of our men and women that have been in North Korea number three a mechanism and safeguards to mitigate risk of conflict if a crisis in negotiation occurs this can happen by establishing a hotline between the leaders or mitigating contact group to include regional stakeholders there are other gestures the United States can offer that are short of policy concessions which can be highly symbolic and motivating for the North Koreans recommitment to the aspirational joint statement of the June summit the summit would be a failure in my judgment if the following is not produced one failure to produce a practical and detailed framework for negotiations failure to define benchmarks in terms of reference without such framework negotiations are going to fizzle once again until the next summit has announced number two failure to establish a roadmap for recovery and repatriation of remains and three ambiguity and no record of agreements and understandings reached between the two leaders during their one-on-one meeting so finally mr. chairman here's my concern I I stated the first one that the disarmament talks yield and not produce concrete denuclearization agreements the danger I see with North Korea is they don't want to denuclearize we have different definitions of denuclearization my worry too is that somehow we will not get in in the summit inventory of all the nuclear weapons fissile material that North Korea has they are very concerned the North Koreans having talked to them for years that if they disclosed where these sites are that we're going to bomb the sites quite frankly and they don't want to disclose but that's essential for any kind of verification or arms control agreement so my concern is that on the issue of arms control and disarmament there's going to be a very low bar for success such as destroying the nuclear reactor at Jung Byung which I've been to that reactor I think that's been promised several times I'm not sure how operational it is and dr. cha probably has better information than I do also they've been some sites that have been allegedly missile sites terminally terminated I'm not sure if even verifying those sites or that one or two sites that that is significant disarmament initiative on the part of North Korea another concern I have is that the negotiating partners in the past that we've had Viktor myself have been the foreign ministry and generally the Foreign Ministry of the North Korean Republic the the DPRK they're pragmatic you can deal with them on prisoners on human rights issues relating to remains especially the Korean people army the military which in my judgment is quite flexible our negotiating partners are the intelligence people now the spy chief and I'm not sure that diplomacy wise they are necessarily the most flexible that concerns me too so in in in at the very end in conclusion here's my worry that yes some positive statements come out of the summit some positive initiatives such as perhaps some joint searches for remains of our soldiers to sites that are being looked at for joint excavation of remains to a liaison office alright that's good that's good that we talked that's good that we have operations in North Korea the North Koreans may not agree to it because they think that that's a way that we spy on them three human rights issues relating to north and south investments economic development development of joint economic facility between North and South family reunification for north and south that's good but my concern is that the true goal of denuclearization which is the issue of dismantling weapons of mass destruction missiles nuclear detonations nuclear will not happen maybe a freeze alright that's better than nothing but those are my concerns mr. chairman I I want the president to succeed you know I I this is a probably our most dominant national security threat that we have but I don't think the threat is diminished Thank You governor and I think we all want the president to succeed dr. Victor cha is a senior advisor and Korea chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies here in Washington DC's also a professor in government international affairs at Georgetown University between 2004 and 2007 he served as director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council at the White House he was responsible primarily for our relations with Japan the Korean Peninsula and the Pacific nations dr. cha was also the deputy head of the delegation for the United States at the six-party talks in Beijing dr. cha thank you chairman chairman ranking member yo ho members of the committee it's a pleasure to be here with you today as well as with Governor Richardson the last time I saw you I think we were in Pyongyang T a little while a few years back but it's really good to be here with the governor let me first say that I think President Trump deserves credit for a couple of things the first is that he stepped away from the fire and fury posture of 2017 second is that he has invested in summit diplomacy based on the theory that there is only it's the reality that there is only one person in North Korea that makes a decision that's the leader of North Korea so you have to talk to them yeah three he's really invested a lot of capital into try to building a personal relationship with the North Korean leader and so I think as everybody said here we want him to succeed this week but what I want to do is focus my comments on five numbers that I think we need to take into consideration with regard to what's going to happen this week because there are a lot of opinions here and around town on North Korea not a lot of data so I'm going to bring some data points to the discussion the first is 1963 and 1963 is important because it is when North Korea started landscaping the ground for where they would build the young beyond nuclear complex so this was not a program that started after the end of the Cold War when they lost the support of the Soviet Union in China they had been building his program for well over half a century so I I think as many of us can t believe I don't think they're fully going to denuclearize second number is 20 that refers to the number of undisclosed missile bases in North Korea short-range medium-range and intermediate-range ballistic missile bases North Korea can close facilities without denuclearizing they can close facilities that they no longer need the things from their past and they can promise things about their future the promise not to transfer the promise not to do more testing but what they will hold in their hands is the present and that are things like those are things like these 20 minutes bases the nuclear weapons stockpile things of these innate things of this nature that's a negotiating challenge the third number is 108 and this is the number of times that the president has made reference to his made reference to the question of whether that we need to have US forces in Korea one of the key metrics for me of the success of this meeting will not be so much what North Korea gives because I think that they will give very little but that we do not cut into our alliance equities and offer those as negotiating chips to North Korea things like our exercises and our readiness our troop disposition on the peninsula these are not things that should be traded for temporary gains on North Korea the fourth number is 2007 2007 refers to the last agreement that that we were a part of where North Korea agreed to a peace regime on the Korean Peninsula and the stipulation then was that at an appropriate time North Korea and the United States and other parties would engage in peace regime talks the phrase at an appropriate time referred to North Korean denuclearization returned to the non-proliferation treaty and full scope compliance with IAEA safeguards so the idea of a peace regime was contingent on these steps forward what we are doing now is we are potentially front-loading the peace regime part to see if we can get steps towards denuclearization and compliance with IAEA NPT safeguards and finally fifth the fifth number is two and that refers to two years have gone by and the administration has still not appointed a senior envoy for human rights abuses in North Korea the human rights issue is often sea pick framed as a distraction to the negotiations but it isn't for all of us to achieve our objectives the human rights issue needs to be addressed for president Trump has made very clear that the core element of his negotiation is to offer North Korea a brighter economic future in return for giving up their weapons that brighter economic future cannot come without some addressing of the human rights abuses because there is no international financial institution there is no general counsel of any American corporation that is going to recommend putting money into North Korea if there are human rights abuses along the supply chain so it is in the interests of both the United States South Korea and North Korea to bring human rights into the discussion thank you very much I'm gonna hold off on my questions for a bit and recognize the gentlelady from Nevada well thank you very much mr. chairman and thank you and the ranking member for bringing us such outstanding witnesses they're so knowledgeable and so much appreciate their being with us today both of you have mentioned how the president likes to negotiate directly with chat with the chairman and he seems to prefer this mano-a-mano kind of diplomacy as opposed to anything multilateral some of us believe however you have to include your allies as you move forward in any kind of negotiation and I believe part of our success working with North Korea will be able to work in collaboration with both Japan and South Korea would you two please address what you think are the consequences of our not bringing them into the circle or how is our leadership in terms of getting them to work together with us on this even though their interests may not always align and their interests may not always align with ours might in my judgment Congresswoman we need to work with Japan better than we have my sense is Japan has been left out of the negotiations with North Korea you know there's a rivalry with South Korea who has been deeply engaged with us so Japan is vulnerable to a missile attack and and this is a horrific prospect that the Japanese people are concerned about they also are concerned about getting [Music] some of their human rights issues addressed by North Korea South Korea I think president moon has been very constructive he was elected as a peace candidate dialogue with North Korea but sometimes I feel that he is getting ahead of us on wanting and an agreement with North Korea at all costs and in my judgment they're great allies and dr. cha mentioned I think it was a mistake initially at the first summit for the United States to make a concession which is to reduce or terminate a number of military exercises we had with South Korea so the last peg here is China I do believe China has made a positive effort at sanctions you know most of the commerce that goes through North Korea is is through China and China I believe through the United Nations and other entities they're cold sanctions energy sanctions people sanctions against North Korea but they're not going to operate well unless they're enforced I think China has done a better job in the past of enforcing sanctions but there's a lot of cross-border contraband that they could do a better job of enforcing and quite frankly I've been a little worried I know we have some tense trade negotiations with China that somehow China is going to say well you know you want to slap some tariffs on us maybe we won't help you as much on sanctions with North Korea which is vital Russia has not observed sanctions as much as they should in fact very little that's another problem so you're right congressman you've got to have regional support for what you're doing I'm pleased that they're having the summit in Vietnam I think Vietnam is an emerging positive country that is that is pro private sector that you know is concerned about Chinese expansionism and I'm pleased that they're part of this regional situation but the six-party talks which Victor was involved with the other countries which encircle the whole issue I'm not sure the six-party talks can be revived again I hope they would but this is how I see the regional perspective that you mentioned so on China the key is to get China to continue to enforce sanctions without Chinese economic pressure the North Koreans are not going to be willing to negotiate in earnest ninety percent of North Korea's external trade today as with China so they don't put pressure on it doesn't work with South Korea it is really restraining them they're so enthusiastic about moving forward that they too can do things that would undercut us leverage at the table and then with regard to Japan as governor Richardson said they are they're going to be important to any political and diplomatic deal that's reached with North Korea historically they've been important in the past two deals and they will be important again so it is important that we is critical that as we go into Hanoi that we have all of these pieces in the right place and that takes work that is theirs bilateral discussions with the North Koreans but there is also all this work you have to do on the side do you feel like that's taking place I think with the South Koreans I have a sense that it is but it's difficult with the Chinese because of the trade disputes and and Korea and Japan are two key allies are just not talking to each other right now and so it was important that secretary Pompeo in his last meeting with the South Korean Foreign Minister expressly talked about the need for more trilateral coordination because usually we go into these meetings with North Korea having fully consulted with Seoul and with Tokyo and right now because of the difficulties between Seoul and Tokyo were not able to do that Thank You ranking member is recognized Thank You mr. chairman I appreciate your testimony again I'm gonna just reiterate the historic nature of this you know in the past there's been three to three attempts in the Clinton administration in the bush and the Obama administration to bring peace to the Korean Peninsula yet during those negotiations they were traditional they had traditional negotiators people from the State Department diplomacy and all that and they didn't work and so I think this is a great tactic history will look back on this moment whether it was a good one or a bad one and let's hope for the that it turns out the way we want it to but and and you brought this up governor Richardson an agreement should be gradual and broken into small reciprocal steps and you both have got experience in the Asian market in order to do business what we have heard what is the first thing you have to establish to move forward in any negotiations over there dr. cha I mean you have to establish a relationship you have to establish a relationship with the other party you just don't slap a legal document on the table you have to establish a relationship and that's what Americans are bad at we've been told over and over again you guys want to get here get the bottom line and you don't want to know anything about us and and so I commend the I don't say the 4sight a president Trump reaching out to do this and he's lavished praise and edification on Kim jong-eun that he's probably never had and I'll hold off on whether he should deserve any of that at this point but we need to look into the future where we're going and we can't move forward if we don't have that initial trust in that relationship and then I had opportunity to talk to special envoy vagin about what denuclearization is do we have a firm of what it is that all parties agree on do you guys have any speculation or any idea do we have a a sound definition I think that there is a definition congressman you know that has been agreed to by the North Koreans in the past in writing and that is denuclearization means they will give up all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs that is language that they signed up to in 2007 I believe that's I I believe that's what the President believes and that's definition I think that will try to push for in Hanoi I believe North Koreans we have a different perspective of what D denuclearization is I think that's the problem in other words we think congressman that denuclearization is dismantling destroying ending whatever the 40 nuclear weapons the WMD the North Koreans don't believe in that definition they want to keep their weapons they want to keep some of their weapons now so far they dismantled nothing so there's a definition what's the word I'm looking for a definition deficit here yeah what nuclearization is now I do agree you have to have trust I think maybe that was the word you were looking for in the relationship between the two leaders and and and I will maybe take a little issue with what you said under the Clinton administration the agreed framework North Korea did not produce any weapons for nine years and I think the Bush administration negotiated well with North Korea the problem was North Korea was intent on increasing their arsenal and and they're still doing it right now while saying therefore Dino right and I just and let me just add here I'm not putting criticism on anybody right okay you know because that's not going to do us any good it's what can we learn from that that we can move forward and again at breakfast I had this morning with dr. Chang in moon he's been there at all three negotiations probably the only person that was there on the first three and he's been to every meeting up there with president moon he says he has seen a distinct difference in North Korea today from when it was before before when they went there it was all military that was present in the negotiations in the streets in Pyongyang whereas today you don't see hardly any military presence so the atmosphere in North Korea has changed let's just hope that we can have a definition that we all agree on that we can move forward based on that trust and what he said that Kim jong-un has said that we've destroyed Young Penn nuclear site but it was a non-functional one his way understood it but yet he hasn't sent anybody in there to verify it from the outside world other than their word and those things have got to be built upon to move forward and let's just hope that the skilled people we have with secretary Pompeo and Steven Bagan can move in that direction to help facilitate those documents to move forward and that once and for all we bring this Korean conflict to an end peace to the peninsula with reunification as they see fit to serve them between north and south and that we look at trade because our top for trading after World War two we were in a war with Germany France since then that was Korea and Vietnam none of those countries today have nuclear weapons and there are some of them are best trading partners so the idea that we want to implore to Mr Kim is you don't need nuclear weapons let's just focus on trade and get rid of this and move forward on our economies and our countries I yield back thank you sorry thank you that's fine gentleman from Virginia I think the chair well maybe on a more critical note I think could be made for diplomatic malpractice in how we're approaching North Korea remember that this is the administration that ripped up the jcpoa with iran that by all accounts is working in every metric because it was inadequate and yet they meet with the nuclear threat Kim Jong un in North Korea and he gets international legitimacy from meeting with the president the United States that audience with the president directly the cancellation of military exercise with our South Korean allies and in the joint statement they don't even mention the denuclearization needs to be irreversible and verifiable which is one of our goals not even mentioned in the joint statement nor is there any mention of the North poulos North's ballistic missile program a criticism used to justify the evisceration of the jcpoa why shouldn't we look at that and call that what it is diplomatic malpractice we got nothing and Kim jong-un got a lot now maybe that's the strategic sort of move where we're being patient and waiting for the future and this summit may then prove that there are other steps but it seems to me that thus far nothing has happened and we haven't even furthered the goals ostensibly we say we're committed to dr. cha thanks congressman so I'm a professor so I'll give you another number and that is seven that is the number of pages that the agreement that we worked on in 2007 was it was seven pages long this part the six-party joint statement the jcpoa I think was a hundred and fifty pages I do believe that if we are going to move forward with denuclearization with North Korea we're gonna need a document that is much more detailed certainly than what came out of Singapore and even what came out of the previous two agreements under pres bush and under President Clinton well let me just a little footnote yes but from your point of view after the first summit did kim jung-han commit to anything no I think the first summit laid out a statement of principles in many ways it was an agreement between the leaders about about what the outcome of diplomacy should be which is normalized relations a peace treaty and a fully denuclearized North Korea but subsequent to that there were really no steps that took us tangibly down any of those paths governor Richardson with what dr. John what you said on the diplomacy side I've been very involved with the remains issue I think something positive has come out of that we need to do a lot more I do think there's some human rights family reunifications between north and south that are better third you know this is very vague but there is less tension in the peninsula however congressman I agree with you in terms of what North Korea committed to in the first summit complete denuclearization they've done nothing there in fact they've increased their enriched uranium capability they you know they're not doing much that's right this is why I hope the president and and and the congresswoman yo congressman Yoho mentioned Steven begun and and Pompeyo especially began he knows what he's doing mr. governor Richardson because I'm gonna run out of time but I thank you for that answer let me ask one other question one of the concerns some people have is that North Korea is about to get us into a trap so that we sign an agreement ending the war after 66 years but in doing that which is a laudable goal we undermine the rationale for us troop tripwire presence in South Korea is that a realistic concern dr. cha and also governor Richardson and I yield back the balance of my time yeah I mean I think there is some concern among experts that in trying to get bigger steps on denuclearization we might put bigger chips on the table as I said in my testimony I think there should be a bright red line between things that we do on sanctions versus things that we do with our alliances sanctions liaison offices some of the things that governor Richardson mentioned they may be part of the bargain but we should not be trading away alliance equities if the chair would allow governor Richardson also to answer I think it's chair congressman I agree I would not trade an end of the war treaty for unless there's a denuclearization of sizeable numbers of dismantling of weapons and WMD and missile I would not perhaps a a begger statement that says tensions are less and the war is over okay maybe but not as a trade off unless they're substantial denuclearization and I'm concerned there's been some reports that were considering that and and it means exactly what you said the vulnerability of us being are having to look at troop reductions in South Korea we have 30,000 troops er 28,000 I'll recognize mr. Barratt after I recognize the gentleman from Utah Thank You mr. chairman and ranking member this is an important harrion thank you to our witnesses for being here I'm hopeful that we see a productive summit I for one view it as historic and important to be taking these steps however we know that the Kim regime does not negotiate in good faith and I think many of us are optimistic but the worrisome regardless of the outcome of the summit I for one will you to urge the administration to use every possible economic and diplomatic solution to find answers and bring us forward as I've listened to your testimonies and and the questions of my colleagues I I sometimes feel like we've got a cultural thing here in America where we want to solve everything immediately and we hope that one summit or two summits has this magic ability to solve it so I'm curious from both of your perspectives not whether we're on the cusp of solving this but how do you see the trajectory are we improving and moving in a good trajectory I guess that's my simple question governor first and then dr. John well the trajectory it's going to depend a lot on the results of this summit this upcoming summit starting today or tomorrow my hope congressman is that there be substantial progress on the denuclearization issue one you talked about long range I think it was unrealistic for anyone to expect North Korea to denuclearize completely they always have and and if you look at that language they've said it in the agreement with Clinton with Bush and they never do it now is there a trajectory that is more positive I think we've underestimated Kim jong-un I think in the end and I'm not I'm not praising him I'm saying he's his vision is in exchange for the lesser this man some dismantling of nuclear weapons he wants American investment he wants European investment he wants infrastructure he wants energy a new grid and so the trajectory is is in that direction his father I think was more of a I won't call him it was more of a negotiator he used to say okay well you want this prisoner back from the united states sent president clinton to pick them up you know it stinks right that and and i hate to push it but i'm gonna be short on time so okay let me move on so i think if we look starting congressman from 2017 2017 there are twenty North Korean ballistic missile tests and a hydrogen bomb test and we were moving military assets to the region I mean it was a really scary time I mean since then we've gotten the diplomacy we've got no more testing by the North Koreans I just came back from South Korea about ten days ago and there's a completely different view know in South Korea everybody says the war is over like why don't we just admit the war is over so I think there has been certainly a positive trajectory since 2017 but as the governor said the key pieces we really need to see tangible steps on denuclearization coming out of this summit because this has to be a road to somewhere right and and and so that's the only piece let me kind of follow up on that we we almost exclusively talk about denuclearization and yet we've said in this hearing today that Japan could be hit by long-range ballistic missiles is it a mistake not to have a broader scope than just denuclearization no I agree that it must include ballistic missiles not just the long-range ones but also the shorter and medium-range ones as well what is there culturally that Americans need to understand that would help us better understand this process I mean two cultures right are very very different I mentioned earlier ours is one of immediate expectations and things like that what is their culturally that Americans could better understand that would help us get our arms around this process well from my experience yeah from my experience they negotiate totally differently than we do their idea of a concession is they think they're always right it's a deity that guides them the father the grandfather Kim jong-un and their idea of a concession is they'll give you a little more time for you to get to their point of view that's their idea of it they always want you to go first you make the concession and then we'll you know we'll see about whether we reciprocate or not they're deeply suspicious of us totally I mean they think if we disclose if they disclose where their weapon sites are we're gonna bomb them I mean there's just I mean there several times is just that fortunately I am or I'm let me thank both of you and yield my time back I know I had said it would be the gentleman from California however the gentlelady from Pennsylvania has returned she is vice chair of the subcommittee and she is recognized thank you I appreciate that and thank you gentlemen for your testimony the history of negotiations between the u.s. and North Korea is obviously long and tumultuous but one thing is clear and I think a lot of people have been talking about it the importance of the of our allies and our partners in the region and making sure that we're respectful to them what is your assessment of how the administration is or isn't implementing areia or the Asia reassurance initiative Act which we recently signed in December and specifically can you talk a little bit about the us-korea special measures agreement that was recently also agreed to and the impact that it might have on our bilateral relationship since it is a short time frame instead of a longer time frame and then finally if you could talk about that impact on Japan who is also up for that same kind of conversation as well and its impact on our relationship with that important ally I would say that the special measures are SMA negotiations have created a lot of ripple effects I think not just in Korea but in Asia and allies more broadly I mean it's clearly a different template for negotiating at least in the Korean case the non personal cost of stationing US forces in Korea where you know sometimes said the president wants cost-plus which is very different from what's been negotiated in the past a very tumultuous 12 months of negotiation led to this interim agreement it's not followed as much here in the United States but it's followed very carefully in the region and the SMA Korea negotiations were watched by Japan they were watched by NATO because they they're next on the block these are not easy negotiations even in the best of times but I think these particular negotiations are quite contentious contentious and it's not clear to me what the ultimate effect will be in terms of how the Allies perceive the United States as we continue to ask for more and more of these allies Congresswoman sometimes I feel that the u.s. South Korea relationship is very important but if anything I would say to this administration for instance they are obsessed with having South Korea pay more for the military relationship that we have yeah we do want to save money but the u.s. military relationship with South Korea's in our interest to and sometimes I'll say the president says well they should pay more all right and and South Korea is paying a little more but that is a very valuable military relationship for us not just because of not just because of North Korea but because of China and the region secondly with Japan we should be more conscious of Japan's needs in this security relationship with North Korea yes the president and the Prime Minister of Japan have a very good personal relationship but somehow the Japanese government you can get a briefing on this feels that they've been left out of this negotiation yes China again it's a very complicated relationship we have with China and we absolutely need them to keep enforcing sanctions or the pressure on North Korea will deteriorate now there are some very good as I mentioned family relationship more investments between north and south I think all of that is good less tension thank you and my last question is as a member of the Armed Services Committee as well as this one very concerned about the suspension of exercises and in other committee hearings that I've had the military folks have been also similarly concerned about how long we can do this and still remain ready and effective do you all have any insight into that as well so my understanding is that when we go for a full year without exercising then we're really starting to erode or erode readiness their elements as you know well of these exercises that we can do in other places like Cobra Gold but there certain elements of the exercise kit that can only be done on the peninsula so this is something really that has to be considered you know if we're looking to suspend the spring exercises which were to start actually this month if we suspend those again I think we really need to think about how we're going to maintain readiness because readiness as part of deterrence and that's what's made the peninsula peaceful since 1953 thank you and sir I would just add this was a concession in the first summit that we got nothing in return so we should not concede that one again maybe you bring them back those exercises of North Korea is not conscious of doing something on denuclearization they're valuable for South Korea for the United States for our troops you know you want them ready in case there's a misfire or some kind of small conflict that could light up the whole region thank you that's incredibly helpful gentlemen thank you very much for your time I yield back the gentleman from Utah is recognized oh excuse me no the gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized Thank You mr. chairman thank you gentlemen for your testimony mr. dr. cha what was the United States posture visa V North Korea prior to this administration from a hostility / wartime footing I mean I'm trying to I'm not trying to evoke I'm not trying to put words in your mouth but what would you care how would you characterize our posture visa be North Korea prior to the start of this administration it was I think popularly known as strategic patience which was sort of a medium level sanctions plan with the effort of trying to bring North Korea to the table to negotiate and what was North Korea doing under that posture they were actively building their nuclear weapons programs and ballistic missile programs and were on the verge of testing at the end of at the end of 2016 and I believe that those tests would have happened in 2017 no matter who was president writes it said they were building progressing testing and and from the from the United States standpoint I think that we were at a posture of considering armed conflict with with North Korea but if but if I'm the only one here that thinks that I mean do you get that sense that that's where we were what my sense is that the previous administration was really focused on sanctioning towards the last sort of last 12 months in office were really focused on ramping up the sanctions campaign which then the Trump administration took to an even a higher degree I agree with that but having look I've participated personally in the military exercises on the peninsula as a service member and I was in this house at the time of the last administration and the conclusion of it and I attended briefings with the uniformed service members who I would just tell you in my opinion the posture of the United States military was planning for armed conflict if necessary in North Korea and I just want to ask if if you dispute that if you can dispute that maybe that's the best way of putting it you don't I don't know congressman I mean I think what I what I recognize the most was this effort at building sanctions on the regime and and focusing on more robust access sure sure but but the sanctions weren't working right they were still constructing they were testing and they were posturing the rhetoric everything was was in my opinion maybe I'm wrong so if I am wrong correctly but everything we were seeing from North Korea was bellicose yes yeah right so let me ask you this is the fact that they're not launching missiles out of the ocean and over Japan and continuing with nuclear tests for the last essentially the greater part of the last two years is that can that be viewed as a concession or not it's certainly an important non-event yes 15 months of no testing of any sort is good for the diplomatic climate and also makes it harder for them to develop their programs right right so look I'm not pie-in-the-sky here and I'm not looking the life through rose-colored colored glasses North Korea is a hostile actor and an enemy of the United States of America and Western civilization and democracies all around the world that that's a given right but I think we're - you know I think it's hard to say objectively that we're not at this very point in a better place from a rhetorical and a wartime footing visa V North Korea than we were at the Latin at the end of the last administration I think it's hard and and there's been a price to pay for that let's let's just let's just admit there's been a price to pay for that but I think that Americans right now are sleeping a little better not wondering if tomorrow their sons and daughters are going to be called up to go to war on the on the Korean Peninsula with potential horrific artillery barrage on Seoul or nuclear weapons being exchanged across across the lines I mean is that reasonably safe to say yeah I mean I think the this administration's decision to engage in the summit diplomacy with North Korea as it has certainly played a role in their not testing right has made this situation lock on so so you know because the the the tenor of the meeting seems to be that the president's failed what's more dangerous we're giving everything away we're getting nothing for it and look I don't like dealing with dictators at all but I understand they live in the world today and if we're gonna and if we're gonna you know try and fix things we're gonna have to have a good discussion with them and I don't remember anybody on this committee on the other side of the aisle being too upset when when the last administration negotiated with with Cuba and opened up relations with them one last question though for you sir with Asian diplomacy particular and and specifically visa vie other places in the world isn't the personal relationship key to success in that as opposed to the tenor the tenants of an agreement or the or the facts of the matter I mean the the relationship is what folks from that part of the world see as key and and building a trusting relationship to moving forward is that true or not true generally speaking yeah I mean I think if we want a watershed agreement with North Korea their needs you need to establish trust with the only person who makes a decision and how many meetings has this president had with that with with President Kim this is now a second meeting this is now so we have we have one meeting we've had one meeting and we're predicating all the rhetoric here in this committee on one meeting the start not the end of negotiations like in the jcpoa but the beginning with that mr. Chairman I yield recognized the gentleman from California great Thank You mr. chairman I'm gonna take a little bit of a different perspective than my colleague from Pennsylvania I don't view foreign policy and our strategic aims through a lens of partisanship or one administration or another administration and I would say you know I had my issues with the prior administration President Obama and strategic patience which I did think eroded some of our strengths in that region you know I'd pointed it's not China Sea and the complexity of not addressing that a bit more aggressively I'd also argue that you know having been on the same committee having gone through those same briefings I don't think the prior administration was putting us on a war footing I do think our troops on the peninsula constantly are training constantly are prepared for those of us that have gone to the DMZ and talked to those troops you know they're constantly ready for anything to happen I do think two years ago at this time and you know even a year and a half ago the tensions on the peninsula the the potential of kinetic conflict the potential at war was much higher I will credit the Trump administration for being willing to negotiate and maybe there was a strategic goal there of increasing those tensions increasing the possibility of war increasing the sanctions to bring them to the table so you know I'm going to give credit to the administration to starting a dialogue I have very real concerns that the outcome of the first summit was or yeah a halting of our true preparation our exercises in the region I think we have to continue to maintain a strong posture there I am very concerned and both of you referenced that we hear the the the rumblings of troop reductions troop withdrawals you know regardless even if we had a safe Peninsula that was moving forward with denuclearization the presence of our troops on the peninsula serve broader strategic importance served strategic importance of stabilizing that region we have an adversary in China it serves a strategic importance and being a check on China's aggressiveness in the region and I would caution the administration I would point out that Congress does have an oversight role here there are checks and balances our colleague from Arizona mr. gallego has in the prior Congress introduced legislation to you know if trooper debt troop levels fall below a certain level you've got to come to Congress and justify that and I think those are the right steps for us as a body this is going to be a long process and again I'm not criticizing the Trump administration I'd rather see dialogue I'd rather see where we are today where the the atmosphere on the peninsula is not one of imminent war or concern but is one of looking at how do you do move how do you move forward so both of you in your opening testimony and you know my sense is let's not set expectations for this summit super high but let's actually be realistic and if we can come out of the summit with that framework and that parameter of what does this look like moving forward in terms of meetings who's going to be negotiating future chairman and and president Trump negotiations you know government what would if you were sitting at the negotiating table what would success look like to you and then same question to dr. cha well success for me would be a commitment by North Korea to dismantle some some of their weapons missiles I won't get into a number because that they very WMD some tangible dismantling what else are remains do you think that's realistic out of this particular sentiment as opposed to I guess success of what a framework of next negotiating steps would be a freeze would be a mild success of existing testing weapons new development but in a way North Korea has already done that you know so you you want to move forward establishing a liaison offices is good for both sides dialogue it would allow for instance our inspectors to have a chance our inspectors verification timelines that is also a definition of success more joint excavations of our remains I think dr. Chow mentioned eventually discussion on human rights religious freedom there but I think that since I'm gonna run out of time let me just you know it is some of us also think part of the reason why Chairman Kim is willing to sit at the table now is they've acquired their nuclear capabilities they've acquired their missile capabilities etc so now they're not negotiating from a plate so a weakness or negotiating from place where they've acquired some of those capabilities and that certainly let's go into this with our eyes wide open so I would say that in terms of what would be success I you know a the key word is is verifiable verifiability whatever the North Koreans give up whether it's a couple of sites or whether it's a promise not to produce more fissile material it has to be verifiable right and and and so they decommission some sites after the Singapore summit as congressman Yoho said but they didn't allow anybody to verify it and so that's really the key piece to me is to see whatever they put on the table how small or how large it has to be verifiable recognize the gentlelady from Missouri I thank Thank You mr. chairman for organizing this hearing and thank you to our witnesses for their time following up on my friend and colleague mr. barreras line of questioning dr. cha US Special Representative for North Korean Steven vegan who Gunnarsson has spoken so highly of has noted that even as the United States pursues a direct leader-to-leader format for the current talks with North Korea it is supplementing sup summit level meetings with intensive working-level negotiations do you think this strategy will better ensure the u.s. walks away from Hanoi with some sort of acceptable deal agreement congressman I think what certainly what was better in in process with regard to this summit was that there was a lead-up of intense as you said right working-level negotiations that Steve Egan led the first summit in Singapore as you remember was just an announcement that they were going to meet and there was no working-level effort so that those working-level meetings are important to help the outcome of the summit be success it's not just happening at the summit let's be clear to cha it is happen it's been in the lead up to the summit in a very intensified ways from what I understand it said your understanding yes yes and that is that's the way it should be done great wonderful governor Richardson you have spent decades working through formal and informal channels in North Korea to secure the release of American citizens held unjustly by the Kim regime informal exchanges like the relationships you have built over the last several years can be highly effective in promoting mutual understanding how do your efforts support and intersect with official talks oh uh yeah I think you you asked a question about special envoy vegan I think he's very effective you know the administration can salts with me they don't listen though listen to me either they don't even talk to me they do there's sometimes my point here congresswoman is I think you need yes presidential the president that's good personal relationships but you need the staff work in preparation Frank and sometimes I wonder because of the president's style that that doesn't happen as much as it should I hope he's listening I mean we're going to find out in two days whether this summit is a success or not he listens to secret envoy bigint secretary Pompeyo you know who's had to negotiate with the North Korean spy chief ever since the first summit or before the first summit my worry is and before I think you came in I said it's better to negotiate with the foreign ministry types in North Korea rather than the intelligence people because they're more flexible we'll see what happens in this next summit we were kind of hanging on to for the result but you would agree that both formal and informal lines of communication are important correct absolutely absolutely you know on prisoner exchanges on rescuing American servicemen on remains yeah I mean we thank you for your leadership in that in that regard Russia and China appeared to be weakening on sanctions enforcement although US negotiators are working to solidify support in advance of the Hanoi summit that shot how worried should we be about Chinese and Russian compliance and how can the u.s. convince the international community to kind of hold the line so it is I think it is a real problem congresswoman the any agreement we make with North Korea has to be enforceable and enforceability means also sanctioning if they violate the agreement and China holds a lot of cards when it comes to sanctioning I mean I think the only the only way to really they'll trying to do this is to be willing to secondary sanction I mean to go after Chinese companies that are will it willfully and knowingly violating US law that's the only way to you found the secondary sanctions can be very effective I think I think they can they certainly spread the net of who is responsible when it comes to this I mean China is a UN Security Council member so they should be complying with the eleven UN Security Council resolutions with regard to North Korea on particularly on trade but they they really haven't been for about 15 months now well thank you I think my time is about to expire so I yield back mr. chairman thank you I'll recognize myself at this point as to denuclearization I'm not sure that we disagree as to what it means I think we disagree as to win all the signatories of the non-proliferation treaty including Russia in the United States are on record saying we look forward to eventually having no nuclear weapons in the world and I'm confident that Pyongyang will denuclearize as soon as the United States and Russia do so as to the change in the level of tension 2015 and 2016 was not a period of particularly high blood pressure we had a policy of strategic patience wasn't a good policy but at least it wasn't a policy fraught with tension the tension was in 2017 it has declined since then as to a minimal level of success I think I mostly agree with the governor but I would say that if we had a verifiable halt to the creation of more fissile material that would mean we were safer if all we have is a halt to testing well Kim has said he's done all the testing he needs so a new test might not make us less safe since it would give him the information he already has or it claims to already have whereas clearly a halt to the creation of new fazham aterial if verifiable would make us safer dr. cha you talk about the importance of human rights we obviously need to be bringing this up it's very important to the North Koreans one place where they could make a concession easily is to allow more family reunification visits particularly for the hundred thousand Korean Americans who have family north of the 38th parallel is there any reason why Kim wouldn't make that concession other than he knows we want it so he wouldn't want to give it to us they disadvantaged to him to allowing such family reunifications with Korean Americans yeah no I mean I think as you said that there are still many divided families as a result of the Korean War this could be a very useful humanitarian gesture I say useful because from the perspective of incentives there's every reason for him to do it if he wants to have you know a more positive view of of himself in the in the broader in the Bronner press but but there still needs to be there needs to be a raising of the human rights abuses not just humanitarian issues uhm congressman could I just yes to that what North Korea needs more than anything in terms of investments it's not necessarily the United States it's South Korea mm-hm and there is a an effort by South Korea to possibly invest in the railway in North Korea the Kaesong joint facility that was shut down so my point is that North Korea will want to make strong family reunification it's in their interests if they want this South Korean investment I mean that's called politics that's something that you're all the entrance the North Koreans have a conventional military double the size of South Korea and yet they're pressuring us to remove some of our 28,000 troops while of course North 3 is almost a million or to make those troops less effective by canceling exercises I've been told that the long term North Korean dream is you get America to withdraw its forces this makes international business less interested in investing in South Korea that leads to the kind of economic decline in South Korea that makes unification on their terms possible is there any lid how do the North Koreans argue for a diminution of American forces in South Korea when they have such a powerful conventional military governor doctor well I think it goes along with and this goes back to the gap and denuclearization definition is it goes back to the way the North Koreans defined denuclearization they define it as being their willingness to do this will be will happen when the United States is off the peninsula and no longer has a security commitment to South Korea that is when they consider a real the real concept of denuclearization it's good politics in the United States to announce an end of the Korean War and sign a peace treaty all Americans like be streets this would not cause pressure on the United States to with move its forces from South Korea well we have a world war two is over with peace treaties in Europe and in Japan and we have had troops in Germany we've got troops in Japan so the question is would a peace treaty with North Korea it obviously is important to them but it would it create pressure in South Korea to expel American troops doctor doctor or or governor quickly I'll just say that yeah quickly I'll just say that you know I think it would start to create a discussion about the utility of US forces in Korea once a peace declaration of some sort was made certainly among the progressive camp in South Korea maybe less so among the conservative camp but certainly among the progressive Kim okay then finally governor what are the phony concessions that North Korea can make are there facilities that are no longer useful to them yong bong i guess is may have out you have that's usefulness the nuclear weapons testing facility they destroyed some are all out because it outlived its usefulness what are the things they can give up that sound important that aren't important you mentioned the two that are I think most obvious the young beyond facility this test site where they blew up I think the sides and they didn't allow inspections for the press there those are what I would expect they will try to get away with III just happen to think that if they continue to say we're not going to have any testing nuclear testing missile testing they've already done that I I want them to do a lot more well I'm not diminishing that but you know this is something that they've done the last it's now almost a year let them do more again I agree with dr. Chuck verification is is essential of what they do and I'm concerned with one concession that I sense we may be giving up and that is list all of your sites your facilities and inventory so this can be inspected and verified and I sense that we're kind of may lose that at this summit all the press conference reports are that we've given up on that and that and with that I'll recognize the gentleman from Michigan Thank You mr. chairman and thanks to you and the ranking member for the terrific witnesses here I think both of you for coming good to see you governor Richardson dr. cha want to start with a question for you about Human Rights the logic behind choosing Vietnam this summits setting seems to be that if Kim sees first hand Viet Nam's economic success he'll want to mirror that success in North Korea or put another way he may see an incentive to D nuclear eyes one issue that seems to be missing from this calculus though is human rights Human Rights Watch reported earlier this month it and I'm quoting Viet Nam's one-party state severely restricts fundamental civil and political rights and has stepped up its harsh crackdown on activists and dissidents reports indicate that these crackdowns range from arbitrary arrests of activists to a lack of press freedom to a grossly unfair legal system Amnesty International has documented more than a hundred prisoners of conscience who remain in prison at the risk of being tortured or ill treated so my question to you is is there a risk that Kim will get the message that North Korea can indeed achieve what Vietnam has and that just like Vietnam he doesn't need to respect human rights to do it Thanks Congress it's a great question I you know I certainly hope that's not the message that he will get I mean if anything I think what would be very useful would be for the North Korean leader to get a briefing about all the laws and now exist passed by this body with regard to not just proliferation but human rights abuses that will make it impossible for US companies to do any sort of business in North Korea that could probably be the most important thing that could be told to him that would be incentive for him to try to address the human rights abuses in the country I really need to study up on that because I've noticed a lot of US companies doing a lot of business in countries with gross human rights violations over the years maybe we've done a better job more recently before I came to Congress I think of not this isn't just about Korea or Asia you know and in in Latin America and Central America and all over the world in Africa and so forth I mentioned earlier I think that the Trump administration is failed to a point special envoy for human rights in North Korea which is a requirement set forth in the North Korea Human Rights Act of 2004 what impact do you think this vacancy has on the coordination of our larger North Korea policy so as you mentioned it is mandated by Congress President Bush appointed the first special envoy for Human Rights J Lefkowitz and then President Obama appointed Bob King I think the most important job position role that this position plays is a leadership role not just here in Washington but at the United Nations and indeed around the world with regard to getting the international community to focus on the human rights abuses in North Korea one very quick example last December the UN Security Council did not vote for raising you North Korean Human Rights in the Security Council agenda which I think was a big defeat because they had done it previously and there is another opportunity this spring perhaps after the summit but it requires US leadership and if we don't have an envoy and if we don't have an UN Ambassador it's harder to do that and do you think that this lack of appointing someone sends a signal to the international community about our commitment to human rights more broadly well I think that there are a number of people around town who have drawn relationship between the absence of human rights envoy and things that are happening in China more crackdowns in China the Weger camps in China so the United States always has been a beacon for human rights and human freedom and we should continue to do so thank you very much I hope we do continue to do so and I fear that we're not being that beacon right now mr. chairman I yield back my time thank you I recognize the gentlelady from Virginia thank you I'll point out we will do a second round but we will adjourn by 12:20 at the very latest Thank You mr. chairman so dr. Chow you've written extensively and governor Richardson and dr. cha we've talked extensively today about undeclared North Korean missile operating bases that may not be included in denuclearization discussions news reports earlier this month described a UN a confidential UN report that North Korea was engaging in what the intelligence community calls denial and deception techniques deliberate efforts to hide their nuclear and ballistic weapons to prevent us and others from discovering them dr. Troy you spoke a bit as well as at the about the idea that any agreements made have to be verifiable so my question is given the denial and deception how can we ensure that inspectors in given whatever agreement is made are gaining access to all of North Korea's weapons and facilities and operating bases and how can a u.s. negotiate an agreement that North with North Korea that would actually account for any undeclared weapon sites development facilities or operating bases and ensure that we can verify whatever agreements are made well it requires the President to raise it I mean this is I think there are things that North Korea will be willing to put on the table and the discussions over the next 48 hours but the key condition I think for our site to say that this is useful or successful would be conditions and protocols for verification I mean once they agree to verification we know how to do it the International Atomic Energy Agency knows how to do it there are people there who've known these North Korean sites for years from working on them in the past but it requires the President to raise it and for the North Koreans to agree to it as a former intelligence officer myself I'm a former CIA officer I'm particularly concerned about what appears to be a growing disconnect between our political and intelligence leaders and in particular the undermining of objective nonpartisan intelligence assessment so following up on that notion of what's verifiable allowing third party organizations to determine what is in fact happening on the ground in North Korea and also listening to our intelligence community assessments about what's happening in North Korea do you have any thoughts about what we as members of Congress can do to ensure that the White House is in the first place receiving considering and then evaluating the intelligence information and other information that is available and and created to help inform US policy engagement with North Korea it's a great question and again given your experience in this area you know a lot more than I do about this I will just say that when we were doing the negotiations 10 years ago the intelligence briefing that we got every morning was about the most important information that we could work from and without it personally I felt like we were just flying blind this is the hardest intelligence target in the world I think governor Richardson would agree it's the hardest intelligence target in the world but I think the ice Ric or the intelligence community has done a remarkable job trying to gain information not just about their capabilities but their intentions I would just add congresswoman what is critical is that you and this committee get the best briefings from our intelligence people that that's number one and I believe that what the NSA and CIA and Dia de and I'm concerned about this gap between the White House and our intelligence people and you know we spent billions on intelligence human assets technological assets and we should listen to them but but I think you and your role of oversight should should insist on those briefings what else would I suggest you know on the verification inspections are key the North Koreans will objective where are the inspectors I believe we the United States we should insist on that perhaps the International Atomic Energy Agency the IAEA that is involved with the Iran deal in the past well it still is that that may be part of the inspections regime thank you very much to the witnesses and to the chair I yield back without objection we will recognize a member of the full committee who is not a member of the subcommittee but the former chair of the subcommittee mr. Chabot thank you very much I appreciate I first of all I was in judiciary and unable to us but I would definitely want to stop by it's a very important topic and I'll go back and review the the questions of my colleagues and the answer is later on you know I I have to be very very honest about about this whole negotiations and meetings with Kim jong-un the he's somebody he being Kim jong-un as somebody if he's anything like his father and grandfather and I think in this case the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree we have to be extremely leery of anything he says and obviously the president and the people that he's surrounded himself with the number one the number one thing that we have to be focused on us what's in the best interests in the United States in our security security the American people now diplomacy certainly is better than military confrontation and I think we were getting closer and closer to that I think it was a game changer when we believed that they had either reached or were very close to having the ability to land a nuclear device on American soil I think previous administrations maybe had somewhat of a luxury in that we could continue to try to get North Koreans to back off their nuclear program and we could negotiate on occasion and we saw that when we had when we would get together with them and in general we would provide food and and energy resources and in return they would promise that they were going to back off their program or discontinue it or closed facilities and and would continue underground full speed ahead maybe not full speed ahead but they would continue the programs maybe not quite as quickly as they would have if they had agreed but they moved forward nonetheless so I'm concerned that that behavior will be repeated here that being said I hope and pray that the president is successful and that he really will be able to get some behavior change in kim jeong-hoon we can't predict the future but but I think we all are hoping that that's where we get so I guess my question then after rambling on there for a couple of minutes is should we be it should we be in a like President Reagan said he said obviously wouldn't negotiate with the Soviet Union trust but verify is this a should we be distrust but verify but hopefully I'll for example is somewhat well not somewhat quite skeptical well I am I likely to be surprised and there really is a possibility here that we will have peace on the peninsula and they will denuclearize with so I'd be happy to open it up to either bill or the other well congressman mr. chairman thank you for your years of service here to we a lot of us especially those have been around the block it was an it was an honor to call you a colleague and you've done great and done wonderful things for our country all over the globe so thank you for that well my answer is I was going to commend you for your very hopeful and positive statement night I believe we need to continue these negotiations even if this next summit does not appear to bear many results I'm concerned about that but this is the most this is the tensest region in the world right now I believe with nuclear weapons with missiles with our allies with our troops 28,000 in South Korea 30 thousand in Japan I think we need to keep talking and dialogue even if we don't get the results we want at this summit needs to continue and regardless of what administration's in power thank you sir yeah I'm yes I'm uncertain as you are congressman of whether we can get to fold the nuclearization but I do know that any steps we take along those paths cannot simply be promises that are made without verification because it makes no sense if nothing can be verified and and in the end if we take steps along those lines then we're moving in a positive direction thank you thank you very much I appreciate that I want to thank the chair and the ranking member for allowing me to participate thank you very much thank you one thing about sanctions is that if you're dealing with the democracy you have a little bit of sanctions you say depress income in the country by 10 percent that's a big deal it's not a big deal - Kim whether his people are 10% rich or 10% poorer and so the problems with partially relaxing sanctions is that you certainly do not have regime threatening sanctions if if you go from the what I think are the inadequate sanctions we have now to something even less my first question is about the Train Kim flew to Switzerland when he was a student he flew to Singapore last year he's on a train through China why well first the maintenance record of North Korean aircraft is not the best that's one secondly you know this has been a tradition in his family yes say me his father used to go to Beijing on a Norman in China Russia my trade I've seen that dream you ought to go see it it's at a museum in in Union well they move it in and out but lastly I think it's mainly a security issue and symbolically I think Kim jong-un was trying to show that he went through China and he needs China so it was giving visibility to China and and I think going to Vietnam is a signal that North Korea wants to do business outside of China with Vietnam we have this image that Kim is in total power yet I've studied dictators and none of them earn total power if he was in total power he could do whatever he thought was in the long-term interests of his dynasty what restraints are there what red lines can't he cross what people in Pyongyang can't across what institutions or is he really though the thing I haven't been able to find in history and that's the total dictator it's a great question congressman it's a hard one to answer I think there was a view when he first started that because of his an experience he needed to balance different factions in the party the military and of course the family but he is since then gone on as you know well such a ruthless purging campaign that I think many experts saw his trip to his first trip to China the first time out of the country and for as long as he was gone as a sign that he really had consolidated power so I think there still is a degree of purging taking place but you know I think relative to when he started he seems to be in about a secure position as we were we could have imagined you know six six years ago and he does seem to be calling the shots if and this would be my wildest fantasy he just goes to Nora Vietnam and gives up his nuclear program in return for getting the the Apple headquarters and maybe Amazon as well moved to Pyongyang whatever it took if he were to do that and none of us expected what repercussions would he have it at home or can he just go back and say hey it's it's time to be Silicon Valley he has total control in North Korea I think he's more secure than ever before his main objective a congressman or mr. chairman is his main objective is to stay in power more so than they taught with the United States or stay in power and I think a source of that is keeping his nuclear weapons or some of his nuclear weapons I think what you suggested maybe a little wishful thinking that you'll give it up but he has said to his people we have to improve our economy and and in a way he said you know the only way we can do that perhaps is they always want to deal with the United States they'd say to me you know we should settle things the US and North Korea not China not Russia not South Korea we're the big guys around here so I think that's why they're talking to us I'm gonna make one more comment and that is the fact that Japan and Korea can't cooperate is harmful to the United States national security and I recognize I brought this home to both Korean and Japanese leaders recently that they have a certain animosity from the first half of the 20th century but Poland in Germany cooperate and that helps our national security and if I had more time I'd ask for well you could respond for the record as to if there's anything we can do to get these two countries to cooperate on that on security matters I'm going to recognize the ranking member for a limited time and then I have to go and I know that wood has to go as well thank you both and I think the important thing is that we look forward to where we're going we can't worry about what didn't work in the past I mean we've got to learn from that but more forward-looking the thing that brought North Korea to the negotiating table correct me if I'm wrong was the unanimous UN agreement resolution that I think 17 countries placed severe sanctions on North Korea with people pretty much adhering to that ie US Russia China South Korea that put enough pressure to where they did come to the table since that point of time we've seen Russia China even South Korea with a transfer of is either coal or petroleum that they said was a mistake it did happen and they went after the the people you know taking that on good faith we've got a report and I don't have the UN report it will be out later this year that we've got a report of over 148 ship-to-ship transfers from January to August it was oil at sea how detrimental is that to our negotiations and moving forward if they start normalizing and allow this to happen and then more importantly what I'd really like to hear from you your recommendations to us on this committee as a bipartisan group to where we can hold the administration or South Korea or China or Russia accountable so that we keep that maximum pressure on them until we get a clear blueprint of where we're going and then the verification I want to ask you real quickly about that but if you would answer those so so first to the Chairman's earlier point about trilateral coordination for the record it's absolutely necessary are strongly the United States is stronger if we are lined up with our allies Japan and Korea for the record on the maximum pressure diplomacy doesn't work without maximum pleasure that the president's efforts at deployment will not work with maximum pressure and that and that speaks not just as you said not just to China but also to South Korea and then the third point is there is a way if we start to lift sanctions it will most likely be through South Korea South Korea reopening Kaesong Industrial Complex with the north I think where human rights matters there is we can require the South Koreans to ensure that they can pay the North Korean workers directly in Kaesong which would address human rights issue and address seeing the desire you know that came up today in our meeting ahead how can you pay him directly I mean is Kim jong-un gonna allow that to happen I mean that would have to go through him and he would have to okay that right right yeah if that happens that would be I mean that would be a huge concession on his part I would think to allow people to actually earn keep what they earn and put in the labor yes and it would be a if for our policy would be a huge success if if that could happen that would be a huge success governor you have any thoughts congressman my sense is that Russia is not observing sanctions there's massive violations that all terrible side of the border there are the the port Viktor what's the name of that port where the China has Russia has a short border yeah so I know were you talking Russia needs to get tougher and they're not doing it I think these UN sanctions were the strongest that we've ever had a lot of it has been working and it's essential that China continue the sanctions but the cross-border contraband the verification areas is key I always found that the most effective sanctions and I think this was in the Bush administration on North Korea were banking sanctions on their banks and Macau I think there's some of that left but the sanctions that have I think bitten that bite the most have been the coal the uranium the oil sanctions that are imposed now by the UN right but yet China and Russia are cheating and so what we wanted to do is go after the bigger banks Bank of construction Bank their agriculture Bank the big ones that would really hurt China and so we're gonna follow up on our letter to the Treasury Department through this administration and and I guess we're at a point the demand why are these not taking place because if we put that pressure on China and Russia they'll come to the table and I see China is just they're insecure because they fear North Korea becoming more like South Korea but yet if they look at the world overall or their largest trading partner and they're gonna benefit hugely from this but they're they're intimidated by success I guess of an open society and then you brought up and I agree with you what would wreck the inspectors I don't think they need to be US inspectors they just need to be verifiable inspectors that we have the faith in that they carry this out and you're in agreement with that right I'm out of time he's got to get to a meeting thank you both I want to thank our witnesses and my colleagues and look forward to exploring this further you

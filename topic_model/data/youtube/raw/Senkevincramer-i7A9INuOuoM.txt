thank you mr chairman and thank you administrator for being here and i i pre one of the things there are many things i appreciate about senator whitehouse but when he honestly says we come from different perspectives he's right but i remember what you said last week about the you know emission standards and energy production goals don't have to be mutually exclusive and i agree with him we should find more ways to capture natural gas rather than vent and flare it there's no productive use of vented and flared natural gas so that so let's work on common goals together and i'm going to get to that in my second question but first mr administrator i want to raise a separate issue and then i'll get to that to methane rule and natural gas um when you were in north dakota and thank you again uh for coming out so quickly after you were sworn in to talk to farmers and ranchers and others about about waters of the u.s but you met then with um our north dakota agriculture commissioner doug goring about about wotus but earlier this year february of this year commissioner goring sent your office a letter they're still waiting for a response on it was sent to the office of pesticides programs um and uh it relates it relates to the uh the existing stocks of unusable clerpirphus clerpiophus um you're probably familiar with that but anyway last last year you guys the epa banned the use of it of this chemical and gave farmers and retailers six months to dispose of it the rule came out i think it was in august which means winter it's coming in north dakota so farmers have the bottom line is farmers have a lot of this stuff on their shelves and they're coming up on having to dispose of it um same with retailers if they have purchased this you know in anticipation of the next growing season and there's been very little to no guidance on how to dispose of it our state's not prepared to be able to do that what i worry about quite honestly is a perverse incentive to you know dispose of it improperly if if there's a if there's punitive threats in in store uh or or use it illegally which i certainly don't advocate i i i'm just bringing it to your attention and just want to see if you could provide me some assurances that the epa is not going to seek to punish growers who who currently hold the product and work with their more importantly work with our state agencies to properly handle the disposal and we are we are even in north dakota that brown is dying out now and we're coming up on planting season so if you just sort of raise that to the top and get you know get back to commissioner gordon or me that would be really appreciated and if i might add please just i i think so in 2021 the court had indicated that epa had abdicated its responsibility since 2007. and they put us on a timeline and told us that either we could prove that clepirophos was not harmful at all or we had to take the action that we took it was a it was a hurdle that the agency couldn't meet so one of the things that we one of the situations we find ourselves in especially with pesticides is because of inaction over decades the court now is putting us on these timelines i can commit to you that we are working our regional office is actually working with your state now to think about how we navigate that tough terrain that we find ourselves in and that's what we want we want to be part of the solution so i'm grateful for that um i'm going to run out of time before i get to this um next issue but i'm going to start it um i want to turn to the methane regulations and the whole of government approach that i think is necessary to meet the goals that you've laid out and bring up you know something that's come up already a couple of times of course is a bipartisan infrastructure bill which provided among several things um some some regulatory streamlining for the build out of natural gas infrastructure for capturing natural gas and in the bakken uh where we produce a lot of oil natural gas is a byproduct of that and so we do have some venting and flaring now i've got a chart right there that we presented to you that demonstrates that uh sort of the different goal not the different outcomes and the the range of capture of natural gas from the bakken oil production ranges from 56 to 94 now the good news is that state average is 93 i'm going to make just a simple point here that the 94 is all state and private land and the 56 to 83 is largely either tribal land or other public federal lands my point being that that we need to do better on the federal lands and and the indian eyes and that's a bureaucracy that's what it you take bureaucracy and then you add another bureaucracy bureaucracy with with tribal lands and you have lots of bureaucracy so in as we work through this as we work through these goals these not mutually exclusive goals that you spoke of last week um i really hope that a lot of this is bia or i mean some bia but largely interior jurisdiction but the infrastructure bill did provide the nippe incentive in fact it makes nipa waves nepa on federal lands where we can demonstrate a reduction of methane emission which clearly if you're capturing the gas you're reducing um if you would i just want to make sure that the whole of government's working together that you're consulting with interior or that they're seeking your assistance because i think we can get to these goals that sheldon whitehouse and kevin kramer both have that you have um and you know get the courts off your back and do the right thing with a product that's more valuable being used than being flared or vented yes how's that for i almost did it under five minutes at least it was under six mr chairman a for effort i did my thank you if i get an a for effort from him it's a good well i can assure you on rating on a curve i can assure you on that topic doe interior epa ceq we're all looking at all the resources that we have our regulation to be sure that we're going in the same direction appreciate it thank you thanks mr chairman

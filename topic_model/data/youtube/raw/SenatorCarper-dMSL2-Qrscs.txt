III want to begin my remarks today by just saying a real special thank you to Senator Harkin and to do it to our colleague from Alaska Lisa Murkowski they are we are from different parts of the country we are democrat or republican a number of things bind us together and one of the things that bind us together is our personal commitment to to healthy lifestyles to eating the right foods and two to exercising and sometimes here's a woman who who has a bad knee because of a skiing accident here's a guy who broke his foot two years were run a half marathon so you know these things can time here's old Tom still going strong and these are these are a role model in all of this but as Senator Harkin suggested we face a an epidemic of obesity in this country of ours something like a third of all the kids are either overweight or obese and I'm told about close to fifty percent of the adults in our country they're overweight or or over these or obese and we know that the bad things follow when we're overweight and when r obese the propensity of four people to become to have diabetes develop diabetes early or late is heightened the the likelihood that will have heart problems the likelihood there will have problems with our joints our knees and in our ankles all of those things so we know we have the empirical data to say bad things happen when we become very large and we don't do anything about her weight and we've go the wrong way I'd stand before you today I could say will pass this legislation my hope is legislation we part of health care reform a lot of health care reform legislation will focus on wellness and our nutrition prevention this is a great piece of that but if if we did just at this piece however good it is and I think it's very good that's so this is all we did it's not nearly enough in terms of turning to tide against this rising tide of obesity and an American and Tom Harkin and with help from people like Senator Murkowski myself are working to do other things as well and the I salute Tommy's becomes for four years but if you look at the I think was in the farm bill when we change the women if controlled attack we actually we made changes there to encourage our to use of federal funds for fruits and vegetables when you look at go to my any school in Delaware go in there five years ago you walked through the schools in Delaware five years ago you can buy all kinds of sugar sugar soft drinks almost we're relatively little water you go into the the cafeterias to see what's being served at lunch not nearly enough fruits and vegetables way too much carbohydrates and fats that's change in my state in my state every high school in might say every public high school in my state now has a Wellness Center all those wellness centers have a nutritionist and so we're fighting this on a lot of areas with federal legislation state-by-state in our schools and with the curriculum with respect to exercise and and all that so there's there's this is a war that we're fighting on a lot of a lot of funds one of the things we have done in the things I was involved in earlier as I suspected time and and and Lisa been involved in tobacco trying to especially to turn the tide against the use of tobacco and especially with young people and we've come to the point in living in about ten years in this country where we've made up smoking almost on exceptional unacceptable socially unacceptable and my goal one of my goals is with respect to through being overweight or to being obese we wanted to really turn the tide of public opinion so that kind of behavior overeating that leads to obesity is going to be seen by more and more people as socially unacceptable let me just stop take a minute and we'll look at this to start you take a snapshot in 1990 a snapshot in the 1998 another Lee in 2007 remember this light blue is really good that shade of blue is not bad these sources of black right here mean we don't have the data this is 1990 the light blue says that fewer than ten percent of the people who live in those states were obese or overweight less than ten percent and the the somewhat darker blue says in the rest of the country for which we had data fewer than fifteen percent of the people were overweight over bees that was eighteen years ago that was eighteen years ago let's fast-forward through 2007 there's one state here that so I don't know if this is actually 15 is nineteen percent the state right here what would I be colorado colorado area colorado is really the the state that may be in the best shape of all we don't see any more like blue window senator dark blue we have data down on every state we see a lot of orange we see this cause head cheer down here this orange cross-hatched color over thirty percent over thirty percent of the people who live in these states are obese or overweight the very best that states that we can do actually here beside the Colorado which is fifteen to nineteen percent overweight then the next best states are the states these are kind of a tan tan color and they're twenty to twenty-four percent that's good today and then you go back to discuss 17 years before that nobody nobody on not we see none of the same colors here nobody was good no status is good now is it it was back in and sometimes it pictures is as good as a thousand would that's a pretty good picture as it pretty give alyssa one more go back to the nineteen nineteen ninety about twelve percent of the folks in Nara and our country were obese but the twelve percent today and it's almost been steady oyster steady rise so by 2017 we're up to oh gosh closing in on thirty percent of americans are obese I strongly believe like Senator Harkin that consumers should have the tools and resources that they need to make healthy eating decisions not just at the grocery store but also when we dine out he made the point we we spent about half the money that on our food at restaurants these these days and menu labeling is an integral part of addressing the right the rapidly rising rates of obesity a mini studies show that over consumption of 100 to 200 calories per day can cause a significant weight gain 200 calories a day 365 days a year is something like 73 calories 73 thousand calories think about that if we eat overeat 200 calories a day 365 days a year I think that works out to 73,000 calories that we have consumed over what we ought to be consuming no wonder we we've gained so much weight no wonder that we're so so over over beef so so obese well that's that over the past year three of us have work together with a number of consumer groups god bless him the Restaurant Association and public health community god bless them to come up with the compromise that provides important nutrition data for restaurant diners and provides the information we need in the same same amount way I just want to say a big thank big shout out to Darden Restaurants to the correlation for responsible nutrition information the National Restaurant Association on the health group side of the center for science in the public interest the Nemours foundation in Delaware down in Florida for all of your help and for working with with us to get us to this to this point very briefly here's the four things that the cliff notes if you will of this legislation number one calories are going to be printed on menus and on menu boards for chain restaurants that have 20 or more restaurants across the country number two other nutrient information is immediately available upon request we go in we sit down we see what the calories are on the board the calories are on the menu we ask for information immediately they've got to give us information well it has to be sodium the sugar carbohydrates all kinds of fats that information has to be immediately available to us as we prepare to to order and the other thing that that's of note here we preempt state and local laws pertaining to nutrient content disclosure and if they're non chain restaurants in a particular state that want to comply voluntarily with the state the federal law if they don't have to but if they want to then they can can opt in to the preemption preemption clause again I'll close wherever I stop this by itself it's not going to solve our problem with obesity in America this coupled with a lot of other things that we've already done and that we're going to do our terrific step in the right direction and Tom I want to thank you for years of perseverance on this and for giving Lisa and me a chance to work with you together we're gonna make a real difference for a lot of a lot of young people a lot of old people who want to be skinny people and they're going to have that changes thank you

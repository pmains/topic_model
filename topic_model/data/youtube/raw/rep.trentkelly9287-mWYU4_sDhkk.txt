from Mississippi mr. Kelly is recognized for five minutes you know I'm starstruck with this panel on thank thank you guys for being here mr. chairman thank you for bringing such a distinguished panel and it's great to hear from first of all you're all excited about what you do and I think enthusiasm is one of those things that any business or whatever you're doing that you have to have enthusiasm and to see people like you you're all role models for people out there so thank you for being here and for what you've done for small businesses on industry masala Vic and I hope I pronounced that right in the south we don't do over one syllable usually but first of all I want to thank you for for your mother and again it goes back to family and your father service this great nation that's very important to me and I think that our veteran on which we haven't talked about a lot but I like to give these guys and girls opportunities to to proceed forward because they paid their debt to this nation at any time we can forward their agenda and help them to be successful a life after the military that's great but can you elaborate a little bit on the Department of Labor's overtime row and how that's impacted your business and other businesses please certainly I've get a lot of concern from small businesses especially with the increase to the threshold of $50,000 it will cost jobs in many many small businesses and just also not even just the level of increase which is huge but the fact that the complexity of the guidelines is very very difficult for small businesses to follow and to know who's exempt and who's non-exempt and how it applies and when I mentioned my father's ambulance service you know it how do you say oh well today it was an ambulance tomorrow it was a hearse and who worked when and just the complexity of it was overwhelming to him and my other concern is and I hear this from many small businesses in smaller parts of the country particularly the Midwest and the area of the country i grew up in fifty thousand dollars in Manhattan is nothing fifty thousand dollars in fredericktown Missouri is a heck of a lot of money I just sold my family's home my father is now in assisted living it was a big house 5,000 square feet for bedrooms three three full baths two half baths a finished basement and an extra lot for a hundred and sixteen thousand dollars so it is a different world we can't make arbitrary decisions like that we need to give small business owners the flexibilities to manage their business in the way they deem appropriate we are not slave drivers and greed mongers like we saw in the industrial era we do want to care for our employees we want to care for our families we want to give back to our communities and the statistic on how much more a small business gives back to their community as opposed to a large chain company is significant so we're trying to be good we're trying to do the right things we just need government out of our business you know just if I could just add one thing to that I cannot stress enough the problem with complexity right people are people are happy to follow the rules but sometimes it is hard to know what the rules are then you spend money on lawyers money on accountants and time that you could be spend marketing or talking to your customers to just figure out if in fact you're following the rules correctly and if you make a mistake it's costly thank you thank you John I your back behind ear man

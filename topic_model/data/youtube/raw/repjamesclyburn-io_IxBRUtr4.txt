thank you madam speaker and i thank the gentlelady for healing me the time i listened pretty intently to the minority leader uh talking about theory a principle upon which a set of practices are made that's what the theory is we're not here today to talk about theory today we're talking about some actions some practices that were made we're talking about moving to make this nation more perfect and one of the ways you do that is by recognizing and admitting that we have a very spotted history when it comes to race i met my late wife in jail protesting practices that were based upon our skin color racial inequities that's what this is all about one of the statues in this building sent up here by my state south carolina it's a statute of john c calhoun john c calhoun is not here because he defended the southern states during the civil war we talk about those generals all over this place john c calhoun died in 1850 more than a decade before the civil war started so why is he here why did south carolina send his statute up here for us to honor simply because he was this nation's foremost proponent of slavery so much so until yale university from which he graduated took his name off to college that they celebrated him with clemson university he was one of the founders of took his name off of his honors college charleston south carolina where he is buried took his stature down overnight people went to bed around 11 o'clock at night looking at the statue when they got up at six o'clock the next morning it was gone because south carolina has done everything they can to get beyond those principles advocated by john c calhoun but his statute is here and i want to thank the speaker for moving that statute to some place out the eyesight of any school child coming up here i always call this hall america's classroom and we ought to be teaching in this hall that which is wholesome about the country this is a great country nobody denies that i don't call this a racist country i do say that this country has on occasion too often for my taste tolerated racism that's a fact and nobody can deny that fact last time this bill came before this body over 70 of my republican friends voted for it i would hope we could do a little better today and let me close by reminding my friend you know most of us who studied history we know when the republican party came into being we know when the democratic party came into being happens to be an older partner than the republican party so i understand all of that but we also know that in 1948 1948 hubert humphreys spoke at the 1948 democratic convention against segregation strom thurmond the democrat left the party came back and in 1964 when democrats came together and decided that they were going to pass the civil rights act of 1964 strom thurman the democrat left the democratic party became a republican and took all of those segregationists with him into the south carolina republican party south carolina republican party built itself on the confederate battle flag those are facts of history we can't deny those facts and we don't try to we try to do whatever we can to do what george santiano admonished us to do learn the history and gather lessons from that history or we run the risk of repeating that history what we should do today is relegate these statutes to the dust bin of history and our yield back

joining me now is a member of the Republican leadership senator roy blunt thank you so much for coming in this morning you've been in Congress a long time you have relationships across the aisle so what is your sense are you gonna come up with a deal so that this trial is gonna start early January yeah I think I think a deal is easy to come up with and we've even got the the plan in place from what happened in the Clinton impeachment and I think that's ultimately we wind up where we start down this path let both sides make their case let the house impeachment managers make their case let the president for what I would argue is the first time have a chance to make his case publicly for his his defenders to do that and then see where we are that's what happened with Clinton I think that's the best way to approach this and my guess is that's what we do otherwise we just sort of start down a path where 51 senators decide every issue as it comes up I don't know that anybody wants to either have that happen or take the time that would take on either side for us to get this this out before the American people both sides having a chance to present so as you well know the standoff right now is that the speaker is holding the articles of impeachment at the house until the parameters of the trial are done The Wall Street Journal editorial board said that the Senate should and even could hold a trial even if they don't get the articles you're the chair of the Rules Committee is that possible have you even looked into that you know I don't know that that's possible I think it's very unlikely I frankly don't think the speaker has the the right to do this or the power to do the speaker has a lot of power but once the house has spoken the speaker doesn't get the decision as to whether or not she transmits that decision to the Senate in my view I think we'll have this all handled by the time we get back in January I'm sure everybody is beginning to figure out how to present their case frankly I think it's a mistake on the speaker's part I think this has looked pretty political anyway and this is sort of the icing on the political cake we're at the end the speakers still can't go of this as an issue to try to wring the last vestige of politics out of I mean that the outcome here is virtually certain as I've been saying for weeks a partisan vote in the house would almost certainly result in a partisan vote in the Senate so that the outcomes certain trying to get that last thing out of it rather than move on as the speaker appeared to want to do one day last week and then suddenly she decides to involve herself in what the Senate should do so you say that the outcome is almost certain I want you to listen to what a couple of your Republican colleagues have said this is a political process is not anything judicial about it impeachment is a political decision I am trying to give a pretty clear signal I have made up my mind have you made up your mind well based on what I know right now I just don't think they made the case I don't think they came close to making the case you know this is called a trial because there was really in the Constitution I think no better thing to call it but it's it's it's it's a very political process five of the so-called jurors running for president not a single Republican in the House convinced that they should vote for either the articles of impeachment and a couple of Democrats convinced that they shouldn't vote for the articles of impeachment so it's it's not a classic guys flown to a federal judge one day this week and he said how could you call this really a trial it was a federal judge for a decade or more we're half of the jurors can overrule what the judge decides that ought to happen next it's not a trial in any classic sense it is a political decision to do it and at the end of the day every single member of the Senate has considerations that are pretty obvious okay so you don't think that the house made its case but let's just talk about some of one of the basic things now which is the president asking a foreign country the leader of a foreign country to investigate a man who is a political rival of his is that appropriate well at the same time you had the Attorney General asking leaders of other countries to help them look into the 2016 elections which is which is the bennett which is to benefit the united states this is a specific ask specifically about his political opponent so do you feel that that's program well the president and the Secretary of State and the retired lieutenant general who's a foreign policy adviser all feel like that call was within what do you think what is right I think you know I think I've never been very happy with any of the Ukraine decisions since the Russians invaded Crimea we told President Obama in December of 2015 to provide lethal aid which he never did you know I've never been happy with the way any of this has been handled regarding Ukraine and we're trying to to do what we can now to be helpful so your colleagues Ben Sasse called it very troubling the call asking for to help dig up dirt on on Joe Biden lamar alexander said it was inappropriate marco rubio said he shouldn't have done it and the list goes on any other president would have said I'll have the Attorney General call you about what some things were looking into this one didn't so did he make a mistake the president's make mistakes I don't know if this call was a mistake but again I think there plenty of mistakes have been made by both President Obama and president Trump regarding Ukraine and how to deal with the Russian aggression in Ukraine just like how to deal with the Russian aggression in our elections so let's talk about potential witnesses in the Senate trial some key figures like the GNAT former national security adviser john bolton haven't testified bolton's lawyer said that bolton was involved in quote many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far as a juror don't you want to hear from him you know as a senator and as a person who believes the Constitution is there for a purpose I think is the job of the house to make the case only a majority of the house can send a case over to the Senate for a hundred and eighty years we only dealt we only one time touched the idea of seneschal impeachment here now three times in 46 years the Congress has moved through the process of impeaching a president I don't think you want to make that so easy that the house that of a different party can send over the vaguest set of charges and expect the Senate than to do the houses job I think they should have gone to court just like the house did with Clinton just like the house did with Nixon it would have taken some time but that's the they had plenty of time they've been wanting to impeach the president many of you don't you will not vote to hear from any witnesses listen let's let them present their case and then see if we need to hear from witnesses that's the way it was done in 2000 in 1999 I think that's the way we should do it this way I want to ask you about a really interesting article this week from the editor of Christianity today which is a prominent evangelical magazine he called for the president's removal from office and here's what he wrote none of the president's positives can balance the moral and political danger we face under a leader of such grossly immoral character going on to say that he should be removed we believe is not a matter of partisan loyalties but loyalty to the creator of the Ten Commandments so he's saying that he can't reconcile his Christian faith and values kindness generosity integrity with the president's quote immoral actions and business relationships with women and habitual string of mischaracterizations lies and slanders I know your Christian faith is important to you and I'm wondering especially since like I think it's almost 6 and 10 of your constituents or right white Christians when you read this is this something that is familiar do you wrestle with us well I think that person looking at the president versus what the president's Donna's president is it's got to be an outlier in everything I hear from the Christian community the faith-based community generally is very supportive of this president because he's been very supportive of them what the president's done to allow faith-based institutions to get back as one of the potential options in adoptions something I care a lot about what the president done to try to assert religious freedom all over the world what about Willie what do you struggle personally with the kind of if you look at the president's actions if Roy Blunt looks at the president's actions no president in my lifetime has been as aggressive in trying to achieve the goals that faith-based voters have set out then this one has thank you so much I really appreciate you coming out to be with you thanks thank you

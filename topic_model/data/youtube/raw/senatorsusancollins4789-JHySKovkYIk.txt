mr. Schultz I issue that you raised when you held up the bottle that had the prescription drug information insert for providers and pharmacists attached to it as you mentioned the FDA is considering issuing a proposed rule that would require just electronic information for prescription drugs products and LU of these paper inserts including the one that you just demonstrated as the Chairman's well aware when I was the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee and we were invested an in-depth investigation into hurricane katrina and we learned during the course of that investigation that there are times when electronic technologies are simply not available whether it's due to temporary power outages or a catastrophic natural disaster or terrorist attack in addition as a representative of the largely rural state I know of many patients and healthcare providers that still reside in areas that have limited access to the Internet as a practicing pharmacists do you think that such a switch from from paper to only electronic information would be in the best interest of health care providers and their patients thank you for that question I certainly this is an area that is some I'm very passionate about because of the the need to have this information available and have it of readily available you brought up several important factors and that is when the internet is not available and there would be a question about the information that is in this packet and how it affects that practitioners decision as to how they dispense or whether they dispense or what directions they give the patient regarding this information that is clearly problematic in natural disasters it's clearly proud of problematic in areas of rural areas where there is is a difficult internet reception also it's difficult for Department of Defense pharmacist and healthcare professionals when they're in a Forward Operating Base that does not have that type of internet or they're not able to use the internet based upon some security issues so there are a number of different practice settings that this information would be totally unavailable to those practitioners at that time so that's incredibly important then you go the next step which is is the fact that if you look and unfortunately there's a lot oftentimes is that when we look at healthcare policy it's inside the beltway thought processes and sometimes we have to go out and think of what happens on the frontline and outside the Beltway if you're practicing pharmacists and you're working really diligently to fill four or five hundred prescriptions sometimes eight hundred prescriptions a day your work your focus is right medication right patient right directions if there something comes up as to a conflict or a question or a dosage in that you need to make an interpretation based upon the fact that your patient has impaired renal function and this is metabolized through through through the kidneys those kinds of issues that information is here it's always been here it's been a lifeline for pharmacists in the GAO in the 2006 when the FDA actually passed a rule is to justify the financial significance of the rule they cited the fact that they that to increase the information that's in this insert increase the formatting is is that that would have significant effect on adverse event drug events and hospitalizations we don't disagree with it I think they were exactly right and this information needs to be very robust and needs to be available now if you look at when you look at any normal pharmacy with a high volume they may have internet connectivity in their region but from a workflow standpoint they're not out surfing the internet for this information and there's been no study to my knowledge it has ever determined and again if i go back to GAO and i go back to the the 2006 fda economic significant analysis for expanding this this professional insert is what we have is 3.0 is is 12 12 times per every thousand prescriptions this is access for information by the pharmacist that is a significant amount of inquiries into this information that wouldn't be available you can't stop your workflow and go out and search the internet to go get this because that internet and these are closed systems they're closed operating systems and they don't actually go out and surf the internet because of obvious HIPAA reasons although all the kinds of hacking reasons that would go on so having this information readily available so i can turn around pick this up off the shelf and have this information is absolutely critical

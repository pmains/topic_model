first on my life I have no intention of being his passion as the gentleman from New Jersey I thanks John California for yielding I was going to walk people through this because to me good people can disagree reasonable people can disagree even people I disagree with vehemently that's what politics that's what government that's what life is all about but you're not entitled to forget history or to ignore facts and for me there's been lots of misrepresentations last week too because there's a lot of passion a lot of emotion but I need to back up a little bit educational value when I'm told the Democrats have to come to the table and compromise might as well we have repeatedly and we will do it again if necessary and people say well no you haven't president saying no you won't negotiate well no one would want to negotiate on this issue at this point in time because we've already gone far enough and here's why 2011 the last super committee where did it come from it came from a budget impasse we couldn't come to an agreement it couldn't make a deal we had taken our corners what did we do create a super committee and if they said if the super committee doesn't work under the sea and do something like simpson-bowles would come up with then we would Institute a sequester and a sequester for all intents and purposes an across-the-board cut of roughly eight percent per year every year for ten years in a row that's what it is at the end of that tenth year if you don't do anything you'd be spending approximately forty-eight cents of every dollar you were spending when you started now I understand that some people want a government that does that and the programs that would pay for I don't agree with that but that's a reasonable position to take I don't want senior housing I don't want childhood nutrition I don't agree with it but it's a reasonable position to take and we should argue about that we shouldn't debate about that and the American people should have an opportunity to elect people that agree or distribute them on those types of issues we couldn't come to an agreement so the sequester took place and the sequester set out numbers each year for ten years this is as much as you can spend unless you come up with some kind of an agreement or get around it we haven't been able to do it we've had the first year of sequester about two it's the second year of sequester pursuant to the law that was passed in 2011 a blob by the way that I voted against I don't like the concept of sequester but which already ruled it passed pursuant to that law in this coming fiscal year we would have been allowed to send a little over a trillion dollars now remember that number is based on an eight percent cut from the prior year so this already represents a cut in by the way it represents a compromise a massive compromise between Democrats and Republicans to pass that's Questor so as a democratic compromise with Republicans to cut the budget for ten years in a row that's when we stop this year Republicans pass a budget 967 billion dollars 100 billion dollars below what the sequester allows they're entitled to do that and again I can disagree but I respect that viewpoint if you really think the government can operate and provide the services the American people want on that number fine I will disagree you will vote pass it and we'll move on but of course the Senate didn't agree with that number sanuk pass another number here we are today what's happened the last week or so you have heard pretty much every Democrat pretty much every Democrat say we want to vote on the clean CR continuing resolution but the Senate passed the average American is no clue we're talking about here's what they passed they passed a budget that would allow spending of 986 billion dollars now to me if you're going to talk about a compromise sequester all was one little over trillion Republicans want 967 a compromise is here a little over a trillion dollars now that would be a compromise on a compromise but no the Senate says 986 a compromise on a compromise on a compromise what the Republican House leaders say no 967 our number in by the way no health care so for those of you who thought Democrats haven't been compromising I'm here to tell you in my opinion not only we compromise I think we have compromised too much from my philosophical viewpoint i know that i am the minority view in this house so be it I think the sequester was too much I certainly think 967 is too much 986 is too much you know why my constituents want senior housing they want children fed they want young people educated and on and on and on they want veterans benefits they want all the things that we do of course no one wants to pay for that I get that I don't need I pay taxes I wish everything was free I'm going out to dinner in a little while hopefully to watch the Red Sox win this series and I don't want to pay for dinner but I guess i'll have to reasonable differences of opinion no matter how dramatic there may be a hundred billion dollar difference a realistic they're honest and the American people have a right to take sides they don't have a right to say Democrats have been compromised this was a compromise this would have been a compromised this is a compromise this is not this is uncompromising and that's why I want to come up there by the way as one little point of historic note I've been in the house now for 14 and a half years this is my first special order my first special order Ian as I said I probably missed the first inning of the red rox game which in my district is close to a cardinal sin but this is more important this is more important I'm not trying to convince anyone that my side is right or the other side is wrong people have their opinions I know that and you're probably not going to change them but I am here to say that there is a difference between compromise and capitulation we have compromised one two three times to get where we are and to get to this number would be fourth and to get rid of health care would be not just fifth that would be fifth and the end of it as far as I'm concerned this Democrat will not compromise further on these issues it's time for the other side to compromise off of what they think the world should be thank you for yielding mr. Garamendi and I yield back

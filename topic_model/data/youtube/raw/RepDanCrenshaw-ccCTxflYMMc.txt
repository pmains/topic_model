we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we old we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw welcome back everybody really honored to have today with us dave portnoy el prezidente as you might know him the president founder of the empire that is barstool sports you also might know him for that one bite pizza review that he does all the time and uh has gathered quite the cult following for that he's interviewed president trump at the white house and more importantly right now he is stepping up and doing great things to help small businesses struggle through the pandemic um and he started the barstool fund recently i think his already raised upwards of eight million dollars yeah or eight million that's awesome um dave welcome thanks well hey appreciate what you're doing and um give us a quick background how did how did the barstool fund even even come to be yeah so i was ranting and raving uh about the lockdowns basically new york um got rid of indoor dining so i did an instagram rant basically saying i don't know how you expect these small businesses to survive because you're not letting them earn a living you can't have customers and they're also not getting any money to you know sustain them so what do you think's going to happen um and then the guy marcus lemonis who i wasn't really familiar reached out he's like hey big mouth put your money where your mouth is if you start a fund i'll match it and at first we were hesitant i was fine with matching it i mean i was fine with putting money into the cause but i was more like how we're going to do it because we're not a charity group we don't want to be touching the money create problems for ourselves but then we sat down we've been a law charity in the past this we knew would be a big undertaking but we like to control where the money goes no red tape no bureaucracy none of that get the money in get it out as fast as you can to the people who need it and we came up with the bar stool fund so people send in the stories small businesses the only requirements we really have one you have to be a successful business like proven track record so the only thing that changed was the pandemic like you were successful before and assuming once it's over you'll be successful again and you have to have your payroll on we wanted to help not only the owners the business owners but the people who work for them so if you met those two criteria we ask for you to send a story a video email and then uh we try to help do they have to prove that they've lost a lot of revenue yes pretty much so we we have it we have our like finance team who follows up with them gets their taxes and their revenue and all that it could be a rent relief it could be anything the other part we tell the companies we're not just giving them one check it's like once you're in our program you're in it for month two month three till the economy basically reopens because what's the point of giving people money if you disappear at month three and they're right back in the same hole you kind of wasted it so um but yes we get all their finances all their finance uh information all that jazz how many how many small businesses have you been able to help so far i think we're at 33. nice are you hoping i mean i don't know if this is even part of the plan but i would hope that other people in your position able to you know to gather resources quickly are kind of mimicking this model because i mean you can only you can only help so many with this one fund but some other billionaire could easily do the same the more the merrier the more the merrier it's not it's strange because i don't know if it's totally true but i do feel like there's a little bit of like we want the credit before we donate and i don't get that at all um the more the merrier anybody who can donate yeah who can donate great and we can get the money out fast great um there's a lot of you know there's a lot of businesses we get 10 000 emails and and what is driving a lot of the donations i think is the viral nature of what we're doing like i uh facetime call these small business owners they pick up and i tell them we're going to be there and i mean they break down and they tell their story and it's heartbreaking and i think the number one benefit because we've only got 32 companies so far we're really for the first time putting a face on what is happening to what i think is like the backbone of you know america like these small mom and pop these businesses and they are in big trouble um and rightfully so i mean how else could someone expect them not to be what kind of business do you see getting hurt the most is it your restaurant our service industry yeah it's hospitality we so we've helped uh bars restaurants dry cleaners is one that you may not think but like no one's going to work so no one's wearing suits always getting their clothes cleaned a bowling alley is another that one that we helped um there there's like a yoga studio the lady was talking is a boutique like fitness and her point's very valid she's like i have mats that i lay out on the ground they don't move i put them i can put them as far apart as you tell me to put them apart and i do and i can have people wear masks i can't be open but that same person will get on an airplane yeah that make any sense that that's the most infuriating part um you know when you did some of your first emergency press conferences i mean you you you have a knack for just expressing your views um in a way that people can understand a way that really relates to just the common american and i think this is what we were all feeling well maybe not all of us i mean it's you know you know this it depends right i mean you see people wearing masks by themselves in a park and which i think is ridiculous but i see it all in dc i see it all the time in houston because i'm always between houston and dc it's a totally different world in houston um so we do we do go about it differently um and it kind of begs the question like if dc wasn't locking these places down which i think they just relocked uh indoor dining down which is crazy if they weren't doing that would these businesses still be hurting anyway um probably not as much but probably yes to a certain extent in a place like houston they probably wouldn't be hurting because you know i've when i lived there i've watched it i've watched how this pandemic has gone in certain places in the country and as soon as restaurants could have people in people were willing to go and and be customers so it's interesting but um but i i mean i've always i've been very outspoken against lockdowns the entire time um right there with you probably more so than most politicians because i guess some would argue it's a risky political move to take i don't think so um i think it's i think it should be riskier to actually lock businesses down and i think it's part of the frustration that you express and what i express is i don't understand how these how these local mayors or governors um are just not punished politically for what they're doing to small businesses i don't get it at all the wavy nature of it is what i don't get like how just your i think a lot of small businesses were saying this as well that it's the flip of a coin on the survival of your small business based just where you are like the geography and it can be as close as 100 yards down the street if you're in a different county or whatever so you know that is frustrating uh it's interesting and what you know what drives me nuts about politics and i don't like the extreme left i don't like the extreme right to be totally honest and i think nobody gets things done there's so much self-interest going on and people assume generally if you say you're a republican or a democrat you can ask the next the next 10 questions i can probably answer how you're going to answer no i'm not you specifically but i'm saying in general you know and it's like i people i see with me they're like you hate masks and you do this it's like i had a pro mask rant like i said in the beginning one of the emergency press conferences like hey if mass can help point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one percent to get rid of corona i'm fine with [ __ ] wearing a mask i don't care but i also think you're gonna let people make their own decisions on whether they go to a restaurant and eat and if you're health impaired or you're old you have to stay home until you get the vaccine or whatever i'm fine with that but i don't know how you don't let people decide their fate and whether they want to visit a restaurant and whether the restaurant owner wants to be open they're playing they're doing everything they can and again oh that's i don't know what it would be these new york restaurants or whatever they spend all this money on you know new air conditioning systems so the hv systems and then the new plexiglas and the new outdoor structure when they're already hurting and then they're told you can't even use them i i mean it's crazy yeah and the explanations from the politicians doing it in my mind are even crazier um just because there are no explanations right it's like well we just want to keep you safe right yeah i mean i get that right but that's not necessarily your job i mean it's your you know the the the government's job on a fundamental level is is is to protect your inalienable rights right life liberty pursuit of happiness this is written into our our founding documents it guides everything we do now you could extend that to the government's job is also to prevent others from infringing on your rights deliberately right this is why murder is illegal right so there's this is why it's illegal for me to steal from you and government would be the arbiter of that of that illegal transaction um and so they but i think they take it way too i think they take that defining principle way too far in this case um and basically protect you from all externalities right protect you from all risk but this is nonsense i mean we don't do that on a daily basis and if we do we at least legislate it right we at least vote on it we at least vote and you know we elect people and they have to debate these things and it goes slowly through a process but instead what we've done is said our job is to keep you safe from literally everything and it's it's just it goes against the science it goes against the data um it goes against what we know about where spreads actually happen i think you pointed out once rightfully that like you know the common sense observation here is that if you're not allowed to go into restaurants you're just going to go to house parties right and hang out with people and that's where all the spread happens yeah i'm in miami now and they have a curfew here and it's not enforced evenly but i can tell you there's plenty of underground parties and going i mean they're just moving it to other places like teenagers colleges all that they're gonna go out so who are you hurting you hurt the business owners we're probably people safer anyways it's nuts um you know what it's like to run a business i mean is is that part of the problem did these poli have these politicians just never run a business or do you i mean what i i can't get into the psychology of it yes i i think there is a large factor of lifetime politicians and i don't know i don't want to say this i don't know i mean you obviously have a different background a lot of politicians were like losers in high school and it's a terrible thing to say but they're not like normal functioning if you've never had a real job and you never earned a living and you don't have to like i think that plays a uh like i was reading up on you know de blasio it's like the guy has never had he he was like running for his like high school math club like chair and he's just a lifetime politician who hasn't actually had to work his ass off right in what it's like i mean for barcelona 10 years i never took a day off literally not one like i worked every week you can see pictures of me when i'm all i'm fat and gross and it's like why you look like that because i never left my computer i never i ate like trash and and you know what i started with literally nothing but i want to work for myself and that's how that rant started because it's like you know what at the end of 10 years when barcelona started to take a turn and was like okay i may be able to do this the epidemic hit i would have been out of business in 10 years of my blood sweat everything wiped out i didn't have a family i was just doing it for myself but you multiply that these people who are now providing for the kids their families to not have a say it i would rather fight and take the risk and if you know you die you die but like this is my life i decide this is what i want to do i can't work for somebody else i have to do it and this was that's the thing i don't get how a politician who's never done that or worked like that can then just say you only we're taking that decision away from you i i do not get that i do think it is i don't think anyone who had my background or a lot of small business owners would then say yep we can lock you down i don't believe that right it's a sense of utopianism and when you go to the extreme left in my opinion you know you look at who advocates for socialist policies you generally find people that have always been in government that have always that have never created much and frankly resent those who do and and believe that if you have created something you you've done it in in nefarious ways it's until begotten wealth yeah yes yes they believe that i hear that all the time like and people i also find that people criticize me don't know much about me or don't know much about barstool but it's somehow like i've exploited my workers when our workers have like great jobs and you know clearly by what we're doing now if you say a response nobody cares about small business more i'm sure people are equal but nobody more than we do and that goes from me all the way down erica our ceo but you know it is ironic that where the private sector is the one that is now stepping up for the private like i pay so much taxes like where's it going this is something it should be going to like give it to these people that's what we want to help that's who we want to pay so that's a little weird it's frustrating i i don't want to get too much into the politics of that luckily this recent build just got signed yesterday um so that's that's the only good news i got for you is that with you know after after months and months and months i think the frustrating thing for people is that we don't just pass what we already agree on there's a lot we disagree on up here and it's supposed to be that way we're supposed to disagree it's the nature of politics but my question has always been all right but we can identify things we do agree on let's just vote on that let's just vote on it right we can agree on ppp funding right which is basically the exact same program that you're doing at bar stool fund is is the ppp program it's a good program it works right keeps people employed you know has some standards in place you know the the best welfare is a job that's a that is a fact right you need purpose in this life you need to work it took way too long to get it and um i don't want to go down as to why i've done that in plenty of other episodes um you just said something which is a lot of people don't know your background a lot of people don't know barstool sports all right how did barstool sports start and like what does it become i mean it's it's an empire of sorts really yeah so it started it was i i always knew i wanted to try my own thing it started as a newspaper in boston it was like a little sports fantasy sports rag four pages um and i used to wake up at like four or five in the morning go to the subway station hand them out to people or as they're going to work i'd go home i'd write articles i'd call for sales i had all fake names for myself because i didn't want people to know it would be like joe smith at sales.com if you want to advertise because they didn't want people to know it's just me and then i'd go back to the subway stations at night hand the newspaper out go back work and it was i deliver the paper myself i did everything um and that was probably like 2004 and it slowly grew word of mouth in boston we moved to digital in 2010 and that was a guy used to hand the newspaper out was moving to new york he's like hey i love this thing if i build you a website will you use it because i'm moving to new york and i still want to read it so it's like if you're going to do that for free yeah i'll put it on there that was the birth of the online version of bar stool and then it became pretty obvious we could grow faster i didn't have the you know the overhead of the newspapers and the delivery route and all that um and that kind of is when we really started to grow and it kind of more from sports to more like men's interest lifestyle talk about anything so barstool sports i say means anything a guy would talk about sitting at a bar watching a game it has continued to evolve and now it's men and women we have a huge female audience our ceo is a female we have the number one female podcast in the country so we have a big but it's all under the ethos of not taking life too seriously it's like having fun making jokes i consider us a comedy site now more than anything and have for a while um and then it just continued to grow word of mouth added employees one by one um like most of the early guys like i'm here in miami my first employee who's been with me like 17 years he's with me i think we've lost like two or three employees probably at least in my world the content side over the last two decades so it's been the same group and uh you know it's been a surreal run for us yeah so we went from one person to about 250 we relocated to manhattan about five years ago to try to create the first reality blog thing out there and it's just it's been a pretty pretty remarkable story i i sometimes like can't believe we're here but we are well what's the reality blog you're talking about us barstool okay just as like a as a show almost yeah right when our lives like i never anticipated people would know who i am or i'd be like a character it was all organic yeah but that resonated with people yeah it's kind of the new way of doing business and it's kind of fascinating and sort of how you have to do politics and well it's maybe in a sense it's always how you've done politics you've got to market yourself right it feels weird to some people um so you were starting this in i was in boston 2004 i went to i did uh my undergrad at tufts 2003 uh 2003-2006 um would you say your passion is more sports or the lifestyle side the social media side or the comedy side it's all it's all mixed into one uh people always screw this out i mean i'll watch like a trashy real watch the bachelor but then i mean i'm a die hard patriot fan i i was good el threw me in prison like twice so i mean it it's all over the map it's a pretty wide varied interests that i have i jumped on the red sox train because that was like there was a 2004 was the world series that they want me that was intense i mean i was a college kid um you know i'm not gonna lie and say that i'm like super into sports um but i jumped on that train real quick that was fun yeah well that was i mean that was the red sox were like uh before they won the chase to win was a a big part of boston culture yeah like men women everybody was on the red sox yeah how is it now i mean are you still so you live in manhattan you're not like you're selling out the red sox are you going yankees no no no no no i hate the yankees i hate all new york sports teams i'll only go to the games when the boston teams are in town i made the mistake once of um publicly saying something bad about the yankees and pissing off my father-in-law so i'm not gonna do that again not gonna say anything bad about any team politicians this is when they screw up the sports analogy is trying to act like they know what they're talking about i don't even try i don't even try i know what i know right like i i know i know social security policy really well you that know like oh man you should be like have to serve a week in prison if you're a politician and you screw up a sports analogy trying to act like you know what you're talking about it's it's bad i mean i know i mean i i know to jump at it i know cool stuff right i don't have to like fake it i know i know i like target terrorists in afghanistan that's what i know i don't i don't know like you know you you i just frankly i just joke about my ignorance so i'm like wow did you see the super bowl last night it had a hat trick and uh more politicians should do that like you know you don't have to just know what you know and and don't pretend like you don't know what you don't know yeah do you have any bad examples of that happening like really egregious examples of about like what do you have a specific instance you're thinking of or just in general we had a mayor mayor menino in boston who was like the all-time all-time like worst that's doing names uh there but there's it wasn't there recently i didn't i think mccain did one pretty recently oh he was wearing uh he was wearing a jacket that was not like a pits i forget what city he was in but he said he was wearing like a professional sports seams jacket it was just the wrong jacket he was not wearing it wasn't it at all but it would be wearing like you know saying you're wearing a red sox jacket and just wearing like i don't know uh a target jacket like you just just not not the thing you think it is yeah hey what was um what was it like i only got like a few more minutes with you i know um unless you've extended your your schedule but um what what was it like um uh interviewing the president and how did that even happen so he reached out to me uh on vacation and it was i think a wednesday afternoon and i got a call like hey trump wants to interview in the rose garden at the white house i was like what are you talking about yeah so i thought it was a joke it got confirmed and um it was surreal because i've never interviewed i have one interview in my life the president uh so it was and they didn't really let us bring our like i had a little crew but they didn't let the crew near us during the interview and he had like 50 people surrounding us yeah it's me i've never done an interview and i didn't meet him before he just walked in and sat down and i was like go so it was fairly intimidating well kind of i and also like as i said to you and this i really try to stay away from politics like i and people say that's like well i'm doing this interview with you i want to talk about the fun i go on fox news a lot they know why i go and talk to carlos joe all the time people don't listen to what's said in the interview it's rarely about politics it's about stuff bar stool and other things but you get associated people don't like to listen a lot of people like to listen um and they just assume which i think is unfair so the trump i didn't want to be like totally roll over in softball but i also didn't want i'm not there to grill him i'm not a political reporter yeah so trying to like dance that line and make it kind of entertaining which is what we do yeah and you know it was a fine balance that because some people in our our company is a perfect example barstool people call us you know liberal and then people say we're the conservative like we get both they and i like that say both but we had people in our company who hated me for doing that and we had people who loved me for doing it so that's why you can't win and i know michael jordan got in trouble for saying it but i run a business in blue states and red states both buy t-shirts he said they buy shoes that's kind of how i look at the world like i agree with some things that the left side and i agree with some things that the rights say i don't like when people put me in a box because i'm talking to you or i talk to the president or i think it's sad actually i mean it's sad that just by nature of going to sit down with the highest office in the world that people will call you every name in the sun that's that's sad yeah i know a little bit about that i mean it's kind of it's kind of part of this canceled culture they want to put you in a box and and you the the label itself is what is what diminishes your argument right because if i label you with something then it means i don't have to listen to anything else you say that i might potentially disagree with and it's really difficult it's easy for me to live in this world because i'm not cancelable like the left can't cancel me they've already canceled me in a way i mean i guess the right could um you know and they try right like we throw out really stupid labels on each other in the right like neocon rhino it's just it's just a way of one upsmanship it doesn't you know it rarely means something but guys like you and i joe rogan is probably another good example is just like because he talks about stuff it's okay but it's like well you can't even talk about things anymore in just a free-flowing manner without somebody being like i knew you were a traitor or i knew you were one of them and it's like what i mean i remember i remember you going off on your people unionizing one time right so it's like does that make you a right winger like i don't know yeah that was one a perfect example that was like a crazy joke i was joking there are our employees a treat great but it's tough to say stuff and it is it is you can't talk about i also think social media is just like this echo chamber of people screaming at each other um so a very small you know vocal minority can seem a lot bigger than they actually are and the normal people are just going about their wives sometimes you forget that they're out there yeah yeah i mean i have to remind myself of that uh constantly it's always helpful when i'm like back on the ground at like events and i can just i can kind of see people you know right in the eye and i'm like okay you're like we're not we're not as angry as we seem online but i mean what's your take it you know one of my fears is that there's too much american fragility just in in a general sense and i think our response to kovid um has demonstrated that right we've i think we've overreacted massively as we've as we've been talking about with these lockdowns and that's that massive overreaction is a reflection of i think a sense of fragility that our our ancestors would just laugh at they could possibly they could not believe what we're offended at they could not believe how fragile we are in the face of risk and um i'm worried about it i mean i wrote a whole book about it so like this worries me a great deal yeah i mean listen i i first certainly canceled culture and the offense of things people get offended i i don't understand you know lockdowns i don't think it was a world thing it's going across the world i it's just at some level it it you hit a point it's like flattening the curve you flatten the curve then what and you know like some businesses and people you can survive a couple months three months four months but when it says dragon i mean what are you gonna do you can't do it forever so but i agree it's become a softer society that's for sure yeah we could use a little bit more uh hardening um i guess we'll leave it there because you said you got to go 4 30. yeah i get to 4 30. i mean if you want to try to do a part two i can figure out a different time but i do have to take this call at 4 30. let's do it let's do part two ask me some questions next time dave great to have you and appreciate what you're doing for small businesses appreciate it thanks for having me all right thank you

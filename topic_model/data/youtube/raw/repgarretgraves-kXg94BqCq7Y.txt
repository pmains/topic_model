administrator thank you for for being here today uh for joining us and i want to thank you for coming down to louisiana uh in the aftermath of of uh hurricane ida we spent some time together in in st john parish and i really appreciate you doing that now also want to tell you that i appreciate the comments you made a little while ago about um lowering what did you say eliminating barriers to access for assistance i think it's it's it's critically important um and and it is something that needs to be needs to be addressed um i've got some concerns that that i want to um discuss with you though related to uh risk rating 2.0 so i listen to you talk about underserved communities marginalized communities and under risk rating 2.0 that i want to make note these these massive changes did not go through congress they did not explicitly go through congress this dates back to the obama administration who shelved it the the trump administration shelved it and now the biden administration has chosen to move forward one example we had a we had a house in uh in larose louisiana preferred risk 572 dollars a year was their rate um there was a clarification because they were going to make their policy effective september 30th they actually had to move it to making it effective october 8th roughly a week later and the rate went from 572 to 5 531 we've got other examples where folks have gone from 560 dollar preferred risk policy to seven thousand eight thousand and nine thousand dollars a year um i'm having a lot of trouble understanding how you can be talking about equity and addressing marginalized or underserved communities whenever fema is thrusting administratively is thrusting these types of actions on our constituents could you please respond absolutely congressman graves so risk reading 2.0 really is about equity and uh in our previous version of our nfip program every homeowner had the same level of premium and the same level of increase regardless of what their risk was to their property what risk rating 2.0 does for me is a couple of things from the equity side risk rating 2.0 now takes into account your unique specific risk and so you are only paying for the risk that your property has and so it's specific to that and individuals that have homes that are in lower risk areas are not subsidizing homes that are in higher risk areas but i think what's more important about risk rating 2.0 is that now homeowners truly understand what their risk is which means that they have a better idea of how they can plan to protect their family now they know that they are actually at a higher risk or in a higher risk area and can take appropriate measures madam administrator i i want to be really clear i totally agree with you in conveying risk to property owners but let's go through a few things number one when these folks built their property in most cases they built it at the fema base flood elevation they complied with fema standards this isn't a car or a table that you just move this is a house you you can't move a house or as you're aware using icc funds limited at 30 000 it's not near enough to actually elevate homes number two you're talking about charging people for risk in my home state of louisiana we've lost 2 000 square miles of our coast 2 000 that's like the state of rhode island being wiped off the map that is not because of the actions of our constituents it's largely the responsibility or actions of the federal government that have done that similarly we're draining parts of canada new york montana and others one of the largest watersheds in the world they're sending us more water again not things we can control yet you're charging our constituents for it first street foundation did an analysis looking at the rates under risk rating 2.0 they found in their analysis that the state of louisiana was the only state that was actually overcharged that risk rating 2.0 over charges louisiana we asked your your front office for an explanation of that uh they were they we asked for it before our april first meeting and they they failed to to provide us a response i want to ask if you could please get us that information lastly administrator look i know you got a heck of a job and i heard you rattling off statistics about the number of disasters this whole thing about coming in and and and trying to address inequities look at wall street journal yesterday president xi of of china he has abandoned their common prosperity uh initiative because he's concerned about about the actual impacts we've got to make sure we're moving forward on a merit-based approach those that have the greatest impacts are being addressed and i'm very concerned about the lack of transparency in terms of how this is going to done it's going to be done if it's going to distort impacts or distort winners and losers here i'd ask for clarity on on how that's going to be administered by by fema moving forward

you heard earlier mayor de Blasio respond to secretary Castro on the question of why the police officer who killed Eric Gardner is still on the NYPD was that response adequate please respond no he should be fired he should be fired now i sat down with Eric Garner's mother and I can tell you when you've lost your son when he begged for breath when you know because you have a video when you know he said I can't breathe so many times over and over again when you know he used an illegal chokehold that person should be fired and as as I was if I was the mayor I'd fire him but as president I would make sure that we had a full investigation that the report would be made public and if I wasn't satisfied we would have a consent decree I want to bring in senator Harris now

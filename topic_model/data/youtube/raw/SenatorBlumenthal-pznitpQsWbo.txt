you know Bob if you're out in America the way I am and my colleagues are and I spent a lot of time back in Connecticut every weekend every opportunity you really hear how people are still hurting struggling to stay in their homes to find jobs to make ends meet and they have a right to be angry at washing because Washington hasn't been listening on gasoline prices for example the price of gasoline in the state of Connecticut has risen from to dot 99 cents last year to four dollars and 14 cents right now well let me just say tell you that President Obama's appointed some kind of an investigatory group to look into that is that enough do we need to do more Bob the problem is it is not investigatory it is more to monitor and follow the development and I commend and applaud the president for focusing on this issue but I think there really needs to be an investigation involving for example subpoenas and compulsory process which I used as Attorney General and similar investigations there needs to be very possibly a grand jury to uncover the potential wrongdoing there so so you want the Justice Department as well as the department should take the lead seize this moment and send a message a very strong deterrent message that this country will not tolerate the kind of illegal speculation and trading and hedge fund activity that may be driving prices up just to give you one fat the amount of trading and hedge fund activity the energy positions are at an all-time high in this country's history up sixty four percent from just a few years ago and the indicia of potential illegal activity whether civil or criminal I think certainly justify Department of Justice investigation immediately and comprehensively right now

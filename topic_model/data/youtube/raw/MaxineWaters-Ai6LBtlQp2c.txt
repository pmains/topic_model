thank you very much mr. speaker and members we patiently waited over here to hear what this motion to recommit was going to be all about we thought about all of the members who have been calling us writing us working with us from both sides of the aisle to please help them address the concerns of their constituents about flood insurance we have worked very hard with members from both sides of the aisle to include their concerns in this bill you saw members come to the floor with those amendments you saw in the manager's amendment that we had worked with so many members not only to include their concerns but to answer questions and prepare them for going back to their communities explaining how this whole thing works many of those questions that have been raised by our constituents have been raised over a long period of time our offices are bombarded with questions about the mapping how does it work how are they going to get timely notification what are the premiums all about these questions go on and on and on to the point where our offices are oftentimes overwhelmed not able to give sufficient information or to assist those communities where they have banded together despite the fact oftentimes they have few resources to deal with these issues and now in this comprehensive authorization that we're doing we address those constituent concerns with this outreach I am very surprised that the members on the opposite side of the aisle would try and deny to their constituents the basic kind of information and services that we should all be responsible for we should be able to say to our constituents not only do you have a right to this information but we're going to give you some help you don't have to try and band together with resources that you don't have to find out how it all works to oppose FEMA to find out from your market server sirs why you didn't get a timely notice to find out from your city who was notified perhaps by FEMA why they didn't notify the community I mr. speaker members these are simply outreach activities that must be dealt with these are outreach activities that our constituents deserve to oppose assisting our constituents when they may be forced into new mapping that's going to cost them money that they had not anticipated on and on and on is just unbelievable and so I would simply say it speaks for itself assistance to our constituents ask answering those basic questions I would ask for no vote on this motion to recommit it works against the best interest of all of our constituents they deserve better than this without

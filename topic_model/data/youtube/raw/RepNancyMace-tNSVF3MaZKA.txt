congressman nancy updates with us right now south carolina republican uh congresswoman what do you make of this well that's certainly hearing what some of those earmarks are going may go toward makes uh then senator hillary clinton's million dollars that she lobbied for a museum to help us remember woodstock that makes certainly makes her look fiscally conservative on my dad but welcome to washington neal where bad ideas never die um this is simply you know there's just they have a facelift now in these pork projects it's ridiculous it's not shocking that nancy pelosi is trying to peddle corruption and currency here with earmarks and it's a way to control and influence not only those in vulnerable districts but voters there as well you know it comes when i was thinking of this of course you're new to congress so you were not there at the time that these were all the rage and everything else um but they were the means by which still more spending was done in other words uh you would try to i'm putting it in crest terms you know you'd buy off a congressman or woman to to get them to support you know your legislation by uh you know providing money for a bridge or a school or in one case this gandhi museum i i really do want to look into that but but that was the problem that the numbers are still small when it comes to earmarks in total but it's what they open up to more spending that's the worry and it's wasteful i mean you're talking about administration and nancy pelosi where it's a trillion here trillion there on top of all the excess spending that we've had so far this year you're talking about seven to ten trillion dollars in spending in the first six to nine months of this fiscal year alone you get a 28 trillion dollar debt three trillion tree trillion dollar deficit in counting and to pay for all this we're gonna have to have the highest tax hike in american history this is not what the taxpayers asked for this is untenable in the middle of a pandemic and when i look at what happened in november this was not a referendum on excess spending or socialism or socialist projects you have a house that nancy pelosi has the narrowest margin she's had in a generation you have a u.s senate that's evenly divided 50-50 we actually should be reigning in spending and working together and instead this is what we've got um you know this this back and forth on spending we understand mitch mcconnell has said that republicans are always ready with an infrastructure package of around 600 billion versus the well it's a moving target that you know the the two and a half trillion now um that the president's proposing uh where are are you on infrastructure well also i think they had to rename that package from an infrastructure deal to a jobs plan potentially because of all the the pork and half of that bill potentially is on green new deal type of wasteful spending i'm for a much smaller package the senate republicans have worked together to put one worth about a quarter of what the original proposal was from the biden administration and imagine that the bulk of that package would be spent on traditional infrastructure because what democrats proposed you only had one percent towards airports less than one percent towards uh waterways and ports you had six and a half percent towards road road and surface transportation the bulk of it over over 93 percent of it had nothing to do with roads or bridges and so we've got to look at a much smaller package that actually has to do with real infrastructure needs and i just sat in traffic after i dropped my kids off to school a couple days ago for an hour and a half and i know that my district isn't the only one it's not just south carolina it's every state in the nation has enormous infrastructure issues and we've got to focus on the needs at hand

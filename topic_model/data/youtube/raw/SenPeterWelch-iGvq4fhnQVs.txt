you good morning good morning everyone hello star how are you Mike oh my goodness I think it's turn of people in this call I cannot say good morning to everybody I mean myself good morning I muted myself to unmuted myself good morning everybody good morning Cindy who are only a few minutes away but now we don't see each other this is Gisele yeah I knew it was you we're all in our own little cloistered places I don't want you to see all what a mess my kitchen is off the video goes hello everyone I will be facilitating today's item I'd like to know before we get started though if Lizzie or Rebekah is on because I just make sure that the congressman is ready to discuss and hear library topics if at all possible could you give me a signal that you are on as well thank you hey Jason this is Patrick in Peter Walsh's office I think I see Lizzy on here I think she's just connecting to the audio and the congressman should be on in just a minute as well I appreciate that thank you so much of course thank you again thank you for attending today's Town Hall with libraries and all associated interested persons and as we are getting ready my name is Jason Broughton I'm your state librarian and we also have Kevin ton ref who is Vermont Library Association president and also the director of the Pearson library in Shelburne Vermont he and I will be facilitating today's discussion with Congressman Peter Welch and we are deeply appreciative of the congressman listening to what the library community is experiencing during this time of a unique human experience that we all call Co vid 19 with that we will get started shortly I think what I will do and I will probably get the signal from the congressman's office when he is ready to start I will lead off though with a variety of items we are going to have some introductions by myself of congressman and his past historical record then the congressman will begin to discuss remarks and have some updates about what's going on federally and what he is experiencing and seeing I as your state librarian will talk for a few moments about what the department is doing during this time and also from the state's perspective that impacts us along with Kevin will be next to talk about remarks and items from the Vermont Library Association and then of course we have three panelists that will be discussing a variety of things which will be Amy Olson of the lamp library we have star electronica and I just love saying her name that much star electronica with an interesting name of the Brooks Memorial and in Brattleboro and then also again I think we have Kevin again and then we will open it up for Q&A and do some closing remarks I see the congressman is on and I will just read a little bit about congressman Welch's past experience Congressman Peter Welch has been a champion of working Vermonters throughout his career since his election to Congress in 2006 he has been widely recognized as a thoughtful and effective legislator who chooses governing over gridlock I would say probably right now maybe gridlock is taking some precedence unfortunately but hey it is what it is car wash and Welsh's record reflects a strong commitment to bringing people together to find common sense solutions to difficult challenges facing our state and nation in an era of part and ship he has worked across the aisle to create jobs increase access to affordable education and healthcare invest in energy efficiency protect our environment and care for veterans he was born in Springfield from Springfield Massachusetts graduated from college of Holy Cross after law school and there were some things in between I'm just giving you a snapshot he then decided to move the remaining seven White River Junction where he worked as a public defender before founding his a small law practice he was first elected to represent Windsor County in the Vermont Senate in 1980 and in 1985 he was unanimously elected by his colleagues to leave the chamber becoming the first Democrat in Vermont history to hold a position of president pro tempore 2006 he was elected to the only seat in the US House of Representatives and with that again he also a chief deputy whip of the House Democratic caucus and member of the Democratic steering and Policy Committee he serves on the house permanent Select Committee and intelligence and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce he is married to Margaret Cheney Commissioner of Public Utility Commission and they share a home in Norwich Vermont I think I've kind of concluded that and I see that the congressman is on and I will now turn it over to our congressman thank you for coming on today congressman thank you thank you very much I really really appreciate it and I just want to say to everybody on the call the librarians you're kind of the glue that's keeping us together I mean it's so astonishing of course what our country is going through you know in January the end of January we had like only a few cases and in in March we the beginning of March we had like 39 deaths in the entire country and now we're pushing 120,000 deaths and if anyone thinks that this coronavirus isn't serious they just have to look at what's happening and our approach I think here in Vermont has been good I mean focusing on the need for social distancing but the big challenge is that it really has a huge impact on the economy but it also means that we well we want a social distance we don't want a social isolate because we have to maintain some connections with our fellow with our neighbors and our friends and also with our own sense of self and it's really where I think the libraries continue to play just such an extraordinarily important role in our community it's a place where people really feel safe going and you've had to make huge adjustments in how you do the work of running your libraries locally and I just want to say thank you for that you know in Washington with all the division we've had down there when the pandemic happened there really was some bipartisan unity directly recognized that the federal government had to be the last resort fiscally to back up local communities in our states and of course we passed that initial legislation the cares act and that was bipartisan and it was negotiated between two people generally don't get along very well politically and that of course is Nancy Pelosi in Mitch McConnell and that has sent about you know it was in that legislation the individual checks the unemployment the payroll protection plan but money to the states and also to some extent not enough but 75 million to the council on the arts and in 75 million to the council and the entities and of course in Vermont that came out to four hundred and twenty four thousand dollars and four hundred two thousand dollars and then the libraries got fifty four thousand dollars which is not a lot in Vermont to try to help you deal with some of the challenges that you face but what I see is so significantly important is that we have to somehow maintain the capacity of people to adjust to the steps that are required to protect our health in that continues to be social distancing washing our hands wearing the mask but as we start to reopen and this is it obviously it's going to be a challenge for you in the job that you do how do we do it in a way that is safe you know voids in another outbreak of the virus so what I see and I look forward to hearing from you about this is you've got this job that's always been critical for community from our communities the library is a gathering place it's a safe place it's a place where when people go as you know they relax and think about things outside of themselves they get a book they can bring it home or an audio tape and it's also a place where even though it's quiet in a library you're sharing a common interest with other folks who are there but you can't do it that way anymore so how do you do it I look forward to hearing about that and as the social distancing rules are relaxed they're gonna be real specific guidelines that you all have to follow as we ease back into kind of we hope eventually a return to normalcy so I just want to look forward to talking to you but I just want to say how much it means to Vermonters that in the midst of this with the limited resources you have you're fully committed to helping Vermonters get through this and what an important role each of you in your library place in all of our communities so Jason let me stop there and turn it back to you and look for dialogue Thank You congressman I really appreciate the words and the work that you have been doing for Vermont and particularly for our libraries and yes what I will do is keep my remarks brief the library community knows that the Department of libraries has been providing continuous information it can feel I know as some have said and they have not said stuff but it's like drinking from a fire hydrant because we have been giving just so much information right federally along with statewide and we continue to do that by providing a lot of updates we are making sure that our libraries have timely information regarding coulded 19 on library surfaces which is a Battelle and we'll see LC and IMLS study and we were pleasantly surprised to know that they have all at the current conclusion for a few items recognize that it will be three days that is basically needed for quarantine items at the current for certain materials their next steps will be library spaces and that will be coming up next and so we are looking forward to see what that next phase will be but Mott was able to get and I will never forget this and I would say you're a cohort senator leahy contacted me when the disbursement occurred fifty six thousand eight hundred and thirty four dollars and twelve cents of federal money out of the cares act as you did say that is not a lot of money but within that one of the things that if I understand from mod you make it work and you do what you can the library community I believe at the moment has been extremely pleased with what we are doing with that one part of that is we were able to launch our probably first ever statewide reading summer platform which is going to be bean stack so we have a digital platform for summer reading it'll allow us to look at statistics but each library will have its own unique portal that they can kind of design and training is coming from that so some of it was used there the majority of it for the congressman though was a PPE we will be dispersing sanitizer to all libraries some will be getting more than others we also are getting guards and sneeze sneeze guards or shields have also been bought for usage and gloves and we're looking at masks because we do know from our conversations with Vth that there will be some form of a second wave in the fall even though we're not sure what that might look like we want to make sure that the libraries at least are prepared going forward with that so we are definitely using it to try to make sure that we have our libraries up and running the way they would like to do so if they choose to do that we also have launched a specific website that allows our libraries to examine a variety of things when it comes to thoughts and questions that they need to ask as they can operate because of local control to open fully at last count we know officially that the Rutland free library was open in limited capacity to the public but there were also eight others that were coming online at this moment we're not sure exactly what that might look like so we could say between eight to ten libraries are going to be publicly facing to the community but again not in the way that they were prior to Cove in nineteen uniquely all libraries are running curbside service which is beautiful to hear so we are very thankful about that in closing we do see our role in helping the libraries during this time because we also understand that there are some health impacts that are occurring across Vermont and biblical therapy is important a lot of people will read items to kind of soothe their mind because unfortunately we know that the drinking rate is up anxiety is up mental health affects when it comes to anger is up and unfortunately we know that suicide attempts are up so the library is now becoming a place where people are seeking release reflection and escape in certain circumstances as a continued presence in the community so that is all I have and with that I will now turn it over to Kevin who will represent the Vermont Library Association point of view as president thank you Kevin thanks Jason and Thank You congressman for taking the time to make this happen and your staff and also Jason thanks for all the leadership you've shown in helping us all get information about what's going on and help us figure out best practices it's been it's been so helpful I wanted to amplify a little bit about what what you said congressman and also Jason what you said about the place of libraries have in Vermont for Vermonters we were visited more than five million times last year by Vermonters in person that's public and school libraries but also libraries provided more than five million electronic resources so ebooks articles and whatnot online and so we've we currently and have her quite some time been inhabiting that dual space of both a physical space people come and online space that people come to get resources and I know many librarians here have probably seen the Gallup study that came out in January but libraries were by far the most visited cultural institution of any state so people visited libraries twice as much as movie theaters which was the next highest illegal activity of the study and also research by every library which is a organization that helps libraries pass bonds has shown that libraries are used by a cross-section of America in a way many other organizations are not so we have equal support from Republicans and Democrats from the elderly and from parents with young children from people of all colors and backgrounds and so we are as you said congressman the glue that keeps many communities together and as we see kind of the separation happening between many different groups I think libraries are one of the exceptions to that and so I just wanted to compliment all of the Vermont librarians for doing such a good job and now I'll talk about the challenges with kovat so certainly here in Shelburne and I think talking to my colleagues around the state there's the health challenge of how to operate safely and keep things going and then there's the economic challenge of what we expect the lien budget years going ahead so for example at my library we've already been asked to cut our budget 5% for the next fiscal year and that was our first tier of what we expect could be two or three more tiers of budget cuts I expect that's probably happening at most public libraries as well as most school and college libraries so the idea that we need to go into austerity mode because we're not going to be taking in as much revenue as we had in the past and I think many folks here were working in libraries during the Great Recession and so we experienced this from 2006 to 2009 library budgets nationally were flat or decreased and at the same time people use the library a lot more during times of economic trouble so libraries nationally saw 25% increase in use during the Great Recession while at the same time their budgets were flat or were decreasing so we were asked to do more with less a lot of libraries never actually recovered fully their budgets after the Great Recession and I expect we'll be trying to do that again so that's the economic challenge the challenges with Coe bid I think I've been talked about Jason talked about those a little bit planning for a second wave and the fall and winter what that looks like for libraries it's going to vary depending on what your library is like what your community is like the local conditions what your budget looks like and also that unknown factor how much will it impact Vermont's and how much will it impact the nation in different places we really have no idea one thing we do know looking at the data from the last few months is that people are using our electronic resources even more than they were before so we've seen an increase of 200 to 300 percent in the usage of our online databases and our ebooks well at the same time we've seen about the same decrease in usage of the collection since it's only available for curbside pickup but of course we've already spent our money to build our our physical collections so any funds that we that we have now that are allocated for those physical collections if we transition those into e-resources then we're not buying the books that we might need in the future so so I think that's one of the challenges that we're seeing as well as just trying to figure out like everyone in the United States and worldwide how to stay healthy with this evolving and novel virus so that's kind of the overall landscape and I'll throw it back over to Jason to introduce our panelists he'll talk a little bit about their own experiences of their libraries thank you Peter thank you so much Kevin I really appreciate that it's been quite a lot and I would want to add one item for you congressman about the thought as Kevin just discussed about the digital world that libraries are now and have always been though navigating it has become very apparent that covin 19 has laid bare some specific challenges across Vermont and I would definitely say libraries in unison with education right now probably are on the same page of saying maybe Vermont should have a conversation about what broadband looks like in the state of Vermont because that seems to be now something of a utility it's become a vital service and it's something that a lot of people right now need and if you're not able to get online your life is pretty much going to go very slow and it's not saying that it can't happen through the old-fashioned method but it is something that we know we connect with a lot of our Vermonters by people accessing collections and different items so broadband is a great interest to a lot of people across the community with that we have our pasts yes congressman I'm looking forward to hearing the panelists but yeah a little bit a couple of things you said first of all I want to acknowledge it died in Derby from Senator Leahy's offices joining us on the call and of course senator leahy has been a real champion and been so extraordinarily helpful in Appropriations and he the Bernie and I are on the same page on everything that we're doing to try to help her mom recover the second I wanted to make a I was struck by some of the comments you made Jason about the mental health issues and what we saw was in the recession of 2008 the enormous increase in incidence of depression mental illness substance abuse and the reality is I think we would be reckless to disregard how tough that's going to be here you know a lot of folks are doing quote okay but there's going to be a question as to how how quickly the economy recovers a lot of folks millions and millions are without their jobs so this is tough and any refuge positive constructive refuge which is something the library offers that is so so important and you know I appreciate your acknowledgement for them and then Kevin you made a point too and by the way hi to Megan and Kevin's wife Megan used to work with us and I'm still recovering from her departure it's not fun so and therefore that she's great but you made a point about the budgets okay and the house believes and we just passed the heroes legislation in the Senate that it's absolutely critical with the federal government be a financial backstop to the states in our communities the reason we believe that it is the only governmental entity that has the fiscal capacity in the fiscal flexibility and we've got to respond in my view is we have to do we have to err on the side of doing too much too soon not too little too late so in that heroes legislation Vermont would get 1.4 billion the first year 1.3 billion the second year and our local communities you know Middlebury heartland Norwich would share about a half a billion dollars and I see that as absolutely essential so that we don't have this enormous burden on the property taxpayers and the state taxpayers which they can't meet and would result in that kind of cuts to libraries and other institutions so Kevin I think you've got a really good point there the Vermont congressional delegation is committed to getting that money back here and to give Vermont significant flexibility about that so thank you perfect for me if you want at some point recognize Diane if she has a say I definitely can guarantee how are you this is a Jason brown we hadn't seen you in a while from our old days of meeting had different types of meetings would you like to say a few things on behalf of Senator Leahy's office thanks so much I didn't really come prepare to talk I just wanted to listen in and report back to the senator but just quickly really appreciate hearing from congressman whelps thanks so much for letting me hijack your meeting for a moment yeah I think in addition just specific to the broadband issue in the 1.25 billion dollar package that they're trying to figure out at the Statehouse I think there's real consideration I don't know I've had the House bill did certainly include money that they just passed out for broadband so there and the Senate still needs to you know work with the house and a final version of that but certainly through some of this federal funding and that was the Kerr's Act money the 1.25 billion so we did have money for broadband in that and it certainly is a priority for the senator he just compared it yesterday and a call to the electrification issue so pairing with Jason's comments about it being a utility Senator Leahy totally understands that and we're working on that through various avenues and just hoping that the Senate leadership Republican leadership sees the wisdom in picking up on the next ghovat spending bill that the house is passed over so thanks for having me feel free to reach out anytime and it's always great to be with you thank you so much perfect perfect within that we are going to now discuss and have our panelists come on and one of the comments those senators said regarding the heroes actors we are definitely looking forward to it I would say and me following that there are days the congressman that I feel that it could be called the villains Act if we're not careful based on various people but I'll be quiet about that so our panelists are going to be star electronico the Brooks memorial a library in Brattleboro Amy Olson of the lamp for a library in Hyde Park and Mike Roy from the library in Middlebury to give us different types of perspectives and I would also like to let everyone know we do have all of the libraries not represented but participating today so we do have parts of the Vermont School Library Association board that is on the call along with a lot of academics and of course our largest group the public libraries of the state with that let's go ahead and start with our southern area first so star are you ready to begin letting us know what you are experiencing during this time of Colvin and what type of things you are going to continue to do or not do as a library of your size thank you thank you and thank you all for inviting me today and for being here and thank you all for recognizing that librarians are truly heroes we are heroic beings and and that goes for everyone who works on the library they really are this is a profession that devotes itself to serving its clientele so we pull out all the stops to do everything we can for people for all of our constituencies and this was no different the singular experience was different than everything else but we reacted in our usual way of rising to the occasion so we have found innovative creative ways to address the needs of our communities and we have only built upon that over the last several months one of the first things we did was to contact our community partners to see what we could do to help them because we knew that some people would have continued contact with the public that we were not going to be able to have once we had closed our doors and so we contacted people who work with the homeless population here we contacted people who are serving people in recovery from substance misuse and to see okay what do you need what can we do for you right now and so we loaned laptops so that those people there their clientele could access online learning which is provided through the Department of libraries so thank you Department of libraries and and so I've had reports from these different organizations saying that some of their clients have really spent this time taking online classes and increasing their skill sets so that's a wonderful thing and then likewise we asked like wise people called us and asked you know what we could do or what they could do for us and so we have helped with people filing in their senses we've we've promoted that we've provided assistance on the phone if people were having trouble getting through or filing it online and we have loan tablets to the Brattleboro retreat so that they could do virtual therapy sessions for people that they couldn't meet with face to face and we are also a drop-off point to donate cell phones for people again people that need access to those devices that they don't have and part of what we did was we forwarded our office phones so that we can receive calls at home and continued reference service including some really complicated reference questions about the chemical makeup of different Beach products to see whether they be appropriate and you know which required some real delving into some complicated publications but we were able to answer those questions and also we provided telephone service for troubleshooting for people trying to access our online services so that we were able to help people who had put those devices away and let them languish in a closet after the holidays and hadn't really gotten them going so our electronic services person was able to lead them through that so that they could access the increased number of online services that we were able to provide and we did we we switched over our some of our budget lines so that we could provide streaming and we increased our streaming video capacity and we purchased a lot more downloadable books so that we would be able to to meet those needs and as Kevin so wisely pointed out you know the the use of those who has gone through the roof but the other thing we really spent a lot of time on was curating our online resources so that our patrons of all ages were able to access good experiences both educational and cultural through through our online links that we provided on our website we have let's see look at my notes oh and so then I did want to say you know certainly I'll just echo what everybody in this on this call would say which is the digital divide we always know it was there libraries have been able to be a bridge across that divide for a while but this really brought home the the issue that we really need to have increased broadband to provide this essential utility for everyone because as you know there are many many places that because my for a job is through that and then of course the mainstay of public libraries which is our service to children and and so this was particularly challenging you know this is we play a big developmental role in children's experience and so it was very difficult when they not only were cut off from there so see socializing at school but then they couldn't come to the library as well so our Youth Services staff has really been creative in reading books aloud online so that kids can go on there they can see those familiar faces they can hear those wonderful stories and have that sense of connection again and also our services to parents and certainly this is a extremely challenging time for parents so to really put those resources out there for parents to be able to access not only to talk about the pandemic but to talk about the social and racial justice issues that kids are acutely aware of and so we have that happening as well and then you know as people have mentioned you know we worked so hard to establish our essential function as a cultural and social center of the community and so we have been looking for ways to extend that virtually so we really emphasized our social media presence our weekly e-newsletter --zz I know some of my heroic colleagues in Vermont have actually been calling patrons who don't have internet access to check in on them and make sure they're doing all right see if there's anything that they can provide for them and we've also established some online groups to have that kind of social interaction there's one called growing Hope which has distributed over 600 packets of sunflower seeds to be planted around town so we'll start to see that the blossoming of that and growing resilience which is a gardening support group and on and on we are as Jason said providing trim site service now and with that we do readers advisory and we do these bags of surprise like a grab bag for patrons that call and just want something good to read and I was talking to someone who husband was unpacking a bag and she said it was like his birthday every title it's like so so we're working on maintaining those social connections and we're looking forward to gradually reopening as they said thank you stars for all of the interesting and unique complexities that you are having to navigate thank you with that we will now go on to Amy Olson who is now past president of the Vermont Library Association and always have been though the director of the land for library in Hyde Park Amy are you ready Thank You congressman Welch and your staff for pursuing this meeting with us it's been really heartening to know that libraries are on your radar in understanding how we have been coping through kovat a lot of what I have to say is going to be repetition of what other people have said but I will start with an issue that's near and dear to me personally in that I'm the director of the land for Memorial Library in Hyde Park Hyde Park is a town of about a little over 3,000 people but I live in the Northeast Kingdom in a town called Lowell Vermont with around 800 people population and not great internet access so working from home for me has been really fun in a lot of ways and I have usable internet for email and Internet in my house but for a meeting like this I've used our town clerk office parking lot in my car as the local Wi-Fi hotspot and we can vouch for that she's we've seen her in her car during meetings it is a beautiful spot food as long as gorgeous there's a reason why I live there but but for sure you know it's not just the people that we serve it's also us that are impacted by this and I can't stress enough the need for statewide broadband for really those those rural communities who really really need it I have been the library director at the land for Memorial Library for 17 years now and I feel like for most of that time I have been spending researching and advocating in our communities not just in Hyde Park but throughout Vermont about libraries being essential services and one of the things that I really admire about librarians is our ability to adapt and to be innovative in our services we are constantly assessing the needs of our communities and adapting our services to meet those needs and when Kovic closure started happening the word association with essential services did not include libraries and so having to sort of be that role model for a community the best way that we could serve was to close our doors typically in times of crisis that's not how libraries respond where typically as people have mentioned during the Great Recession during Hurricane Irene we were on the front lines of opening our doors and helping people find jobs and helping people file for unemployment in the census and all of these things that we typically do but in this particular instance it was the opposite reaction which goes against all of our instincts as the helpers in our communities so my mindset or my my use of the word essential is has changed so I'm using synonyms we are going to be crucial in the recovery process so I'm so grateful that you're listening to us and and concerned about how we're serving our communities now and thinking about how we will do that in the future especially economically and socially so very much like Starr mentioned the Lancer library working from home I was partnering with our community organizations behavioral health and wellness got harm reduction PAC help people suffering from substance abuse we said might libraries help distribute those through our curbside service the Vermont Department of Health we help them adapt their family fun day I've been working very closely with a racial equity alliance of oyel a real real schools committee on a big project that we've been working on for several months now the Karina Howard nickel centers are local domestic and sexual violence shelter and the folks there have reached out to us to help us to help us to help them get the word out about the services that they've been providing right along understanding that that instances are on the rise connecting a lot of people reached out to us saying how can we get free books to add to our family kits that were distributing to from the Lamoille Family Center and the Department of Health so we were able to help connect people with the children's literacy foundation so they could get free books we also reallocated some of our budget to amp up our digital resources particularly ebooks and audio books because our patrons also were increased use of those digital services we we are still and have been right along hosting virtual book discussions and virtual programs while the school was closed the High Parks elementary school librarian invited me to take part in her classes so I was able to virtually join classes and read to the kids then help those kids stay connected to the community which was really fun and important too I'm just looking at my list so moving forward um we are now only open for curbside we haven't opened our doors for patrons to come in yet we just purchased a Wi-Fi extender so that people can not only use the Wi-Fi outside our building which lots of people do for years and years but we've seen more and more people doing that so the Wi-Fi extender will allow people to sit in the pocket park across the street and use our internet as well for free and our summer reading program is going to be mostly outside where we know that a lot of kids are getting those of virtual storytimes and screen time is a concern so we're trying to think of creative ways to have have the summer reading program with less screen time so story walk scavenger hunt and those will be more individual family lead types of things that we will initiate the we'll have to kind of do on their own and also activity kids and looking ahead you know anticipating that secondly I have been erring on the side of caution so much that that it was a relief to get the report from the OCLC IMLS and the Phil foundation the Calvin's ation that it's only three days because we've been quarantined our materials for a week just to be cautious but as we're we're finalizing our draft of our reopening plan which we're still working on one of our trustees introduced us to the term pastino Monday which is Latin and he had to translate it so it means nice and slowly and that kind of feels like my new mantra in all of this okay I just want to final finally say that that libraries are crucial and as Ryan Dowd the homeless shelter in Chicago executive director has said that we are the last bastion of true democracy in America and and I just really moving forward want to make sure that it's understood that we start every single person in our community and that why those community partners those mental health services the diversion board those people are reaching out to us because they know that we serve every single person thank you thank you Amy on that and again libraries are doing a variety of things you've met you now so within that our last panelist and then Kevin will be facilitating the Q&A session is going to be my cry from the Middlebury University Library thank you Mike are you ready I am ready can you hear me all right we can thank you fabulous so um Thank You congressman wells for having this event it's really important for us to have a chance to just explain what we're what we're doing and what our experience has been so I'm gonna I pulled the over 20 college and university librarians in Vermont just to kind of share what I was going to say just to see if it was consistent with what they're experiencing and so for the most part what I'm going to say is more or less represents what many of the colleges and universities and Vermont are experiencing in terms of their library services so the first thing I'd say is as many have suggested that our investments that we've made in digital infrastructure over the years has really paid off and so partly the good news is that this that it wasn't as disruptive as we worried it would be because we had spent decades making these digital transformations and I think that's true for the public library colleagues as well I'd say that we benefited in the short term from many publishers making available for short term lots of materials and so we're able to make some pivots there but I'd say we're concerned that those publishers are going to kind of step back from those offerings and that's going to have a significant impact on our ability to continue to provide these digital services echoing many of the other speakers we've certainly seen how the residential campuses where many of our students and faculty and staff work mask lots of the the inequity that exists and the disparity it exists in terms of access to the Internet access to homes large enough for people to work and study remotely and so that's been that's been eye-opening and I'd say that because we're linked so closely to our institutions there's a lot of concern about you know how this transition to in-person education is going to go and we're going to have to close up again mid semester and what does that mean for budgets and staffs and the future of our institutions and Kevin suggested that we could we should make a list of you know what what our needs in thinking at a kind of federal level and so I would characterize kind of three types of needs so one is advice and so we've heard a lot about how we've benefited from science-based evidence-based research into how to safely open these services and so thinking about how do we how do we continue to promote that beyond materials and thinking about the physical spaces in terms of funding thinking about furniture and other structural upgrades to facilities thinking about funds for licensing digital resources as publishers and their free offerings thinking about equipment safe you know safe equipment that's easy to clean and distribute and one of my colleagues mentioned increased funding for the federal work-study program that we're going to our students are going to increasingly need what to work and have been making sure there's sufficient funds there and in the last category is really on the policy level and so thinking about open access and open education access and open educational resources and how we no longer need to be as beholden to commercial publishers in order to provide access to resources thinking about reforms to fair use and copyright that allows for broader use in an educational context and especially the sharing of DRM locked down materials and then thinking about internet access and how do we both within the state and because Middlebury serves a national and international audience we've certainly seen that this is not limited to Vermont that the that the issue of broadband in rural areas is is across the country so anyway those are my those are the things I I was thinking about it and again I really appreciate you taking the time to hear us our thank you Michael thank you thanks so much for those words Mike and Amy and Starr I really appreciate you participating and since we have limited time I would like to open it up for some questions to the congressman feel free to unmute yourself and ask a question we have about 10 more minutes so let's go for it Kevin I have a question this is Tom McMurdo at Vermont Department of libraries Congressman I was just wondering and I want you to look into your crystal ball or anything but I would like to get your opinion about the likelihood of the heroes Act passing I think there's a good chance that parts of it are gonna pass we got a real problem with Senator McConnell you know the state aid is essential that in his position you may have read is that the states should declare bankruptcy net that's crazy all right they were talking about a deep and prolonged brutal depression it would mean that libraries would by and large be closed I really do believe that but there are so many Republican senators just like Democratic senators where they're talking to their librarians and they're talking to their local school folks and this problem that we have obviously is not a red state blue state type of deal and there's only one question it is whether the federal government is going to step in and provide relief so that we can get through this so I think at the end of the day we will pass the heroes Act significant components of it and I even saw the President Trump is saying that he wants another package that it's at least two trillion the hero says three trillion in you know when I keep arguing this so literally it's a once in a century event so there's no game plan for this it's not as though we're in a normal business cycle where we're in a recession or it's not a function of the state of Vermont being profligate in its spending so the existential challenge that libraries face is the same as what schools faces with our community health centers face is the same as what forty million Americans who lost their jobs face so question will the federal government step in and use the authority that it uniquely has to raise funds or provide funds to get us through this so that gives me some basis of optimism because there's such a common need that goes beyond political differences even in this time of harsh person not divided great thank you made me feel a little more optimistic yeah in government is you know it's just an exam governor Scott is very much as the state aid that we want to provide including with Senator Leahy senator Sanders and I also believes that there should be a good deal flexibility so that at the state level we can be making this decision so you know if we're successful then I would want to see your association you know you've got a great great group I'm making it making the case in my appeal for some of the money that comes to my appealing from Washington thank you so who would like to jump in with a question I can relay one question that we received and this has already been addressed by by the congressman and a couple of speakers but people were asking a lot about broadband and what's happening with specifically with broadband it's been an issue in Vermont for a while and I don't know if there's any money that's coming for broadband or any movement for that for rural communities like lots of parts of Vermont but I'm curious about that aspect of okay yeah in fact I want to thank everybody for their advocacy for broadband two things one getting access to rural broadband has been a major focus of my office and we've been at it for years we've had some success getting some money but koban has changed everything and broadened the basis of support jason said in the beginning that it's like a utility and it is and basically we're at the point politically where we have to make a decision right now similar to what the Roosevelt administration made in the 30s about electricity and there was no economic case to start getting electricity out to rural America cuz the big companies it wasn't profitable but on the other end there's a huge social case to be made that same decision has to be made about broadband next week we're going to be voting in the House on an infrastructure package that would have a hundred billion dollars for rural broadband in what I have seen but my Republican colleagues have seen because when I talk to them about broadband they live in a lot of remote areas a lot of men Republican colleagues represent rural America I start talking about the challenges about broadband if we're on the same totally on the same page because again this is not a red state blue state they've got librarians and can't Indiana you know I owe an Oklahoma that are is dedicated to their jobs as you guys are know a fundamentally important having access to broadband is to be a modern library so we've got this brew a rural broadband caucus and it's got a bunch of Republicans as well as Democrats on it we're going to be voting on that hundred billion dollars next year and I think the time is coming where that all-in commitment will soon be made you can think about it you see how broadband is essential for you to provide services to the folks in your towns but now it's not just about helping kids for their homework it's having kids go to school it's not about a convenience to have a doctor's appointment it's the only way many people can get medical attention and it's not about having the convenience of it so that after dinner and the kids are down and you've done the dishes you can check your email and do a little work to get ahead of the day it's about working you don't have bribe in you can't work so I think we're gonna get the money you know relatively soon the Senate is a real problem with Macau but I think we're going to get a positive vote in the house and it's going to be foundational for next year if we don't get it this year then the second challenge is how do you grind it out house by house in on the dirt road where there's mountains and valleys so the situation that Madison County is a lot different than the situation in the Northeast Kingdom that's a local challenge and we've got to be flexible about how we do it with electricity we created a lot of rural electrification districts where you have local people local small companies committed to the local community doing the implementation so I think we need federal money and significant local implementation but your urgent advocacy for broadband is extremely helpful to the ultimate success of Patrick Bernie and I've been able to get the money to wire for my thank you thank you and I think we have one more question I see that in the chat Kathryn Hays raised your hand if you have time for one more question thanks very much this is Kathryn he is with the Bixby librarian Vergennes and I guess I was just going to ask when you talked about us making the case in Montpelier for getting relief from the heroes Act is there what advice do you have for us as a community that we should be doing now in our libraries to get ready for that so we're proactive rather than reactive and that we're making our case in the way to be the most effective and and be the most in a way that's most received by those who need to hear about it what what language should we be using what number should we be gathering that sort of thing well I thank you for that number one the most important thing is that you do it together okay so when you're speaking as an association and you're all supporting this in each of you in your own local area in your own local library you're talking to your local state representatives you're talking to your local state senators that adds up okay so the most important is that you speak with the unified voice you can concrete about what you want and that might be a specific amount of money that gets allocated to each library so unity is key the second is a clear message and the clear message is you need money they're clear ask you need money to maintain the budget but then the third and this where I think you have unique credibility how are we going to restore and revitalize our communities that have been through this epidermis pandemic where there's been job loss job dislocation where there's been social distancing the can lead to social isolation well it's why I think that libraries are restaurants that are run by local people and owned by them why are schools all those institutions that are embedded in the local community and give a definition to law and give the definition to Vergennes that make people feel proud of living there that's what we have to revive and restore we can't let that be a casualty of the virus and if we let a institution like a local library wither you know how hard it is to put it back together and I think our legislators in Montpelier understand that so I think that case about the role that you play in our communities you know just think about the stories of individual libraries we're so often it's been a couple of folks who got together and said our community needs a library and they raise money locally and it is just such an a from of affirmation of local is real and I think that's an exciting case for you guys to make and I think it's one that would resonate with our citizen legislature in Montpelier so I wish you luck and I'll do all I can help but I know Derby well to my buddy thank you very much watch congressman and one of the focuses for the VLA this year is on advocacy we have two that really jumped to the forefront one is promoting anti racism and we're going to try to do that at all libraries than the other is on advocacy for our profession and for our communities so I really appreciate those good tips thank you um do you have any closing words before we before we end the session well those were my closing words I think that you know modern life is got a lot of factors that are freeing our sense of community and any folks who are doing work that help us bring a community together and help make it cohesive god bless you in libraries here at the front and center of that you've got a lot to be proud of and it would give I hope you a lot of energy to get up each day and face these extraordinary challenges because it's really important that you'd be successful thank you again thanks to your staff for reaching out and your interest in talking to libraries and I wanted to echo to Diane we appreciate your support and Senator Leahy's support as well and thanks to all over the library thanks by the way my last word I just got a chat from Nancy the Hartman library you know Martin memorial I used to spend time there my kids spent a lot of time there when you're growing up Nancy thanks for being on the call okay thank you all so much this has been wonderful good to see you all via zoom and I look forward to seeing folks in person when we can do that yeah thanks bye-bye thank you

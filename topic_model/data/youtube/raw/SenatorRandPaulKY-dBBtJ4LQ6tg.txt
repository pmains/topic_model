dr. Falchi every day virtually every day we seem to hear from you things we can't do but when you're asked can we go back to school I don't hear much certitude at all I hear well maybe it depends if you were listening and I think you were to my opening statement and my response to one of the questions I feel very strongly we need to do whatever we can to get the children back to school so I think we are in Lock agreement with that one of the more heated moments of today's coronavirus members of meeting of before the Senate Rand Paul was the one asking the questions of Tucker found that he might be a little bit too tentative a little too guarded and a little too unclear in this particular case about allowing kids to return to school the senator with us right now Senator Paul thank you for coming q he seemed to say that it's dr. Falchi that you guys are kind of on the same page you were pointing out that you're not because he's he's not more unequivocal I guess right you know I think we got more out of him I think it takes a little bit to draw out of dr. Falchi but in the end he did seem to be agreeing with me but my point is this the scientific evidence is overwhelming the kids rarely get the disease kids rarely die from the disease and actually even more extraordinary they rarely transmit the disease but here's the problem you got scientists at the whu-oh who said who said this so scientists came on and she gave a press conference and said this but you know what they did they shut her down and because political correctness rules everywhere they actually deleted the link to the studies that pointed out that this was rare so I think this is a rare bit of good news and we should be happy for children but we need to send them to school and in frankly many of the schools in Europe are going back without masks many of them are going out with modified if any social distancing and kids are not causing a spike I listed eight different countries and we showed the chart where guess what there was no spike when they open the schools there have been spikes for other reasons in other areas in a number of states about a dozen of them right now that have seen double-digit increases in cases a senator and I'm wondering whether you agree with the governor's in those states who are scaling back or openings and phase three openings than in the case of of Texas partly Florida they're reversing them you know I think it's unknown right now there there definitely are increased cases there is more testing but I do believe there are more cases but the thing we don't know yet is is it having a really terrible effect are we gonna have an increased death rate if you just have cases and the average age is 37 and there's virtually no or no mortality you could make the argument that we are increasing our herd immunity for a country and so I guess I'm not as alarmed as some I'm not saying it's nothing I'm saying we don't Miette know they say that the death rate lags that's true but work two or three even four weeks into a lot of the opening the increased cases have been going on for a while and I think it's very good news I think we shouldn't always have bad news that we talk about it's very much good news that the average age is 37 and that the vast majority of them are surviving if you look at the statistics from the Netherlands at age 37 or even at age 47 95 to 97% were either mildly affected or asymptomatic so the odds are good with this disease and we need to not keep scaring people I mean this is the point with opening schools there now scaring teachers such the teachers don't want to go back to school and they're gonna refuse to teach and yet the the facts the scientific evidence our kids rarely transmit this to adults kids don't catch it very often kids don't get sick and so all the worry about Grandma kids need to go to school don't send the kids to the nursing home I mean we have to do what we can to protect those in a nursing home but doesn't mean we shouldn't kids back send the kids back to school alright well fair enough that then you talk about practical advice that people should honor rather than wait for needed from the government and one concerns nests whether you should wear we're masks the vice president's speaking right now in Maryland is advocating that yeah you know push comes to shove probably a good idea the president doesn't wear a mask and I get the reason in the part of this rationale is you know he's been tested to get it again again he doesn't have it he's not gonna give it to anyone but is it a good example to set do you think the president should wear it or is he pushing a cavalier attitude where a lot of people say what the heck with it if he's not wearing it I'm not working well you know I'm old enough to remember when the CD say the CDC said we were idiots for wearing masks and now they say we're criminals I think the answer is somewhere in between I think if you're immuno compromised you should avoid crowds I think if you are elderly should avoid crowds and I think if you're 20 years old I think the same prescription isn't there so the people who want to tell every twenty-year-old that you have to stay inside and stay away from people forever or until there's a vaccine and no vaccine comes this is the new normal I am really just not for that but I am for individual responsibility everybody every day do you want to get in a car do you want to ride a motorcycle do you want to ride a bike in DC do you want to walk in DC do you want to jaywalk in DC all of the decisions we make in our life involve risks and really for young people the risks of death from accidents and other things are as high or higher sometimes than some of the risks from infectious disease so I'm for individual choice and there are people who should wear masks and then there are other times in which it's sort of Kabuki theater and may or may not be doing anything to change the the rate of what's going on if you don't see people taking those common-sense measures to just be aware of the crowds around you distancing on all that what do you think of governors who force the issue like in New Jersey where the governor just said all right I'm holding off on indoor dining because you guys aren't listening well the thing is is they really don't have any scientific evidence on their side to say oh if you seat every other seat on the airplane you know you have reduced infection there's just no science to that that's what we're doing now and even the airlines are pushing back and saying well what is your science same with restaurants I mean what if eight people are in the same family and they hang out with their neighbors can we not let them make decision you know neighbors are getting together all over America we're not telling Big Brother but neighbors get together and they have picnics and they associate with people in extended families that is happening so when you go to a restaurant you're not allowed to sit with those people you know there are some absurdities to this thing but I'm not saying you shouldn't take precautions if you are in a nursing home or have cancer or immuno compromised or someone your family is take extra precautions by all means but I don't like the one-size-fits-all I'm against mandatory mass some against I'm against most of the government mandates on your personal behavior I think we should be largely left free it doesn't mean that we should ignore advice but we should remember that we're a free country that's what we were founded on is freedom of choice Senator Rand Paul very good having you back be well actually say Rand Paul the beautiful state of Kentucky or

congresswoman nicole malliotakis of new york state joins us member of the house transportation and infrastructure committee congresswoman good to see you how would you address the pinch what should the administration do how do we get more formula back on the shelves now because you know parents are have been desperately wanting it well republicans have been calling for them to streamline the process to set the standards for importation because it could easily be be received from other countries while they ramp up production here at home the real issue is that the fda under president biden shut down that one plant in michigan that provides about 15 percent of the stock nationwide and that has only exacerbated the problem and it's been months and so we are wondering why has it taken the fda so long to investigate and get this manufacturing plant back online because now we're seeing shortages around 50 stock shortage across the country as a result the president should have been on top of this months ago and many members of the republican conference had been calling for the fda to ramp up the production to streamline the situation i mean he could have also invoked the national defense authorization if necessary if we knew it was going to take this long so really this is an issue of why his agencies were working so slowly to address this issue that is now hurting american families and then to see what is occurring at the border with the palettes that's just a slap in the face uh to see that how there's a formula available there but not in the stores across america before we get there go back to the this fall back on the border first of all it's it's the law that uh anyone comes in for asylum that they have to be fed babies who come across the border need to be fed and there's also controversy over those pallets that's another issue but in terms of what you just talked about most people don't realize there are only four domestic producers of formula in this country so if one factor goes down man we're caught short you know what can they do now in order to get more in the president says they're going to uh reduce some regulations bring more overseas but were you surprised that this you know it's been two months already since last february when that plant went down it hasn't even started up yet absolutely i think the question a lot of us have is why were these manufacturers not brought to the white house earlier to have a discussion on how the federal government can help and again the other thing is these agencies need to be fully staffed they're still working on covid restrictions people are still working from home at agencies all across the country we have problems with various agencies each and every day to help our constituents with various issues so we need to get everyone back to work and perhaps that also played a role and the other thing was democrats have waited months to hold a hearing we're now going to have a hearing three months after this problem initiated in february that is far too late but again it's them being reactive to what the republicans have been doing calling attention to this look it's also very reminiscent of the energy crisis that we're facing in this country the president doesn't want to ramp up domestic production his desk they're sitting on thousands of lease applications while we have an energy crisis and people are paying soaring gas prices so it's just one thing after another from this administration and a lot of it has to do with the regulations the red tape the bureaucracy the government agencies not being fully back to work uh that has led to this and at the end of the day that's the president he's the executive he's the manager of all these agencies and he has to make sure that they're doing their job when you talk about the president the wall street journal blaming the trump administration president trump for some of this uh tariffs regulations let me read you something that the atlantic reveals about this they say the tax on formula imports can exceed 17 under president donald trump the u.s entered into a new north american trade agreement that actively discouraged formula imports from our largest trading partner canada we're seeing what happens when we reduce trade with other nations so congresswoman do you think that that that policy which is instituted under president trump should be reversed now drop that 17 and a half percent tariff uh you know why can't we just get more baby food from canada by tomorrow well look there's a lot of things we should be doing with canada including uh finishing the keystone pipeline so we can get energy uh into from the united from canada look these policies can be re be looked at and altered as needed but the reality is is that this is the fault of this administration he has created a border crisis an energy crisis a food shortage crisis uh now the baby formula we are seeing crime we're seeing a lot of issues across america cities that are going unaddressed as well under democratic leadership so let's not play games here you're trying they're trying to play blame a president that has left office over a year ago instead of actually seeing what we can do right now to resolve this issue if the tariff is an issue then let's address it and let's get to work and just get it done but uh i don't see any leadership from this president this this is what you're seeing right now let me interrupt you because he pointed out that they are doing something that they're making taking action they're doing something now but months later considering the defense production act and you got a banner right under you congresswoman says for more information and parents should know about this hhs.gov formula if you want to know where uh to find formula well that's something that they're doing right now whether that's enough we'll have to see uh certainly our hearts to our out months later though and by the way they say don't dilute the formula you can go to hhsgovernor.gov.gov formula congresswoman molly hitacus from the great borough of staten island otherwise known as richmond county

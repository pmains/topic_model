you were among the u.s senators who wrote a letter to the director of national institutes of health after they removed coronavirus gene sequence data that might hold clues to the pandemic's origin in it you write we request additional information about the nih sequence red archive and the actions taken by chinese researchers to have nih delete sars covered to related data what's the status on the information you have gotten and your assessment i think what we're trying to get to is where did this come from and did we play a role in the united states in it you know absolutely lots of reasons we need to know why where this came from um and this is the origin of it what we're getting to much like if i knew your genetic sequences and i could have some other people's i could figure out which one is your who is your grandfather who's your grandmother and your cousins we think that we can prove the origins of code but started in a lab in wuhan if we could look at these precursors to what became cova 19. we think that the grandparents the relatives of that virus will be will be found in these data banks we've given china a year and a half to find some type of an intermediate species or prove to us that it came from nature so far it's all empty so we think that these these genetic lab banks will have the answer and can show us the relatives and and indeed it looks like going way back to maybe 2011 that that dr fauci was funding viral gain of function research uh on a sars virus and then we talked dr she had manipulate these viruses and eventually she took that knowledge and made the copa 19 virus in her laboratory that's what it looks like here's what uh press secretary jinsaki had to say about the national institutes of health and the origins of the virus just a few days ago listen to this uh nih has never approved any research that would make a coronavirus more dangerous to humans a reminder that there are previous and different coronaviruses than the existing one were battling and the body of sinons produced by this research demonstrates that the bad chronovirus sequences published from that work uh emma nih supported were not uh covet the the strain coveted to strain so first of all you wouldn't know the answers to any of that if the researchers in china are deleting the sequences which is what your letter was about asking them why they would be doing that and if they have done that already will you be able to retrieve any of that information look we're assuming that they're scientists and they would had a backup of these uh this genetic lab stored someplace but her words are so deceitful we funded a north carolina lab to take the original sars virus and put a spike on it that would stick to humans lung cells like blue and then we funded eco health to the tune of over 100 million dollars who worked with dr xi on viral gain of function research so that is totally deceitful uh they're going to come back and argue with us what is viral gain of function but very simply viral gain of function research is to take a virus and make it meaner angrier more lethal and that's exactly what they did with the sars virus originally and we took it in piecemeal fashion and made it into what looks like a cova 19 now so that's what she just said is horribly deceitful has dr fauci been transparent much less than transparent and i think so the few emails we've got to see and we just got a whole new treasure trove of emails downloaded from the nih to see exactly what's going on i think he's been way less than transparent even the the original authors the 27 authors that said that most likely that this virus came from nature in china and we're back in a timeline of february of 2020 even all 27 of those authors were typically funded in some way shape or form by dr fauci in the past and i think he should have been transparent about that and that he was communicating with some of those writers as that letter was being put together so that's just the tip of the iceberg why would genetic sequences be deleted will i what do you why do why are they trying to hide and that's exactly the question so if you're the godfather and you're being held in court and all of a sudden the witnesses come up dead that's what the chinese are doing right now these are the witnesses the genetic sequences are the witnesses to the crime so they they they keep hiding those and trying to remove them from the public eye because they know that there's going to be a trail that leads to a lab in wuhan china all right senator and dr roger marshall thank you

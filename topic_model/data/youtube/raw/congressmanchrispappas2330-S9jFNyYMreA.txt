today i want to focus my comments on an issue that is so critical to the public health concerns in my district to our environment to the availability of clean water and that's the issue of these toxic forever chemicals known as pfas and the need to regulate them under the clean water act i think our states need additional federal support uh to understand the problem to test for it and to ensure that contaminants like pfas do not get out into the environment where they persist uh for decades and centuries um that's why a bill that has passed the house in the last session uh i'm really looking forward to reintroducing it this term it's the clean water standards for pfas act and it would require epa to up fast discharges under the clean water act and issue regulations to address harmful discharges into our nation's waterways and into the environment this is important because it would allow epa to hold these corporations to hold polluters accountable and ensuring that they're not just sending these harmful pfas chemicals directly to publicly owned treatment works uh and uh you know pass along the burden to our local ratepayers um additionally this bill would also authorize a grant program to assist these publicly owned treatment works to make sure that they can comply and that ultimately we're not just perpetuating uh this type of contamination so i really look forward to building some support uh in a bipartisan fashion that legislation i hope it can be taken up as part of reauthorization uh and i think this could really help a lot of our uh water treatment facilities around the country deal with this persistent issue

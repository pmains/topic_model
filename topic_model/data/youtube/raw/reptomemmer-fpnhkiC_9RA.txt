powell he was fooled he was twisted kind of like one of those old stretch armstrong toys right both sides of the al uh did some of it including my next guest congressman tom emmer of minnesota uh representative emmer you actually said we can raise interest rates over and over but the only way to curb a disaster this bad is to raise interest rates to a catastrophic catastrophic level what's a catastrophic level well charles thanks for having me catastrophic most economists uh whether they their perspective is from the left or the right or right down the middle will tell you that you have to raise interest rates almost to the same level of your inflation in this garbage about 8.5 percent core inflation let's throw in everything charles let's throw in housing let's throw in energy let's throw in closing and clothing and food our interest rate or our uh our inflation is actually closer to 12 so what do they got to do is he going to keep going up up up i i it just this is uh they waited too long and i i appreciate your previous guests but this is all on the fed now the fed waited too long to exercise the powers that it has and now rather than rather than acknowledge that they basically try to provide cover for the administration that caused this inflation and they're coming in too late and now americans are getting punched in the face by double-digit inflation we haven't seen in 40 years yeah in fact chris actually just acknowledged what you said uh that they're going to have to go harder than they're going and it's that they actually have no choice so the question now though are you confident that powell and can and b will pull this off wow we really have no choice i am i confident in the chair after our discussion yesterday uh no i think uh credibility was an issue right you've got a president who says the 1.9 trillion dollar american rescue plan did not have any impact at all on inflation when in fact larry summers a uh someone beloved by democrats an economist told him in january and february before he passed the american rescue planner signed it that this was going to kick off inflation like we haven't seen and now uh here you've got the president denying that he's responsible for it you got the treasury chair trying to suggest that she made a mistake it wasn't transitory and now we've got our our federal reserve chair trying to play both sides of the aisle that's not their job charles we need a chair who says look at you can't spend money like this you gotta rein in the money you've got to have an all-of-the-above energy policy because it is energy that drives our economy and they have killed our energy sector by their attack on fossil fuels and because of them they have driven energy prices sky high through the roof and that has contributed with the spending to double digit inflation like we haven't seen and the sad part is charles it's not gonna end soon let me get back to uh the fed for a moment because goldman sachs had a really interesting note out today uh saying that political campaign ads pose further risk to consumer inflation expectations uh i mean because everyone's going to have these ads out there saying prices are going sky high when people see those ads they're going to say wow prices have gone sky high do you think that that that's going to be an issue i think the issue is the administration the issue is the central bankers the issue is the balance sheet i mean you and i are talking about uh the fed raising interest rates but they've done nothing to start to whittle down a balance sheet that is so bloated it would embarrass a uh a raccoon that's a roadkill on a northern minnesota highway on a 100 degree day this they've got to start attacking the problem where it is and they're not doing it yeah that that was one hell of an image he just imparted into my head i hope i can shake it off before the day is over yeah i got 20 seconds left and so then what is what are you telling your constituents then uh you know about their prosperity i mean it's it sounds pretty dire right now look if we're going to get this under control the first thing you got to do is start to allow us to have all of the american energy independence that we had before this administration came in then you got to start to control your spending uh look charles we have to look at the united states of america as a broken business we're coming in it's got huge debts somebody's got to talk about taking this 30 trillion dollars of debt which we didn't have in the late 70s when we were able to grow ourselves out of it after the the reagan administration now we've got 30 trillion dollars of debt you have got to somehow figure out how you're going to take that deal refinance it to pay it off and get this country moving again we got to go but in all fairness that debt is built up under both parties so you got one hell of a job sir representative emmer thank you very much appreciate it thank you chuck

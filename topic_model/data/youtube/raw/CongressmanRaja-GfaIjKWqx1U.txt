noi congressman raja krishna morthy concerned it's great seeing you again what does this bill do for your constituents in illinois for example oh my goodness it's got so much good stuff jose obviously it lowers carbon emissions and provides incentives so that more people can buy solar panels they can buy electric vehicles they can buy energy-saving appliances but it also lowers prescription drug prices it also lowers insurance premiums on the obamacare exchanges and then finally it helps lower the deficit and that controls inflation and prices over the long term so overall it's it's a big win for our constituents and i'm really excited at final passage in getting it signed into law there are some in your party congressman that say the bill doesn't go far enough what do you expect to happen when the house returns on friday to take up this bill i think the vast majority of my colleagues on the democratic side are going to support this and then we're going to come back for more so for instance one thing that i'm very interested in is you know unfortunately the senate parliamentarian stripped out the uh cap the 35 a month cap for insulin for those people who are on private insurance and i think that we should introduce legislation to uh you know make that a reality uh but you know everything else that has happened within this bill is a big plus and i think it's going to command a lot of votes yeah and kaiser you were one of the lawmakers who traveled to asia with house speaker nancy pelosi last week including that stop in taiwan almost a week later china is still upset by your visit expanding live fire drills around taiwan are you surprised by the chinese response to this visit um unfortunately i'm not surprised you know their temper tantrum and their live fire exercises have happened before long before we visited taiwan and it's happening again but if the price of not seeing that type of irresponsible behavior is seeding control of taiwan or seeding control of our schedule our travel schedule to the chinese communist party that is not a price that we are going to pay jose and you know the plane you traveled on to taiwan took the long way to get there instead of the direct route over the south china sea where there's a huge chinese military presence did you and your colleagues ever worry about your safety i mean boy china was saying all kinds of things yeah there was all kinds of crazy statements especially in the government sponsored twit their equivalent of twitterverse where they were talking about shooting down the plane and so forth but i have to say that my colleagues and i i at least was not concerned because we were in the safe hands of uh the air force as well as the navy and our uh good men and women in uniform took extremely uh good care of us and making sure that we put in counter measures to whatever the chinese communist party was doing uh to uh uh basically dissuade us from going to taiwan you know a bipartisan group of lawmakers led by senate foreign relations committee chair bob menendez is working on a bill to bolster taiwan's defense capabilities and deepen america's ties with the island politico reports the white house is pushing back against that legislation worried that it will upset the balance and potentially provoke a conflict with china what's your take on that i respectfully disagree with the white house i think right now we have to help under the taiwan relations act we have an obligation to support the self-defense of taiwan and we cannot cower in the face of intimidation or bullying by the chinese communist party we have to remember that to avoid what happened in ukraine happening with taiwan we're going to have to achieve peace through strength and basically that means helping the taiwanese in shoring up their own defenses and of course uh providing uh whatever equipment is necessary for our own forces in the pacific to resist uh the use of force by the chinese and to deter them from moving on uh taiwan militarily congressman raja krishna murthy it's always a pleasure to see you i thank you so much for your time this morning

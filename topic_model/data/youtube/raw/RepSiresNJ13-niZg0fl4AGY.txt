yeah I was thinking that maybe there is a bias against the northern eastern state of this country you know this devastation can happen to any state and no one state has the money to make sure that those people that were injured in this storm can move forward and I will remind all those members that are not here supporting this bill that this could happen to your state you know as I said here and supported Alabama I supported Mississippi I supported Texas I was hoping that by now the northeast part of this country what had this Congress would have acted it's been 77 days those people are hurting people in my district still can't get back to their homes and here we are in the last Congress we just didn't do anything about it now we're moving forward and hopefully January 15 we can get the rest of this money so those people who are suffering in all these states that were hit by this storm can get their lives back together again and I thank thank you are your back gentlemen

thank you mr d.a and i want to thank you for your pulling us together uh having a what i think was a very fruitful meeting with members from the police department and those of us that are around this table and i want to thank all of my colleagues in government uh for sure uh what this nine-point plan goes to and talks about and i think the reason we're here is that we want the voices and the people to know that our communities and those of us who are elected are not just sitting back and we're going to be idly sitting back while our children are in the streets dying basically to a large extent shooting one another too many guns too many people who are looking at guns as an answer to resolve problems turf problems or game problems that we've got to come together and work collectively to make a difference and to do that we need every avenue that's possible every avenue that's possible uh and to make us feel safe you know some of us agree and some of us disagree on the kind of stop and frisk policy for example that we have but we all agree that it is something that has to be utilized we got to talk about how do we do it but as a tool being a former d.a that we utilize but we want to make sure that it's done in a way that's appropriate for the community because it's also important for the community to have a trust in the police department so that they can get the information or give the information to the police department that is needed if they see someone that's about to commit a crime especially if it has a someone has a weapon we know i know firsthand as a former d.a that without a witness you don't have a case you have to have somebody to testify the police can do all the work that they want but if you don't have someone that's going to step up then you don't have a case that you can make sure that the message gets loud and clear to those individuals who want to commit crimes especially those that have weapons that it is us standing together i think one thing that police commissioner kelly said right a number of other things and i'm we're here because we're working together he says that everybody has to hear that everybody in the community is upset about the violence that's going on and so with that i just want to say thank you judge brown because i think that as you can see all the electives and you'll hear from them all of us are united and saying that the violence must stop in our community and we're going to work collectively together with community leaders civic leaders along with the police department and others public schools to reduce the violence and the kind and the number of guns that are taking place in southeastern queens this nine-point plan is the beginning of that and i thank the d.a for his leadership and working collectively with us as he's done for his entire career as the district attorney of queens county

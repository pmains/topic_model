nationally syndicated radio host dana lash and south carolina congresswoman nancy mace nancy you've gone through this how much money is wasted of the 1.9 trillion or better yet how much of the 1.9 trillion actually is for emergency relief well actually more than 90 percent of the quote covet 19 relief package is being spent on is none of it's being spent on code really if you've got about nine percent being spent on covet 19 relief and i can't think of a worse idea right now than president biden raising taxes on the american people in the middle of a pandemic and that's what he's doing right now you just said it a minute ago that open borders and closed schools open borders hundreds of thousands of migrants waiting at the border because they have a hundred days to get here per president biden's words and yet he's going to raise taxes on the american people corporations and businesses are going to somebody's got to pay that bill we've already seen the pain at the pump 45 cents more per gallon when you go to fill your gas tank right now um this is this is enormous and this is the wrong plan of attack going forward in the future we can't come out of this pandemic by raising taxes on questions they say this is going to be the largest number of people crossing our border illegally in 20 years who's going to pay for their housing they're going to pay for their education who's going to pay for their health care who's going to pay for basic fundamental needs of everybody well we all are every single american that was for dana yeah no shawn you're right and and that's that's the million-dollar question it's it's it's an insane proposal to think that what we're still dealing with the aftermath of a national lockdown where we had the government essentially carry out imminent domain over the ability to engage in commerce gas prices are creeping up what is it some sectors of the border they see over 700 percent increase in people coming across i was speaking with chad wolfe earlier today and he said something like it's six to seven times the amount the number of illegal entrants in those crossing the border six to seven times what it was even at during barack obama's peak during his administration so yeah this is the best time to just throw together one of the biggest tax hikes in the past 30 years and the people who and i think sean you made a great point when you're talking about the corporate tax rate do people not understand that when you're the corporate tax rate is a cost that's directly transferred to the american people the middle class is going to be paying a huge price on this everyone should just go ahead and send those 1400 those 1400 checks back just send it right back to the department of treasury because you're essentially going to be doing that with your taxes and last point at a time when government did not render us services do under the taxation of theft scheme that we're forced to live under i think that everyone should be giving a year-long tax holiday instead of this exit question same question both of you quick answers will this result these radical policies nancy in a massive public outcry and impact 2022 i i absolutely think it does and we're talking about when you talk about all the stimulus money that's being spent right now 42 000 per taxpayer in this country is footing this bill i haven't seen 42 thousand dollars none of us have and at the end of the day we're gonna have a lot to talk about not just two years from now but four years from now we're going to win back the house in the majority in two years because of these far left policies dana impacts the election real quick i think it will people vote their wallet sean they always do yeah great point right on the money all right thank you both

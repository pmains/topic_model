recognized for five minutes thank you madam chair and i as i listen to the conversation it just occurs to me that nobody here seems to recognize that we've maxed out the credit card i mean trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars in borrowing and we still say there's no problem just spending money like it grows on trees i i just it just boggles my mind and you know i recently received a disturbing email from a constituent that demonstrates the breathtaking i mean breathtaking shortfalls of this multi-trillion dollar tax and spend big government debt exploding strategy that the biden administration is pursuing my constituent owns 14 restaurants and he employs hundreds of workers in my district and in the few days after re receiving their third economic impact payment of 1400 85 of his 267 employees walked off the job i want to repeat that 85 of his employees who had a job they were employed they walked off the job and to save everyone the math that's 32 percent of his entire workforce that quit because of the american recovery plan okay they quit because of the arp with 1400 for themselves their spouses dependents they felt they no longer had to work now he is having big trouble backfilling those roles because the job market is so tight the nfib recently reported that 40 of small businesses have job openings that they cannot fill right now and he's one of the victims and his employees are victims now because they no longer have a job because the government and congress specifically has told those people to go home and not work and he's now having big trouble with even operating his business my constituent told me he didn't see a similar pattern with the first economic impact payments under the cares act back when employees were truly struggling and they really needed the money and when restaurants were forced to actually shut down now i know that many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are hearing similar stories in their districts and it shows the consequences when congress and the administration ignore basic economics and plow through trillions of dollars in poorly targeted spending even as the economy is recovering mr riedel in your research have you encountered similar anecdotes and since we're talking about infrastructure in housing is paying people not to work helping those people's prospects for housing security in the long run uh you you are muted sir i knew it would happen thank you for the question i mean the history of anti-poverty programs shown that you have to be very careful with incentives a lot you know the only ftc program was notorious for having huge extensive effects against working because the phase out rate was so steep even even people on the right and left agree that was poorly designed in terms of unemployment benefits the the average unemployment benefit right now is about a hundred percent of the wage replenishment for the average unemployed worker now that's not bad when the unemployment rate is is 14 and we're paying people to stay home and we don't want people to work the danger is as soon as the economy reopens as it's starting to as soon as people start to go back to work as soon as people get their pandemic shots all of a sudden when you want people to go back to work having that 100 wage replacement from unemployment benefits will all of the sudden create a cliff i don't think it was a big problem when we didn't want people to work but very quickly or i think we're going to see over the next couple months it's going to become a problem when the economy reopens and individuals see that the marginal additional wage of working is at least in the short term so just reclaiming my time and i only have a minute left but look i think that the best way we can help people have long-term sustainable uh non-subsidized housing is to make sure that they have wage growth and increasing taxes and reversing the the positive benefits of the tax cuts and jobs act where we saw in the first two years after the tax cuts real median household income increased 4 900 employment surged especially among the long-term unemployed poor and minorities wealth for the bottom fifty percent of household households advanced three times as fast as the top one percent average median income increased six point eight percent why would we reverse that when we were actually helping people achieve their own housing and be able to afford their own housing without relying on the government and it just seems totally counter-intuitive to me that we would reverse the progress we've made that actually help people in the lower uh echelons of the income scale and i yield back

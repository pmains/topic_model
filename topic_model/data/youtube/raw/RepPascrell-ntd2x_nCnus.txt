>>> FORMER FIRST LADY LAURA BUSH IS OUT WITH AN OP-ED IN THE  "WASHINGTON POST" WRITING IN  PART, QUOTE, I LIVE IN A BORDER  STATE. APPRECIATE THE NEED TO ENFORCE  AND PROTECT OUR INTERNATIONAL  BOUNDARIES BUT THIS  ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICY IS CRUEL. IT IS IMMORAL AND IT BREAKS MY  HEART. OUR GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT BE IN  THE BUSINESS OF WAREHOUSING  CHILDREN IN CONVERTED BOX STORES OR MAKING PLANS TO PLACE THEM IN TENT CITIES IN THE DESERT  OUTSIDE OF EL PASO. THESE IMAGES ARE EERILY  REMINISCENT OF THE JAPANESE  AMERICAN INTERNMENT CAMPS OF  WORLD WAR II. AMERICANS PRIDE OURSELVES ON  BEING A MORAL NATION. IF WE ARE TRULY THAT COUNTRY  THEN IT IS OUR OBLIGATION TO  REUNITE THESE DETAINED CHILDREN  WITH THEIR PARENTS AND TO STOP  SEPARATING PARENTS AND CHILDREN  IN THE FIRST PLACE.CENTLY COLLE  THAT WHILE THERE WERE BEDS,  TOYS, CRAYONS, A PLAYGROUND AND  DIAPER CHANGES THE PEOPLE  WORKING AT THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED NOT TO PICK UP OR  TOUCH THE CHILDREN TO COMFORT  THEM. IMAGINE NOT BEING ABLE TO PICK  UP A CHILD WHO IS NOT YET OUT OF DIAPERS. SO I'D ASK SOME FOLKS IN THE  MEDIA, I TWEETED DIRECTLY AT ONE HOST, TO THINK ABOUT THIS OP-ED  BEFORE YOU TALK ABOUT ANYTHING  ABOUT THIS POLICY. NOT THE PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THE POLICY. TALK ABOUT THE POLICY AND TELL  US WHAT YOU REALLY THINK OF IT. JOINING US NOW, WE HAVE  DEMOCRATIC REPRESENTATIVE BILL  PASCRELL AND HAKEEM JEFFRIES. THEY WERE PART OF A GROUP OF  LAWMAKERS WHO WENT TO A  DETENTION FACILITY IN NEW JERSEY FOR AN UNANNOUNCED INSPECTION TO SPEAK WITH ASYLUM SPEAKERS WHO  HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM THEIR  CHILDREN. LOVE TO HEAR WHAT YOU HEARD FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW. >> GOOD MORNING, IT WAS HARD  HEARTBREAKING EMOTIONAL  EXPERIENCE WHEN WE ARRIVED. IT TOOK ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF BEFORE WE WERE ABLE TO VISIT  WITH THE DETAINEES, NOT  WITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT WE  HAVE PRIOR LEGAL AUTHORIZATION  FROM THEIR ATTORNEYS AND FROM  THESE INDIVIDUALS THEMSELVES TO  MEET WITH US, BUT WHEN WE HAVE  THE OPPORTUNITY TO FINALLY  ENGAGE WITH THEM, IT WAS SEVEN  MEMBERS OF CONGRESS LED BY  CONGRESSMAN JERRY NADLER  INCLUDING BILLY PASCRELL, WHAT  WAS AMAZING ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE IS THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS HAD  HAD YOUNG CHILDREN, IN ONE CASE  A SON WHO WERE RIPPED AWAY THEM  FROM THEM FIVE YEARS OLD, SEVEN  YEARS OLD, 12 YEARS OLD EVEN  THOUGH THEY HAD COME TO THE  BORDER SEEKING POLITICAL ASYLUM, BECAUSE THEY HAD A CREDIBLE FEAR OF PERSECUTION BACK HOME.  >> WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO MAKE  THIS TRIP? >> WELL, WE DECIDED TO MAKE THE  TRIP TO SEE FOR OURSELVES, LET'S GO THERE WHICH WE USUALLY DO,  WE'RE THE FIRST RESPONDERS, AND  WE WEREN'T SHOCKED. WHEN YOU'RE LISTENING TO IT,  WHEN YOU'RE HEARING FROM THE  EMOTION FROM FATHERS ON FATHER'S DAY YOU HAVE TO SIT BACK AND YOU HAVE TO LISTEN AND YOU HAVE TO  REACH OUT AND TRY TO BE OF SOME  COMFORT TO THE INDIVIDUAL. WE FEEL VERY STRONGLY ANT THIS,  AND I WANT TO REVERSE THE TERM,  MIKA, THE TERM THAT THEY'VE USED AND THAT IS ZERO TOLERANCE. WE HAVE ZERO TOLERANCE FOR THIS, I WANT YOU TO KNOW THIS. THERE WERE SEVEN OF US WHO WERE  THERE. WE HAVE ZERO TOLERANCE. WE'RE GOING TO USE THAT TERM  OVER AND OVER AGAIN. WE CANNOT ALLOW THIS TO GO ON. THE ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS THAT  WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE, THOSE  FOLKS CAME OUT STRONGLY. CHURCH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE COME  OUT VERY STRONGLY. EVEN PART OF THE EVANGELICAL  COMMUNITY SEES THIS AS AN  ENVELOPE PUSHED TOO FAR. WE CAN'T ACCEPT THIS AS  AMERICANS. WE CAN'T JUST TALK ABOUT IT. WE'VE SENT A LETTER, I'VE SENT A LETTER TO RODNEY FRELINGHUYSEN  WHO IS THE CHAIRMAN OF  APPROPRIATIONS. YOU BETTER NOT ALLOW MONEY FROM  THE APPROPRIATIONS TO GO TO ANY  OF THESE BECAUSE IF WE CONTINUE  TO FUND THEM, THAT I'LL CONTINUE TO GROW AND THAT'S WHAT I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT RIGHT NOW. THE PRESIDENT HAS TO STEP UP TO  THE PLATE, HE HAS TO DO HIS JOB  FOR CHANGE.  >> THANK YOU FOR GOING AND  BEARING WITNESS TO THIS MORAL  OUTRAGE. THIS IS HORRIFIC, I CAN'T  BELIEVE THIS IS HAPPENING IN  AMERICA, THAT WE'RE USING  CHILDREN AS POLITICAL PAWNS FOR  A BORDER WALL. WHAT CAN AMERICANS DO, REACH OUT TO OUR CONGRESS, CONGRESSIONAL  REPRESENTATIVES, BUT WHAT CAN WE DO TO STOP THIS AS QUICKLY AS  POSSIBLE? >> A GREAT QUESTION. THE PRESIDENT WILL BE ON THE  HILL THIS WEEK MEETING WITH OUR  COLLEAGUES ON THE REPUBLICAN  SIDE OF THE AISLE. IF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE REACH OUT TO ALL OF THEIR REPRESENTATIVES  IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE AND  EXPRESS THE SHEER OUTRAGE AT THE NOTION OF A POLICY BEING PUT  INTO PLACE BY OUR GOVERNMENT  THAT'S UNCONSCIONABLE,  UNACCEPTABLE, UN-AMERICAN  HOPEFULLY WE'LL SEE MY  COLLEAGUES COMMUNICATE TO THE  PRESIDENT THAT THIS IS NOT  ACCEPTABLE AND THE PRESIDENT CAN END THIS TODAY WITH A PHONE CALL TO HIS SO-CALLED BELEAGUERED  ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYING ENOUGH. THIS ENDS.  >> THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT  THINGS GOING ON. YOU MENTIONED THERE ARE PEOPLE  THAT CROSS THE BORDER ILLEGALLY  AT AN UNRECOGNIZED BORDER  CROSSING PLACE CARRYING THE KID  ARRESTED AS A MISDEMEANOR  BECAUSE IT'S A FIRST OFFENSE OR  FELONY IF IT'S ANOTHER OFFENSE. THEN PEOPLE COME TO THE BORDER  AT AN APPROPRIATE BORDER  CROSSING AND REQUEST ASYLUM  BECAUSE OF FEAR OF PERSECUTION  OR VIOLENCE. THESE ARE TWO DIFFERENT  PROCEDURES SO WHAT WE ARE BEING  TOLD, ALTHOUGH IT SEEMS TO BE  ENTIRELY ANECDOTAL A IS THAT  THERE ARE PEOPLE BEING CAUGHT IN THE DRAGNET WHO ARE FOLLOWING  THE LAW. THEY COME, THEY REQUEST ASYLUM,  THEY HAVE A KID WITH THEM AND  YET THIS IS STILL HAPPENING. IS. YOU WERE TOLD THEY HAD FOLLOWED  THE RULES, GOT ARRESTED AND HAD  THEIR KID TAKEN FROM THEM  ANYWAY.  >> THAT'S RIGHT. AS SESSIONS SAID WE'RE NOT GOING TO ACCEPT ASYLUM FROM FOLKS WHO  ARE UNDER TREMENDOUS PRESSURE  THROUGH GANGS OR THE GOVERNMENT  THEMSELVES. THAT'S WHY THEY LEFT. FEAR OF THEIR OWN SECURITY. WE WON'T ACCEPT THOSE PEOPLE. WE WON'T LISTEN TO THEM. LISTEN TO THESE PEOPLE. WE DIDN'T SEPARATE THEM FROM  THEIR CHILDREN, THAT'S THE ONE  THING WE DIDN'T DO. THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION FOR  THAT WHATSOEVER. WHAT POLITICAL REND WE LOOKING  FOR HERE? WHAT'S THE END GAME? >> WELL I HAVE A COUPLE IDEAS ON THAT.  >> THIS IS ONE CENTER IN NEW  JERSEY AND THERE ARE MULTIPLE  CENTERS IN THE U.S. THAT  REPORTERS HAVEN'T BEEN ALLOWED  ACCESS TO, I BELIEVE REPORTERS  HAVE BEEN ALLOWED ACCESS TO TWO  CENTERS SO THOSE HAVE BEEN  CHERRY PICKED AND ARE THE BEST  CASE SCENARIO AND YET THE  PICTURES AND IMAGES ARE STILL  HORRIFYING. WHERE ARE THE YOUNG CHILDREN. WHERE ARE THE GIRLS? >> THE THREE INDIVIDUALS WHO WE  MET WITH WHO ARE APPREHENDED ON  THE SOUTHERN BORDER, THOUGH THEY VOLUNTARILY TURNED THEMSELVES IN SEEKING POLITICAL ASYLUM HAD NO  IDEA WHERE THEIR CHILDREN WERE. SOME OF WHOM HAD BEEN IN THIS  DETENTION CENTER FOR MONTHS. AND IT DIDN'T SEEM AS IF ANY OF  THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE  RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR  QUOTE/UNQUOTE CARE IN THAT  FACILITY HAD ENDEAVORED TO TRY  TO FIGURE THAT OUT. THERE WAS ONE INDIVIDUAL, A  FATHER, WHO HAD HIS DAUGHTER  TORN AWAY FROM HIM AT 3:00 A.M.  IN THE MORNING WHO FELL DOWN TO  HIS KNEES, AS HE COMMUNICATED TO US, BEGGING FOR THEM NOT TO TAKE HER AWAY AS SHE WAS CRYING. THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO FLED ONE OF THE MOST VIOLENT NATIONS IN THE  WORLD IN CENTRAL AMERICA, AS  OTHERS HAD, BECAUSE A GANG  SHOWED UP EARLIER IN THE DAY  LOOKING FOR HIS DAUGHTER AT THE  SCHOOL AND HE DECIDED AT THAT  POINT THAT WAS ENOUGH. HE WAS GOING TO TAKE THIS RISKY  JOURNEY IN ORDER TO SAVE HIS  CHILD AND WE KNOW THAT MOTHERS  ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHO HAVE  BEEN APPREHENDED ON THE SOUTHERN BORDER HAVE DONE THE SAME THING. >> SO, AGAIN, IMPORTANT TO KEEP  TO THE FACTS. WE APPRECIATE YOU ALL GOING AND  GETTING FIRSTHAND ACCOUNTS. DEFINITELY QUEUE UP JEFF  SESSIONS'S BITE IN APRIL WHERE  HE ANNOUNCED THIS POLICY  HIMSELF, THIS POLICY IS BROUGHT  FORWARD BY THE TRUMP  ADMINISTRATION AND ANNOUNCED BY  THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. YOU WILL HEAR OTHERWISE FROM THE PRESIDENT AT TIMES BLAMING IT ON DEMOCRATS. IT'S NOT POLITICS, IT'S A LIE. CONGRESSMAN BILL PASCRELL AND  HAKEEM JEFFRIES, THANK YOU SO  MUCH. APPRECIATE IT.  >>> OUR NEXT GUEST HAS SERVED IN THE LAST THREE REPUBLICAN  ADMINISTRATIONS AND SAYS THE  POLITICAL DIVISIONS IN THIS  NATION WILL ONLY GET WORSE AFTER BOB MUELLER RELEASES HIS  OBSTRUCTION REPORT. PETE WAINER JOINS THE DISCUSS  NEXT. >> IF YOU CROSS THE BORDER  UNLAWFULLY THEN WE WILL  PROSECUTE YOU. IT'S THAT SIMPLE. IF YOU ARE SMUGGLING A CHILD  THEN WE WILL PROSECUTE YOU. AND THAT CHILD M

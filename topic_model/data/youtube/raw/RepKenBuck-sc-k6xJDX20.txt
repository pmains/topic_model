this is a particularly exciting panel which is going to be run in two parts we are going to have first a chat uh we representative comeback uh Colorado from the U.S Congress he has played a particular role I have to say in the U.S discourse in recent years as a as a as a republican really being aware of the issues and the problems that are associated with the rise of big digital companies the implications that this has for Democratic discourse in the end so Ken is also been someone who has been pushing legislation in various forms and and we'll talk about that and he will be in conversation with Marco and city of Harvard Business School and then we'll broaden the discussion to the rest of the panel which contains a combination of lawmakers we have Attorney General of Texas and enforcers and opinion makers and various other very attractive characters so let me start with with you too the title of this is online homes Ai and democracy and uh can to start with you you have been uh really very much of this a center stage in the in the the attempt in the U.S to bring forward uh some form of regulation of digital that was meaningful there have been as we know multiple attempts to Just Launch bills you yourself have been associated with sponsoring important bills uh some have come through particularly the venue bill but substantively not much has happened relative to Europe and we'll talk about it in a moment but I wanted to start this discussion with your sense for uh well we kind of know why but where is this discussion on regulation potentially going in the U.S is it still very much who knows up in the air it will never happen because lobbying is too great or what is your sense for where this might go first thank you very much for inviting me and having me and and second uh one of the first things I learned in public life was never to speak mid-afternoon because everybody falls asleep so I hope everyone here has had plenty of uh caffeine because it's very difficult to make antitrust interesting um without caffeine much less mid-afternoon so um let me go let me take a step back if I can Christine and just talk about what happened in the last Congress and then where things probably will go the the last Congress uh was very interesting we passed six antitrust bills from the Judiciary Committee in the house David sicilini absolute Superstar I will miss him uh while we are different on 99 of the issues that we Face we had a lot of uh Synergy on on and I trust and did a lot of great work together but those six bills did not hit the floor for one very simple reason we had the votes on the Republican side we had the votes on the Democrat side there was there was great bipartisanship and there rarely is in in this day and age but there was great bipartisan ship didn't hit the the floor because of Nancy Pelosi speaker Pelosi the same happened in the Senate great bipartisanship with Senator Klobuchar and Senator Lee a number of uh Democrat Senators Republican Senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee were moving bills didn't hit the senate floor for one very simple reason Senator Schumer and they it wasn't because we didn't have the better argument we did have the better argument and that's why we got such broad bipartisan support and it wasn't because we didn't have popular support we did have popular support the the Grassroots in America is absolutely in favor of competition and they feel um that there is something and I'm going to use a phrase from my daughter that I'm looking around the room and very few of you have the same color hair that I have but but she says Dad it's creepy so that's her technical term in the antitrust world for lack of competition and it's just plain creepy when I go and look for a pair of cowboy boots and for three weeks every time I turn on my computer there's an advertisement for a pair of cowboy boots or I drive by a Ford store after I'm looking for a pickup truck and they're following me in every way possible and I'm turning off all those tracking devices it's just creepy and so Americans understand that and they want change but these companies spent tens of millions of dollars in the political system they didn't darken my doorway but they did in a number of areas they didn't move the the norm the the sort of uh Rank and file members of the house or Senate but they certainly moved leadership now I've taken my shot at Democrats let me take my shot at Republicans the current Administration with Kevin McCarthy and Jim Jordan is uh chairman of the Judiciary Committee will do absolutely nothing and and they'll do nothing and it's to me as a republican it's a disgrace because we are constantly I've said it a thousand times and I've heard it ten thousand times we want strict constructionists on the bench we don't want the Judiciary uh making law we want them interpreting law and then at the same time my my colleagues a couple of my colleagues are saying well let the marketplace deal with this we don't need to interfere with with Congress so if you say the courts shouldn't do anything and if you say the legislative brand shouldn't do anything what you're saying is we don't want anything to happen and and that comes from a whole lot of money being put into a whole lot of pockets and and that's just plain wrong again they don't win ideologically they don't win with popular support they win because they are making such gross amounts of money that they can buy the system fortunately I'm not going to make this a Debbie Downer moment for everybody but fortunately there is good news and and the good news is the Texas Attorney General uh sitting over there I just want to make clear if there are any cameras in the room that he is to the left of me um but uh it is uh it is real important we were able to pass a bill that uh empowered uh the attorney generals to keep cases in their own District they were always getting moved to the backyard of uh these big tech companies in in Silicon Valley we were able to make sure that we got some more resources for the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission so those things going forward we we hope there is more enforcement activity unfortunately it will be a very big uh challenge for us to get more done in this Congress especially with David leaving the U.S house there is a chance that we could get one or two bills done and everyone's going to say well tell us what those one or two bills are the one bill that I think is the the most uh deals with the most egregious conduct is what I call the ad Tech Bill and that is to make sure that Google can't control all three sides of the digital advertising world and and that's a bill that we will focus on the other two bills are sort of the non-discrimination bill and it affects a number of these tech companies or the um uh the uh sort of the platform bill that Marcia Blackburn has with with Amy Klobuchar but I think those two are the uh two of the bills that that may pass um if we can do enough of the procedural uh maneuvering to get those passed the nice thing about having a five vote majority in the U.S house is uh leadership knows they need those five votes they didn't have them for the speaker race and so that took many many hours and it was a clear message that we hopefully can get get some things done like that so you have been concerned about on fair business practices of big Tech but also very prominently about uh issues of accountability and transparency and you have a book which is uh out there as well on the particular effect and the concerns you have around discourse and Democratic discourse and so there's a current case or recent case in front of the Supreme Court or article 230 which is being debated on a responsibility of platforms ultimately we are all watching Twitter descend with movie Fascination into some sort of chaos so um I know this is a concern of yours and we'll talk about AI in a second but just give us again a sense for what the main focus and how do you think this this fight against uh particularly Google but others too takes the form of the pro-democracy fight in your mind so for for me what convinced me that this was a an essential issue is speech um in a democracy if one company controls 94 of the searches online that company controls the flow of information if it controls the flow of information it has an undue influence on elections um and I I believe that it it had an influence on elections and I believe that given its Morality In how it conducted itself and I'm talking about Google I'm not trying to mince words here uh in in the whole legislative process that they will continue to act that way and do everything they can to maintain their Monopoly we can't allow that we have to have competition in the search Marketplace and it is essential that we move in that direction the same is true with the phone platforms the same is true with the uh since since more and more of the world is getting their news through streaming rather than cable and more old-fashioned methods we need to make sure that there are streaming services and and not controlled by just a few companies so in my view the democratization issue is the key issue in all of this and I think it is the issue that really appeals to both sides of the political Spectrum the most and now there's a new kid on the Block in some sense right there is AI we've been also following this uh very recent Surge and the concern inevitably is is that going to make things worse I know this is something you ask yourself and immediately in this context people think how should we deal with this so I'd like you to start on this and then pass on to Marco who is a professor at HBS and somebody who has worked on AI quite closely but I'd like to see you too take it away a bit sure so in my view AI artificial intelligence machine learning the whole group has the potential to open up uh search search being the most profitable of what these platforms do perhaps Bing is more competitive with Google down the road as a result of AI perhaps not but AI could be in in first of all let me just say we can't lose to China when it comes to AI we can't over regulate and not innovate at the same time we can't have a lack of competition and not innovate China is not a country that shares our values and as we have seen with Russia recently and and there will be three hot spots in the world in the next three or four years we cannot allow that to happen so I think we have to have an eye towards how do we make sure that we uh support the development of AI in a safe way and with with not that these companies necessarily share our values but they share our values better than some of the countries that would like to use AI for the various nefarious purposes so I think that AI has a lot of potential to do great things in health care and so many other areas but as it pertains to search we need to make sure that we do have competition with AI so that it is something that helps us in terms of spreading information in in the country great comments in in really good thoughts and and uh it's an interesting time to be doing this right now because I feel like we've really had a major moment uh in the history of technology in the history of AI specifically when um Chad gbt3 was introduced November 30th of this year uh in a period of about two months it signed down about 100 million users which is an incredible uh increase it's just mind-blowing increase and uh it is really a major change in how AI is structured how it works what it does is potential for both good and bad right so the game has just changed and I think they will remember this time a little bit like maybe how we remembered you know when Mark andreasen introduced Mosaic and back those days in 93 and 94 and Netscape and and all of that it's really going to change the game around AI uh why because it's really different uh traditional AI has been set up in a very specific way so machine learning works on very specific use cases like we were talking about agriculture this morning so one of my favorite ones actually is in the in agriculture this was actually done in China so but yeah no further comments on that but basically it's it's a it's a system to ensure pigs apparently they have a lot of pigs and they need to be in short and it turns out you can use AI for example to do facial recognition on pigs very exciting application and so how do you do that well you get a lot of pig faces and you train the AI and what the eye can do is the basically it fulfilled that purpose and does that specifically and it works well and you can kind of automate the process recognizing Pigs by humans is hard and so it's a nice thing yeah it does that so but machine learning fundamentally is a huge variety of these very narrow use cases that in some ways are a little scary because they can replace what humans do but typically recognizing pigs is not your ideal job and so many of these things are not are not uh are not that exciting now generative AI is fundamentally different right because we're talking about General artificial intelligence and so these um these algorithms are powerful enough that they can simulate many different things that humans do and so it's fundamentally it's almost like a philosophical uh change right and how do you feel about this um uh to the extent that we're getting close on things like the touring test and stuff like that these things are pretty human including the fact that they cheat and they lie and all kinds of things um and it's an interesting moment um because again it's like there's a whole new range of things that will change as a function of this now is it going to be one question maybe to just Tee It Up uh two more quick points but one of them is is it going to be pro-competitive or not and that's an interesting question AI traditionally has all been about data and you have the right data and how much data do you have and all that generative AI is also about data but all the data that gets ingested by these massive algorithms is public pretty much at least so far we you know we're ingesting Wikipedia we're ingesting all this copyrighted things that people are having all kinds of concerns about and things like that but basically you're just taking all the stuff that's up on the world wide web and sticking it into training algorithm which then is so highly trained that it can solve a broad variety of problems essentially and so it's kind of an interesting it's an interesting thing so so data itself it's not really a barrier because it's out there uh the barrier has shifted over to in many ways compute capacity so it took a billion dollars to train chat chippy T3 that's a lot of compute capacity and so we're going back to basically almost like a traditional scale barrier which could concentrate the markets uh but it's not going to be the kind of non-linear Network effect like thing with the winner to call outcome um so from that person so it's kind of interesting so we do have definitely Dynamics there and uh Christina so so how do you see how do you see a potential regulatory effort in that direction where should it be focused or legislative yeah so so yes it's an interesting so part of this is also understanding where this thing is going to go right because we're just at the beginning we have a clunky browser you know like back in the days of you know 94 and 95 when you're browsing the web and it was all pretty clunky and messy uh this is sort of Chachi T right now is powerful but it's just the beginning this thing's this thing is going to get better by you know six orders of magnitude like if you look at sort of how much the technology is going to progress the hardware behind it as well as the extent to which the algorithms and themselves uh will will progress over time in the learning curves around all that so this thing is going to get a lot better so right now it's pretty good already in the criticize plenty uh but the in the future is going to get interesting there's going to be two levels of this you're going to have platforms and you have applications right kind of like a lot of things all digital things these days and so there's going to be a few platforms um I believe you're going to have a lot of the traditional players there um uh hopefully not too many but enough not too many because we can know who they are and regulate them and if you want accountability and transparency that's a good thing to have because you go in and and you know make sure that these things are being used in a way that is um you know from regulatory perspective reasonable on top of that you're going to have millions of people writing applications of these things and already this is starting to happen so half of Y combinator this year is about generative AI applications just to give you a sense so we're talking about already hundreds of companies essentially being started around this in more going forward but surely there is a concern and I'm going to pass on to to Ken and then move on about you know we need to think about an AI gate gatekeeping problem I mean this is not this is not easy and it is not sounding that uh that reassuring frankly Marco I am not saying it is never said it was a good thing it's just happened I hope Marco that I'm not the first person that the AI um confuses uh the facial recognition with a pig yeah no no no no it's undoubtedly going to happen I just don't want to be that person um but I I do think the the really interesting issue is that uh in order to be successful in AI you need to have massive Computing ability you need to have a massive database and there's only a few companies in the world that can that can create that and so we're not really talking about fixing the competition problem we might be talking about instead of one having two or three but we're not talking about 10 Airlines or or you know 20 car makers well like how many would you like to have right so in a sense because like you're stuck between on the one hand you need to have enough so you have a competitive environment you don't have so many so you can't regulate and you can't really have transparency you don't want to have a thousand of these because then it would be a nightmare to figure out all the different things that are going on and so uh you're kind of stuck between sort of the National Security and making sure that these things are being used in a way that is possible to regulate and something that becomes anti-competitive and one of the things that will happen is that the the barriers to entry will go down so from the perspective of investment that's going to come down now the models are going to get more complex and so it's a moving Target right but I still don't find that reassuring two or three um Let me let me just shift slightly to to your left and um

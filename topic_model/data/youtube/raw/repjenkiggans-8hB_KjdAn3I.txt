today President Biden will be coming to my district Virginia's second congressional district it's honored to be able to host him here but I really wish the purpose of his visit was Les partisan he's coming here today to pit Republicans and Democrats against each other on the issue of health care and I'm a geriatric nurse practitioner I've had the honor and privilege of taking care of our greatest Generation for many years proudly providing them with Quality Health Care they deserve as they get older they've spent their entire lives paying into programs like Social Security and Medicare with the promise that the government would pay them back one day and that's a promise that I intend to keep as the only geriatric nurse practitioner in Congress I certainly know how important these programs are to our seniors unlike the president who has proposed cutting Medicare and Social Security in the past my Republican colleagues and I have no plans to cut benefits for anyone who's receiving or is eligible for receiving these benefits that's why I'm fighting to preserve them Healthcare should never be a partisan issue and I certainly didn't come to Washington to play politics I'm laser focused on solutions for providing quality accessible and Affordable Health Care to all Americans and especially for those in my district and those in our greatest Generation I hope the president will decide to switch gears today and will work with Republicans to find those practical bipartisan Solutions because I stand ready to work with him and any of my colleagues to get the job done

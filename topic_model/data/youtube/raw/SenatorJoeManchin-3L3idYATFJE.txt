this is this is the most beautiful right that we have as as living in a free country such as America being able to defend and protect the Constitution be able to exercise our right and if you have any differences you might have in your political philosophy this is where you make the changes not on social media not on Twitter not on all this and not on this this uh this violence of that we see in our society today that's not where you cure the problems that you disagree with in the political Arena this is where you do it at the polling place so I hope people take a chance take an opportunity go in and make your voice heard and if there's someone who's doesn't believe the same as you do or political differences go in and vote against them vote for somebody else and if there's someone you really like what they've been doing go vote for them that's what it's about and talk about what's it mean to come back to your hometown oh it's always good to come home it's always good I mean there's no place like home as they say and I mean that but all of West Virginia has been so good to me and I've had so many opportunities but I take it seriously about you know representing everybody Democrats Republicans Independents people to vote for you people that vote against you when you take that oath of office you take an oath of office that you're going to represent the entire population basic constituents that you have I have the entire state of West Virginia I'm looking out for every day and I don't really elections people that support you people don't support you you go through this process even people that run against you those are all people that you're still going to represent and you it's not personal the only thing's personal is my family other than that my country and my family but other than that everything else I understand you everybody has different opinions I respect that and I only think I think is I owe you an answer if you ask me a question and how I what I think about this subject or that subject I've got to give you a process of how I came to a conclusion I believe I I that's my responsibility I owe it to all of you if I don't do that then I haven't done my job if I just think well he just vote in politics it's just because of politics no it's not there should be a rational reason why I support something or don't you might disagree with it but at least you know I want you to walk away and say I don't agree with that but at least I understand how he made that decision and I've always said if I can't come home where I am today and explain how I voted why I voted for something or against something if I can't go home and explain it I can't support it I can't vote it and I've always said this we're all a part of our environment I am who I am because of where I was raised how I was raised and who raised me I'm 10 miles down the road in little Farmington a little coal mining town beautiful little town and those people are still dear to me and I reflect back on my upbringing every day and every decision I make

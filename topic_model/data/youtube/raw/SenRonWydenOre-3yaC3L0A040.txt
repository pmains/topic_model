I senator Wyden has one last question that madam chair thank you for your courtesy imma be very very brief director clapper as you know the Supreme Court ruled last week that it was unconstitutional for federal agents to attach a GPS tracking device to an individual's car and monitor their movements 24-7 without a warrant because the chairs being very gracious I want to just do this briefly can you tell me as of now what you believe this means for the intelligence community number one and two would you be willing to commit this morning to giving me an unclassified response with respect to what you believe the law authorizes this goes to the point that you and I have talks are about and ask the question a secret law as you know I strongly feel that laws and their interpretations must be public and then of course the important work that all of your doing we very often have to keep that classified in order to protect secrets and the well-being of your capable staff so just two parts one what you think the law means as of now and will you commit to giving me an unclassified answer on the point of what you believe the law actually authorized sir what did the law the the judgment rendered was a court as you stated was in a law enforcement context we are now examining and the lawyers are what are the potential implications for intelligence you know foreign or domestic so that's that reading is of great interest to us and I'm sure we can share with you Bob would you want to add in one more point I need to make though in all of this we will we have and will continue abide by the Fourth Amendment okay Thank You manager thank you very much

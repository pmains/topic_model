welcome Miss Peters actually I find myself a bit mystified by the comments that Senator Durbin made earlier he talked about seeking stiffer penalties for prisoner abuse cases of course no prisoner should be abused and if a prison guard is found guilty of doing so after being afforded due process of law I favor them facing stiff penalties one of the main reasons we have posted penalty of course is because it has a deterrent effect and uh Senator Durbin and many of the other Democrats in this committee like Senator Booker seem to have a very selective view of when deterrence comes into play just yesterday in fact Senator Durbin blocked bills on the floor that would impose stiffer penalties for fentanyl which is poisoning children all across America bills that I offered bills that Senator Grassley offered Senator Booker has repeatedly offered or blocked my legislation that would permanently schedule fentanyl under the controlled substance act so our Democratic friends seem to have a very curious and selective view of when stiff penalties will have an actual deterrent effect now let me move on Miss Peters this is your first appearance for the committee since this is not a senate confirmed position um so I'd like to ask you a couple basic questions that uh nominees for the committee always get asked um I assume you would agree that it's important for you and executive branch officials to be responsive to requests from Congress for information yes sir and I would assume that you also agree that it's important for you an executive branch officials to be responsive to requests from the public if information is requested properly under the Freedom of Information Act is that correct that is correct well the reason I ask is that because at the beginning of the pandemic Congress passed the cares act the first major coronavirus response bill which gave temporary authority to the Bureau of Prisons to allow some inmates to serve out part of their sentences at home until the pandemic ended or until the availability vaccines meant that prisoners could again be housed in a secure location but jailbreak activists to include so-called Progressive criminal justice reformers asked the Biden Administration to twist the law and have the bureau use the pandemic as an excuse to release as many inmates as possible and never returned them to prison and to finish their sentences after the pandemic ended I know that this was before you started but it was public reported that those jailbreak activists asked the Department of Justice to rewrite the law to achieve their soft on crime goals now the department is proposing a new rule that would give the Bureau of Prisons authority to release tens of thousands of additional criminals and not require them to serve their sentences this would not only be an enormous mistake in the middle of a crime wave it would also be illegal in January I sent attorney general Merrick Garland a letter to provide the exact same information that he would be required by law to provide any interested member of the public that is written copies of communications and meeting records between the Biden Administration and these jailbreak activists where they discuss policy this week more than eight months later one of the Attorney General's underlings finally sent a cursory response providing exactly none of that information I say this simply as a cautionary Tale I hope that you'll be more responsive than the Attorney General who has politicized the department who seems unable to stand up to far left-wing activists in his own department and to enforce the law neutrally at the same time that he sicks the feds on parents at school boards or send armed agents into a Catholic Minister's home a man named Matt Hoke when he had agreed already to cooperate with any investigation into his supposed crimes now the Attorney General is going to have a reckoning whenever he faces a republican Congress in January I hope though that you will simply cooperate with timely requests for information from members of Congress and from the public now miss Peters On a related point I I want to note that the president said just a couple weeks ago the pandemic is over it's President Biden wrong thank you Senator I appreciate the cautionary tale about being responsive we certainly want to be as responsive as we can at the Bureau of Prisons to both members of Congress requests and also that of the general public as we pivot out of the pandemic and really focus on kind of a future State as it relates to the pandemic we do have that rule under review that will give the bureau guidance on those individuals that were released on Home Care confinement we're hoping to see what that rule looks like here in the coming weeks and I look forward to reviewing it when it's finalized so miss Peters is the is the president wrong is the pandemic over or not over Senator I am not a health professional I would not be able to make that it's part of your job as the Director of the bureaus to ensure that our prisons can adapt to pandemic conditions do you know how many how many criminals are currently serving their senates at home who should be in the prison I don't I don't have that number in front of me it's uh it's over 11 000. that includes 647 gun criminals bomb makers and other weapons criminals 13 murderers five thousand eight hundred seventy drug traffickers are you certain that not a single one of those criminals who are serving their senates at home are currently engaged in criminal activity thank you Senator I could never make that a certain determination I don't think any I don't think anyone could in fact I'm pretty certain that at least one of them is probably a lot of them thanks Miss Peter welcome Miss Peters actually I find myself a bit mystified by the comments that Senator Durbin made earlier he talked about seeking stiffer penalties for prisoner abuse cases of course no

thank you Senator I could never make that a certain determination I don't think anyone I don't think anyone could in fact I'm pretty certain that at least one of them is probably a lot of them thanks Miss Peter thank you senator Mr chairman my friend Tom Cotton mentioned my name may I make a small response without objection um so first of all I don't object to scheduling temp fentanyl has been scheduled for it is scheduled you're talking about Fentanyl analogs and we should be specific about that the scientific Community has said we should test things before we schedule them but you've actually won for the last four years fentanyl analogs have been temporarily scheduled so what you're saying is not true and the second thing I want to say is four years of doing what you want to do which is permanently scheduling four years of scheduling Fentanyl has actually not seen the response that we want we are in this nation seeing this overwhelming fentanyl crisis and Mr chairman we're trying to just do the same things we've been doing that cause mass incarceration in the first place but didn't actually make us safer as we've seen with a problem with fentanyl so I'm happy to work on a real solution right now again for the record fentanyl is scheduled fentanyl analogs are scheduled and the crisis is getting worse so we know there are a lot of things we could be doing to solve this problem but having people beat their chest to try to create more and higher mandatory minimums or more and more scheduling with things already done that's just posturing what we need to do is solve this crisis in America and come together in a bipartisan way to make this nation safer and not not to rhetoric that's just not true when this nation already has fentanyl scheduling fentanyl analogs are scheduled but the problem is getting worse it's not just a permanent scheduling yesterday Senator Durbin block Center grassley's mere 14 month scheduling the simple fact of the matter is Democrats will not take this seriously unless they get something in return like more violent felons released from prison so I'm happy to have this debate on the floor later today I have a stack of letters right here from parents whose children were killed by fentanyl sent to Senator Booker and I'm more than happy to go to Florida and read those into the record if we want to again I'm sorry Mr but that's just not true this this partisan rhetoric this partisan Warfare that we all don't have people in all of our states who are dying from this crisis and so what he's asking for is already done we have fentanyl scheduled right now but more and more people are dying why can't we come together because there are a lot of Republican groups that I work with a lot of Republican think tanks that I work with that have real solutions to this crisis of people dying I would never accuse my colleague Tom Cotton of not caring about dead children we both have hearts I know your heart so to accuse me of that is outrageous I I literally run a city where people are dying from these drugs and all I hear often is the same things we've been doing for 25 years or on the drug war that just are increasing incarceration not helping we're going to hear from people here who are addicted let's find real solutions and stop accusing ourselves and partners in Warfare of things that just aren't true right now fentanyl is scheduled we've been extending that that scheduling over and over again but this problem is going worse I'd love to work with my colleagues on things that are actually going to solve the problem and not just the rhetoric that works good for partisan Left Right debates but doesn't work for actually saving the lives that we need to save I'm tired of this ridiculous partisanship let's solve problems and not stop accusing each other of not having Hearts you're a good man I'm a good man let's see if we can come together and actually solve some problems it didn't accuse you of anything in your heart I said the obvious and predictable consequences of the policies you and your party support are the fact that we are now at not mass incarceration but a 21-year low in the number of inmates in federal prisons we are not at a 21-year low in the number of overdoses in this country we are at record highs almost twice as many people die every single year as from drug overdoses as died in the Vietnam War and just look

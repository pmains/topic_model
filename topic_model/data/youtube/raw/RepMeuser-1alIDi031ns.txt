this is very much dr scissors would you say that in 2019 the us in texas okay having stable demand for domestic suppliers is a good way to do that and that might in this case it would make a lot of sense to purchase for a stockpile thank you thank you mr chairman thank you representative chair recognizes representative muser for five minutes thank you chairman uh thank you to our witnesses very much dr scissors would you say that in 2019 the u.s economy uh on a comparative basis so the rest of the world that we traded with was was doing well uh wow put me on the spot there sir i would say yes it was but i also see the seats for problem because we were borrowing too much money that's my own personal opinion fair our deficit did increase that year by uh 520 billion dollars um of course over the last couple of years we've uh we've we've you know we've had covet but i mean uh we're up uh six trillion i believe it is so a little bit a little bit more um in 2018 our gdp was 20 trillion our china trade deficit was 419. in 19 our gdp was 21. our china trade deficit was 319 in 2020 the year of covert we went down to 19 trillion in gdp 310 china trade deficit and in 21 we had an absolutely booming year 23 trillion with 344 trade deficits so what's interesting there is that uh the size of the increase four trillion dollars um nearly 20 percent but also the um the fact that we here we are thinking that we're buying everything necessarily from china and it went up relatively proportionately of course you got inflation in that in that gdp number and a tremendous amount of government spending so we know what where we are with outcomes you know i was in i was in the real world in business for uh 25 years um and there you you focus on outcomes uh not in pensions so you know what we have right here is we have enormous demand in certain sectors i'm not telling anybody anything they don't know consumer spending is very high we have incredible workforce shortages in rural areas and and throughout cities it exists so you gotta do is uh take a walk with me down main street and you'll hear every single business tell you that um now now in in china they had their shutdowns as well and that's primarily the reason that um we got you know so many uh cargo ships offshore but our domestic production clearly was was was dramatically reduced from furniture to bacon and you know that's why we have the type of inflation we haven't seen since 1982. so so why would you think that this administration would think it's a good idea because to me it's the worst time to increase government spending and and this is this is for uh mr mr she as well and perhaps the other witness i mean worse time to increase taxes worse time to uh to put down uh certain certain mandates on employment availability all right without doing it in a smart way particularly without doing any stockpiling of of testing here you have this huge test mandate you don't or you discuss it anyway it gets proven unconstitutional and then you don't even bother worrying about the supply um and so my question to you is um do you do you think the continued idea to continue to spend and increase taxes is uh the right way to go in this sort of environment no i definitely don't um i understand why people have a response to a crisis that they think in the short term what do we need to do right now this is urgent i get that and and we can have an argument over short-term policy but a long-term policy i i think we're in complete agreement sir um i would say as somebody who thinks about u.s economic competition versus china you don't want to win the debt race you don't want to be first in debt as we have discussed repeatedly in this hearing you do want to be first in innovation innovation does not solve all your problems but if you want to win an economic competition you want to be healthy economically you need to innovate and finally as you mentioned we need to train our workers um that that's you know we have a lot of people there's a you know thoughts that like people don't want to work anymore let's give them the skill level to get a job that they like better than the one they have or the one they don't want to apply to so i agree it's hard with a 50 000 annual uh cost for for college 50 thousand plus and i'd love to get the witnesses thoughts on the chips act because i certainly believe it's imperative important and necessary uh so maybe we could get to get that in a follow-up but i yield back mr chairman i understand my time's run out thank you representative chair recognized as representative tenney for five minutes uh thank you mr chairman and ranking member

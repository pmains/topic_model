right now somewhere on the streets of New York Miami or maybe a few blocks away from where we sit in Washington drug dealers are selling cocaine heroin or marijuana these drugs enter the United States through a wide open back door they didn't see it come across u.s. Mexico or northern border mr. Rodney Benson intelligence chief for the Drug Enforcement Agency so that larger and larger loads of both cocaine and heroin were transit transiting now staying in Puerto Rico and once these drugs are in Puerto Rico they can cross into our borders into the mainland this Caribbean region is America's third border an open door for drug traffickers and terrorists because Puerto Rico is a US territory illegal contraband that makes it to the island is unlikely to be subjected to further US customs inspections in route to the continental United States meaning it's easy easily mailed or placed on commercial aircraft without inspection in fy2011 165,000 metric tons of the illegal drugs were seized in the Caribbean Bahamas in Gulf of Mexico up some thirty six percent over four years up to eighty percent of the cocaine trafficking through Puerto Rico's directive directed to US East Coast cities the maritime smuggling routes widely used by international drug trafficking organizations in the 1980's the Miami Vice era are utilized more and more today these routes are a threat to America's national security the Caribbean region is also susceptible to smuggling nuclear radiological chemical and biological materials and it could be used as a staging area for violence against the United States in 1982 President Ronald Reagan said Puerto Ricans have borne the responsibilities of US citizenship with honor and courage for more than sixty four years they have fought beside us for decades and have worked beside us for generations President Reagan added that puerto rico strong tradition of democracy provides leadership and stability for the caribbean these statements also apply to the US Virgin Islands today that's stability in the millions of American citizens in the region are under siege and we have some mats to demonstrate the region that i'm referring to Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands close proximity to the continental United States and their lack of effective security infrastructure's make them an appealing gateway for drug cartels the Caribbean region is also experiencing an escalation and trafficking of persons and firearms as well as money laundering as these networks and drug routes evolve so do the potential links to terrorism and transnational crime and a ver on average one person is murdered on the island every 7.5 hours and at least half of those murders involved drug trafficking organizations last year there were 30 homicides for every 100,000 Puerto Ricans this rate is far higher than any state in the mainland drug shipments from locations including Haiti Colombia Venezuela and the Dominican Republic are transported to the islands onboard these fast boats and submersibles cargo has been dropped into obscure port locations or just simply unloaded in the water and flagged for later pick up these locations are so remote they can't take federal law enforcement officers hours to reach them the caribbean region drug trafficking organizations have proved flexible adaptable and can change routes quickly the US Postal Inspection Service seized hundreds of weapons hidden in packages postmarked for Puerto Rico including assault rifles ak-47s ar-15s armor penetrating cop-killer bullets and on jun 6 2012 the Drug Enforcement Agency arrested 36 people in a drug trafficking ring that used Puerto Rico's international airport in San Juan to smuggle large quantities of cocaine off the island aboard US bound passenger flights from san juan drugs were then flown to Miami Orlando and Newark the drug ring had operated for 10 years inside the San Juan Airport the Caribbean region has also has an active black market selling fraudulent documents according to the Department of State forty percent of identity fraud the United States involved birth certificates from Puerto Rico in January fifty people were charged with conspiring to sell the identities of hundreds of Puerto Ricans to illegal immigrants on the American mainland this was the largest single fraud case uncovered by Immigration and Customs Enforcement hundreds of birth certificates of security numbers and driver's license were sold for up to 25 hundred dollars a set James clapper the Director of National Intelligence recently testified that terrorists and insurgents will increasingly turn to crime and criminal networks for funding and logistics criminal connections and activities of Hezbollah and al-qaeda in the islamic maghreb illustrate this trim these criminal networks in the region could potentially be exploited by terrorists seeking to do us harm inside our borders this type of exploitation was evidenced in the forded plot to kill the Saudi ambassador in Washington the Iranian Kurds force attempted to solicit a Mexican drug cartel member to carry out this assassination plot and with slide fire we see look at the connection between President Ahmadinejad and Chavez in Venezuela Iran in the Bolivian States Venezuela Bolivia Ecuador and Nicaragua are major drug producers they bring a new set of threats to the Western Hemisphere as they work together with transnational organized crime enterprises and terrorist groups these threat posed include the potential for weapons of mass destruction related trafficking the American flag is flown over Puerto Rico for more than a century the people of the US virgin islands have been American citizens for a long time these islands are American soil and our fellow American citizens need our support now

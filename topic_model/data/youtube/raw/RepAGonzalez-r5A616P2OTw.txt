hello everybody Anthony Gonzalez here with our first weekly update of the year first off happy new year hope everybody enjoyed their Christmas holiday and is enjoying the new year so first week back in DC after the holiday season and it was a busy week first we were able to be at the White House for the signing of our battlefield cross bill which was an unbelievable honor you've heard me talk about the battlefield cross but before this was brought to my predecessor congressman Rene see by Elton Boyer down in Worcester to make sure that our battlefield crosses cannot be removed from our national cemeteries which had happened accidentally but it had happened and so we got that bill signed into law and that will make sure that those those crosses are there and so really excited about that and was an honor to be with President Trump to to sign that so that was outstanding secondly obviously the news of the week was was the strike in Iran I personally believe that this was perfectly justified so limini was the top terrorist in the world directly responsible for over 600 soldiers loss of lives countless injuries not to mention the death and destruction that he'd perpetuated across the entire Middle East destabilizing that region the top lieutenant for their regime of terror so I believe it was justified I was in the Intel briefing the evidence was presented with respect to the eminence it was pretty clear from my standpoint that they were escalating for months and building up to a final big attack which which we thwarted and I think that's great secondly I think there's there was a concern a big concern that this would lead to war I think the response that you saw from the Iranians suggests that they don't want a war either and that makes perfect sense because they would lose that war they cannot beat the United States in a war they simply cannot they don't have the firepower that the economy for that none of the people for it and so we don't want a war at all but they certainly don't and so I think the strike was justified I'm glad we did it and and I believe and that this will ultimately lead to to a better situation in the Middle East which has obviously been a quagmire for decades so with that thank you as always for Senna me and allow me to be a representative happy new year

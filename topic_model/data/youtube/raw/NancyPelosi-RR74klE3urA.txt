thank the gentleman for yielding and for his kind words and his great leadership on all of the issue of the issues that are important to America's working families Mr Speaker I came to the floor to talk about the balanced budget constitutional amendment but before I get into my comments specifically to the amendment I want to acknowledge that the distinguished chairman of the committee mr. Smith has talked about what the deficit was in 1995 and how much bigger it is now and the distinguished maker of this amendment of this resolution today mr. goodnight said about the problem of having such a big national debt recognizing those two facts i want to speak up about them first of all if this were just about talking about how we can reduce the deficit the best way to do that is job creation we know that if we want to talk about what happened in enough we have to reference the fact that under President Bill Clinton the debt that wasn't he inherited the reagan-bush deficit that he inherited he turned around and for the five of his last budgets of the Clinton budgets were in balance or were in surplus he put us on a trajectory he and the the growth of jobs in our country in the public and largely in the private sector took us to a path a trajectory of five point six trillion dollars in surplus along comes president george w bush and record time he reversed that it was the biggest turnaround fiscal biggest fiscal turnaround in our nation's history taking us to over five trajectory over five trillion dollars in deficit an 11 trillion dollar turn around two unpaid-for Wars said the CBO to seek congressional budget office the nonpartisan congressional congressional budget office said that was because of two unpaid wars the Bush tax cuts particularly at the high end which did not create jobs and a giveaway pharmaceutical bill to the pharmaceutical industry there was a three main reasons for the big fiscal turn around how we got deeply in debt I don't remember a lot of complaint coming from the Republican side of the aisle while President Bush was taking us down this path mr. good bite reference to paths well this is one path the President Bush took us down and so now we have to deal with that because the deficit is a concern to all of us we believe that the best way to deal with that is what President Clinton did to have a great economic agenda to generate jobs and here we are 320 days of the Republican majority early 300 days of their majority and they have taken no action on any serious job-creating bills here we go again debating legislation that will not create jobs in fact according to experts enactment of this proposal proposed amendment to our Constitution would destroy 15 million jobs double the unemployment rate caused the economy to shrink by seventeen percent as Bruce Bartlett a former economic advisor to President Ronald Reagan and President George Herbert Walker Bush said recently even if we were not in an economic crisis and fighting two wars a rapid cut in spending that of the magnitude would unquestionably throw the economy into recession just as it did in 1937 this legislation is an attack on our economy it is an attack on our seniors according to the nonpartisan said center on budget and policy priorities it could result in cuts over ten years of 750 billion dollars to Medicare and 1.2 trillion dollars in cuts to Social Security these cuts would be devastating to the 40 million seniors who rely on Medicare and Social Security every day they are even more draconian Merle rich draconian then the cuts in the Republican budget which effectively repeal the Medicare guarantee in just one week just one week after our nation celebrated Veterans Day we are debating potentially cutting 85 billion dollars over the next 10 years from veterans benefits despite the claims that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that this is not a clean balance but they claim it is a clean balanced budget amendment it is not because this proposed amendment to oxygen will require a supermajority in both chambers of Congress to raise the debt limit it puts the Full Faith and Credit of the United States of America in the hands of a minority this after we went through all of the stress and strain and uncertainty and a downgrading of our credit rating when we couldn't even get a majority and now we're thinking of a supermajority vote for the debt limit increase again that was never a requirement when President Bush was president that there would be a supermajority to to raise the debt limit this amendment promotes further brinksmanship and uncertainty and shrining extreme ideology into the Constitution at a time when Americans have been very clear that they expect us to set differences aside and to get to work there's our duty as members of Congress indeed we take the oath of office to be the elected guardians of our Constitution to protect and defend it to do no harm to our founding documents yet if this proposed amendment is adopted it will have far-reaching and adverse consequences mr. speaker with a Democratic president president clinton i repeat who balanced the budget in the 90s fault for five of his budgets were in balance or in surplus we can do it again without harming our Constitution eric economy our seniors or our veterans we must start by creating jobs and strengthen our economic growth the key to reducing the deficit it was interesting to me to hear others on the other side of I'll talk about our children our responsibility to them yes that's what we said when President Bush was amassing his deficit I didn't hear anyone on the other side of the aisle talking about that but this is about institution so we owe it to the vision of our founders the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform the aspirations of our children to get our economic and fiscal house in order this is the exact wrong way to do it we must reignite the American dream and we have work to do that so let's get to work to create jobs so many more people can achieve the American dream I had my colleagues to vote no and with that I yield back the balance of my time time the

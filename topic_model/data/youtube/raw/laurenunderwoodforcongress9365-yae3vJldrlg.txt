joining me now is Democratic congresswoman Lauren Underwood of Illinois who is also a nurse congresswoman Underwood as a nurse you have all of the the knowledge that we want as well as the burden of passing this rescue bill and knowing who it is coming in who it isn't covering first of all how are you doing and did you have to travel back from Illinois to get here just for this vote because of Republican objections to proxy voting well hi Andrea yes I came in from Illinois yesterday morning and I've been I treat this as an honor to be able to come to the floor to vote to extend additional support to so many hard-working entrepreneurs and small businesses our local farmers are going to be able to access the relief now and then there's additional money for hospitals or health providers and testing so this is really important and certainly worth the trip how do you feel about the fact that after promising that there would be yet you know another vote to help state and local governments that Mitch McConnell said never mind we're not doing that and suggested that states might have to go bankrupt you know Senator McConnell has an approach that doesn't really reflect the values that I have and certainly that we share in northern Illinois which is this we help our neighbors state and local governments are providing an incredibly important service during this time of real need listen we've had a hot spot in northern Illinois for a number of weeks and our local communities has stepped up big time our police and fire departments are the ones who are having the sacrifice if our state's and our local governments are forced to run out of money I mean I talked to mayors that say that they're gonna run out of funds by June 1st if we don't step up at the federal level and help them out and so I'm really anxious for cares 2 which is the next package that we're already working on and eager to bring that to the floor for a vote nurses clearly around the front line what are you hearing from your fellow professionals and I guess there are two nurses in Congress maybe I'm maybe I don't have that right to correct me if I'm wrong but registered nurses were gathered in front of the White House just the other day protesting that they are not getting enough help so there are two of us in Congress had chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson who's the chair of the Science Space and Technology Committee is also registered nurse in 2020 is actually the year of the nurse and the midwives and so this is such an important time to recognize and thank these frontline health professionals who do the work day in and day out and during the corona virus they're being asked to do it under some extremely difficult circumstances with it Andrea it is outrageous that we are asking doctors and nurses and other essential workers to go to work without the critical personal protective equipment the 75 billion dollars that we will pass today and money for health systems and providers will allow them to purchase these additional critical PPE items and that we want to continue to make sure that these individuals have everything that they need to not just keep themselves and their families safe but our whole community they are doing heroic work and we've got to have their back how how nervous are you or should people be about our our political leaders members of Congress coming despite the precautions that are being taken they're all together you've got more than 400 people now back as well as staff on top of that you've got there's Jim McGovern I see the rules chairman on the House floor I think that's a Patriots mask he's wearing but how careful are you and and how concerning were you did you get on a plane I got on a plane there are probably seven passengers total on this flight including my colleague Robin Kelly from Chicago wiped out my seat put on my mask and promptly went to sleep on that airplane we are taking extreme precautions using a lot of hand sanitizer a lot of disinfecting wipes and keeping the social distance I've seen just a small handful of my colleagues around the hallways as I came over to do this interview today I'll be going to the floor of the house to make a speech in a few minutes and then we will be voting in phases no more than 20 members I believe allowed on the floor of the house at a time and so as you mentioned at the start it will take a little while for all of us to be able to cast our vote today well Lauren Underwood thank you for your service thanks to all of the nurses of course who are such heroes to all of us who benefit from the work of the people on the front line thanks to you lots of luck thank you

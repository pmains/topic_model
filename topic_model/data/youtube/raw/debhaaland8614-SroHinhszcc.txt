We've all faced struggles. Overcoming
them made us fierce. I'm Deb Halland and I pushed through law school as a single
mom to become a champion for our schools and our kids. I'm 30 years sober and I
know affordable health care that serves everyone is fundamental and I will move
us toward a clean energy future because when we build opportunity we all rise.
I approve this message because it's a new day in New Mexico. Are you ready?

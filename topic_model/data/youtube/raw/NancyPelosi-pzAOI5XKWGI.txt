for Stephen Lee America is home he's studying to be a nurse and wants to serve his community Stephens been here half his life but last year he was held for deportation as he continues his studies he's still at risk for being deported Stephen and his family are part of a long line of men and women striving to make a better life for themselves and their children the American dream their story rests at the center of the DREAM Act and the larger drive to enact comprehensive immigration reform for hundreds of thousands of young people serving our country as soldiers and students brought here as children and unaware of their legal status the House passed the DREAM Act last year with bipartisan support we did so to put these young immigrants on the path to citizenship to strengthen our national security to invest in our future workforce and as we continue to fight for the DREAM Act we must stop deporting young dreamers those who only know America as home in the words of one dreamer the DREAM Act itself symbolizes what it is to be an American indeed these young people make America more American they deserve to take part in the American dream

JOINING US NOW DEMOCRATIC MEMBER OF THE FOREIGN RELATIONS
COMMITTEE. SENATOR TIM KAINE, WE HAVE A
LOT OF ISSUES TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT TODAY BUT LET'S START THERE
WITH YOUR REACTION TO THE TAKEDOWN OF AL-ZAWAHIRI.
>> GREAT TO BE WITH YOU GUYS. VERY VERY GOOD NEWS AND IT SENDS A
LESSON. I MEAN THIS IS A GUY WHO HAS BASICALLY BEEN LIVING A SHADOW  LIFE IN
SAFE HOUSES FOR 20 YEARS TRYING AVOIDING THE U.S. BUT HE
COULDN'T. WE ARE VERY PATIENT PEOPLE AND IF YOU
PLOT AN ATTACK AGAINST US THERE'S NO PLACE IN THE WORLD YOU
CAN WAIT US OUT. GREAT INTEL.
OBVIOUSLY SOME IMPORTANT TIPS THAT  LED US TO AL-ZAWAHIRI BUT THEN
EVEN AFTER WE HAD THE INFORMATION,  THE CARE THAT WAS
USED IN PLANNING AN OPERATION TO MINIMIZE CASUALTIES IN THE
MIDDLE OF A CROWDED KABUL WAS MOST IMPRESSIVE. SO AS A MEMBER
OF THE ARMED SERVICES AND FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE
WITH AN AWFUL LOT OF VIRGINIA SCAR TISSUE BECAUSE OF THE ATTACK OF
9/11 ON THE PENTAGON AND OTHERS WHO DIED OVER 20 YEARS SERVING
IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN, IT WAS VERY GOOD NEWS TO HEAR THIS LAST NIGHT.
>> SENATOR A LOT OF VETERANS ARE ALSO A LOT OF VIRGINIANS ARE ALSO VETS IN URGENT NEED OF
HEALTH CARE. JON LEMEIRE AND I WERE JUST CURIOUS WHAT THE
REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE HAVE BEEN DOING OVER THE PAST COUPLE
WEEKS, BIZZARELY ENOUGH TAKING A PRO-BEIJING ANTI-VETERAN
POSITION ON TWO BILLS THAT MY GOSH I WOULD THINK 90% OF AMERICANS
WOULD SUPPORT. LOOKING AT THAT RADICALISM, THE
RADICALISM OF OPPOSING UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS,
THE RADICALISM OF PASSING LEGISLATION ON STAGE LEVELS
FORCING 10-YEAR-OLD VICTIMS TO CROSS STATE LINES BECAUSE THEY
ARE AFRAID THEY WILL BE COMPELLED TO HAVE A FORCED BIRTH
, WHAT IS GOING ON WITHHE REPUBLICAN PARTY?
IT SEEMS EVEN THOSE WHO CLAIM TO BE ANTI-TRUMP ARE QUIETLY
ANTI-TRUMP ARE NOW TAKING EXTREME PRO-BEIJING ANTI-
VETERAN POSITIONS. >> WELL JOE, I WAS LISTENING TO THAT
SEGMENT THAT YOU HAD WITH JONATHAN. JUST TO TAKE TWO OF THE ITEMS MENTIONED, THIS
REPUBLICAN SWITCHEROO WHERE THEY VOTED FOR VERAN
HEALTHCARE TO PROVIDE CARE TO IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN WAR
VETERANS, THEY VOTED FOR IT AND THEN BECAUSE THEY WERE MA THE
DEMOCRATS WERE DOING RECONCILIATION NOT ONLY DID
THEY SWITCH VOTES AND KILL THE BILL BUT THERE'S VIDEO OF
REPUBLICAN SENATORS ON THE FLOOR GIVING EACH OTHER FIST
BUMPS. DID AND WE DO SUCH A GREAT
THING BY KNIFING VETERANS IN THE BACK AND VOTING AGAINST
THIS BILL. IT WAS ASTOUNDING AND THE SECOND POINT YOU
MENTIONED THIS IS NOW AN AMERICA WHERE A 10-YEAR-OLD HAS
TO GET SMUGGLED ACROSS STATE LINES TO GET AN ABORTION TO
TERMINATE A PREGNANCY BECAUSE OF A RAPE  AND WHAT DOES
INDIANA DO IN THE AFTERMATH OF THAT?
THEY TRIED TO SAY WE SHOULD BE COMPASSIONATE TO 10-YEAR-OLDS?
NO, THE REPUBLICAN ATTORNEY GENERAL IS SLANDERING AND
ATTACKING THE DOCTOR WHO PROVIDED CARE IN THE
LEGISLATURE IS TRYING TO CLOSE LOOPHOLES SO A 10-YEAR-OLD
CANNOT GET THIS CARE. WHAT HAVE WE COME TO?
SO THOSE OF US HERE WHO SINCE BEFORE JANUARY 6th HAVE BEEN
WORRIED ABOUT THE STATE OF DEMOCRACY IT JUST MEANS WE HAVE
TO WORK HARDER TO BUILD BRIDGES AND INJECT COMMON SENSE INTO
POLITICS THAT SEEMS TO GO HAYWIRE.
>> YOU HAVE GONE TO MY NEXT QUESTION.
BECAUSE OF THIS REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM FOR ALL ACTS, THE BILL
YOU ARE WORKING ON, WHAT ARE THE CHANCES THIS WILL GO THROUGH
, BECAUSE AT THIS POINT WE ARE LOOKING AT A REPUBLICAN PARTY
THAT IS PUSHING BACK ON A LOT OF THINGS THAT WOMEN CONSIDER
PART OF THEIR DAILY LIVES AND PART OF THEIR DAILY RIGHTS.
>> ABSOLUTELY, AMERICAN WOMEN HAD RELIED ON THE BASIC ROE
VERSUS WADE AND THE SUPREME COURT TOOK IT ALL THE WAY WITH
THIS DECISION. MASSIVELY MISINTERPRETING WHAT
THE 14th AMENDMENT WAS DESIGNED TO DO AND IGNORING A A CENTURY
PRECEDENT INCLUDING 50 YEARS OF PRECEDENT ON REPRODUCTIVE
RIGHTS. WE HAD TWO VOTES EARLIER THIS
YEAR ON THE WOMEN'S HEALTH PROTECTION ACT WHICH I VOTED
FOR, IN THE FIRST INSTANCE WE ONLY GOT 49 VOTES IN FEBRUARY
AND WHEN WE WERE GOING FOR A SECOND VOTE IN MAY I STARTED TO
THINK I DOT T THINK IT SENDS A GOOD SIGNAL IF IT SEEMS LIKE
ONLY A MINORITY OF THE SENATE WANTS TO PROTECT WOMEN'S
REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM AND I THINK WE'RE LEAVING VOTES ON
THE TABLE, SO I WENT TO COLLEAGUES WHO I KNEW WANTED TO
CODIFY ROE VERSUS WADE INTO FEDERAL STATUTE AND SAID IF
THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU LIKE CAN WE DO IT A DIFFERENT WAY WHICH
LED TO THE REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM FOR ALL ACT WHICH IS BASED ON A
MICHIGAN BALLOT REFERENDUM TO ADD PROTECTION TO THE MICHIGAN
CONSTITUTION THAT'S GOING TO BE ON THE BALLOT IN NOMBMBER.
YOU ASKED ME WILL IT BE PASSED?  I WILL BE HONEST I DON'T HAVE
60 VOTES TO PASS THIS BUT TWO MONTHS AGO WE DO NOT HAVE 60
VOTES TO PASS GUN LEGISLATION. WE SAT ON OUR HANDS FOR A DECADE BUT THE
TRAGEDIES IN BUFFALO AND TEXAS CHANGED THE REALITY. AND I THINK THE
TRAGEDIES OF A POST-DOBBS AMERICA WITH 10- YEAR-OLDS BEING SMUGGLED ACROSS
STATE LINES WILL CHANGE THE REALITY HERE IN CONGRESS AND
GET US TO A POINT WHERE WE WILL PROTECT WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE
FREEDOM. >>

Mr Speaker I rise today to speak out against president Trump's Muslim ban an executive order that in Boldin's our enemies undermines our alliances and offends our American vet this band has among other things blocked visas for interpreters from the Middle East people who risked their lives to save American lives when I was deployed to Afghanistan as an intelligence officer I worked with many interpreters and at first I realized they not only provided accurate information they kept us safe as time went along and I got to know them what I came to realize is that they were the ones who were unsafe they were the ones who were risking their lives to save our lives and so I when I get to know them I would ask them why are you taking this risk why are you doing this and the reason they gave me was similar to the one my grandfather gave me an Italian immigrant grandfather as to why he came here to America back in nineteen twenty one and that is they came here to give their children a better life mr. speaker to me that is the definition of the American dream president Trump's executive order not only makes us unsafe it is against our fundamental values if people are going on the paper is to live the American dream we don't stop them we welcome them and that is why my only time expired that is why I am here John the time has expired

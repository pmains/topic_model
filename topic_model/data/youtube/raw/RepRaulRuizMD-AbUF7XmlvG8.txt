the gentleman from California mr. Ruiz is recognized for five minutes of questions dr. Ruiz thank you thank you dr. bright thank you for your testimony here and thank you for your service to our country my heart aches for the family and friends of the over 80,000 in America who have died of covin 19 in such a short period of time in fact my heart aches for those closer to me the the Riverside counties reported 228 deaths as a doctor I appreciate your written testimony the states that science not politics or cronyism must lead the way to combat this deadly virus there's been a lot of hype about cures for kovat that have been shown to be ineffective and even dangerous we are now seeing the very real dangers and consequences of not making decisions based on science hydroxychloroquine which Fox News commentators and then the white house repeatedly touted and actually encouraged people to use is Exhibit A on this list but there is one drug that appears to provide some therapeutic benefit REM disappear two weeks ago dr. Fauci announced that REM disappear showed a clear-cut significant positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery my understanding is that in January and early February you launched a comprehensive review to assess which existing drugs might prove a therapeutic benefit and you quickly identified rim disappear as the most likely drug to be effective against Cova 19 can you describe how you came to that conclusion who you told within HHS and what the response was as for that conclusion I was came about by a technical review from number of scientists within HHS to the CDC FDA NIH and Barta it was also aligned with a scientific assessment from w-h-o and a number of global experts who rapidly looked at every potential drug and ranked Rimba severe is the drug that had the most potential for benefit what did you tell what was the response and we share that information with doctor like we share that information within HHS leadership as well we had discussions about the actions that could be considered for acquiring the limited supply rim Desa beer what was your response and we had the discussions about how to ramp up production of more room des severe in case the randomized controlled clinical study that the NIH was conducting came through with positives we had a discussion and what was the response did anything happen no decision was made and at that time my understanding is that Peter Navarro the white house trade adviser reached out to you on February 7th to seek your counsel you told them about your top three concerns the shortage of n95 masks the need for a quote unquote Manhattan Project to develop vaccines and securing adequate supplies of rim disappear can you tell us if mr. Navarro agreed with you and what steps you and he took mr. Furr Navarro did agree with me on the rim death severe at the n95 mask and the vaccine Manhattan Project and he drafted a memo on February 9 m to the White House chief of staff and Mick Mulvaney to share with the White House Task Force Director for HHS to act on rim disappear occurred on February 10th what happened next and did the department promptly procure the needed supplies of him disappear we did not perceive was procuring any supplies of him death severe okay you were removed from your position on April 22nd by the time you were removed has a department settled on a plan and procured the rim disappear no sir they were still discussing resilient presentations about potential donations affirmed s appear at that time so what you are describing is a gang that couldn't shoot straight and yet we are in the middle of a pandemic there is one drug the experts say could make a difference and in fact has been shown to make a difference yet the department can't seem to figure out how to acquire we go The Washington Post published an article on the rollout of the rim disappear just driving it as quote confusing unfair and marred with incomplete medical information unquote doctors described how they can obtain the drug and don't understand the process for accessing it dr. Benjamin Lena's from the Boston Medical Center said quote there's no transparency the processes staggering injustice dr. bright you were warning about this over three months ago if the department had listened to you and the other experts at your agency could this fiasco have been avoided we would have had a plan sir we should have had a plan for that drug and any other drug a limited supply so it didn't have to be this way right here's what I don't understand you were right about the dangers of hydroxychloroquine you were right about the benefits of REM dis severe you were right about n95 masks and other critical issues yet you got fired from your job while officials who botched the response and ignored your warnings stay in theirs not only is this unfair to you it's completely dangerous to the American people I yield back my time

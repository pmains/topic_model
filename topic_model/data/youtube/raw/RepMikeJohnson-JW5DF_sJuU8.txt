early I spoke to U.S congressman Mike Johnson who's a Republican representative for Louisiana's fourth congressional district and he's Vice chairman of the house Republican conference well it's important to note I think what we've achieved here it will be a small majority but this is only the third time in the last 70 years that the American people have changed the House of Representatives from Democrat to Republican control what this means now is that they'll no longer be single party rule in Washington of course for the last two years you've had the same party in charge of the White House in both houses of Congress so this will be a big change we will begin as Republicans fulfilling our commitment to America that we made to the voters during this election cycle and we'll also begin in early January when the new Congress starts fulfilling our critical oversight responsibility in Congress investigating some of the corruption that we've seen the last two years so it will be an interesting time in our politics here it's interesting that you're talking about corruption investigating what do you mean exactly well there are a number of Investigations that the American people are deeply concerned about the administration's disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal misuse and abuses within our department of justice and our FBI Hunter Biden of course the president's son and the scandals related to him so there are a lot of questions that Congress has a constitutional responsibility to ask and to seek accountability and and we intend to do a lot of that work it's interesting that you're talking about that because of course Joe Biden will need support of Republicans in order to put through some of his policies it sounds as if some Republicans like yourself may not be thinking about any kind of cooperation where we would like to reach consensus but the problem that we have and the reason that the American people have returned control of the house to Republicans is that they want us to stop the Biden administration's agenda that is his policy choices and decisions are precisely what has led us into the many crises we Face our inflation our cost of living our energy crisis our illegal immigration crisis our crime crisis there is literally a disaster in almost every area of public policy domestically and of course on the world stage right now we have been weakened and so people want us to seek a change and to advance a change and that's what we intend to do if the president will be willing to work with us on a different direction that would be welcomed and we would love to do that but the decision will be his however there are some who argue that it's a Joe Biden's predecessor who created quite a few of the problems that you cited and that it is Donald Trump who in fact should even within the Republican party bear some of the blame for the red wave that was predicted not happening yet I know that you received support from Donald Trump are you confident that having Donald Trump still in the Forefront of the Republican party is the way to go well look the dust is still settling from the midterm elections and there are still races left to be called even as we speak tonight and I suspect in the coming days and weeks it'll become more clear why some of our Statewide candidates underperformed relative to the expectations of pollsters but I think it's important to note here the pollsters all got it wrong on the right left and the center all anticipated a big red wave so I think there were probably a number of factors that weighed into the the outcome that no one expected and we're still trying to sort all of that out they're those within the Republican Party who are rather ill at ease about Donald Trump and his candidacy it is a cause of division within your party isn't it do you feel maybe that division could ultimately hand a victory to the Democrats because your party cannot unite over somebody who's become a very divisive figure well I'm not concerned about that I think the Republican party will unite the stakes are very high the contrast is very sharp between our party and and the Democrats under Joe Biden we have inflation that soaring gas prices are out of control crime is rampant and I think the American people recognize that certainly those in our party do you know we just had an election it's not even completed there's still races yet to be called so right now our focus is on governing in 2023 not the election of 2024 we have two years to sort all of that out I think that's plenty of time what about the contacts either Kevin McCarthy did he get your backing to become a house speaker he does you know the consensus here is that no one worked harder for the Republicans here the success that we had you know flipping the house for the third time in just 70 years Kevin worked harder than anyone to make that outcome a reality he earned the privilege of servant as our speaker beginning in January and I think he'll have the votes to do that and you know until then like I said we are just laser focused on getting our team in place to begin governing in the 118th Congress that will begin in early January we have a lot of work to do and I think we'll be United in that cause and that is my Congressman Mike Johnson of the Republican uh party he's the representative for Louisiana's fourth congressional district

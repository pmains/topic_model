just days ago we passed 22 trillion in debt for which we have no plan to begin paying off the green New Deal would only add trillions more while simultaneously destroying the American economy the 27th district of Texas which I represent has a better approach we're home to a diverse energy portfolio which includes wind nuclear LNG oil production not to mention our fair share of cows and airplanes we're home to safe reliable nuclear power plant in Matagorda County that generates 2.7 gigawatts of power enough to power nearly two million Texas homes and businesses it would take eight point four million solar panels to replace that kind of energy even President Obama's Secretary of Energy said that's just impractical and what that new American energy dominance means is means global stability and peace in the world as our allies are able to buy energy from us rather than from countries that don't have our best intentions in mind so when it comes to the green New Deal let's stop looking to socialism for answers and start looking to places like Texas this green New Deal would be devastating to American job holders harmful to our allies around the world and it's also counterproductive to advancing protections to our environment and I'll continue to firmly oppose this outlandish and unrealistic idea

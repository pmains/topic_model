and the people ask me all the time in the last election this one what do you think of Donald Trump I said I support his policies I'm going to be someone I will learn and women to get things done in Washington now there's a little bit of a difference between the two of us on this issue and it came out in the last debate in Albert Lea and you know before the last election nobody under it nobody thought well very few of us I predicted Trump's victory in the Rochester crossbow that neighborhood and so he killed good McCloud way but most people thought it was a hindrance to be tied to Donald Trump and I said it doesn't matter because of the losses we lose in their country Hillary's gonna stack the court we have Obama policies for the rest of our lives this is our chance it was the most consequential election in our lifetimes think where we would be today if Donald Trump hadn't won the White House just Justice Scalia's appointment alone would have made the difference that's why I told people of course I supported vote form get out there let's save our country that's the most important that's the most important election on the ballot Mike offender had a different answer she couldn't commit to voting for Donald Trump and I think that's a little bit of a difference between the two of us

my name is jim forrest i live in franconia new hampshire i'm retired i'm 72 years old i'm reasonably healthy knock on wood well the reason i think medicare is important is because it just relieves my mind from the worry of getting into some health issue that could end up costing all of my savings it's worry-free i don't have to worry about going broke in my retirement i can enjoy my retirement the ryan budget would would preserve the tax cuts that the wealthy have and it would have to result in cutbacks in medicare because where's the money going to come from a lot of wealthy people are paying less in percentage rate than middle class and lower class people so we've got to get a more equitable tax structure

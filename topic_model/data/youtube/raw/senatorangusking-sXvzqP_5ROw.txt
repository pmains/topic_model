from Capitol Hill we have both independent senator angus King of Maine and Republican senator Mike rounds of South Dakota thank you both so much for joining us appreciate the opportunity yeah great senator King I'll start with you we're gonna try and look at the positive the hopeful signs here and I'll ask you given that this process has had a lot of fits and starts and there was this argument or debate over the president's vulgarities moving forward what was the win for the Democrats in this so that they could maybe have an honest negotiation moving forward and feel holy well before I answer that question I think there was a win for the American people which was the fact that there were 25 moderate senators from both parties who really got deeply involved in this process and digital diplomacy and I think contributed to ending the shutdown in terms of I think Mitch McConnell a couple of important things happen number one he committed to bringing a bill to the floor on the date certain number two he talked about a neutral of a level playing field a neutral bill in order to give us an even chance to get at this issue and then finally and this hasn't been much pointed out if you recall earlier last week and for the prior couple of weeks Mitch McConnell said I'm not going to deal with this issue because the president hasn't told us yet what he's for and we'd only be spinning our wheels as of yesterday morning Mitch McConnell said we're not waiting for the president anymore we're bringing a bill to the floor on February 8th if we can't get it resolved before then and Mike and I are both involved in discussions that started within hours of the vote yesterday to try to get to an agreement on the daca border security issue so I think that was that was positive and you know you I quoted Mick Jagger on the floor the other day you can't always get what you want but if you try sometimes you just might find you get what you need work for any Mick Jagger quote on this show so we'll give you that one senators it's willie Geist it's good to see both senator rounds you've said in a tweet among other things that with the shutdown coming to a debt and then now we can quote permanently address daca what does that mean - exactly - permanently address daca because there are a lot of conserves a lot of Democrats suspect of the motives of leader McCallum don't believe there will ever be a deal that protects Decker recipients would you be willing to vote for a bill that exchanges protection for daca recipients in exchange for border security I think that's what the bill will finally end up with will be both border security a limitation on additional illegal immigration but also addressing the issue of doctor for these young people that really know no other country other than the United States we need work force we need their talents this is a positive thing for our country and I think we need to get past this point I think we need to get past the issue and if we can do a combination of those where we take care of the answering and responding to one of the president's request with regards to his campaign promises and at the same time also take care of these these individuals who are here in the country right now and get them into the workforce and give some stability in their lives I think we've got a win-win situation and maybe along the way we can actually do something about the h-2b visa issues as well so border security is sort of a catch-all term and we don't drill down on it very much what do you mean when you say border secure does that mean a physical wall and the border and what else you know we've actually had some real discussions about that because if we're talking about border security systems there are some places where a wall is the appropriate way to handle it in some places that may very well be electronic surveillance so while you can you can see through there may be some cases where it's simply a matter of appropriate fencing but in not and all of it you've got to have the proper manpower it's a system it's not necessarily just a structure along with that and part of the discussions we had was is you got to have your laws in such a fashion that you actually don't invite illegal immigration so that you get back to the point of allowing legal immigration that can be a part of this discussion we may not get all the way through it but we most certainly have to take care of the docket issue and the border security side of it in this discussion and we don't have a lot of time in which to get it done senator King what would be the stumbling blocks for you in whatever comes to the floor of the Senate it sounds like you've just had senator rounds we had Tom Cole on just a few moments ago saying this is basically about border security for dreamers what happens if the White House also wanted to have say an end of chain migration in their family migration and the end to the visa lottery system those the kinds of hurdles that might get thrown in that would make it difficult for you to vote for this kind of a deal well I think that I think you've identified a significant issue and that is what we're trying to focus on is not the whole immigration issue there are lots of them and believe me once you dig into it it gets connected and it gets very complicated very fast what we're trying to focus on is border security and the daca issue now you know there we're going to have to develop a bill that attracts hopefully 60 or 70 votes I think that's the path forward here if the Senate can come to a bipartisan bill that has a super majority then the president and the House have to pay attention that's really the strategy so you know I'm not saying anything is off the table but I keep saying in these meetings and we had two of them yesterday after the the end of the shutdown vote we can't get we can't try to do comprehensive immigration in three weeks let's keep it as narrow as possible so that we can we can get something realistic done senator Browns daca chain migration border security you know you've discussed it all you discuss it all every each and every day if at eight o'clock this morning you had to go across the street and take the floor of the United States Senate and describe what you feel is the president's position what he wants to do with a new immigration bill how confident would you be that you could outline exactly what this President believes I don't think the president has an exact position I think at this point what he knows is that he's made a campaign a promise that he will do border security he's identified it as a wall people have a visual of a wall but it's really a border security system along with that he's indicated his real desire and I really do believe that he wants to address the issue of he wants to see that fixed he's going to talk about a contract between the two or a connection between the two I also think that that when you start talking about that now you get into the nuances of these young people eventually having a road to citizenship in the in the future and so I I think what these deities has given us plenty of leeway but at the same time I think people say well if you're giving them leeway then you're not being exact in your discussions I I think at this point we're in a good shape to offer some stuff and I think as long as we help him achieve his goals and I think he can come out of that saying I've made progress once again then I think he's gonna be more than willing to work with us on the total package and what it takes to get it done and I agree with Angus we're not looking at just 60 people in the Senate we really want to have closer to 70 people on this and really making a bipartisan approach that a lot Stanly it'll actually stand the test of time okay and Senator King first of all it's a great day for America every time you're on TV in the morning we appreciate it and second way senator if Mick Jagger was with you looking for the 70 votes would he have a problem with the fact that out of 49 Democrats in the United States Senate maybe up to 40 as many as 40 are gonna be running for president United States that's taking 40 just that's taking you into the issue of identity politics getting into the way of getting something accomplished in the Senate and immigration do you worry about that well I think it's something of an issue it always you know they used to say it's hard to get things done in an election year but around here it seems like every year is an election year I think that's one of the problems but no I I think there are enough people again if we can keep the focus on daca and border security I think we can come up with something that'll work and I don't know I would might my ideal bill would be one that would have 35 or 40 votes on each side not necessarily pleasing everybody on either side of this debate by definition if you if you're working with compromise and that's what we've gotta do here that's the way our system works you're not going to make everybody happy but I do think and you know I think there are plenty of people and I've talked to a lot of Republican senators one on one genuinely concerned about doctor who are generally concerned about these kids and are willing to talk about path to citizenship and if we can you know we got to get the Democrats and talking about border security and those kinds of things I think there is a path forward but it's not going to be easy I can tell you because the danger is and we talked about this in one of our meetings yesterday you can attract Republican votes and lose Democratic voters so we've got to try to build from the middle out and that's exactly what we're starting later today senators noah rothman from commentary magazine that's sort of what I want to drill down on I know we're being very specific about border security but that is what is at issue here I think we understand that Senator Schumer came apparent according to him came to Donald Trump and put border security on the table his staffer said it was north of the two point six billion that was originally in the gram Durbin proposal are we to understand that we're gonna have something more substantial than that and that Graham Durban is basically a non-starter from the Democratic perspective you know I'm not sure that it's an excuse me I'm not sure it's a non-starter I think for some Republicans it may be a non-starter but and I'm one of the folks that said look I'm gonna support this path moving forward but I disagree with some of the concepts in the bill itself but I'm willing to work on it I think with regard to the to the wall or to the to the border security system that we talked about we know that this is not a one-year process but there's got to be some assurances to the president that we're going to give enough resources or set enough resources aside before we can actually not just start it but but get a long way down to getting it finished because once we do the daca fix then we've still got to have the incentive for for Democrats to help finish the rest of the border security those are the types of nuances that we're gonna have to work our way through so just to understand Graham Durban is still really the template from which we're working here what we're actually trying to move away from that as being that template and talking about the the different concepts that were found in there but not limiting it to just those and so yeah some of the pieces that were in Graham Durban will still be there but we may very well I mean other things as I'm searching we I've asked my we're working on a side-by-side with the Graham Durban provisions the 2013 border security provisions which were pretty extensive what DHS is telling us now they think they need so we're gonna have at least three main news if you will to choose from and the question is how do we put something together and the the this is this is real stuff I mean we're talking about what will be effective what will be the most efficient and effective way to secure the border and and at the same time not waste the taxpayers money and and come up with something that works all right senators angus King and Mike rounds we appreciate you both getting together this morning come see us I'm sure there'll be a lot more to talk about in the next couple weeks and maybe some more Rolling Stones references as well gentlemen thanks very much we appreciate it I love that all right Joe what do you make of what you heard be

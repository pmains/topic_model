so good morning it is Sunday morning and Zach and I are headed off to keen to another canvas kickoff we had a great day yesterday in Hanover and Plymouth and then all the way up to white filled with the cost county dems all our hard work is paying off thank you so much everybody knocking on doors making those phone calls it's making a difference we hit our one that was in volunteer this week which was really exciting I wanted to report in on our standing up for seniors week that was a great success I had the opportunity to meet with seniors in Salem and Nashua and Peterborough in Concord and everyone had the same concern what were we going to do about Medicare they're so worried about Congress and basses boat not once but twice for the Ryan budget and we know that the voucher for Medicare in the romney-ryan vas budget will not be sufficient to cover the cost of health care for our seniors and so they'll be faced with the out-of-pocket expense I want to bring down the cost of health care not just shift the cost to our incredibly important people in our society the seniors who have worked so hard their whole life so let me move on to some great news we've now got three public polls showing us pulling ahead and all your hard work is paying off we're up by three in the most recent WMUR poll so it's obviously a tight race and I'm going to need your help every step of the way we're still fundraising because we've got to respond to these attack ads that are coming at us now I know I've asked for a lot and the only thing harder than asking for more is knowing that we could wake up on Wednesday morning the seventh of November with a narrow loss so I know you're with me and you'll have my back I hope you can chip in just five dollars this week to help us respond to this attack machine but listen I'm upbeat and you should be too we've got the message we've got the ideas and we definitely have the people power to win this race so let's get out there today knock on a few more doors make a few more phone calls and I look forward to checking in next week thanks so much for all your doing

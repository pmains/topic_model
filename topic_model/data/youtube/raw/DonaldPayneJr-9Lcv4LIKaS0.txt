I'd like to thank the gentlelady for yielding yielding to my chairman on the subcommittee and former chairman of this whole committee two gentlemen I have great respect for I look at this issue as as important as the defense budget and I know how the my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are always looking for a strong defense in this nation these dollars that we're talking about are as important as the defense budget this is to defend our homeland our army fights all over the world and thank God that we have not had to have them fight a war in this nation but these homeland dollars keeps our country safe it is as important as the defense budget and so I don't understand why there's a rationale and rightfully so for a strong defense that we wouldn't want to see the same thing in the homeland our budget is trillions of dollars another hundred million dollars in the scheme of that budget is not great it would be a lot of money for first responders and the defense of the homeland but in the whole scheme of the budget another 100 billion dollars is a drop in the bucket but can make a great difference in what we do for our first responders people to keep us safe people like to responded today in Alexandria to make sure that they have the training and the equipment that they need to do what they did today for members of Congress and the public in this nation and with that I yield back Joe

last week the President's chief of staff said these words fiscal responsibility is very important to us in the Biden Administration and I think the American people know that nothing could be further from the truth we've seen record inflation borne out again today by the latest CPI numbers but if you look at the increase in the cost of everything since this Administration has taken office it's gone up 13.8 percent overall if you look at groceries a 12 percent increase electricity 13.7 percent increase and this is year-over-year numbers and fuel oil fuel oil 65.7 percent increase year over year and this is a result of the massive amount of spending that this Administration and on a party line vote the Democrats here in the Congress have approved in the last couple of years it's as simple as that and so what happens now is the Fed meets tomorrow and they're again looking at another increase in interest rates which for the American people who were putting more and more on their credit of cards looking at price for automobiles price for homes other things that they buy on credit interest rates continuing to go up so you know this Administration currently has no plan for what how to deal with that but there are a few things I think that we could do if we were serious about getting inflation under control and they have to do with extensions of expiring tax policy that was part of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act one of which is bonus depreciation the tax Foundation suggests that just extending bonus depreciation would create tens of thousands of jobs add Positively to the GDP the research and development tax credit allowing the companies to take the full deduction for that also would be something that would create jobs create growth in the economy these are pro-growth tax policies that would help keep the economy expanding and growing incentivize businesses to invest and make sure the American people have uh even better paying jobs and so I'm hopeful that those are a few things that we could get done here in the waning weeks before the the end of this Congress but clearly this Administration has been asleep at the switch when it comes to addressing the issue of inflation and the enormous adverse economic impact it's had on the American people

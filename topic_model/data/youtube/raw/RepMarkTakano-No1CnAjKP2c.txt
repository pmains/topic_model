the president will touch on the country's gun violence epidemic this evening and there will be an empty chair and first ladies balcony box to symbolize the victims including the people of San Bernardino California several first responders family members of victims of last month's terror attack will be in the gallery including the next guest she was to the mines the widow of Damien mines and was shot and killed just a couple of weeks ago joining her here congressman California mark Takano who represents I didn't own town of Riverside so thank you so much for taking the time and just my heart goes out to you and of course all the family members from San Bernardino and all these shootings that we cover far too often since thank you thank you can we just begin with your husband can you tell me a little bit about him it was a very intelligent man a very docile man he loved the diversity in the office and he loved working with the kids so he was he was a wonderful human being the kids isn't these two lovely daughters camera here not only children from the center right right not only not only those children but for the school kids right and he really was a community service individual so he tried to help everyone and his idea was to help everyone if he could and even the smallest things for anybody was was the right thing to do it's all the little things all the little things you know I was on the air when it happened and our heart obviously breaks for all of you all in San Bernardino but you know I've talked to too many gun violence victims and I asked tell me about the call cuz everyone got the call well the call was uh we heard on the news I heard on the news that's when you first heard them that's when I found out and I text him and I called him and he didn't respond and then our friend called me and said that he was going to come down everybody was trying to call him and trying to find out where he was because it was kind of mayhem everybody was running around nobody could nobody knew anything yet and then we went down to the reunification center we stayed there till eight o'clock at night when the last bus came in then we were taken into the room and said and told that the the the wounded were in the hospital and those family members had already been notified and that we were to go home and we would be contacted the missing the next day and for our positive identification so we got home about ten o'clock and I already know the answer to my next question as far as why you would ask tryna to come to be seated with you at the State of the Union but there are so many families why specifically did you ask her well trim and her family mr. minds constituents of mine and I lost two constituents I was able to reach trying to speak to her personally you know we've had a much tougher decision at every better reach both families but it was family of the other victim who lived in my district but his family actually lives so outside the district so really it's a matter of you know those of us in the area the other members of Congress lost and one or two members there districts but I felt it was also important that the families of the victims were represented here my colleague mr. Aguilar has done a wonderful thing and inviting the police chief and sheriff and some of the first responders but I really felt was important for our community that we also had the real faces of the victims I'm wondering before you lost her husband how familiar with you with gun laws were you in this country or you know the knowledge of loopholes or background checks or is this something you very quickly have become an expert on well we did talk about it before we're a family that that we had guns and family has guns there's hunters and there's Truman and that's what team members in our family that that that happens we went ahead and we had talked about shooting and gun control we had also talked about our views on that before but since this has happened we have found a lot of loopholes that we didn't know existed and we would like that those who posed to become tighter so that not everybody has to worry about this or at least it's more difficult by than to go ahead and do you feel like the president's executive actions have gone far enough for you not for me but it's a good step that the pushback I was just in Virginia the other night with the President and Anderson as part of this town hall on gun violence in this country and look at you as a member of Congress and I think one of the one of the questions critics would say is what these executive actions that will prevent the killer couple from murdering port to the people potentially or or getting a gun don't your response well you know just because you can poke holes in some of these proposals that they won't absolutely one hundred percent certainty guaranteeing a crazy person or mentally ill person or a radicalized person will get a weapon is no reason not to try to tighten on the poles look this guy Farouk went to this other guy Marquez because he felt that he couldn't pass anything again yeah and so that suggests to me that background checks are important they can work look we need to tighten up the whole chain of ownership in California if I want to transfer ownership of my automobile to another person I have to go to the DMV exactly what the president made about titles and I know alleles the other night and we should be able to be able to trace this this is not taking away people's Second Amendment and the mines like many of my constituents are respectful of a second limit but it's you know common sense things like we should be able to have tighter background checks had this young man mark has even thought about the consequences what he was doing potentially a known that was tighter penalties for transferring a weapon without a second thought I mean so they actually the tired of background checks there has to be a better accountability on who owns what weapons that sort of congressman takano thank you so much i'm trying to thank you so much i appreciate your time thank you forget we want you to

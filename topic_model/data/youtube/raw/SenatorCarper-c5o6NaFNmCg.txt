senator carper thanks so much for joining us i i wonder just until a few days ago this deal was considered dead in the water how did it come together at this late hour yeah it's the testimony of never giving up i didn't get up my staff on the environmental public works committee never gave up and continue to negotiate with senator manchin not just on methane emissions reductions but on broader aspects of it we work with our caucus we work with senator senator schumann to his credit and that of his staff and really too were to to joe manchin to find the middle find a way to not only address climate change and real and meaningful ways but to do so in ways that create a lot of jobs and economic opportunity it's paid for it's uh deficit neutral and uh it's going to be helping us actually it's on inflation it's actually uh helpful in combating inflation so it's a it's an amazing um amazing development just thrilled to be a part of it so senator manchin support of course key here it is not clear yet whether kirsten cinema or even bernie sanders are on board are you confident that democrats have the votes all the votes necessary to get this through yeah defeat is uh not a an option here we've got to prevail and it's this is common sense it's all good stuff again deficit neutral works on inflation puts people to work covers folks for for health care brings down prescription prices uh who would not be for that the washington post is reporting that larry summers what was key here in speaking to imagine to convince him that this package is not inflationary can you explain to folks at home how spending these many hundreds of billions of dollars will not be inflationary given uh the the record-breaking inflation that we have right now well actually in this case the uh some of the earlier spending uh a year or two ago was was not paid for was deficit spending this is actually paid for this is probably fully offset in ways that i think make a lot of sense god bless larry summers one of the best economists we've got in the country maybe in the world and i want to thank him personally for reaching out to the senator mansion and just giving him a little bit of economics 101 inflation 101 i think it was enormously helpful you mentioned methane emissions and and that is a key part of this package here controlling those from the oil and gas industry i i wonder does this meet u.s climate commitments made by president biden in scotland last year if you put the entire package together which includes uh uh tax credits with respect to uh promoting uh clean hydrogen green hydrogen tax credits that promote uh advanced uh nuclear uh tax credits that are actually designed to to fight climate change you put it all together it's it's a comprehensive package not just one thing it's all those different things and the other thing that the federal reserve until recently has been awol absent without leave with respect to inflation they're all into it now and you so what you have is you've got a great uh infrastructure package which is now being implemented all over across the of the country you've got this legislation which is designed to go after climate change but in ways that actually complement the job creation and we've got the federal reserve weighing in on monetary policy put all that together it's a great uh great package republicans are now threatening to torpedo the chips bill which had reached bipartisan agreement here i wonder do you believe they'll follow through on that and how should democrats respond should they risk this reconciliation bill to save the chips package i don't i don't think we have to do one or the other the republicans are smart they were good to come out and work with us on the chip's legislation and uh the uh good i think at the end of the day will they'll prove they'll basically do the right thing and uh there's a lot of good people on that side of the aisle as well we'll be working with them closely just have as we did on our side with senator manchin and his team you so you've seen i i believe that this morning new economic statistics are out showing that the u.s economy did shrink during the second quarter by just under one percent that by traditional definitions would mean two consecutive quarters of negative growth which means reception recession in the minds of some although i know that other uh economists will look at a number of indicators i just wonder you speak to voters in your state all the time is the u.s in recession yeah i already speak to a lot of them tonight and i'm going to go to the elder state fair and we're going to have a lot of good news to share with them if you look at job creation numbers we get those every month from the department of labor uh each of the last three four five months we've seen something like 400 300 400 500 000 jobs created a month and uh i think uh on that's front front we're doing just fine and uh and the infrastructure bill which is still being uh implemented in the legislation that we're hopefully going to pass here in the next several days there's plenty of stimulus to keep the economy moving the difference here though is that it's paid for we're not just adding it to the deficit fully offset in ways that i think make a lot of sense senator tom carper thanks so much for taking the time this morning thanks so much see you at the state fair state fair sounds fun

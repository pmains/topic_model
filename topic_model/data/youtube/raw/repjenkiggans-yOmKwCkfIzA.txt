KIGGANS: A CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL RECIPIENT, AN AMERICAN HERO, MONTHFORD POINT MARINE CORPORAL LINWOOD HOLLAND. A CONSTITUENT OF VIRGINIA'S SECOND CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, CORPORATE HOLLAND PASSED AWAY ON FEBRUARY 16 AT THE AGE OF 99 YEARS OLD. HE LEAVES BEHIND A LEGACY OF BRAVERY, PERSEVERANCE AND LOVE OF COUNTRY. IN 1942, LINWOOD HOLLAND TRAVELED TO RICH MONDAY, VIRGINIA, TO ENLIST IN THE UNITED STATES WAR EFFORT. IN THE FACE OF ADVERSITY AND DISCRIMINATION, HE BECAME ONE OF THE FIRST BLACK AMERICANS TO SERVE IN THE MARINE CORPS. OVER THE COURSE OF WORLD WAR II, MORE THAN 20,000 MONTHFORD POINT MARINES SERVED IN SEGREGATED UNITS. CORPORAL HOLLAND SERVED OUR NATION AND THE MARINE CORPS HONORABLY, FIGHTING IN THE CONSEQUENTIAL BATTLES OF IWO JIMA AND OKINAWA. HE COURAGEOUSLY PAVEED THE WAY FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS OF BLACK AMERICANS AND U.S. MARINES. THE SUFFOLK COMMUNITY, THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA AND THE UNITED STATES AS A WHOLE HAVE LOST A VALUE YANLT MEMBER OF THE GREATEST GENERATION -- VALIANT MEMBER OF THE GREATEST GENERATION. MR. SPEAKER, PLEASE JOIN ME IN MOURNING THE LOSS OF CORPORAL HOLLAND AND HONORING THIS AMERICAN HERO FOR HIS SERVICE

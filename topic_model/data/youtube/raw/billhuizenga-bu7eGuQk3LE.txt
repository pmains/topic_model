recognizes the gentleman from Michigan mr. Huizinga 45 minutes Thank You mr. Chairman I appreciate that mr. chairman appreciate you being here as well I'm going to try and move quick and express some opinions but also have have a couple of questions and I too want to sort of log my my caution on on what we have been doing with our monetary policy and the easing that we've had and there's been lots of discussion about this economy being very fragile for a number of my friends and colleagues over there and why we quote unquote can't allow the across-the-board cuts to to go in place but it seems to me at no one's really commenting on you know the tax increase is proposed by the White House or the increased regulation that we are seeing whether it's through the EPA certainly through dodd-frank that this committee is is dealing with etc is one of my business owners back home put it to me said look it's not like this one little piece this one grain of sand is going to stop the machine but when you start adding 10 or 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 and then you start pounding it in with a mallet suddenly that little grain of sand does start grinding on that machine and it breaks it down and I think that's exactly what we've seen with much of the regulation but you know in addition to that we haven't even talked about the hit from the from the tax rate lapses the other so-called bush / Obama tax rates that were there and I'd like to see my friends have a greater conversation about that i mean the time Ernst & Young put out a study that letting tax rates for the wealthiest Americans lapse would cost about 700,000 jobs exact same numbers basically and I'm not trying to compare apples and oranges I think as one wise person said we might be talking about apples red apples versus green apples here but you know we've got to look at that side of the equation as we're moving forward the the long-term I want to talk a little bit about that I've got a specific question on page five to quote your your report today however the committee remains committee you all being remains confident that it has the tools necessary to tighten monitor very policy when the time comes to do so and I know you've laid out 2015 2016 that timeframe what exactly tools do you believe that you are going to employ to to to put that restraint back in place well we earlier discussed the exit sequence so so first we can simply allow securities on our balance sheet to run off and not replace them as we currently are doing secondly we have a number of tools that can be used to drain reserves from the system such as reverse repos thirdly we can raise interest rates even without reducing our balance sheet by raising the interest rate we pay in excess reserves which will in turn trigger interest rates in money markets and fourth and finally and it's not the first resort but eventually we can sell the securities back into the market in a slow predictable way and this has not been done though I think as we've talked about with Japan and others correct I mean this is this is this is the theory of how we're going to do this that there's each of the elements is something that we've tested that we've seen other countries use so we think we understand it pretty well so the the thing I did appreciate you laid out three things that you wanted to have brought to light today and interest rates won't be this low forever was something I think we were not living with a reality of or where the recognition of that I'm curious because you you talk about there and I'm afraid that the that the headlines tomorrow are going to be Bernanke Bernanke blasts across the board cuts and or or Bernanke Bernanke calls for a stoppage of the across-the-board cuts when I had frankly based on what I read and what I've heard the testimony today I think the headlines ought to be bernanke called calls for long-term reforms and and there's just a denial in this town and so many in so many ways about what's happening down the future and what would you say to those who say we can't or shouldn't reform these long-term programs I don't think we have any choice i think i've tried throughout this discussion to always have two parts to the recommendation there are good economists on the other one hand I got a third hand here yeah so anyway on with the idea being that we want to reduce somewhat the fiscal drag in 2013 and I didn't you know i'm not speaking only about the sequester i talked about all of the fiscal actions which collectively are about one and a half percentage points according to the CBO but here to recommend that we just kick the can indefinitely down the road i think it's very important to address we've got about 10 seconds so this is Medicare Medicaid Social Security reform it's up the specifics are up to Congress but obviously the well those are our long-term drivers of that so there you go folks a headline for tomorrow is Bernanke calls for long term fixes time at the gym

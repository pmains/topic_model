Mr. Speaker, I rise today in defense of every
woman’s access to health care and right to make her own personal health care decisions,
in private consultation with her physician and family. Last week, President Trump issued a shameful
executive order that will allow employers to deny women insurance coverage for contraception. This rolls back progress under the Affordable
Care Act that required insurance companies to cover birth control without a copay. This is outrageous. Employers have no role dictating what health
care women can and cannot have. That’s a decision between a woman and her
doctor. Nearly 9 in 10 women will use birth control
at some point in their lives. This order is a direct attack on their health
care. President Trump tried to sneak this change
through, announcing it on a Friday afternoon before a long weekend. Well we noticed. And so did the millions of other women this
order will adversely impact. We’re paying attention and we’re not about
to stop speaking out and working to protect women’s access to health care.

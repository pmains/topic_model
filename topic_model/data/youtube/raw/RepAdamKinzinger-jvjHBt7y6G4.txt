  REVEALED THAT THE JUSTICE  DEPARTMENT FEARED THERE WAS,  QUOTE. JOINING ME NOW IS A MEMBER OF  THE JANUARY 6th COMMITTEE,  REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN ADAM  KINZINGER OF ILLINOIS. WELCOME BACK TO "MEET THE  PRESS."  >> THANK YOU. GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.  >> LET ME START WITH THE  AFFIDAVIT WITH YOU. IT SEEMS AS IF JUSTICE WANTED TO CHARGE THE FORMER PRESIDENT WITH A CRIME. DOESN'T IT APPEAR THEY ALREADY  HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE JUST SIMPLY ON THE MISHANDLING OF THESE  CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS? >> YEAH. I MEAN, LOOK. I'M NO EXPERT IN, YOU KNOW, WHAT IT TAKES TO INDICT SOMEBODY, YOU KNOW? I'M A PILOT. THAT'S ABOUT IT. BUT KNOWING WHAT I KNOW, I LOOK  AT THIS AND I GO, MY GOODNESS. I MEAN, CHUCK, IF ANY OF US IN  THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WHO BY OUR ELECTION WE HAVE, YOU  KNOW, IN ESSENCE THE HIGHEST  LEVEL OF SECURITY CLEARANCE, IF  ANY OF US WALKED OUT  INTENTIONALLY WITH EVEN ONE  DOCUMENT FROM THE SKIF, WHICH IS WHERE WE CAN GO SEE CLASSIFIED  DOCUMENTS TO US AND THE HOUSE  CAME TO US, SAID YOU HAVE TO  GIVE THIS DOCUMENT BACK AND WE  REFUSED TO DO IT FOR YEARS, WE  WOULD BE IN REAL TROUBLE. NOT JUST ONE DOCUMENT IN THIS  CASE. WE KNOW 180 PLUS THEN WHAT WAS  GOTTEN AFTER THIS SEARCH. I MEAN, THE HYPOCRISY ARE OUT  THERE DEFENDING A MAN WHO VERY  CLEARLY DID NOT TAKE THE  NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE UNITED  STATES TO HEART AND IT WILL BE  UP TO DOJ WHETHER THAT REACHES  THE LEVEL OF INDICTMENT. THIS IS DISGUSTING IN MY MIND  AND, LOOK. NO PRESIDENT SHOULD ACT THIS  WAY, OBVIOUSLY.  >> LOOK. YOU'RE PURSUING A DIFFERENT  INVESTIGATION WHETHER THESE  DOCUMENTS THAT WE HAVE HELD ARE  DOCUMENTS THAT ARE HELPFUL TO  YOUR INVESTIGATION. HOW ARE YOU ABLE TO FIND THAT  OUT? IS THERE GOING TO A BROAD  SUBPOENA THAT YOUR COMMITTEE  ISSUES TO GET A LOOK AT WHAT HE  WAS HOARDING AT MAR-A-LAGO? >> YEAH. IT'S NOT -- IT'S NOT AN ANSWER  WE HAVE AT THIS MOMENT. I THINK WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT  WHERE DOES THIS FALL? WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET ACCESS  TO DOCUMENTS THAT ARE  SPECIFICALLY ON NATIONAL  SECURITY AND NOTHING AS JANUARY  6th AS AN EXAMPLE, WE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO KNOW THAT, BUT I  THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO  LOOK AT THE BROAD AREAS AND IF  IT SEEMS LIKE THERE MAY BE  SOMETHING THAT IS IN A BROAD  AREA, POTENTIALLY. AGAIN, THIS IS STUFF, FROM WHAT  WE UNDERSTAND, MAY EVEN BE  BEYOND WHAT CONGRESS, SHORT OF  BEING ON A SPECIFIC COMMITTEE,  WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO.  >> WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT JUSTICE MAY BE LOOKING AT, I MEAN, I GO  BACK TO IF THIS WERE SIMPLY  ABOUT HIM MISHANDLING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION AND THE FACT THEY  ARE NOT PURSUING THAT CHARGE, IS IT FAIR TO ASSUME THEY ARE  LOOKING AT SOMETHING THAT WOULD  BE EVEN MORE SERIOUS THAN THIS? >> THAT'S MY PERCEPTION. I MEAN, LOOK. MISHANDLING CLASSIFIED  INFORMATION IS ONE THING. PARTICULARLY IF IT WAS  UNINTENTIONAL. IF YOU ACCIDENTALLY DID TAKE  SOMETHING HOME, THERE MAY BE  CONSEQUENCES, BUT I THINK YOU'D  LOOK INTO THE INTENTIONALITY OF  THAT. WHEN YOU HAVE WHAT WE APPEAR TO  KNOW, JUST THROUGH SOME OF WHAT  WE HAVE SEEN, YOU KNOW, THEY  APPROACHED THE FORMER PRESIDENT  WITH THINGS THAT HE HAD. HE CLAIMED HE EITHER DIDN'T HAVE THEM OR CLAIMED HE GAVE THEM UP. ANY OF THOSE KIND OF STUFF. WE KNOW HE DIDN'T. THERE IS INTENTIONALITY THERE. THIS SEEMS BIG. WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE  PRESIDENT'S BIGGEST KINDS OF  CHEERLEADERS, MARTHA TAYLOR  GREENE AND JIM GEORGE HAS KIND  OF GONE SILENT. THEY ARE BASICALLY SITTING HERE  SAYING WE DIDN'T START THIS FIRE AND WALKING AWAY, BUT, YOU KNOW, THEY, OBVIOUSLY, IGNITED IT. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO HAVE SAT  THERE AND TOLD THIS PRESIDENT  EVERYTHING HE DID WAS RIGHT,  EVERYTHING HE COULD DO WOULD BE  OKAY AND THEY DEFENDED HIM AT  THE BEGINNING OF THIS.  >> WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT YOU  GUYS ARE GETTING READY TO LAY  OUT TO THE PUBLIC IN SEPTEMBER,  CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT  ARE THE MISSING PIECES THAT YOU  DIDN'T HAVE THAT YOU FEEL LIKE  THE PUBLIC IS GOING TO  UNDERSTAND BETTER COME  SEPTEMBER? >> WELL, I THINK THE -- I THINK  THERE IS GOING TO BE THE A LOT  OF DEPTH WE ARE ABLE TO BUILD  WHETHER THROUGH THE HEARINGS OR  THE FINAL REPORT. IF YOU THINK ABOUT, FOR  INSTANCE, THE LAST HEARING, THE  ONE WE DID. WHAT WAS THE PRESIDENT DOING  DURING THE 18 7 MINUTES? WE DID AN HOUR AND A HALF  HEARING AND COULD HAVE DONE ONE  FOUR OR FIVE AND SOME MORE DEPTH TO SOME OF THAT AND SOME OF THE  LEAKS. I THINK ONE OF THE MORE  INTRIGUING THING IS GOING TO BE  SOME OF THE FINANCING, RIGHT? SOME OF THE FUND-RAISING. THE FACT THAT, YOU KNOW, A VAST  MAJORITY OF THIS MONEY WAS  RAISED AND UNDER, QUOTE,  UNQUOTE, STOP THE STEAL WITH NO  INTENTION OF DOING ANYTHING TO  SO-CALLED STOP A STEAL. IT WAS ALL ABOUT JUST RAISING  MONEY. AND PEOPLE WERE ABUSED THAT WAY. THIS WILL BE A LOT MORE OF THAT. I THINK WE HAVE A LOT MORE TO  FIND OUT STILL ABOUT THE SECRET  SERVICE INCIDENT. THERE IS A WHOLE LOT OF -- WE  ARE STILL SITTING AROUND LIKE  WHY DON'T WE HAVE SOME OF THESE  TEXT MESSAGES? WHY WAS SOME OF THIS STUFF  HIDDEN? I THINK WE WILL GET ANSWERS TO  THAT BY THE TIME WE CAN PRESENT  THAT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.  >> I WANT TO GET YOU TO RESPOND  TO SOMETHING RICH LOWRY WROTE IN AN OP-ED IN "THE NEW YORK  TIMES." HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE JANUARY 6th COMMITTEE AND SORT OF THE  DIFFICULTY YOU MAY BE HAVING IN  PROVING A CRIME. HE WRITES THIS. QUOTE. DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT? >> NO, NOT AT ALL. LOOK. I HAD A LOT OF RESPECT FOR RICH  LOWRY. I STILL READ HIM ON OCCASION. IT'S BEEN AMAZING TO WATCH HIS  PIVOT FROM KIND OF INTELLECTUAL  DESERVIVE TO LIKE THIS  ANTI/ANTI-TRUMPER. HE NOT NECESSARILY FOR TRUMP. HE CONSTANTLY THERE MAY NOT BE  PRECEDENCE. OF COURSE NOT. WE HAVE NEVER AN AMERICAN  PRESIDENT ATTEMPT A COUP AGAINST THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I'M QUITE SURE SOME OF THE LAWS  CAN COVER THIS. THE DOJ SEEMS CONVINCED OF IT. OUR JOB IS NOT TO PROSECUTE  TRUMP. OUR JOB IS TO PRESENT  INFORMATION TO THE AMERICAN  PEOPLE TO TALK ABOUT  RECOMMENDATIONS. HERE IS WHAT I RECOMMEND. I'M GOING TO SAY THIS BEFORE THE REPORT. I RECOMMEND WE NEVER AGAIN ELECT SOMEBODY WHO DOES NOT RESPECT  THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED  STATES, WHO DOES NOT RESPECT THE VOTERS, AND WHO ABUSES PEOPLE BY LYING TO THEM. THAT IS DONALD TRUMP. PEOPLE CAN BE ANTSY. WE ARE NOT AGAINST DONALD TRUMP  EXCEPT WE LOVE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND HE IS TEARING IT  DOWN DAILY.  >> THIS WEEK WE SAW THE  PRIMARIES IN FLORIDA AND NEW  YORK. THAT SPECIAL ELECTION IN NEW  YORK. I WANT TO READ YOU SOMETHING  MATTHEW CONNETY WROTE. QUOTE. DO YOU AGREE ESSENTIALLY WITH  THAT SENTIMENT? AND THAT THIS MAY HAVE CHANGED  THE POLITICAL COMPLEXION OF THE  MIDTERMS? >> I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY  CHANGED THE COMPLEXION OF THE  MIDTERM SOME. I DON'T KNOW HOW BIG. LOOK. I'VE ALWAYS TAKEN THE POSITION  OF RAPE, INCEST, LIFE OF THE  MOTHER, AND CERTAIN WEEKS UP TO  15 WEEKS AND WHATEVER. THAT WAS A FAIRLY COMMON THING  IN THE CAMPAIGN. NOW YOU'VE BEEN SEEING THESE  REPUBLICANS GO THERE IS  ABSOLUTELY NO EXCEPTION. BECAUSE SOMEHOW IN THE  REPUBLICAN PARTY, THE CRUELLER  YOU ARE, THE MORE LIKELY YOU ARE TO WIN A PRIMARY. SO BLAKE MASTERS, FOR INSTANCE,  CAN ERASE HIS WEBSITE ALL HE  WANTS AND NOW PRETEND LIKE HE IS SOME SOFT ON THIS BUT HE DIDN'T  BECAUSE HE USED IT TO WIN A  PRIMARY. SO, YEAH, I THINK REPUBLICANS  ARE IN REAL TROUBLE BECAUSE WE  HAVE NO LEADERSHIP. THIS IS THE PROBLEM, CHUCK. KEVIN McCARTHY ISN'T LEADING. HE IS ASKING WHAT IS MARJORIE  TRAILER GREENE WANTS ME TO DO. MITCH McCONNELL IS TRYING TO  SAVE THE SENATE. WE HAVE NO LEADERS AND NO WONDER OUR BASE BELIEVES EVERYTHING  DONALD TRUMP SAYS.  >> I'M CURIOUS. LIZ CHENEY SAID IN SOME CASES  SHE MAY HAVE TO HELP A DIAGRAM  WIN AGAINST AN ANTI-DEMOCRACY  REPUBLICAN WIN. DO YOU FEEL THAT IS WHAT YOU  WILL BE DOING THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS OR SO? >> YES. THE BIGGEST ISSUE, NOT EVERYBODY AGREES WITH ME AND CERTAINLY IN  MY PARTY AND EVEN DEMOCRATS LIKE SO SAY BUT YOU'RE STILL A  CONSERVATIVE. YEAH, I'M A CONSERVATIVE. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE  BIGGEST THREAT IT TO OUR COUNTRY IS DEMOCRACY. IF YOU HAVE REPUBLICANS THAT ARE RUNNING AGAINST EVEN LEFT WING  DEMOCRATS THAT BELIEVE IN  DEMOCRACY AND BELIEVE IN VOTING, THAT PERSON SHOULD BE ELECTED  OVER SOMEBODY WHO WOULD  OVERTHROW THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND, ULTIMATELY, DESTROY THIS  COUNTRY. THIS COUNTRY CANNOT SURVIVE  OUTSIDE OF DEMOCRACY. IT WILL TURN INTO A POWER  STRUGGLE BETWEEN GROUPS OF  DIFFERENT RACES, ETHNICITIES AND DIFFERENT RELIGION. TAKE THAT AWAY THE COUNTRY IS A  MESS. REPUBLICANS THAT ARE FOR THAT  HAVE NO PLACE IN OFFICE. I DON'T CARE WHAT THEIR POLICY  POSITION ON TAXES ARE.  >> ADAM

recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina mr. McHenry vice chairman of our committee Thank You mr. chairman so I have the honor of representing the suburbs of Charlotte North Carolina North Carolina had incredible banking culture over decades yet in Charlotte first union homegrown bank great reputation went through challenging times in the economic crisis as you well know but before that time they teamed up with a bank based in winston-salem wachovia and as you know in acquiring what was then called wachovia which is really first union in wachovia the pitch was that your culture from california was very similar to this North Carolina culture spanking culture but you know you and as you well know John Grimes Midland who is a great chairman of wachovia sort of it imbued in wachovia this culture that a banker is a civil servant as well there's this obligation to society they have in their community you eulogize them yes paid tribute to that culture yes so I want to think about that culture because what what is so sad to me is that pitch of culture doesn't conform with my experience with my constituents in North Carolina it doesn't conform what I know about First Union would I know about wachovia and this cultural pitch that you had in acquiring them in the financial crisis I know you have a huge head count in North Carolina we're grateful for it but what's sad to me is the impact of this on them and those employees you have in North Carolina so I wanted to look at your code of conduct the u tau so let's look at your code of ethics and Business Conduct you said in your message is CEO we are all responsible for maintaining the highest possible ethical standards and how we conduct our biz and serve our customers the code of ethics and set in fact says our code applies to all team members including officers as well as directors of Wells Fargo and company and its subsidiaries it also says we are all accountable for complying with the code as well as all company policies and applicable laws and finally it's critical that all team members have a solid understanding of our company's code of ethics and Business Conduct and understanding that non-compliance with the policy may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment you clearly have failed you've clearly failed in your own ethical standards internally you have broken and your company is broken long-standing law you've broken long-standing ethical standards that you have within your company this has nothing to do with this this debate about dodd-frank or anything else you've broken a long-standing law and you've defrauded your customers how can you rebuild trust how can you built rebuild trust and how can you get through this thing what standards are you holding yourself to that sends the message to the rest of these folks in your organization that look to you for leader leadership and guidance what are you doing to restore that yes well Thank You congressman the culture of the company is strong and I don't I I know it's really hard to say that when you're before Congress for the second time and in the and behind you was all the settlements you've had for problematical relationship problematic relationships you've had with your customers by taking their money right counter to the law counter to your ethical standards so it's great you say you have a strong culture but why are we here today how are you addressing that we are addressing it first of all with respect to culture you know we have two hundred sixty eight thousand people who have made their life's work and careers out of helping customers there's people today who are out with yeah that's why I raised this in the way that I do by severe disappointment severe disappointment that's all you broke the law we make the law in Congress this is not new stuff that all the sudden Congress changed some rules and you you can't have your employees create fake accounts and take fees from customers unknowingly unwittingly that is that is there's never in human history when that has been an ethical okay right conferred you say the culture is okay this seems to me that you're just tone deaf to this the final thing you need to think about and your board of directors need to think about is this the impact you have is not simply on your institution but the wider conversation on how my consumers can access credit and the implications on what you've done in your leadership has done has this broader societal impact that is very negative time the gentleman has expired the chair now recognizes

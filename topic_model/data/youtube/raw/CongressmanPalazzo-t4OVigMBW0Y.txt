but we recognize the state of Mississippi and our newest member mr. pallazzo well thank you mr. chairman and before I get in the questions I'd briefly like to express my gratitude and appreciation to the Appropriations Committee the members of Congress our conference for allowing me to serve in the seat our friend and colleague Alan Nunnelee held I know everyone who knew him is heartbroken of his passing and although I do not believe his shoes can be filled I hope to serve this committee with the best interest the United States and in mind just as our good friend Alan did for four years with that said dr. I mean director Comey I appreciate you being here and appreciate the sacrifices that your your people the magic and your agency as you so eloquently said provides for you know our security and protection here at home and I'm sorry for your loss to as well as the three FBI agents you mentioned we too have lost the US Marshal and Josie wells in the past month and he's from south Mississippi and it was in the line of duty and he left a wife and unborn child to carry on his legacy so we know what you which i'll sacrifice day in and day out and some of the best people in the world serve in our law enforcement I would like to follow up real quick on you know the chair the chairman Rogers mentioned he brought up China and China something from armed service and Homeland Security my former committees has always piqued my curiosity they seem to be aggressively building up their military and their space capabilities and it is sounded I don't want to put words in your mouth that we know China the government of China is involved in cyber attacks on American on American government and American Enterprise in so knowing that and just lighting five individuals to kind of you know oh you know expose them and shame them I didn't I don't think really works with with China since it has the consent of their gut so with that how do we counter the site would you recommend to us on how we counter these cyber threats both internally and externally and I guess I already namecoin found on them I just like to hear your laws thank you and I should have said I may have misspoken that the three lives that were lost were of police officers one state trooper and two local police officers have a great doesn't make any difference it's still great people lost in line of duty with respect to China or any nation state actor that's engaged in cyber intrusion activity United States the question about what can be done more broadly about them is one that's both beyond the can of the FBI and one that that even if it was the FBI's Lane we wouldn't discuss in an open forum but what we're trying to do is make sure our responsibility is to investigate cyber intrusions the United States to make sure that our government has a full understanding of who's doing what so we can figure out as a country what to do about it one of the things that we have been involved in is bring criminal charge against some of those actors as part of a toolbox approach to try and change behavior with the Chinese there are a lot of other things that are beyond the FBI that I know have gone on diplomatic for example and it's part of a lot of international forums our government i know is working to try and adopt some norms and get the Chinese to go along with them but it is my function at the FBI is to understand what they're doing develop the facts and then show our government here's what we see well understand you know that the cyber threat is real and I think Congress and the American people are recognizing that it's real and it's a clear and present danger I hope we're doing everything that we can as members of Congress to provide your agency as well as others with the resources to counter this threat because it's not just illegally downloading music but it's a huge fear that if they engage in some form of cyber attack that it could you know  our critical infrastructure you know you last thing I'd want to see is the lights go out and your ATM doesn't work your navigation on your car and your phone I think it would cause a huge amount of panic in our in our country you also mentioned something about the siren song of the radical Islamists and in these people that you mentioned we don't really see them they're not you know obvious to us and the large extent because they're in their basements consuming this form of poison can you well I guess a lack of a better word profile what this person would be in is there certain you know something about their demographics that make them vulnerable to this poison because I agree with you it is a poison and we don't need our young you know we don't need anybody in America consuming it yeah in a way I wish I could that's one of the challenges of this threat is when we talk about travelers the people that we know who have gone to Syria to hook up with ISIL range from 18 to 62 they're from any part of the country any background right they are we're either raised in Islamic faith or are converts who then but they may have all different kinds of backgrounds be all different places the United States consume this and develop this view that this is how they'll find meaning in life so they are the one common characteristic they have which unfortunately is not a great marker for me finding them is they are people who are troubled soul seeking meaning in life but there's not a poverty marker right some of them have jobs they just have a misguided sense that they need to participate in the apocalyptic battle some of them are kind of losers right who have had trouble with jobs or petty crimes but there isn't a particular pattern we've studied it pretty closely very closely and search for the pattern but so far I can't I can't offer you one Thank You director around I yield back Thank You mr. chairman

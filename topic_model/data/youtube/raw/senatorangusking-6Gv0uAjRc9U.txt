mr. president I called a an amendment up that's now on the floor of the United States Senate and it is a very very simple one maybe one of the most straightforward short amendments offered in the course of this debate the amendment is very simple that simply refers this committee this bill back to the committee with instructions to bring back a bill which is deficit-neutral and I believe that can be done and I think it can be done you know in a very short period of time and I think it's important and I'm going to outline why but before I get to that I'd like to mention that senator tester senators tester Whitehouse Harris Van Hollen Cain Warner Bennett Udall hike camp Manchin Coons and Feinstein are all announced supporters of this amendment and I wanted to offer my thanks and appreciation to them for their assistance again the ax men was very simple recommit the bill have the committee work it once more and come back to the Senate floor with a bill that does not bust the deficit this is one of the most important votes any of us will take in this body I think it may be the most important this is a bill that will affect America and Americans for a generation if past history is any guide this will be the major tax reform bill in the next 20 to 30 years it will affect every business every citizen and our entire economy the stakes in other words are incredibly high and it's my assumption that when the stakes are high the process the bar for the process would also be high if you're doing something with such enormous ramifications it's common sense that you would take a great deal of care to thoroughly understand the provisions of the bill its implications its impacts its possible unintended consequences and be as careful as would be possible in order to determine how this bill will affect our country and our economy instead mr. president we have the worst possible process in other words we have the highest stakes and the lowest process it's the worst process I think I've ever seen in a public body the Bangor City Council would not amend the leash law using this process we are talking about one of the most important bills any of us will ever vote on that has had zero hearings before the United States Senate it has had no input from the citizenry no input from outside of the the community of this body in fact the committee that has brought the bill to the floor no expert no outside expert analysis there are bound to be mistakes in this bill in fact I have a new rule I'm proposing today I'm calling it modestly Kings law Kings law is the faster a bill goes through this body the worse it will be and that's what we're talking about today we're talking about bringing something through the United States Senate supposedly the world's most deliberative body with little or no deliberation and the impacts are going to be enormous I just believe that we can slow down and do this right in 1986 the last time there was a major tax reform in this country it's very instructive to look back and watch and look and see how they did it number one it was bipartisan from the beginning it was bipartisan from the beginning and the Senate Finance Committee had 33 hearings on the bill 33 as compared with zero have we really fallen that far in this institution that we can't even have a series of hearings to understand what it is that we're doing it took 10 months to consider that bill and to come to a conclusion and a vote on the Senate floor 10 months we're talking about a matter of days for the consideration of this bill and the final point about the 1986 bill is that it passed the Senate with 90 votes that could happen here I was on a stage with 16 colleagues members of the Democratic caucus two days ago all of whom are prepared ready and anxious and able to support tax reform including cutting the corporate tax rate to make our businesses more competitive but there's been no process to let them in to allow them to talk to the point I'm trying to make here is that the vote that we take tonight or tomorrow morning or whenever it is does not have to be the end of this process it can be the beginning of a real process which is what it should be now my real concern or one of my concerns there are a lot of problems with this bill but the concern that I want to focus on today in the background of my amendment which recommence and ask that the committee come back with the deficit-neutral bill is the debt and the deficit itself this is a chart that should strike fear into the hearts of every American this is basically the history of our national debt as a percentage of gross domestic product this isn't dollars because that can be misleading dollars of course are worth less than now than they were in 1930 or in in 1850 so this is percent of gross domestic product it starts back in 1790 when the the the the early Americans were paying off the debt from the Revolutionary War and if you notice there's a pattern here that stops right here the pattern is when we get into major catastrophes including Wars that's when we have to borrow money and that's what we did and here's the Civil War but it was paid down 1910 then World War one another huge expenditure this is why you preserve your borrowing power for when you actually need it and then World War two now this line that goes down right here is the greatest generation the greatest generation not only fought World War two they paid for it they paid down the debt and it goes down into the 1970s and then we have a bump up and then down but look where we're headed look where we're headed we're headed to a place where we aren't going to be able to sustain this debt everybody knows that and yet the bill that we're voting on today expands the deficit by somewhere between half a trillion and two and a half trillion dollars depending upon how it's all sorted out of course it's there's a little bit of fake bookkeeping where the personal changes to the tax code expire in order to not bump up the cost within the budget window but everybody knows and people on the majority who are supporting this bill are winking and nodding saying of course those will be extended well you can't have it both ways you can't say they're going to be extended and take credit for that and yet and then turn around and say oh don't worry about the deficit this this is the greatest generation this is the me2 generation that's not paying for things and it's shameful it's shameful and it is going to come back to haunt us here's why we are now in a column Alice in Wonderland of interest rates the lowest interest rates that we've had in my lifetime around 2% is what we're paying on our federal debt the problem is the average for interest rates on our federal debt over the last 50 years is about five and a half percent well it's a real easy calculation when the debt is 20 trillion dollars one percent on the debt is 200 billion dollars a year if you go to five and a half percent just interest on the debt is 1.1 trillion dollars now if that number rings a bell to anyone in this room that's because that's the size of the entire current federal discretionary budget defense and non-defense 1.1 trillion dollars just in interest interest rates are already starting to creep up this is not an abstract fear this is a high likelihood now I've been around public life and politics for a long time and I've heard a lot about deficits and people are concerned about deficits until today the deficit doesn't seem to be a big deal anymore I predict but after this bill passes within a couple of years when the deficits start to mount up the same people are voting for this bill today are going to say oh my goodness we have these huge deficits what are we going to do I think we have to cut entitlement cut Social Security we have to cut Medicare and certainly we have to cut all those domestic programs well mr. chairman I just don't mr. president I don't think that's right we had a hearing this morning in the Armed Services Committee with a group of people talking about our national defense strategy and virtually everyone at that table I think there were five or six agreed that the cost of rebuilding our defense our defense capability over the next ten years will be about a trillion dollars that's over and above the current defense budget so we're talking about an additional trillion dollars that happens to be the amount that this budget that this tax bill will suck out of the revenues of this country and be unavailable for any purpose including defense those who are concerned in this body about national security should be very concerned about this bill I believe it will make it impossible to do the kind of restoration of the national security apparatus in this country that is necessary because we're not going to have the money what we're doing is simply borrowing money for our children to give ourselves tax cuts that's really the essence of what's going on here if we were cutting taxes and a revenue neutral basis that would make sense I think you can make an argument we're going to broaden the base and lower the rates all of those kinds of things can be done you can get the stimulative effect but instead all we're doing is shifting the tax to our kids if you're already in a deficit situation and you cut taxes further it makes a hole you fill the hole with borrowed money that borrowed money is going to have to be paid back by these young people that are sitting in this room today mr. president if five-year-olds knew what we were doing and could vote none of us would have a job because we are spending their money it's as if you're lying on your deathbed you call your children over to hear your last words and your last words are here's the credit card we had a great vacation your mother and I you pay the bill that's what we're doing and it's wrong it's unethical we are passing the bill on to our children now I know that the purpose here is to stimulate economic growth and I'm all for it and I believed and said earlier on I can see where a reduction of corporate tax rates and offshore rates is called for to make us competitive in the world economy but the idea that these tax cuts are going to pay for themselves it's never happened it's never happened it hasn't happened didn't happen to the Bush tax cuts hasn't happened in Kansas it just hasn't happened so we're talking about a dramatic increase in the federal deficit on top of what's already coming that's what's really bothersome about this we can't talk about this bill in isolation without acknowledging we're already spending half a trillion dollars a year more than we're taking in in relatively good times these are the times when we should be paying back this debt not making it worse no rational business would be taking on debt when they're doing well when you're doing well you pay down your debt and then you have a reserve for when you need it we have no reserve we're using up our cushion we're using up whatever cushion we might need for disasters for some kind of heaven forbid of conflict or simply for a recession this is an incredibly destructive bill and it doesn't have to be that way it doesn't have to be that way this is a place where I believe we can work together this isn't a yes-or-no issue I understand the health care debate was really a yes-or-no issue do you want to repeal the Affordable Care Act or not that was yes or no this however is about numbers should the corporate rate be twenty five twenty to twenty eight or twenty or how do you deal with the AMT or the estate tax or the personal exemption all of those dials can be changed in order to achieve a targeted growth which is what we all want and I realize growth is the best way to solve this problem without at the same time exacerbating this really serious deficit problem that we're headed into there are provisions of this bill that have nothing to do with economic growth the estate tax what does that have to do with it eliminating the AMT what does that have to do with economic growth it's these there there are provisions of this bill that don't meet the theory of the bill and yet significantly aggregate aggravate its fiscal effect so mr. chairman again a mr. president again my amendment is really very straightforward recommit the bill come back with a deficit neutral bill which I think can be done it doesn't take it wouldn't take a month but have some hearings that will get us some information about what the impacts of this bill will be and we will have a much better bill it could be a bipartisan bill and we can meet the responsibilities that we have to the American people mr. president I believe that we owe the people no less as I said at the beginning there will be no more important bill we can vote on in this body in our careers and we owe it to the American people to number one understand fully what we're voting on and two to do it in the most careful possible way to be the most targeted and most effective and most responsible change that we can make in order to help our economy and also help all the people of this country there are many other issues with the bill but I chose today to focus in my remarks and also on my amendment on the effects on the deficit because I think it's one of the most long-term threats in fact a former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said the national debt is the most serious threat to our national security in the long run and to aggravate it unnecessarily as this bill would do I think is irresponsible mr. president we can do better I am sure of that if we'll slow down listen to one another and do what the American people expect of us

my next guest is a member of Congress from the great state of Florida he's my congressman in fact and he's just been appointed the president Trump's Advisory Committee on reopening the US economy congressman Matt Kate's glad to have you back on the show welcome Thank You governor I want to get into on some of the things that have been very controversial during this shutdown mayors governors saying you can't go fishing you can't mow your lawn you can't buy seeds you can't sit in your own car in the parking lot of a church how many liberties are we willing to give up and for what purpose how does that make us safer some of those things obviously no one in our country expected to be dealing with a crazy Chinese bat virus at this point in time but in the wake of that experience we have to have the spirit of a great American renewal we have to understand that Americans have to be able to go outside again and interact with one another at safe distances with exquisite hygiene but that we cannot fundamentally change American life and my concern governor is that particularly at the local government level we're starting to see some real infringement on people's liberties whether it's telling folks that they can't hang out in their own backyard or even in some cases municipalities have used Chinese drones and video surveillance to spy on people in their own backyards or how about a New York City where the government was actually setting up snitch lines for neighbors to rat out other neighbors I am so grateful that we have an attorney general like Bill Barr who wants to vindicate the rights and liberties of Americans there are some legitimate concerns about not only government overreach but if we're using Chinese drones don't we have some anxiety that that information is going to be sent right straight to the Chinese Communists well if this pandemic has taught us anything it's truly a wake up call about our relationship with China whether it's the need to read to masticate our supply chain whether it's the need to pull funding from joint ventures like the Wuhan Institute of virology where they had our resources but then didn't share information with the world about the sequencing of this virus or whether it is in fact Chinese technology in our country deployed by Huawei or deployed by other Chinese companies in the form of telecommunications or yes even video drones and so in dealing with and defeating the Chinese Wuhan virus we should not invite China to have a greater role in our country for us to be more reliant on China or potentially to even risk a public health crisis becoming a national security risk the President appointed you to be on the congressional Advisory Committee on reopening the economy what are some of the steps that you're gonna recommend that we need to take to get businesses up and running in people back to work 26 million out of work right now how do we start fixing that I met with the president this week and discussed recommendations that involved layering on opportunity for people to get back to work as soon as possible I don't believe that every industry every circumstance every region of the country is going to deal with the same level of risk or the same acuity of disease and so I think that empowering local communities to be able to reopen with the best medical advice is important it's also important governor that we use this as an opportunity to raise the standards for our health care capacity I believe people will have more confidence to be able to engage in economic activity again if we see that we in fact have more ability in our country to have our pharmaceuticals made here if we have ventilators that are made here if we have more elastic capacity in our hospital systems to be able to respond if there are any flare-ups I think those the types of steps that give people confidence and I think that as we begin to reopen you know small doctors offices nurse practitioners dentists will continue to see that confidence build within the American people congressmen before we let you go Roger stone was just with us in the segment before you you were on the view and got criticized big surprise when you said you would support a pardon for Roger stone would you still support one and do you think the president will do it the should a pardon stone and I suspect he will we've just learned in the last few days that our own government knew that the sub sources of the steel dossier that they were using were the targets of Russian intelligence and that Russian intelligence was actually trying to use this process to discredit President Trump and discredit our election now that we know that the origins of this investigation were so deeply flawed I think it's understandable to not have Roger stone disproportionately carry the burden of the Muller experience that we probably should have never gone through in the first place I agree wholeheartedly my thanks to congressman

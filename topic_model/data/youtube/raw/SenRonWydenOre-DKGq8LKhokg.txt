very much um mr. chairman I look forward to working with you senator Cardin is here Senate Roberts look forward to working with all our colleagues the Trump administration has taken a qualified nominee and dumped him right into the middle of a dark money political firestorm of their own creation and a radical change in tax law regarding transparency and disclosure has dragged the IRS and Treasury into a swirling set of questions about the president's foreign financial ties and his motivations as a result this nomination is no longer an isolated debate that can begin without some context on Monday morning news broke that a Russian national with alleged ties to Russian intelligence was arrested for and I quote here using a gun rights organization as a conduit to infiltrate and influence our economy a Russian national using a gun rights organization to infiltrate our democracy just a few hours later the Trump administration unveiled a pro corruption transformation of our tax law that would make it even easier for Russia to get away with it the next time it was a good day for dark money mr. chairman and colleagues our laws regarding donor disclosure and campaign finance were already horribly broken before this change was announced and by the way I had no notice of it there were no hearings on it it was just sprung on us so the laws were broken before the change was announced that was true even before the Citizens United ruling now the latest blow dark money groups used to be required to clothes their donors to the IRS now they won't be required to disclose at all not only it's the Trump administration's move dangerously undemocratic it goes straight into the Hall of Fame of shameless partisan politics it's a signal to the public the administration is more interested in protecting foreign metal errs than American voters and it came just hours after the president stood at a lectern next to a murderous dictator praised him and through our intelligence professionals under the bus so in my view what happened this week leads to a few conclusions and next steps first this committee has to hold a hearing on the Trump administration's move to allow more dark money to influence and undermine our elections as I stated this was a change never debated in this room or in any public venue it was basically plucked from the dream list of deep pocketed groups on the far right who want to rewrite our laws to their benefit the Congress and the American people need to know how the administration came to this decision who they discussed it with and what the full implications will be going for it I will save the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee someone who worked with Chairman hatch on these issues before I was not informed anything about this it's long past time to make several major changes to the laws in this area so the people can have confidence our elections aren't bought and sold second mr. Chairman I believe the committee needs to see Donald Trump's tax returns we ought to set up a time as is provided in statute to discuss this an executive session because this week proved enough is enough people across the country across the globe are still reeling from the president's conduct in Helsinki in London and meetings of NATO and our partners over the last several days there is a serious question did the presidents lavish praise on Putin and slam on our allies take place because he prefers strong men to democratic elect elected leaders or is it because he is personal and financial connections to Russia that Vladimir Putin is exploiting the committee needs answers to that question and those answers eventually need to become public reviewing the president's tax returns would be a start might not uncover the full picture because the ties between Russia the president expensive business organizations he and his family continue to run are certainly complicated and very well concealed but the president's refusal to adhere to a 40 year plus bipartisan Pro transparency tradition of releasing tax returns after what happened this Monday can go on no longer finally there are more questions in my view that ought to be investigated with the usual bipartisan approach we bring mr. chairman that includes further inquiries into the nras role in the 2016 election Michael Cohen's influence-peddling and the conduct of the Trump foundation as of right now we on this side of the dais have no dance partners to proceed as is the best tradition of the Finance Committee in a bipartisan way I hope that changes because one thing has become clear with the string of explosive revelations in the last few weeks what the president calls a witch-hunt is turning up a lot of witches as to the nomination the committee scheduled to vote on today I want to close with this for now despite his qualifications I'm unable to support mr. Renick I have appreciated the productive conversations I have had with him since he was nominated as soon as this hearing ends I intend to ask mr. Rettig to meet with me to discuss what he will do if confirmed to protect our country from a new flood of dark money potentially foreign to further infect our politics colleagues this week has been about as far from business as usual as I can remember and what the Trump administration announced late on Monday after a Russian national is indicted for trying to infiltrate our politics just yanks control of our democracy even further from the hands of the American people so today I'll be a no thank you mr. chairman

well good afternoon everyone and welcome to another edition of hot seat with hinson i'm congresswoman ashley henson from iowa's first congressional district running in the new second congressional district and i am so pleased today to have a fabulous candidate joining us for congress uh state senator jenn kiggins out of virginia is running in virginia's second district to help flip that seat from blue to red jen thank you so much for joining us today i am so proud to support you i've been out to your district to to to ask your people to support you too because i think it's just that important that we have truly qualified uh citizen legislators coming to work in congress and um i need you by my side there so we can help fire nancy pelosi but could you tell me jen uh and everyone watching today a little bit more about your race specifically um and a little bit more about you yeah yeah thanks ashley thanks for having me today and thank you so much for coming out to virginia beach a few months ago it was great to have you out here and just to have that support so thank you for that so i'm running to represent virginia's second congressional district which is the hampton roads area in virginia virginia beach uh eastern shore with redistricting it got a little bit bigger a lot more conservative it's uh more republican now so it's great so it's definitely a top race for the republican party in a seat that we need to flip to get the u.s house majority back this year so we're super excited about that a little bit about me i'm a former navy pilot i flew helicopters in the navy for 10 years blue age 46 is in h3 10 of the best years of my life i met my husband who flies f-18s uh and deployed a couple times the persian gulf got out of the military to be a stay-at-home mom to four children where i was able to to be a navy spouse and just a full-time mom and uh get my kids to school and pay our bills and and run the house so i certainly understand all those challenges and then used my gi bill and went back to nursing school and then went to vanderbilt get my nurse practitioner degree and currently practice as an adult geriatric nurse practitioner and primary care and have done just a lot of work in nursing homes assisted living memory care so those are a group of people that i'm i'm just love to be an advocate for our greatest generation they're often a voiceless group and just really looking forward this year to to running for congress i ran for the state senate in 2019 and that was a tough year for for republicans in virginia it was the year of the blue wave here but a great victory in the state senate and i've certainly learned a lot about one party rule we've had a democrat-controlled house senate uh in governor for the first two years of my term and really it was a jewelry store smash and grab they came in and got whatever they wanted and the governor signed it so i lived through that kind of danger and insanity of one party political rule and i see the same thing happening up in up in dc and it's a fight you guys have on a daily basis uh that's the same danger in sandy that same far left progressive agenda uh that we need the majority back because you know numbers matter and every vote counts so so i want to be a part of that group that comes in and helps to get you guys the majority in the u.s house and fire nancy pelosi once and for all well i think you you hit the nail on the head here uh this democrat majority and it's the democrat party of today has taken the country in the wrong direction and we continue to see these progressive priorities play out uh telling parents they don't matter um telling um taxpayers they don't matter right i mean ultimately that's what we continue to see with these policies that continue to spur record high inflation um and uh gas prices that are through the roof i mean your district is i'm sure not immune to those challenges and so i'm sure you're hearing about those issues everywhere you go uh democrats who i talked to say they feel like the democrat party today has left them and so we tell them hey there's a place for common sense republican policies in congress and um i'm so i'm proud to fight for those and i know you will be as well and i think it's really important to talk about another issue we have a lot we have growing ranks of republican women in congress right now i look at a lot of my colleagues that came in in 2020 we were just getting started with that republican women red wave but we understand that there is more work to do there but i think it's crucial you talk about your background jen um you you fit the people of your district and uh it's important to have you there to tell stories common sense stories about the life experiences you have so um i think it's great to have more conservative women in congress and i'm sure you hear that throughout your district too very much so i was watching when you all were elected two years ago and i was watching even before that and i said you know where are the republican women we were so few in numbers i think down to 13 at one point and the democrats were light years ahead up in the 80s and and that really spurred my interest in politics and just in in running for elected office in general because we we need there are conservative women out there and we are not represented well and as a conservative female veteran you know where where are they and there's really just one i think in the u.s house right now so so uh my district is is a huge veteran population and i really feel strongly just about being not just a woman but but a veteran and a good conservative in the state of virginia as well interestingly we have three women who are democrats who represent virginia up in the u.s house elaine lorea who i'm running against and then abigail spamberger and jennifer wexton uh we have no republican women that represent the women the conservative women of virginia so we've got to uh to elect a republican woman this is the year to do it yeah absolutely it's high time virginians have a republican woman in congress and we are very lucky here in iowa to have two women veterans serving in washington dc we have senator joni ernst and we have uh congresswoman marianne at miller meek so we have a great representation for our veterans here in iowa and um i'm so proud of your record of standing up for veterans um in virginia and look forward to adding you to our conversations about veterans issues in washington d.c that is so important and they need to be the right policies right and that's really what our focus is on on helping whether or not it's um you know parents or veterans um or senior citizens it has to be the right policies and that's where i know you have that that experience to draw on you talk about uh inflation and the impact on on our veteran community it's huge right i mean many people are living on fixed incomes and um that really is digging into their bottom line so can you talk about what you've heard a little bit on some of those key issues from your account well the economy and the the record-breaking inflation is affecting everyone republicans democrats independents veterans non-veterans i mean every single american is impacted by this so it's an issue that we need to address what are we going to do what are the republicans going to do once we regain the majority this year you know to curb some of that inflation because americans will want to see results from us so uh you know i'm excited to to help you guys get that majority so we can get some things done i'd like to see some more energy independence because everything is really a lot of it is stemming from these these ridiculous gas prices that we're all paying you know my kids used to ask for twenty dollars to fill up their old civic that they drive to high school a week and now it's costing about sixty dollars to fill up my kids honda civic so they can drive to their school and activities and uh and that's three times more than i than i have been paying so we're all feeling that at the pump so that you know we're getting some of the energy independence with reopening the keystone pipeline finding some domestic oil production sources uh those are things we need to push for we also need to really watch our spending up in dc i really think money grows on trees up there is is that the message that i'm getting with the amount of spending that's coming out of the biden administration uh and we've got to stop paying people to stay home we paid people we paid people not only on the state level but we pay people extra from some of the stimulus money that the congresswoman i'm running against voted for uh this is ridiculous amounts of spending uh some of the priorities that the democrats have bought to the table build back better uh you know as an example of just some of those trillions of dollars worth of spending if we don't find places to cut costs and reduce reduce our deficit and at least have a goal of working towards a more balanced budget then we're going to see inflation continue to rise and we're going to get to that recession that we're all worried about right well and i unfortunately were already seeing those signs of an economy contracting and that record high inflation paired together um these are not coincidences in my mind these are the predictable results of policies that put our country last um and focused on woke priorities over the future of our country and that you're exactly right jen we have to focus on looking at the future long term and lay out a plan to do that and it's not something that is going to be fixed overnight we need to be putting out a long-term vision for the future of our success of our country because this is about the future of our kids um this is about that next generation and the generation after that because i know it's not lost on me that the decisions we are making today in congress will impact generation after generation um and i'm still hopeful that the the greatest generation is yet to come i hope that for my kids and and my grandkids and and for the generations that follow that everything can be better freedom and opportunity can be available for every single american no matter what their background and so i know that you'll continue to fight that fight um to help get our um contra our country back on track um how do you think the military perspective will help you um to cut through some of this this red tape that exists within our federal government yeah uh it's always a priority in my mind you know as a veteran as a navy spouse as a mother now to veterans i have a son who's a junior at the naval academy and one who's a freshman in rotc at bmi so i i now think of my children and the decisions that that we're making for our military and how that will impact my kids and their friends so i want to see it at that table i want to be a voice uh and some of that decision making pro you know the progress that we will see i'll say this for the second district in virginia we have one of the largest populations of veterans in the country and we care right we care what happened in afghanistan in the fall that that withdrawal that was a that was a ridiculous ridiculous way to leave a country that killed 13 service men and women uh that we need to continue to remind people about they died they did not need to die that day so we are disappointed uh it was it was failed leadership it was weak leadership uh you know we're at a point now where our friends aren't trusting us as much and our enemies certainly aren't fearing us as much uh and a result of that weak leadership and leading from behind we're seeing some of the aggression that's happened for example in the ukraine and russia so we've got to do a better job of building up strength in our nation and being that deterrent that i know that we are and that's the military that i come from my dad was a vietnam veteran as well so i bring those perspectives and you know i'm a big piece to strength girl so it's that perspective alone uh you know with a lot of common sense added in and a lot of different backgrounds just as a mom a healthcare professional but those are the things i bring to the table that that really uh just weigh in on all the decisions i make and i'm excited to to use all my backgrounds to to uh just put good policy in place in dc yeah well and i appreciate you bringing up those challenges that we face both in afghanistan and obviously now with the situation happening and unfolding daily in ukraine um we need to be strong right on the global stage and what we've seen is uh reactive policies instead of proactive policies and um that's unfortunately set our country and our and our global relations up for many many challenges and so i think we we need to be very very clear about where we stand as a country to continue to express that strength and we need to have a strong military uh to to make sure we're focused on the basics here which is safety security and freedom if we don't have that then all is lost so we should all be fighting for that as a shared value going forward to protect our country and protect our future so um for people who are watching today who want to learn more about your campaign and

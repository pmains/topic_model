stewby recovering after falling off a 25-foot ladder while cutting tree limbs on his Florida property this happened late last month his office says he suffered several serious injuries the Florida Congressman joins us now Greg stubey thank you so much for coming on National report Congressman this is your yeah this is your first interview on Newsmax since your your injury so for many viewers maybe seeing you again for the first time and it's great to see you by the way in great health can you walk us through what happened and perhaps maybe you know you go through injuries sometimes in lives or hurdles if you will and you learn something from it and you take something that could be applied to Everyday Life what what did you learn and and what happened and where are you today yeah the trauma surgeon said he added extension ladders and chainsaws to my allergy list so maybe that'll have some impact going forward but I was trimming trees on our property we've got some property out in East Sarasota County and we still dealing with the effects of Hurricane Ian a lot of us still trying to trim tree trees and that sort of thing I was about 25 feet up and the limb Broke Free as I was cutting through it with the chainsaw it hit the extension ladder ejected me up into the air and then I fell down and as God prevented provincially put in place there was an Amazon driver that was there at the exact moment that I fell he saw the whole thing happen he was able to uh come to my Aid call 9-1-1 arrange for the ambulance to come onto the property and get me to the hospital before anybody in my family even realized what was going on I sustained a concussion tore ligaments in my neck I have a contusion in my lungs which is why I can't fly to DC until March I don't get cleared medically to do that and then I have a crack in my pelvis right where the hip joint goes in so I'm non-weight-bearing for about six weeks but we're on the mend I get stronger and healing every day and I just got to give it that time for that bone to heal and my lung to heal up and looking forward to get back to Washington and do the things that my constituent voted me to do absolutely well look we're glad to see you on the road to recovery happy to hear about the Amazon worker that was there at the right place at the right time amen and also the dog that's with you that was keeping you company you're going to give your recovery as well that man's best friend uh but you are as we see there but you are um you are able to watch maybe a lot more television I'm assuming um you're seeing what's happening uh obviously not being able to fly to Washington you may have caught President Biden for the first time addressing the three unidentified flying objects shot down last week not including the one reportedly from China but many questions are still out there I'm sure there are with you let me play this for you this is the commander-in-chief on that we don't yet know exactly what these three objects were but nothing nothing right now suggests they were related to China's spy balloon program we see competition not conflict with China we're not looking for a new Cold War I will remain in communication with President XI so again um demanding of a lot of answers there are a lot of questions not a lot of answers is that the same for you Congressman have you received any briefings on the the three objects is the president's uh message um strong enough does it have enough substance well it's definitely not strong enough the Chinese Communist party is the number one national security threat to our nation and he stood by for eight days and let a air balloon with surveillance capabilities from the Chinese Communist Party Traverse our entire country and on the three latest ones that they shot down uh and used fighter jets to shoot down um we had a briefing this week and they told us they didn't know exactly what it was well if they didn't know what it was and that wasn't the Chinese Communist Party surveilling or another uh Rogue Nation surveilling on us and why did you uh shoot him down so there's still a lot of questions and not a lot of answers and we had a briefing this week for all members of Congress and a lot of members of Congress some of which are former Pilots who've fought in fighter jets asked very specific questions and didn't get any answers and then when we asked very specific questions about what the White House was doing when the president was advised why for eight days the president refused to shoot down a balloon that they knew was the Chinese Communist Party surveillance balloon balloon uh why did they let that Traverse our entire country go over nuclear basis go over B2 bomber bases we didn't get any answers from that yeah that's the big questions that many have why was this one allowed to travel eight days and the others they were shot down almost instantly uh and by the way those missiles that they use I believe are four hundred thousand dollars those Rockets or missiles that they use are 400 000 bucks and if it's a hobby balloon that was 18 in the air what exactly is going on uh we'll continue to ask that question but look if we're having this conversation right now and one of the customers has DirecTV they're not able to see you right now or to hear about your story I know you signed a letter to a T and DirecTV Executives based on canceling this network Newsmax questioning why they did that how is it affecting the folks in your state of Florida we've received uh so many phone calls so many emails about this people switching service what have you heard about this and the letter that you've said then yeah we've had a lot of constituents and people in my district reach out to our office outraged obviously there's also a movement amongst conservatives to say all right we're going to ban DirecTV and move to some other platform but this is what these leftist media programs do is they don't want the voices of people like President Trump and conservative voices to be heard so they just take them off their platform and make it more difficult uh for you the citizens of this country to hear from conservative voices and it's exactly what mainstream media has been doing for years and now you're seeing it come out in clear as day now I hope that Energy and Commerce it's a committee I do not sit on but I hope they start bringing these individuals the at T CEO the CEO of some of these different entities before these committees and ask them very tough questions under oath as to why they're paying liberal organizations and liberal news Medias who don't doesn't have anywhere near the viewership that Newsmax does and refusing to pay Newsmax and dropping them so there's a lot a lot of questions that I would have if I was on that committee and I sure hope that the chairman of that committee is going to bring the CEO of DirecTV before the committee so the American people can hear exactly what his reasoning is for doing what he's doing but we know we know his reasoning but let's put him under oath and ask him those questions we appreciate the kind words about the network lastly Before I Let You Go I know that you put this out on social media the beard or no beard have you gotten a response what what's the response been what's the verdict the people have spoken 68 say bring the beard back which was actually kind of surprising I had to shave it because the neck collar was rubbing me yeah um but I got the neck collar off so I guess I'm gonna have to bring that bring back the beard all right that's coming back and you're going back to Congress as soon as you get better I believe you said in March or going back to DC it's good to see you it's good to see you recovering Congressman thank you that's Greg stupid thank you also bad news for Bank of America

thank you Mr chairman and secretary McDonough first of all let me Begin by saying thank you for the amount of time that you've taken to work on the challenges we found thanks at the Sioux Falls VA facility I can tell you that there have been improvements there but your interest in helping the veterans there it was greatly appreciated and noticed and my team there has made it very clear that they appreciated the opportunity to participate with you in those meetings I hope you found it interesting and uh very much so very much so yeah the challenge is that are there you helped to alleviate some of them I would like to share with you and I as you know I've had real concerns about the implementation of care in the community in part because I really don't believe that the VA by itself has the resources to take care of all of the needs of all of our veterans and in some cases the needs of the veterans would be better served closer to home using the physician of their choice or in some cases simply because the VA doesn't have all the resources necessary on a timely basis to meet that what I'd like to share with you is with regard to care in the community from one of my team members who has been working with veterans since you were there this is his message and I think it's self-explanatory but then we can kind of discuss where we go from here in the past six months care in the community at the Sioux Falls VA has hired approximately seven additional employees to assist in the call center this solved the problem of call wait times and call drops now veterans wait only minutes or seconds to have their calls answered a huge improvement over the one hour plus wait times many had been experiencing but this seems to be where the process comes to another halt the call center verifies the veterans demographics and notes the Veterans Preference for care providers after this has been accomplished the veteran will be transferred to a scheduler in order to schedule that appointment with an in-network provider of their choice in many cases if not the majority of cases there is not a scheduler available to take that next step to schedule the appointment when that happens the veteran is told that his or her preference for care is listed and that he or she will be contacted by a scheduler when they are available currently it can take up to two months for the veteran to receive a call back to schedule that appointment unless it is an urgent or Stat situation the issue of timely and appropriate care has not been resolved and the actual scheduling wait times have not improved and are simply not acceptable the veteran is not receiving the same standard of care as civilians in the community and based upon that message I guess what I'm asking is is I recognize that you're trying to work through the issues within the VA to get a clear and concise measurement but the bottom line is is care in the community should be available and right now it appears there's still a huge amount of pressure within the VA itself to keep as many veterans as possible within the VA system and that even if their preference is to go to the through the care in the community program they're really being restricted and I'm just curious are you finding that still to be the case within the VA so uh Senator thanks very much and I was I was thrilled to be in Sioux Falls I I really appreciated the time there your team was great um and I'm glad to hear there's some progress uh what I hear when I listen to what you're what you're reading there is I hear want uh you know the waiting two months to get a call back from a scheduler is unacceptable uh one two is uh I we submitted in the report last Friday I said in my opening comments today that these periods during which we spend as much time talking to ourselves about scheduling a veteran in the community as it actually ends up taking to schedule the employee the appointment in the community is not not acceptable and so we're working through our what we call our workflows on that and uh we will get those right third what I also hear in there is I could be wrong your team knows it better than anything but there's a shortage still a shortage of people the msas we call them the schedulers it sounds this is one of the hardest jobs to fill right now in the system it has to do with wage grade and a lot of other things but uh that's part of the issue which brings me the fourth thing to respond to your question I don't think anybody that maybe look the good thing the good news is the ig's looking at this too at the one you and I have had a back and forth on the referral coordination initiative they're looking at that and we'll see what they come back with and I'm eager to find out what they come back with are there individuals who are refusing to move people into the community maybe that's not what I experience but let me just say this because the evidence I have on this I was with Rob mcdivitt last week in Des Moines he told me FY 18 he spent in Vision 23 we spent on ural's behalf uh 700 million dollars and Care in the community this year FY 22 which ends in two weeks prison 23 will spend 1.3 billion actually I think that points out the veterans really do want to use care in the community and I think your message in your opening statement your written statement that the use of VA direct care is growing but use of Community Care is growing faster third the growing use of va care is not uniform across country it's clear and I think in rural areas where it's closer to home you may very well find out that that the care in the community is perhaps growing faster and I just simply want to point out long term I think that's fair and I think that's probably a good thing we should focus on what the veteran wants and if I could and I'm over time if there is any possibility that once a veteran has been cleared rather than having the VA schedule it why not give them an authorization tell them who the providers are that are accepted and allow that veteran to to access their provider directly and save that whole 30 to 60 additional days so we have a couple of Pilots where we're testing different scheduling options and we'll be happy to brief you on those thank you thank you very much and thank you Mr chairman

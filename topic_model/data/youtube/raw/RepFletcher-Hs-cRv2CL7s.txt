followed by a period of q a from pre-submitted questions you sent in while registering i will now turn it over to congresswoman lizzie fletcher great thank you so much shirley and thanks to all of you who are joining us today for this webinar i'm really glad to be with you virtually and um and really excited to have arlene good from the irs with us today to give us a presentation uh answer some questions we got in advance um and and go through the things that are most on your mind we did get a lot of questions so i am not going to spend too long um talking now before we get started with that presentation um but i do want to thank you all for being here um and just make a couple of notes about some of the things that um we are seeing in congress and things that we're trying to do to help address some of the concerns that i know you have um as you all know as we knows we're getting into the third year of uh the coronavirus pandemic um it is the third year that the irs is uh going into tax return filing season um with the operations and staffing and workload all impacted by the pandemic and this filing season we have already heard will present a lot of challenges for taxpayers as the irs continues to work through a backlog of unprocessed returns from last year and is is really facing increasing demands as some of the adjustments and some of the things that have happened over the last couple of years lead to a lot of questions um so that's part of why we wanted to do this today to help answer questions you may have we also have a local taxpayer advocate service that we work with closely in our office and i know the taxpayer advocate service is working very hard to alleviate its backlog and i met with the taxpayer advocate uh the acting taxpayer advocate here a couple weeks ago to get an update um that they're doing a great job of clearing out the backlog of cases and issues that they are handling um and then two weeks ago when we voted on the appropriations bills the omnibus appropriations package to fund the government for fiscal year 2022. that package provided 12.6 billion dollars to help the irs deal with this backlog of returns and correspondence so in addition to the assistance of the backlog the funding will also help the agency improve customer service and its web applications modernize its technology and increase enforcement and so that is the goal um to help make sure that we're getting the irs uh the funds it needs to serve the taxpayers across the country but as a reminder we are here in our district office um where i am today um to help you with matters involving all federal agencies including the irs so if you want to open a case with our office or have questions where we may be able to help you please don't hesitate to call or email us you probably all get my weekly email that always has links and numbers in it just to make sure that you know that we're here to help you as well but today we really wanted to provide a space for you to have your questions answered about tax filing season whether it's refundable credits that you should include on your return or common errors to avoid um lots of questions there and i'm so glad to be joined by arlene goode who's a stakeholder liaison for the irs she's going to provide a presentation for us first on deadlines for filing extensions how and where to file um as well as some of the new changes like the child tax credit um and updates so she has a wealth of knowledge to bring to this discussion and i'm really grateful for her partnership and her help uh answering questions from people in the 7th congressional district today so thank you arlene for joining us i'm going to turn it over to you and then i'll circle back when it's time for questions and and we'll go through some of the questions that were submitted to our office in advance so thanks so much for being with us and i look forward to hearing your presentation thank you very much well good morning everyone and thank you miss fletcher for inviting me to speak to your constituents uh about the new changes with the tax laws so can you hear me well and can you see my powerpoint presentation okay let me just do one thing here okay now you can see okay great you can see the presentation okay fantastic so i am arlene good senior stakeholder liaison with the internal revenue service i'm located in the houston office um right now we're still virtual but my pod is in the downtown office just to give you a little background about myself i have been with the service for over 30 years i want to say 30 plus years um and i started out in customer service answering tax questions over the phone and moved on as a taxpayer specialist taxpayer service specialist and then i went into the examination division as a tax compliance officer and i'm currently in stakeholder liaison in communication and liaison so i've done a lot with the service um i've you know definitely love educating taxpayers as well as um industry taxpayers about the different tax law changes so today i'm going to just share some filing season 2022 get ready to file your 2021 tax returns so the information uh is going to mainly focus on the tax credits uh that were changed for this tax season so um hopefully you'll have your pencil and paper and you'll be able to answer ask some questions at the end of the presentation so i want to bring your attention to the irs operations during covet 19. this is on our web page uh this gives you updates including current times for returns the processing times refunds and other services we periodically update this page i just uh recently inserted this on yesterday uh you can see the dates when there's a section of what you can expect is updated and they have the dates are here so that filing a tax return was recently updated on march 18th and if there are any changes then you will see the most recent date there on this page and the information is in english and spanish so please feel free if you don't have it in your favorites then make sure you bookmark it in your favorites now also we are processing mail tax returns payments and correspondence that taxpayers have submitted now of course you know doing covet 19 has caused some significant delays in our services um they include the live phone support processing tax returns that are filed on paper and answering any mail from taxpayers so the commissioner redick has made some significant changes to get help uh with hiring as well as allowing overtime for some employees to work additional hours and also bringing back some employees that may have left the service to help with the filing season so no worries we will get your returns processed and get the refunds in your accounts as quickly as possible i also want to bring your attention to this special filing season alert this is also on irs.gov under news and announcements i did kind of highlight that so you could see that when you pull up irs.gov you may have to arrow over or hit the docs at the bottom of the page in order to get to the special filing season alert one of the alerts that was just recently updated i think as of yesterday was one of the changes with form 8962 which is with the health insurance through the marketplace so check out the alerts because they give you up-to-date information as soon as we receive the information this is our way to communicate to the public about the developments of tax returns uh refunds and any other letters or notices and much more now you asked when did filing season begin well the internal revenue service put out a news release and this is how we communicate to our taxpayers with the news release and this was as of january 10th um we informed the american people that the filing season was going to begin and open on january 24th this year we had to do a lot of updating performing programming and testing to critically ensure that our systems would run as smoothly as possible we updated our programming to make sure that the child tax credit and the um other credits re recovery rebate credits were actually uploaded so that when taxpayers file their 2021 returns then they will be able to process as smoothly as possible so that's why the um the deadlock the change in the filing date and also on the uh deadline for filing this year it's typically april 15th but it will be uh april 18th and april 18th for most taxpayers however if you have family and friends that are in um the other states of um i'm sorry in the district of columbia normally recognizes their holidays so we're dealing with the um it meant the problem the i'm sorry patriotic uh change with the the tax laws um the district of columbia there's a taxpayers who live in maine and massachusetts have until april 19th to file their tax returns not the april uh 18th so they do have an extra date and then also if you file an extension you will have until october 17 to file your tax return your individual tax returns so just wanted to make mention that the deadlines often change due to the district of columbia holidays and then also the patriotic day holidays um that is recognized by those other states now you want to know what are your options to file your tax returns where there are many options to file we recommend the free file or fillable forms and that's if your income is under 73 000 then you can use the irs software which is the irs free file you also can use a free tax preparation site which i'll talk about um shortly about the different vita sites and then we also have commercial software some of you may use those uh where you purchase those at different locations where you can upload and file your tax returns we also have the authorized e-file provider and look at our social media image we try to get the information out to uh all uh our taxpayers that use social media is the more important than ever to file your tax returns electronically this year we all found out about that from taxpayers who were entitled to receive the economic impact payment and the fastest way to get that to them was if they had uh direct deposit uh it was a safer way to get that but if you don't have a bank account then please you can get one there are many free accounts that are available at the various financial institutions also you can check the status of your refund under where is my refund now that's available 24 hours a day after you've be filed your tax return however if you paper file for whatever reason then you would need to wait until four weeks to check where's my refund so this is the free tax preparation the um they are called the vita voluntary income tax assistance centers um if you make less than 58 000 or less in 2021 then we have volunteers i don't know if they're standing by but most likely they are ready to prepare your tax return i'm also a body vita volunteer and i also volunteer to prepare tax returns as well so many um you don't have to necessarily be with the internal revenue service but if you're interested in being a vita volunteer you do receive the training but and so those are sisters that were available to receive the training then they became vita volunteers we also have the ark tax aid sites that taxpayers can go into as well the vita tool locator as well as the arp site two locators are both located on irs.gov so if you don't know where the free sites are you can go to irs.gov and then just type in the search engine vita tool locator and then we also have a toll-free number that you can call uh and just it'll look up your zip code you just type in your zip code and it will give you the closest location nearest you so um again the information is free we don't have a lot of taxpayers that take advantage of that so please share that information they can go to irs.gov backslash fida now if you don't know use the vita volunteers or the free uh file option then you can also choose a tax professional and choosing a tax professional again the information is on our website the page will give you information on what kind of tax preparer do you need depending on the type of return that you file in the additional schedules you also can check the credentials of the tax professionals and then if you have a complaint about a tax professional we will give you information on what you need to do in order to file a complaint and sometimes it's warranted so choose your tax professionals choose them wisely because they're you're ensuring that they're preparing your return based on the information that you provide and then under penalties of perjury you're saying you're set you're signing the return uh either it'd be electronically or physically signing the return saying that you agree with the information that they prepared now since you filed your tax returns you want to know how long will it take to get your refund well there are many different factors that can affect the timely uh refunds that are being issued typically we've said within 21 days within less than 21 days however with the um processing the new tax laws that with the earned income credit and the additional child tax credit um those refunds could not be released until mid-february regardless if you didn't have if if the full refund wasn't just for the earned income tax credit so those refunds didn't go out until after mid february however the with the tax law changes we may have had to send correspondence to some taxpayers uh regarding their credits or handling of their tax returns in that case a notice needed to be issued in order to request the additional information so therefore the 21 days may not apply to all taxpayers uh in some cases the um irs had to of course do the with the special handling had to ask for some additional explanation regarding the entries on your return but again our system can detect when you electronically file and that's why we encourage you to electronically file because some of the issues can be detected up front our system detect any possible errors any missing information and also and i hate to say it any suspected identity theft now we know you know as we're sleeping at night the identity thieves are out prowling and they're stealing our information so therefore if that's the case and when your returns are electronically filed if you receive a reject meaning that your return has not been accepted and it says it'll give you a reason code indicating if someone else has filed well it will say that this return has already been filed that may be an indication that someone has maybe stolen your identity just an indication but that's a conversation that you can have with your tax professional or you would need to call irs we do have information on our website about identity fraud if you feel like you're a victim of identity fraud um you'll need to file with us especially if there's a tax um ten number your taxpayers your social security number tin number has been compromised then you can file so that we can issue you an ip pin now there are um some cases also in order for you to determine when your refund is going to be issued you can as i mentioned before check where's my refund and on the irs website we will provide you with the date if it's available on when to expect the refund um and direct deposit is the safest and the fastest way for you to receive your your refund so now let me get into some of the federal changes with the tax year that will affect your 2021 return and future returns and let me just mention um the changes came about with three different laws the first was the consolidated appropriation act that came into law on december 27 2020 and that extended and made clarification and technical corrections to the cares act also the american rescue plan act of 2021 that was enacted on march 11 which was the one year anniversary of the covet 19 that was declared a global pandemic by the will world health organization now the legislation provide both immediate tax relief for tax year 2020 and tax relief for tax year 2021 and beyond and with this act under this act it gave the third rounder we issued the third round of the economic impact payment and the tax provision in 2021 also included the temporary enhancement of the child tax credit the earned income credit and the um child and dependent care credit as well as the premium tax credit and legislation also included a new series of payroll tax credits um the last one was the infrastructure investments and jobs act and that was enacted on november 15 2021 and it made a action and termination of the employee retention credit as of september 30th 2021 for all businesses other than the recovery startup business but for today we're going to focus i'm going to focus on the um cares act with the tax law credits with the tax credits the america and so what right now i want to kind of highlight under the american rescue plan act which issued the third round of the economic impact payment and uh with this the american rescue plan made significant and temporary enhancements as i mentioned to the child and dependent care credit the earned income credit the child tax credit um so if look at the um social media image have you seen the american rescue plan expanding the child independent care credit take a fresh look at that so if you haven't had a conversation maybe with your tax professional then you may need to do so because they will ask the questions about did did you receive the child tax credit do you have any dependents you know they'll go through the questions also about the child tax credit and if you receive any economic impact payments during the year and we'll talk about that in a few minutes now with the under the american rescue plan uh with the child and dependent care credit this credit is fully refundable for taxpayers but your your principal place of abode must have been in the united states for more than half of the year now in the case where you have a um merit filing joint return then at least one spouse must satisfy the principal place of bold requirement and then taxpayers who do not meet that requirement then it's a non-refundable and it reverts back to the 2020 uh tax rules on the child independent care credit now there is also under the the cares act a dollar limit on qualifying expenses and that was increased to a thousand before it was three thousand and for one qualifying person and sixteen thousand for two or more qualifying person previously it was six thousand so you see that's a large increase and also the credit rate has been increased and that is up to a maximum of 50 percent prior it was 35 of the employment related expenses now there's some income phase out amounts that have also increased and the income phase out is when your adjusted gross income reaches and i'm not sure that applies to any of us but it might 438 000 so that's when the credit would actually phase out now for taxpayers who received dependent benefits from their employers the exclusion amount increased to um 10 500 from previously five thousand or five thousand two fifty and that's from twenty five hundred for married filing separate returns in 2021 so you can see that the child tax child and dependent care credit made some significant changes as well now looking at the earned income credit under the american rescue plan now this was a temporary expansion of the earned income credit for taxpayers who do not have a qualifying child typically you had to have a qualifying child also the overall credit uh was a more widely available and it made a broader range for eligibility for filers that are claiming the credit without a qualifying child the minimum age to claim the credit was lowered to age 19 before it was 25 and then also for students you had the age was lowered to age 24. now the law also eliminated a maximum age to claim the credit for um taxpayers who did not have a child and you can see the social image there workers over 64 years of age may qualify for the earned income credit so grandparents that are caring for their grandchildren uh they you know the parents maybe are not around and they're you know need some assistance with caring for the children their grandchildren that was changed to allow that to take place and then the law also increased um permanent amounts that were were also changed uh it provided special rules for spouses who meet certain earned income uh tax credit to now be able to qualify such as marriage filing separate spouses who do not file a joint return with their spouse of course they needed to um be apart from their spouse did not live in their in the uh with a spouse during the last six months of the tax year and or they could um had been legally separated according to the state law in a written or separation agreement so the american rescue plan also um covered a temporary special rule for purposes of calculating the credit for 2021 and taxpayers may use their 2019 earned income for 2021 um if their uh 2019 earned income was greater than 2021 earned income so those are some significant changes with the earned income uh tax credit as well now let's talk about the enhancements to under the american rescue plan with the enhanced child tax credit the enhanced child tax credit um provided changes with the age limit which it had been extended has been extended to qualifying children that are 17 years of age instead of 16 uh so that's under age 18 and the credit is fully refundable for taxpayers who had a principal place of abode in the united states for more than half of the year and then taxpayers don't need to meet a residence requirement if the credit would be a combination of a non-refundable and refundable tax credit um this means that individuals with no earned income can also claim the full amount of the child tax credit for 2021 even without earned income uh as long as they had a principal place of abode in the united states so the maximum amount of the enhanced earned income credit i'm sorry in uh enhanced child tax credit has been increased from 2000 per child to 3 600 per child for children under age 6 and 3 000 per child for children aged 6 through 17. now the enhanced amount of the credit um which is 3 600 is subject to different adjusted gross income thresholds uh which is 150 000 for married filing joint returns 112 thousand five hundred for head of household and seventy five thousand for all other filers and there's also advanced payment of the child tax credit um up to fifty percent of the estimated allowable uh expense expenses that were paid credits for 2021. now let's look at the comparison for 2021 versus 2020 uh and i just want to make note that you remember that the um principal place of abode must be in the united states for more than half of the year uh in order to claim the non-refundable versus the refundable credit um because those rules did apply to some taxpayers but under the provision for the maximum age of a child um you can claim the credit for age 17 and under for 2021 and 2020 it was under age 616 and under um maximum payment amount per qualifying child was 3 000 and 3 600 depending on the age of the child and in 2020 it was 2 000. the tax credit refundable amount is fully refundable if they resided in the united states for more than half of the year that was it currently in 2021 in 2020 it was up to 1400 per child that was refunded that was a refundable credit and then the earned income threshold for the refundable credit if no income requirement you can have zero income and still qualify for the full credit as long as you resided in the united states for more than half of the year that's the current and then last year you must have earned income more than 2500 to qualify for the refundable credit and then the phase out as i previously mentioned the child tax credit amount will start to decrease at 75 000 for single married filing separates 112 and head of household 150 um um yes 75 000 for seeing a married filing separate 112 for head of household filers 150 uh as well as the married filing joint and then you saw the ctc amount would start to decrease at twenty two hundred thousand um for marriage filing separate single and head of household and four hundred that was last year four hundred thousand and so you see the big difference in the changes for the child tax credit for the current versus last year now i also wanted to touch on the advanced payments that were paid during the tax year under the american rescue plan some of you uh did receive the advanced child tax credit and we started sending those out it was based on the most current tax filing for either 2020 or 2019 um they were prepayments and they were paid monthly we started those payments in july on july 15th that ran through december 15th and it was 50 of the estimated amount for 2021 child tax credit now i want to also mention that for taxpayers who reside in puerto rico uh did not claim the did not receive the advanced child tax credit however they would receive the recovery rebate credit when they file their tax return uh for the current year and that will be on of course the 1040 uh pr or the ss forms now i also wanted to mention about the third round of the economic impact payment uh those payments we started seeing those sending those out to taxpayers you you would no longer we're no longer issuing the third round of the economic impact payment it would be a recovery rebate credit when you file the tax return and also those payment amounts were 1400 for individuals with a valid social security number of course and 2 800 for married couples and also um 1400 for each qualifying dependent with a valid social security number or adoption taxpayer identification number that was issued by the irs now some taxpayers in addition to the third round of the economic impact payment also received a plus up payment now this plus a payment was if you received uh which we were comparing the 2019 tax return information and information that we received from social security administration from the railroad retirement administration as well as from the other government agencies that from the va and then the payments if they were larger if your income was a little bit larger or more income than what was reported then you were entitled to receive a larger economic impact payment on their 2020 tax returns which we call them um plus up payments you receive those during the year an additional payment also the recovery rebate credit um some taxpayers maybe they got less than the full amount that they were expecting um then they um were entitled to receive a recovery rebate credit when they filed their tax return so when you filed your 2021 tax return uh which is why and i'll mention this later we sent notices we sent notices out when you were recipients of the economic impact payment to inform you the amount that we paid out so you'll need to indicate on your tax return about those payments so we can determine if you receive all of the monies that you were eligible to receive and we have questions and answers on the irs web page if you have a question about the recovery rebate credit so this is a reconcile some taxpayers may be required to reconcile um their credits their advanced child tax credits so if you receive the advanced payments when you file your 2021 tax return you'll need to compare the advanced tax credit payments that you received in 2021 with the amount of the child tax credit that you can properly claim on the 2021 return now if you receive less than the amount that you're eligible for you will need to claim the credit for the remaining amount because we didn't you know give you all the monies that you were entitled to receive if you receive more than the amount that you were eligible for then of course you may need to repay some or all of the excess payments when you file the return now we started sending out letter 6419 last year in december and that provided the total amount of the advanced child tax credit payments that you received in 2021 now you need to keep that letter because again when you take that either to your tax professional or if you choose to use the free file or any one of the paid the filing options that i mentioned earlier it will ask how much um did you receive any child tax credit and if so what was the amount of the payment it'll just list that and so you'll just need to refer back to the letter just to make sure you won't have to do it from memory but the letter will give you that amount that we paid to you now i also um just put this on the screen which is i don't know if you've seen this publication g this is a publication which talk about or tell you about letter 6419 and this letter was we sent this out as well informing recipients of the advanced child tax credit payments and the third round of the economic impact payment the publication is uh in english as well as spanish and we're also um you know just sending this information out you'll need to keep that as well uh when you file your tax return to inform um to make sure you claim the the proper amount on the tax return so the information in the letters when preparing the tax return will reduce any errors or any delays in processing so just keep that in mind and then this is iris uh irs letter 6475 and that provided the total amount of the third round of the economic impact payment and any plus of payments that you receive this letter also uh has been issued to taxpayers that were recipients of that and also you would need to keep that as well now i also want to cover some of the resources that we have and then give some of the updates that i have not covered and this is what i wanted to share since we're talking about uh getting ready to file your tax return if those of you who have not filed we have publication 5348 it's a get ready to file uh publication as you can see we have it in english as well as spanish uh hot off the press the spanish publication was uploaded on irs.gov so you can find them both there now tax planning is for everyone no matter what language you speak taxpayers can use this publication to help you get ready to file your 2021 federal income tax return and we want the returns to be accurate to avoid any processing delays that can show your tax refund and you won't have any delays you know with your refund so make sure that you um you know just rely on that publication just kind of go through it and make sure you have everything that you need to prepare your return now we know that information can be difficult to understand in any language sometimes english is hard to understand but it can even be more challenging if that information isn't offered in a language that you know best now to broaden our reach and to provide better service to the non-english speaking communities we've developed a new language webpage that's on irs.gov and it has the basic tax information in 21 languages so taxpayers can choose from the language that's listed to get the information needed to file their federal tax returns i wanted to share that with you also we have the over the phone interpretation service which we call opi now it's a no-cost service where language interpreters interpret a telephone call between the irs and a taxpayer it's a three-way call again it's free it's no cost and it translates for both the irs employee and the non-english speaking taxpayer in the taxpayers language uh we call that we go through lion bridge which is a current opi service contractor that irs uses to access more than 300 languages and over the past six years irs has used 121 languages enabling irs employees to communicate with the limited english english-speaking taxpayers so that we could help them meet their tax responsibilities and i also wanted to share with you now publication 17 has been around a long time but in order to um you know continue to be able to communicate with the limited english-speaking taxpayers we've increased the availability of information uh to taxpayers and ultimately improve the taxpayer experience for the underserved population across the united states including those who have limited english proficiency so last year was our first time when we published the 1040 uh schedule one and two and three in the instructions and their instructions in spanish uh earlier this year we translated publication 17 in chinese korean vietnamese spanish and russian we have the simplified and traditional um translation so make sure you inform uh your constituents of that and then also the irs is assisting taxpayers on saturdays at our taxpayer assistance centers they're open the second saturday of each month we started this in february it's going to run through may uh on the uh four actually the next one is april 9th uh 9 a.m to 4 p.m you don't have to make an appointment it's a first come first serve uh please check i advise you to check irs.gov because sometimes the availability may

especially on the recent changes that we've seen with the child tax credit with the um economic impact payments from the pandemic just so many things that i think are helpful and anticipated a lot of the questions people submitted to us but we do still have several questions um that have come in and i just want to try to go through them with you as quickly as possible so we can get as many questions answered as possible i will say as someone who gets asked questions a lot you may not know all the answers off the top of your head and so if you don't uh we will work to get the answers from you and your team and get them back to the constituents that submitted them um and i think it's great that you offered to share your presentation and if you'll share that with us we will send it out to everyone who registered for the um webinar today um but i've got a few questions that were submitted in advance and i'd love to just run through them um kind of rapid fire as quickly as we can just to get as many questions answered as possible um but the first came from sharama who asked what should i do if i still haven't received my 2020 tax return will it affect my 2021 filing what if previous years are also delayed in processing okay thank you for that question as i mentioned we are processing uh tax returns so if you haven't received your 2020 um information that you file your refund if that's what you're expecting then you can still file your 2021 tax return we'll just you know still be down the pipeline with uh processing your 2020 return we will process that as soon as possible but don't delay go ahead and file the 2021 return uh file it electronically i would recommend you filing electronically which will be the fastest way for you to file that return so please go ahead and file terrific okay and that's that april 18th deadline that you gave us earlier another question from linda who said i received my tax refund last year but then unemployment benefits were made tax-exempt so i haven't received my unemployment refund i've already called the irs but i haven't gotten an estimated completion time can you give her any guidance about what's happening with the unemployment benefits obviously her specific return you don't have in front of you but has that caused a delay what should she expect and should she also uh just go ahead and file her her 2021 return as well okay with the unemployment i'm not sure if she filed her return prior to the change with the tax law where the unemployment became un uh exempt it looks like that from the question that she filed and then the the benefits became um exempt after the fact after she already gone through the whole process yes and we were automatically making changes uh from understanding to those returns where she didn't have to file an amended return in some cases some taxpayers of course we're asking for patients uh as we work through those issues but if you've gone through the normal channel and you need to contact the taxpayer advocate office in order for them to intercede uh to try to get that resolved then feel feel free to do so uh the taxpayer advocate information is there they advocate for the taxpayer uh but i would recommend don't wait until uh you receive that before you file your 2021 return still file the 2021 return so she should find her answer 21 return it does and i think what i'm hearing you say is um the the unemployment benefit adjustment will be made automatically and she doesn't have to do an amended return it will care okay um another another question um i think some of which you can answer some of which uh you probably can't um is uh mary and julie both asked what should i do if i haven't received my stimulus checks and recovery rebate credits will there be any additional tax breaks related to the pandemic i think the second question might be more directed at me um and right now i haven't seen any additional uh legislation moving through at this time but for those who have pandemic related assistance that they haven't received how should they proceed okay if the taxpayer did not receive the economic impact payment then they could when they filed their tax return they will receive or you would indicate on the return you did not receive the full amount of the economic impact payment and therefore you can claim the recovery rebate credit when you file the tax return so if they have not filed the tax return then they would need to file so that they would be uh we can determine if they're entitled to receive the economic impact payment and in some cases you know you you have to look at the taxpayers filing status we you know found the tax the money was sent out and maybe the taxpayer didn't receive it but we would need to you would need to call the irs so that an assister can look up your account who have access to your account can look up the information to determine if the check was issued if you never received it we may need to do a payment tracer and if not that was not the case then you can get the recovery rebate credit when you file the tax return okay another pandemic program related question here marie asked uh if my ppp loan has been forgiven by the sba is that considered taxable income now on the ppp loan i'm not really sure but i can um do a little research for you and get that answer to you um ms fletcher i can get that answer to you and so that you can respond to her question terrific well i know we helped a lot of people get ppp loans in this district so that's probably a question a lot of folks have and if we can work together on the answer then we'll circulate it broadly um as well but certainly we'll work to get uh marie the specific answer to her question um another kind of more broad question not pandemic related uh but alejandro asked i'm retired he says i'm retired and my only income is social security benefits do i need to file taxes okay thank you for that question typically if social security benefits is your only source of income then your social security typically would not be taxable uh based on your filing status if you have other income in addition to your social security and for example if you're single then your other income in addition to your social security would need to exceed 25 000 in order for your benefits to be taxed so if that was your only source then no you would not have a filing requirement okay thanks another um kind of broad question here and cesar asked he said without uh going into a really detailed calculation or data gathering of expenses like medical expenses can you give just sort of general guidance about how you determine whether to use standard or itemized deductions okay you know sometimes well the irs publication uh that we have publication 17 that i mentioned is one of the sources that you can use but if you now the standard deduction is higher uh than it has been in the past that make it a little harder for taxpayers to overcome that standard deduction so the standard typically is the best way to go because you want to take the higher deduction so if you did not have any charitable contributions i would say you don't own a home where you have mortgage interest and taxes on your home uh and some of the other itemized deductions that you can claim i don't have the schedule a in front of me but if it does not exceed the standard deduction because it is given then it's going to benefit you to take the standard versus itemized because it the higher deduction is the standard deduction uh based on your filing status so uh just add up all of those expenses we now have the software uh that you can use and that will ask you the pertinent questions that you would need in order to determine if you should itemize or take the standard deduction but again if you don't have those additional expenses then the standard is the best way to go okay terrific and i know we're we're running right up on our time if i can keep you for an extra minute or two to go over a couple of questions that we got um that would be great i uh we got a question from john asking about the irs recognition software and we've heard that um from a few folks his question is is the irs using id dot me for tax returns and do i need to provide facial recognition uh we made some changes with that id me and those specific changes it is listed on irs.gov i don't have uh the information because it's pretty detailed so i will also include that in my um answers to that question and so it'll it'll be clear what we're using now as far as we have other methods that we're using to identify uh taxpayers but that id me we're no longer using that if i'm not mistaken okay terrific um that was a question we heard from a lot of folks and then um i know you touched on one of the questions about hiring new employees and you mentioned uh that folks who can work at austin um near us as well as other centers of course um you're hiring one question is just is there an expectation that's been set yet um from how long that might help impact the processing times that question was from chris and i don't know if you have um an estimate that y'all are working from about increasing the processing time as a result of the hiring or just we're doing everything as fast as we can which is a um something i know to be true yes we are doing everything as fast as we can you know the hiring with any job regardless of with the federal government or any other agency it's a process so we haven't even had the interviews yet um and i just mentioned the 24th and the 25th in austin where we're doing the hiring on the spot but we have many uh other jobs as well that's on usa jobs that you can apply for i won't say that it'll be an immediate fix for uh the processing because again it's a process that we have to go through in order to you know get folks on get them trained and then ready to do do the job so um it's coming we just we're not there yet but we're just starting um at the bottom floor trying to win yeah well and i think the goal is that this will be a long-term solution to help um in the big picture having additional manpower having people there um to assist into the future and also improving um the technology i know we've talked a lot about some of the letters and the form letters that come out so folks who are on this webinar i think are most likely to be ones who have questions who've dealt with the agency in the past and um and really uh have some very very specific questions we're not able to get to all of them um unfortunately but the answers you've given the overview you've given has been really helpful and for the folks whose questions we didn't get to yet um we will work to get answers to you for your questions i would like to remind everyone as you mentioned arlene the the taxpayer advocate service we work with the taxpayer advocate here in our office our constituent services team is here to serve our district and our constituents so please don't hesitate to call us as well that's what we're here for um and i really appreciate you taking your time today to help

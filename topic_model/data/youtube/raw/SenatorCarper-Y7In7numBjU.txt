over the past several years we've been engaged here in in Washington and across the country in a conversation about our nation's deficit and that in the cost of federal programs conversation has been serious and at times they heated unfortunately we've yet to reach a consensus on a plan to attract the country from serious financial challenges that we face but there's one thing however that I think we can all agree upon and that as we must stop the fiscal bleeding caused by waste by fraud by abuse this is a small subcommittee but for years we've been almost singularly focused on how the federal government can get better results for less money or better results for the same amount of money whether the chairman is a Tom Carper or Tom Coburn that has been our singular focus and continues to be working together with partners such as jail OMB inspectors general and other government watchdog groups we try to maximize our oversight and I believe that we've begun to make a real impact we've drilled down on how the federal government waste millions annually maintaining properties and buildings we neither want nor need we've examined the billions that agencies waste on autumn 25 billion and avoidable improper payments made to contractors to ineligible programs to participants and even to dead people we focus like a laser on federal information technology projects that lead that have gone billions of dollars over budget without ever delivering any real benefit one issue we spent a lot of time taking a look at recently is the enormous amount of a fraud and waste and abuse that are perpetrated within Medicare and Medicaid these problems provide life-saving benefits as we know to millions our nation's most vulnerable citizens unfortunately too often criminals have figured out how to use Medicare and Medicaid for their own gain roughly two years ago we held a hearing dealing with fraud and abuse and the Medicaid program in this room at that hearing we learned that Gao had found tens of thousands of Medicaid beneficiaries and providers involved in fraudulent or abusive purchases of controlled substances through the program after that hearing we asked the government can ability office to see whether or not something similar light might be going with a Medicare Part D prescription program I was disappointed but not surprised to learn the GAO has found evidence that a number of Part D beneficiaries are likely abusing the system to obtain powerful drugs to fuel their own addictions or to sell them on the street as part of their analysis Gao auditors looked at all of the prescriptions paid for by Part D in 2008 combing through over a billion prescription records they found that over 170,000 part d beneficiaries apparently engaged that year in a practice commonly known as doctor shopping these beneficiaries have gone through five or more doctors to obtain prescriptions for the same drug in one case Jo found a beneficiary who received prescriptions from 87 different medical practitioners in that one year 2008 in another case the beneficiary received 33 years worth of ox ox ox co dumb is that right oxycodone alright oxycodone pills from 58 different prescribing doctors in just one year we need to be honest about what these findings mean they mean that federal dollars in ten to address the health needs of the elderly and the poor are instead being used with feet addictions or to pad the walls of drug dealers this is clearly unacceptable according to Gao the control that CMS has put into place to stop this sort of abuse haven't done the trick under the plan CMS has put in place to combat doctor shopping if a part d plan sponsor suspects a beneficiary is doctor shopping they send a letter to the doctor who doctors who've been visited the letter is sent along with the self-addressed envelope in which the doctors can send a response to the sponsors concerns in some cases the doctors will stop giving the doctor shopping patients prescriptions in other cases they won't sometimes the letters go unanswered Gao has made several recommendations to Senator CMS on how to tighten up controls of the program included among these recommendations as a suggestion the beneficiaries be limited to one doctor and one pharmacy and approach that many states use and their Medicaid programs I look forward to hearing more about this suggestion from our witnesses today in addition I understand that just last week perhaps as a result of Jays work CMS has issued new guidance to Part D plan sponsors this guidance suggested plans began denying beneficiaries at the point of sale if they suspect abuse this is important change and again I want to hear more about that today as well I worked with Senator Tom Coburn with Senator Brown and others on this panel to work on bipartisan legislation the kerbs waste and fraud in both Medicaid and Medicare our legislation s 1251 1251 contains a set of important steps that will help rein in those trying to defraud our federal health care programs our legislation has provisions that directly affect fraud in Medicare Part D including strengthening the prescription drug monitoring programs and requiring closer coordination between CMS their oversight contractors the DEA drug enforcement agency and state and local law enforcement our proposal also requires that the list of doctors who can prescribe controlled substances like painkillers painkillers be maintained up-to-date and accurate as many of you know 12 of our colleagues are currently serving on a bipartisan bicameral joint committee that has been tasked by the rest of us with coming up with a plan to begin to put our fiscal house in order if at some point that committee in Congress as a whole are to come to agreement on a meaningful plan for addressing our country's fiscal challenges will need to address issues like the ones we're talking about here today as I close this opening statement I want to come in on prescription drug abuse the dangers associated with a misuse of prescription drug have become known in the past few years as celebrities and other public figures have succumbed to the lethal effects however less widely publicized are the millions of Americans including children he abused the same drugs unfortunately trillin abusing prescription drugs in an alarming rate one out of seven teenagers one out of seven teenagers reportedly has abused or is abusing prescription drugs today this is a drug problem that could impact any American home with a medicine cabinet as a father I find this news especially especially troubling and I want to make this point so that it's clear while there is a financial cost to the fraud and abuse of controlled substance paid for by Medicare and we're mindful that we cannot ignore the fact that there's a human cost as well prescription drug abuse is the fastest growing addiction in the United States the difference between a street drug like cocaine and it's prescription painkiller is that in many cases as this hearing in this subcommittees previous works show the federal government is often paying to feed this addiction with taxpayer money aside from our financial imperative then we have a moral imperative to ensure that our public health care system isn't used or misused to further intensify and subsidize a public health crisis and I don't have the full list so I turn it over to Senator Brown I don't have a full list of the illegal drugs whose cost if you add up for their street sales if you added up actually are still less than the the value of the prescription drugs the other controlled substances that are being shopped and sold but it includes cocaine what else cocaine heroin any others yeah there others cocaine heroin and others combined so think about when we think about how big is this problem add up heroin cocaine sales and another a number of other illegal drugs and add them all up and the total is less than is involved in the the sale of these controlled substances it's a big problem it's a problem that we're beginning to address we're going to learn a lot more today about how we can further address it

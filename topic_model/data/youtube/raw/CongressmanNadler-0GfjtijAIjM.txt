joining me now democratic congressman gerald nadler of new york welcome sir thanks for coming in pleasure thank you has the president reached out to you no not not personally although uh i've been in a series of meetings with ben road the national security advisor over the last few months what do you think of this deal i i think it's too early to know there are some really serious questions about the deal especially in the areas of of of inspections what are the consequences if if the inspectors suspect something do we need a conference of the p5 plus one to decide whether to send an inspector somewhere else what happens then and second of all what happens in 10 or 15 years is an american president at that time precluded from taking further actions this deal is not complete it's not going to be completed until june and i think it's it's frankly premature to make a judgment one way or the other until we see a lot of those details so you're a liberal democrat is that fair yeah right so so if the president can't count on you what does that mean well he may not count well i'm saying it's too early at this point to say because we don't know enough but i also have said consistently that simply saying that this deal is not as good as it could be or is that you like it to be is the wrong analysis it's the wrong question the right question is of the three alternatives available to us to prevent iran from getting a nuclear bomb which gives us the best odds of doing that you have a deal and when we know more about the deal at the end of of of june will have a better idea of of what the odds are that this would really prevent them from getting a nuclear bomb you have the possibility of sanctions but with sanctions you're making a bet you're making the bet that sanctions will bring about the economic collapse of the regime before they get a bomb what are the odds on that and the third alternative is is is war um and and that our military tells us would hold it for a few years so it's really until we see the details on this and analyze the other two alternatives it's too early to reach a definitive judgment on the senate side bob corker is pushing a bill to give congress a mandatory review of the iran nuclear agreement is that necessary well it would be it would be nice whether uh and by the way why the senate not the house also as a house member i have to stick it for the house but it's not generally the practice in the united states for congress to vote in every executive agreement there may be features of this that i see the latest version of senator corker's bill apparently is to delay the the the uh taking off the sanctions for 60 days to give congress a chance to weigh that that sounds reasonable

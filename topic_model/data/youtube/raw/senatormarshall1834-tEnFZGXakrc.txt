well good good afternoon everybody and and welcome to ag talk with doc i'm dr roger marshall and you all know this young man secretary of agriculture sonny produce secretary thank you for being here today has been you'll always be a secretary to me yeah well we'll welcome i appreciate everybody being here at american farm bureau i hope you're having a great time it's been great to see everybody in person and and suddenly you're kind of the star of the show here today you've got a wonderful lifetime achievement award from american farm bureau maybe just tell us what that award means to you seven decades of service in agriculture and i'm sure the people would love to know just what you're up to well dr marshall you probably know this is the premier agricultural advocacy organization in the united states and uh when we were at usda farm bureau across the country all their state organizations they were like our field team we wanted to go out and meet face to face with real farmers with real challenges and understand and hear from them and farm bureau was always there to gather up their members and non-members and allow us to have a great candid conversation about their needs so we relied on farm bureau they always came through and obviously zippy duvall their present and our friends when he was president here in georgia so we just got along famously but their staff was amazing and it allowed us to to learn real-time information what was going on on the farm not through necessarily through a lobbyist somewhere but we talked to the people that were enduring those kind of issues and policies and challenges right there on the farm so we uh we enjoyed it and we're happy to be here today it's a great organization and i'm happy to be here with you as well you uh you always when i left dc you were on the congress side on the house of representatives and now you've made a change but what i always appreciated about you at those committee hearings you came prepared with real questions inquiring about real issues for agriculture and how to make it better and i always appreciated that well thanks sonny and i want to you know i want to shout out to rich phelps my farm bureau president back home kansas farm bureau rich phelps i say is mine because i'm a member of farm bureau back home so i get to complain to rich when i got concerns as well so rich good to see you here as well and so many other other kansans um but you're right um whatever this conversation goes i think when we talk about agriculture it's good to talk to the voice of agriculture and that's what this organization probably the most democrat democratic with a little d organization of american agriculture built up from the county level all the way up with policies and provisions they're they're each of these individuals out here individual members whether in leadership or not can put forth an idea that has the opportunity to bubble all the way up to the american federation level to bring to you all in policy-making positions or at the at the secretary level to help implement and that's really what the power of it i think it's a it's a truly a a an organization that values its members values of input it's the best form of democracy that i see in agricultural advocacy as i said here i think about great giants in agriculture and i think of sunny purdue oh my god and i think of pat roberts one of my mentors as well who served the state of kansas but really the greater world of agriculture for 40 years the only person i know of that spent 40 years on an ag committee in the house and senate and helped write eight farm bills uh you got to write a few of those forms you helped us write a farm bill and you know one of the questions i'm getting here today people are asking me uh what are you happy about the form the past farm bill that we wrote the law but you helped participate but then you had to implement it as you think about the farm bill that you and i and senator roberts helped write and many others what are you what are you proud about from that well i'm proud of first of all we got it done and we got it done during his watch and uh uh and and before he left in that regard and uh i didn't realize i think that was a surprise to me roger that you really kind of work on the farm bill all four years you're uh you you get the language down you're trying to get technical information to congress beforehand and all the questions about what should we do over conservation over crops and other things and it's a very complex law if you look at it it's multiple pages but it's very complex and deals with multiple issues that most people wouldn't think about that's in a farm bill but it was very good to work with senator roberts and his staff and the ag committee staff there to do that and we were grateful to do that implementation also after the bill passed that's when our real work began because you all can't specify to the ultimate degree of everything that's where the rules and regulations come in that's where the partnership between congress and usda came about of developing the rules because we wanted to follow that really the intent of congress the challenge in that regard is on your side there may be one intent on the other side there was another intent we had to meld those together to make sure that the consensus intent of congress and that law was what was implemented by rule and regulation so i feel pretty good i've gotten we've gotten good compliments about the implementation of the rules that follow the farm bill i hope you have as well i think for the most part it's been very successful we know that uh agricultural prices have been helped the last couple of years there are also some challenges i think we probably ought to talk about inputs but right i think for the most part i think farmer and community agriculture community is very happy all the way from the conservation group to the crop producers to the livestock are very pleased with the outcome is it perfect no never will be that's why you continue to do it every five years yeah even today as i asked the some of the folks i'm meeting what are their concerns about the past farm bill and really aren't getting oh my gosh this this phase three years ago when we were working on a farm bill i was getting concerns people were telling me look arc and plc are good programs we want to be able to change them year by year we got that accomplished folks continue to say prioritizing crop insurance in general probably the biggest concern i have is that nobody's really talking about a farm bill back in washington d.c they're very focused on environmental issues as you and i have tried to lean into the years as as well as usda secretary talk a little bit about the conservation programs that you're so proud of well again you mentioned something else that i'm proud of and your predecessor senator roberts was very very proud of the crop insurance program and i think again the safety net that the crop insurance program where farmers individual farmers and producers participate in that that risk management tool has been one of the bright spots that has really brought agriculture through along with the help that president trump gave during the situation with china and the tariffs and the low commodity prices was very helpful we got a lot of compliments about that but regarding the conservation i think it was a great balance we we didn't look at a one side or the other we think both good conservation is good agriculture good agriculture is good conservation so we didn't we never treated it as a one or the other we thought the blending of that obviously chairman peterson on the other side i think had some good ideas about some of the conservation efforts as well and we listened to that we listened to him as well so i think we came out with a very balanced type of bill between conservation obviously agriculture is very concerned now we've made a lot of progress under president trump and the waters of the u.s we're very concerned about hearing some of the undoing of those rules and regulations of the waters that would be catastrophic i think for agriculture yeah it is about that simple i i even remember coming to kansas your team coming and discussing kind of maybe freezing the waters of the u.s expansion and made some great progress there as well you know maybe uh folks would enjoy a little bit of the interaction behind the scenes with president trump's team and i'm going to share a quick story as well the first time i met president trump i was called to the white house to discuss health care and sat down with the president and the first thing he said is roger how are your farmers doing this is going to go back to 2017 and i said well mr president our farmers aren't doing very well right tough times then and this was a 10-minute meeting that we talked for 20 minutes and i say we president trump talked about agriculture for 20 minutes but in many ways it was the birth of the market facilitation program and and you being in azir but i just recall being in the white house and watching the president talk about agriculture really jumping into it and after 20 minutes i was one of those minutes where i was overwhelmed this little fifth generation farm kid from kansas sitting in the oval office with the president united states and the president uh was looking at me and i was looking at a little red button beside him where he was setting and i'm not sure if you've had this happen to you or not but i was looking at the red button right there beside the the president he said roger i bet you're wondering what the red button's for and i shook my head yes i i sure did and it was one of those moments it was 15 seconds but it seemed like 10 minutes i looked out the window and i thought maybe the air force one helicopter was going to be landing and maybe the ci agents would jump out of there behind the sofa and grab us and throw us into the secret cart that was take us to a tunnel and i looked up and there was a marine with a diet coke for the president so i thought of that story setting here in atlanta and coke and all that means to do it to atlanta but he sure got me on that one that was a very important red button and he used it frequently as well he did but what you described was exactly my experience people obviously asked me what it was like i said this man that grew up in queens new york in the heart of the city real estate new york battles had a uncanny affectionate affinity for people of the land just what you said roger i bet we could be talking about i wasn't talking too much about health care but vietnam currency and trade policies and energy and other types of things i bet i didn't leave the oval office twice when i would get up to say sonny how am i farmers doing and in 17 and 18 i had to tell him then i said mr president it's pretty tough out there on the farm they need help he said well let's you figure out what needs to be done let's help them and so that was a real honor to me to serve someone that not only i believe loved this country with all of his heart he loved working people he would tell me he said i would learn more from my carpenters and our electricians and plumbers than i did for my architects and engineers so what i finally figured out roger i believe he understood the fundamentals of the law of land and believe that american farmers and ranchers embodied that american spirit of building up things seeing it all drought or rained or flooded away and doing it again next year continuing with work ethic and faith and values and just that persistence i think he truly loved that that's great yeah when i go out and talk to folks to farmers back home today they asked me you know is the president really serious about a 30 by 30 program they asked me are we going to lose stepped up basis are we going to lose are they going to lower the amount of money we can give to our grandchildren the land that my great great great grandparents purchased they're worried about expansion of waters of the u.s they're worried about uh expansion of the endangered species act herbicide issues pesticides but the number one issue that i hear from is input costs in the fur and the price of fertilizer what would your what would you tell the the farmers uh and and what what are the solutions here well that's a good question a very complex question about what are the solutions you're really putting me on the spot there but i think if people see these crop prices now they say oh farmers are just killing it they're making bank out here but you don't see the other side of that equation with the expenses of these guys out here can tell you these guys and gals can tell you what fertilizer prices have somewhat doubled and tripled in other input costs as well as the availability we all know about the supply chain but the supply chain has affected ag protection chemicals as well i think it's again roger a dependence one of the solutions may be we've depended upon foreign sources too much we need to make it policy wise where we can make it profitable here to make those kind of items from a regulatory perspective and from a profitability standpoint to make those things here and not be dependent one of the saddest things i think we've seen in this whole inflation thing everybody here goes to the gas pump and you don't have to you don't have to guess what's happened there we were for the first time we were in energy independent you think about all the geopolitical implications that made and that had with the united states being energy independent but just almost within a year the policies over the pipelines and other type of regulatory stopping it on federal lands has made us again dependent upon foreign sources for for our fuel and that's just that's bad all of us farmers are great conservationists they want green energy as well love ethanol and others but we we're not going to just immediately swap over to total green energy it's not going to be all electric vehicles for a long period of time and we've got to have some kind of transition to do that it does seem like this nation takes their food for granted and one of the things i'm trying to communicate is that food is a national security issue and one of the things we try to do is elevate the secretary of agriculture to someone that would be involved with cyphious and some of those uh decisions and i again i want to put you on the spot but is that something that would be helpful to the secretary of agriculture absolutely we we were called in the way the the foreign organization or cyphus the group that decides whether uh foreign entities can purchase u.s assets and companies there we were called in on a couple of those but we're not standing members i absolutely agree with you that our protection of our agricultural assets and the opportunity to grow independently our food and fiber here in fuel the united states is critical for national security i absolutely believe the secretary of agriculture ought to be a permanent member of the cities committee that makes the decision whether we are suddenly foreign entities come in they're watching these young startups all the time and buying those uh buying those startup companies and taking the technology offshore and then selling it back to us and we allow that to continue the united states will not be that beacon just just imagine what a blessing it is in the united states because of these people and their colleagues all across the country that we are food independent we've known where we're not energy dependent or we've become energy dependent but think about if we became food dependent upon other nations and what a powerful geopolitical tool that would be against our folks the great thing about this country is these men and women and like them all across the country have developed a system where we don't have to depend on anyone else for our food and defeat our families there you go i want to talk about innovation for a second and you know it's one of our favorite topics we've shared through the years i want to tell you a quick story what innovation is it i was walking from the senate floor or from my office in the senate over in russell building over the capitol with a democrat member on that on the senate ag committee and we really were just developing a relationship he said had the farmers in kansas ever thought about doing no-till farming i hear it's a real innovative practice have you ever thought about doing cover crops and i didn't have the heart to tell them look we've been doing no-till farming on my farm for over 20 years and cover crops i just assume we've been doing those for years there's other innovation out there i see our packing plants we're taking the fat from the processing we're turning it into a renewable diesel we're seeing the methane gas from our hog farming operations turn into a renewable gas as well you're on the board of calera and you guys are doing some innovative things maybe just talk a little bit about what you see the future of agriculture is uh and what calera is doing for innovation we had started with an ag innovation agenda really which was encourage these seed companies out here to think about what could be and imagine technology and agriculture we've already seen a tremendous uptick in that where many people think agriculture's taker agriculture has been givers of of really feeding our population and much of the world for many years so it's all because of the technology aggravation of innovation we think about just hybrid seeds but what has taken place with soil science and the new science and soil technologies and other type planners all those kind of things is going to propel you look at our yield curve it's really just a hockey stick of exponential increases and what that means is people have been able to keep food prices competitive you know competitive and lower if you look back many years ago on an inflation scale lower than they've been for years because of the productivity with less less acres and less people doing that so it's critical that we would do that calera is a part of a new uh era of controlled environment agriculture it's taking pl uh logistics are certainly a big part of our process and cost in in food we know that much of our our lettuce and other kings come from arizona california this idea is to take industrial sites and do a controlled inside agriculture in growing lettuce and small micro greens and other types of things around metro areas where the consumers are which we believe will be a safe help it's very safe no chemicals or pesticides needed there because the controlled environment and we see a lot of it we went to the netherlands in europe which is almost the the the grandfather of that kind of technology i think we're going to see more over there many companies out there but calera is an innovative company that's you doing whole head lettuce that is preserved with having that root ball there where it can stay in the refrigerator much longer sounds good looking for michonne how much time do we got left here we need to wrap it up here we've got time for maybe uh two more quick questions for you you and you and i enjoy a passion of turkey honey what what is your favorite why do you enjoy turkey hunting well it's interesting i uh i i jokingly tell my wife it's safer than trying to pick up someone in a bar but to be able to trick a uh a wild animal as wiley and as uh as smart as a wild turkey is a pretty amazing type of thing it's interactive i came to turkey hunting later because in georgia we didn't have turkeys like you all had in kansas up until about 20 25 years ago so i didn't grow up doing that but i've become very addictive and it's a sport that i love in your state and we've been out to kansas for several years now and hope to be back again this spring but it is a it's a challenge and it's like life you're not always successful but everyone every incident every encounter is different and you learn something from every experience that way so it is a great uh great sport and i'm very appreciative of the fact that i can come to kansas and kansas is very friendly to out-of-state hunters thankfully some states are kind of putting up a no no welcome sign there but kansas is not one of those so last question you played football at the university of georgia that's what i've been told who do you got tomorrow night well you're very kind in saying that play was not the operative word [Laughter] i was on the team i was on the team and it was dooley's second year he'd recruited about nine different quarterbacks and i went up as a quarterback as a walk-on i want to go to veterinary school like you went to medical school i want to go to veterinary school and university of georgia so i skipped some out of state offers and walked on there that's another way you learn a lot about when you come a different class different jersey that way you learn a lot about yourself in that way but we had a great time it was a great period of life and uh herschel followed me a little behind but jake scott bill stanfield those all pro players were on that team and we really bonded together so guess what i'm going with go dogs there you go go dog yes sir secretary perdue thank you for being here with us thank you everybody thank you you

well thank you mr. speaker and thank you mr. chairman for your leadership on this we all know that small businesses and entrepreneurs are what drive the American economy we meet them in our districts and we see firsthand the benefits that their dreams and hard work provide to our constituents and art to our communities these investors entrepreneurs and risk takers are really small businesspeople which are critical for our country's economic prosperity small businesses help create more than sixty percent of the nation's net new jobs over the past two decades sixty percent of all the net new jobs in the past two decades so if our nation is going to have an economy that provides opportunities for every American then we must promote and encourage the success and growth of our small businesses and our startups in order to succeed these companies need capital and the lifeblood for growth expansion and job creation yet the government continues to construct arbitrary walls that cut them off from essential financing as smaller companies are caught in red tape created frankly to go be applied to the largest public companies but those public companies have the financial means to hire lawyers and accountants and management consultants and all those things that would then guide them through the sheer weight volume and complexity of the federal securities laws Congress has made strides in tailoring regulatory environment for smaller companies most notably when we passed with strong bipartisan support the jumpstart our business startups or Jobs Act in 2012 the JOBS Act benefits are notable as more and more companies use it use its provisions to raise investment capital in both the public and private markets one essential form of capital for many startups comes from angel investors sophisticated high net worth individuals who invest their own money into startups and other early stage companies not many college students that I'm aware of would would be would fit that definition of a sophisticated high net worth individual in 2015 angel investors deployed over 24 billion dollars to about 71,000 startups many of these investments going to companies in their own communities and states beyond capital angels provide advice and guidance to help these companies succeed and create jobs Mr Speaker I believe that it's important to note that companies such as Amazon costco Facebook Google and Starbucks among with a whole myriad of others that we have not necessarily heard of as public names were all initially funded by angel investors without angel investors these very successful companies would have never gotten off the ground yet the Securities and Exchange Commission whose neglect of its statutory mission to facilitate capital formation nessus and assesses Congress passed the JOBS Act in the first place has further restricted startups from interacting with angel investors at demo days and similar pitch events startups rely on demo days and similar events to build relationships with angel investors and other investors to generate interest in their company and their idea these events existed prior to the JOBS Act but the SEC rules jeopardize their future HR 79 the helping angels lead our startups or halos Act is a common-sense bipartisan bill aimed at removing a significant regulatory hurdle for innovative companies and startups seeking early-stage equity investments specifically the Halos Act would clarify that these demo days sponsored by an angel investor groups universities municipalities and nonprofits are considered general solicitations and would are not considered excuse me general solicitations and would instead ensure that angel funding remains available to those businesses seeking investment capital these are really educational opportunities mr. speaker some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will claim that the Halos act guts critical investor protections and it will subject honest hardworking Americans to rampant fraud we just had an example of college students being brought out that's simply not true a company that offers securities to investors under these rules may only sell their securities to sophisticated or quote accredited end quote investors these individuals do not meet the standards of an accredited investor they are not then eligible or even allowed to invest in these types of startups that would participate in a demo day instead of the instead of the Halos act is a simple bipartisan bicameral and I might add a short bill that will provide small innovative companies and startups the ability to interact with angels and other investors who can provide the capital that they need to succeed grow and create jobs indeed Senate Murphy of Connecticut said it best when he introduced the Halos act last Congress and I quote I've heard from local entrepreneurs and interested backers alike that the most important thing we can do to help these businesses is to make it easier for angel investors to put capital behind them yield an additional 30 second Thank You mr. chairman and that it's exactly what our bipartisan halos Act will do that was that Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut I commend the efforts of Representatives Chabot and cinema and working together across the aisle and bipartisan positive solution excuse me and last Congress so the Halos Act passed this very body with an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 325 289 and I have high hopes for that HR 79 will enjoy another strong bipartisan vote and I encourage all of my colleagues to support its adoption

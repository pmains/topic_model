madam Speaker I rise today to shed light on the president's broken health care promise the president promised over and over again that Americans who like their health care plans could keep them but that's just not true here's what Wendy from my district wrote me my BlueCross BlueShield policy will be cancelled due to Obamacare starting March 1st of 2014 I checked out other policy options under Obamacare and the least expensive qualifying plan was an additional two hundred and eight dollars and forty four cents per month this is with a higher deductible larger out-of-pocket expense and only three doctor visits per year per person this is outrageous additionally this rate only includes me and my three children not even my husband I guess we can't even keep a family together under Obamacare as Wendy story exemplifies and as we predicted since 2010 Obamacare is fundamentally flawed in both concept and execution dictated government health care cannot beat free-market choices and as a health care professional I will can do to continue to do all that I can to protect American people from Obamacare and I yield back

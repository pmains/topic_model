Thank You mr. president I agree with my distinguished colleague from Alabama that the United States Senate can no longer deal with serious issues relating to economic and national security as if we were doing business as usual I have slightly different views in some instances radically different views but I hope on the issue that i will discuss here that we can really come together on a bipartisan basis in support of the teachers and first responders back to work act which I am co-sponsoring and I hope for a bipartisan support because this bill should be about as far from a partisan issue as can be I hope we can all agree that what America needs at this moment in our history is policies that put America back to work and help to protect and create jobs we need to put Connecticut back to work and every state in our union back to work with policies that favor not just our national security and make us safer and more secure but also invest in our workforce for the future and there's no better place to start than with teachers and first responders funding these two professional areas is much more than an immediate need it is a common-sense solution and a national priority in promoting safe and secure communities and a highly educated workforce we all know the numbers tens of thousands of jobs 300,000 jobs to be more precise in our schools have been lost due to budget cuts in the last few years in Connecticut alone 3,600 jobs have been lost in our schools those numbers are not just absurd a speculative statistics each of them attest to an individual whose potential creativity in the classroom and possible contribution to our young people has been lost it attests to the loss of individualized attention to students at a critical point in their lives when they need that kind of care and every one of them means an educator probably another educator is stretched farther burdened more in the capacity to provide a positive learning environment for our kids the teachers that would be supported by this bill are not numbers they are not statistics they are vital to our most precious resource our children and this bill is not about only their faith it is about our children it is about the quality of their learning and it's about the quality of our future workforce in this nation when manufacturers tell us as we go home that they need people with the skills to match jobs that exist now or will be created in the future this measure will help to provide them with the workforce they need and deserve to make things in America and to make sure that America is competitive in the world economy this measure meets our most urgent priorities our children our competitiveness in the world and our security and safety in our communities we all know that fiscal challenges have forced our towns and cities to make cuts going to the bone of what they feel is fundamental and essential to our schools and also to our first responders and this bill is in a sends an emergency response a first response to those needs because if we fail to meet this challenge the lives of our children will be changed forever the lives of children in Connecticut affected by those 3600 teachers will be diminished and degraded forever by the loss of classes and tutoring and teams that will be ended our first responders need this bill as much as our teachers and not just our first responders but the people that they serve every day we urge our children to follow their example their integrity their commitment their service and yet as budgets have been cut we've been all too willing to cut the first responders who should be the last to go this approach not only weakens our economy it weakens the safety of our neighborhoods and our communities and this bill is just common sense about putting those people back in their jobs back on their roots back in their cars and vans and their offices the numbers are not sufficient to tell the whole story but those numbers are staggering this bill will invest 30 billion dollars to support state and local efforts which otherwise would be lost these efforts to retrain rehire recruit good people for these jobs in Connecticut and around the country are absolutely essential the shortfall of 2.9 billion dollars in Connecticut as a result of this fiscal crisis has been stunningly impactful to our state we have been forced to slash funding for programs and the 3600 jobs lost in Connecticut will take their toll in a slowed recovery and an extended downturn the teachers and first responders back to work act will provide Connecticut with an additional 336 million dollars to support 3,800 positions that are essential to our children and the safety of our communities this money will give a boost to the state's economy and improve education and we know it is undeniable and we know that we need these positions in Connecticut we need them in the country America needs to get back to work and we know that teachers and first responders are the right place to begin let me just close by saying as I go around my state what people tell me and they're not politicians some of them could be less interested in politics but they're concerned that classes are canceled the teams are uncoated that music and arts programs are ended and that their students are untutored they want action they want decisions from this body we have an obligation to meet those needs and to provide this response for teachers and first responders and I urge that we do so on a bipartisan basis in a effort that is fully funded from the tax on millionaires that we have proposed Thank You mr. president and I yield the floor

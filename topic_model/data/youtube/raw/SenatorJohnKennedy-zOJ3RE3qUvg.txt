so there's a new bill in the congress called the endless frontier act and the idea behind it is kind of hard to criticize you don't imagine anyone could be against a piece of legislation that aims to help the united states beat china in manufacturing and technology but we thought it'd be interesting to hear from one of its critics what's in it exactly senator john kennedy serves the state of louisiana in the united states senate he joins us now to explain his view of this bill senator thanks so much for coming on so i i know you agree that the idea behind the bill sounds great you're saying that the reality of the bill falls far short of great tell us how well let me apologize in advance for any mean ugly accurate things i'm about to say senator schumer has a bill as you said endless frontiers act um it's um it is right now before the senate uh it is an orgy of spending and very little bit of the money goes to the military here is a copy of the bill uh it started out at 40 billion dollars it the budget office tells me it's up to 200 billion and growing like kudzu it's probably going to pass because i say this gently but some of my republican colleagues have swapped brains with the democrats that are going to vote for it senator schumer is ecstatic he's running around like a a five-year-old in a batman costume here's what the bill will do 120 billion dollars in foreign aid i don't know why we can't use that money for infrastructure i don't know why we have to give money to countries that hate us they should be able to hate us for free 50 billion dollars to the big tech semiconductor companies we all know how broke big tech is uh i i guess they can use the money to develop more efficient algorithms to censors uh 80 billion dollars to the infamous national science foundation this is the same national science foundation that spent five hundred thousand dollars in taxpayer money studying how long it takes pandas to poop the answer's 12 minutes by the way um they need more fiber uh it spent three million dollars the nsf did uh seeing to see if students can tell the difference between toilet water and bottled water uh they spent another five hundred thousand dollars to study whether shrimp can run on treadmills under water and i could keep going for an hour uh here's my point and this is my opinion others disagree with me um my mother did not raise a fool and if she did it was one of my brothers this is not a fight communism bill if you look at this bill and study it you will see this is a all four feet and your snout in the trough spending bill with virtually no money going for military defense me i asked just a stupid question um and i'm sorry about your brothers by the way uh why would a build designed to help american manufacturing contain foreign aid i have no idea well yes i do tucker here's what happened this started out as a fairly small bill if you can call 40 billion dollars small and then everybody piled on and senator schumer desperately wants to pass the bill so he cut everybody in on the spending and that's why i say it is an orgy of spending porn i'm not saying that every penny in here is wasteful i'm saying an enormous amount is wasteful and here we are talking about our president biden is raising taxes to pay for infrastructure why can't we use some of this money to pay for infrastructure uh that's all i'm saying yeah um everybody everybody in washington is forced is for is for fiscal responsibility they want to cut spending but everybody in washington is it's like going to heaven they want to go to heaven but they don't want to take the trip it's amazing senator thanks so much for joining us tonight and giving us a window into how things actually work i appreciate it thanks tucker

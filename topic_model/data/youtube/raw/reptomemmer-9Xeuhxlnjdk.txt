i i have a lot to get uh on so i'm gonna jump right into it uh director chopra uh ranking member mchenry referred to reports that former acting director luigio unlawfully removed career cfp cfpb staff to make room for your hand-picked replacements here's the specific allegation in case anyone missed it this is from a story that appeared in gov exec on june 14 2021 it states quote the biden administration is taking unusual steps to ensure it can install its own hires into top career positions at the consumer financial protection bureau and push out officials who served under president trump according to several current and former employees cfpb in recent months has offered separation incentives including early retirement and launched investigations into career senior executives to sideline them targeting about a half dozen of the highest-ranked non-political staffers at the bureau close quote these are serious allegations if the inspector general finds these allegations to be true it is clear that president biden's political team violated a law stating that discrimination based on political affiliation is prohibited the supreme court held that the president can remove the director of the cfpb for any reason or for no reason at all but let me be clear the supreme court did not exempt the cfpb from laws that prohibit removing career civil servants based on their political affiliation mr chopra were you aware of the biden administration's plan to push out career officials who were hired during the trump administration [Music] i don't believe there was a plan to do that but i just asked the allegations well were you aware just be aware if there wasn't a plan so it's no did anyone at the white house ever discuss cfpb personnel with you sir i was a nominee so i was nominated and that was through presidential again i'm gonna i'm trying to be very clear and i have a limited amount of time did anyone at the white house who i'm assuming you've had communications with before you were nominated once you were nominated and since you've been confirmed have before you were actually confirmed did you have any anyone at the white house ever discussed cfpb personnel with you there has been never been any discussions with the white house about career civil servants or any indications of that matter since i took office thank you very much again i could move on to my next question sir i'll reclaim my time did you discuss the cfpb workforce with leander leandra english at any time since the election last november no the workforce director no i'll say it again did you discuss people that work at the cfpb i think it's pretty self-explanatory did you ever discuss people who work at the cfpb with leandra english at any time since the election last november i don't recall ever speaking to her about personnel issues thank you director chopra if there are people on your senior political team who hired or fired career staff because of their political affiliation i expect you'll take some sort of corrective action and my question to you sir will you re-hire the people who were wrongfully terminated if there are findings of any prohibited personnel practice we will take appropriate disciplinary action would you rehire anyone who was wrongfully terminated because of their political affiliation well it if there is a finding of that which i have no indication to suggest i will take all the steps that i am required to under the law including if required rehiring i hope that yes thank you i also think it will be important to know whether any of the actions and questions occurred with your knowledge or at your direction if so i think you may need to consider whether to recuse yourself from any decisions related to this matter if it turns out sir that you are implicated in the scheme to remove career staff based on their perceived political affiliations can i have your commitment that you will recuse yourself from any decision any decision making related to corrective action i will not be implicated in it because i did not engage in that behavior but if you were you would recuse yourself correct if on any directive about law findings of course i will adhere to that but you can trust me i did not engage in the allegations you are suggesting thank you will you fully cooperate with the ig's investigation into this matter i will always cooperate with the inspector general the federal reserve system and will you instruct the agency's political staff to come up cooperate with the investigation everyone must cooperate with the ig and you'll tell them that they must right yes and i've also told them that they must adhere to all ethics rules as well we need to make sure that all of those are being followed and that they're not practicing i see my time is expired we'll wait and see what the ig finds in this case i yield back thank you time has expired we will now hear from

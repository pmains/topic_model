mr. speaker mr. Speaker I yield three minutes to the gentleman from Maryland the Democratic whip mr. Hoyer gentleman from Maryland is recognized for three minutes what a sad state of affairs there are scores of critically important issues that need to be considered by this house not the least of which is funding our government we failed to do that and now we are confronted with a bill that is recycled and we've added to Natural Resources bills on it who could have passed unanimously I'm a big defender of native tribes rights and sovereignty and I know that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle remain committed to their sovereignty as well this bill however is about undermining the National Labor Relations Act not about tribal sovereignty that act the National Labor Relations Act safeguards workers rights to organize and bargain collectively most of my friends on the other side of the aisle are not for that I know that I've seen them vote that way no matter where you work the basic protections for American workers however ought to apply it is already settled law that the National Labor Relations Act and other worker protection laws applied to businesses even on tribal lands outside the context of inherently governmental functions carried out by tribal government this was not defined decided by some faceless bureaucrat this was a court of our land that made this decision instead of undermining workers rights this house ought to be moving forward with policies that help our workers and their families Make It in America as part of a strong middle-class that means raising wages it I'll care more affordable it means expanding access to opportunities like higher education home ownership and secure retirement those are the issues the Democrats continue to be focused on that's not what this bill focuses on instead Republicans are focused not on helping workers but trying to Pit one group tribes against another group workers that's not what we all have in this country and they're attaching popular non-controversial Natural Resources bills to this legislation they have nothing to do with this legislation and would pass overwhelmingly I'm going to vote against this bill and I hope they'll bring the Natural Resources bills back so we can pass those as everybody wants to do this is not the kind of regular order speaker Ryan promised when he took the gavel and that Republicans prongs when they took the majority moreover they're bringing this to the floor when we should be as I said at the outset two additional arrests for two additional men thank my friend as I said at the beginning we are bringing this bill to the floor a retread this is not new legislation that they are offering the only knew about it is they put two Natural Resources bills attached to it we should be focused as I said before on reaching agreement on appropriation bills on caps on protecting dreamers on making sure that chip children are left aside not this bill but though those bills aren't scheduled today and they're not scheduled next week as far as I know maybe the majority leader will give me better information tomorrow in fact what we really ought to be working on now as I say are those appropriation bills but under the Republican majority we're still stuck working on fiscal year 2018 when we're nearly halfway through I urge my colleagues not to oppose tribal Serban sovereignty not to oppose the rights of our Native American brothers and sisters we're for them but not to be pitted against workers making a decent acceptable wage so they can live with some quality of life it is not enough to give the upper 1% in a huge tax cut and pretend that you're helping the middle class the workers in fact in this bill you're doing exactly the opposite I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill and stand up for workers whether they're Native Americans or whoever they may be stand up for workers respect workers understand that workers made this country great and they deserve our support and our protection defeat this bill gentleman yields back the balance of his time the gentleman for Michigan is recognized fingers mr. speaker and it's now my privilege to recognize

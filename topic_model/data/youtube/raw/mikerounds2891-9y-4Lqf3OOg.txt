want to go now to republican senator mike rounds because he was just briefed uh moments ago here i know just stepping out obviously on the senate foreign relations committee and the senate armed services committee so senator um i know you did just literally step out of a briefing what was the big takeaway from that briefing that you could share let me just say that there are no surprises what you're reporting and what others are reporting is accurate and in terms of the loss of life in ukraine the movement on the part of millions of people over the borders uh the challenge that we have in making sure that ukrainian forces are being appropriately resupplied with javelin missiles stinger missiles and so forth that is all going on right now we know that those resupplies are getting into the right hands but um you know mr putin has made a couple of serious mistakes first of all he's clearly underestimated ukrainians will to fight he's underestimated the conditions on the ground it's getting a little bit closer until spring it's making it more difficult for his equipment to move off of the roads themselves the old style tactics with which they're using right now have not been working as well as he would have hoped they would have i don't think he's very happy with the operation of the the russian army itself clearly his aircraft are not flying the way that we would have expected them to be flying um we're not sure if it's because the uh you know the the anti-aircraft equipment that we've got there is doing the job or if uh he's simply waiting but uh or if he's having a tough time getting his own people to fight with him we're not sure yet what we do know is is that there's a huge loss of life and the off-ramps for mr putin are becoming fewer and fewer so and of course that's that's a bad situation for for everyone right there's got to be an off-ramp uh because if there isn't there's only an escalation ramp uh so let me ask you about the nuclear power plant situation i don't know if you just heard our sam kiley but he's talking about um you know the mass exodus from the town nearby right russian forces now control we understand the largest nuclear power plant in ukraine and all of europe the iaea is extremely concerned they're they they say that the the risk of an accident is incredibly high they don't have full access to crucial readings on plant operations outside communications has been limited uh with the internet they haven't been able to fully communicate to the ukrainian workers who are still there they've said staff doesn't have enough food these are the the trinkets of information that we're getting out what is your understanding about the situation there we haven't had a specific brief on what's going on in the power plants directly but the scenario which you're laying out fits what mr putin would be trying to do he's chasing the population he's creating refugees he's making life miserable for these individuals uh he doesn't care about any loss of life if it's ukrainian and right now it appears that the conscripts that he has on the front lines in many cases he simply sees as fodder and so it doesn't surprise us a bit that he appears to be irresponsible and yet at the same time he's using it as a weapon he's making people afraid of the possibility of a nuclear disaster or accident and at the same time for him that works in in his favor in terms of pushing people away and getting them out of the way senator one other question for you here and i know that you know the u.s you've been saying the us needs to stop buying all russian oil which obviously is is clearly the case but the reality of it is is that brent crude prices which is what russia sells are up 33 percent since the day before the invasion right just so just in two weeks he's seen a 33 increase in prices so as long as his exports haven't fallen by more than that he's still breaking more money yeah absolutely correct and in fact i think it was 127 dollars a barrel today right our message has got to be look we could be producing more crude in this country today but the administration has got to decide which direction they want to go are they going to continue to travel so i understand that i think that levels only i understand i understand what you're saying my question actually was was slightly different which is just that as long as china's there to buy that oil how can you stop putin from getting all that money you can't stop him from getting it but you can force it at a discounted rate and that means as long as we put pressure on china and as we find other uh people not wanting to buy it as well the one thing we do know is is we should not be buying it and we should be producing more of our own and we should be sharing it with our allies that should be done now look the the the coordination it's going to be years before we quit using crude oil and right now i know the administration wants to move towards towards um you know a carbon-free uh approach in terms of energy this is not the time to be trying it long term perhaps we can move more and more to nuclear into renewables but right now mr putin is the enemy and and and that's where this has got to be focused we have to do everything in our power to produce more natural gas to produce more petroleum and we can do it more efficiently then either china or russia can do it and we should be focused on that now that would bring the price of crude down immediately just on the futures market alone all right thank you very much senator i appreciate your time thank you

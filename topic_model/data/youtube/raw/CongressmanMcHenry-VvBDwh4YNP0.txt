one of the men who will have to try to get the votes for all of these things chief deputy whip congressman patrick mchenry a republican from north carolina it's good to have you here for those who aren't aware of how all of the sausage making works inside washington as chief deputy whip you are largely responsible for counting the votes making sure that uh that the president's agenda or the speaker's agenda get passed i have that right correct that's about right yeah i work with the whip to count the votes all right so uh let's talk about a government shutdown there are fears that that there could be um a shutdown of the government when it effectively runs out of money on friday is that going to happen we hope not at this point what i read today in politico is that democrat leader nancy pelosi is asking for insurance bailout money as well as money for puerto rico and puerto rican bailout these are new ingredients to this discussion they are extraneous to keep the government open and i would hope that the leader would relent most of the democrats are actually on board with giving up on those two issues because they don't think they're essential for funding the government once they let go of that issue then we're very clear to keep the government up and running for the right remainder of the fiscal year but republicans are in the majority why would this be a hiccup well because in the senate you have to have 60 votes for this there are 52 republicans in the senate that means you have to have eight democrats vote for that measure in the senate what we're trying to achieve here is a bipartisan agreement to keep the government open and fund our priorities we're very close the only holdout left is uh democrat leader pelosi the whip steny hoyer is saying look this is not essential we need to make sure that we get the drama out of government funding measures and get this thing done and i think we can get there i only have 20 seconds for a big question but what about the president's tax proposal will it fly yeah i think the president's laid out major priorities uh what he wants to see for tax reform to help increase economic growth and increase jobs congressman patrick mchenry we know you have a lot of votes to count we'll let you get back to it thanks for joining us today thanks

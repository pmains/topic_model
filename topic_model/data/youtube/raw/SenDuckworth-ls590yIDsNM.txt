duckworth Thank You mr. chairman gentleman thank you so much for being here one of my priorities is making sure we learn sometimes that sometimes hard lessons from pass acquisition challenges like the significant cost overruns repeated delays and ongoing technical problems we've seen with the f-35 what are some specific challenges or mistakes you all have identified in the past not necessary army problems but but in in pass acquisition efforts especially of a major weapons platforms and what are you doing to make sure those same challenges do not negatively impact future vertical lift as we move forward senator I'll start off with the answer I'm sure general Ostrosky will jump in we studied all of our failed programs over the last two to three years as we looked at acquisition reform in the United States in the United States Army what we found were it starts off with the requirement where we're writing requirements that are not technologically achievable we also found that we're changing our requirements over time and we've put in place with the cross-functional teams if you look at whether it's fvl with a joint with with jmr with a joint demonstrator we are starting to experiment with all of our major programs we design build and test to learn about the technology that informs us when we write that requirement that is one of the the biggest lessons learned that we've learned we've also learned as it relates to the requirement to get it right is you have to write it as a team you have to bring in the acquisition professionals the science and technology professionals to ensure that it's technologically achievable you have to bring in our acquisition logisticians to make sure it's this piece of equipment is reliable because we don't want to field equipment on the backs of soldiers betters that is not reliable so what we have found in our process is starts off with the requirement to make sure it's technologically achievable that is going to be reliable when we filled this piece of equipment and the second area that we focused on as we go through our life cycle program and our acquisition process if we hand it over to the acquisition community there's a supportive and supporting relationship there supporting us and writing the requirement we're supporting them as we move along this lifecycle and providing feedback because they're always it's going to be trades but the warfighter has to be involved in that and I think that's the power of the cross-functional teams that's what AFC brings to the table it's the integration and synchronization across the future force modernization Enterprise I would just offer one quick thing and then pull me out up I think I was general Casey's XO back and almost exactly ten years ago when SEC def cancelled FCS and really I think the challenge there and the lesson learned there's a great rant study I just read on our lessons learned from FCS it was incredibly complex and we couldn't explain it to Congress and we couldn't explain it to OSD and I think the other issue there it wasn't tied to a threat it was a capability that we were developing complex as I described but we could we weren't targeting against a certain threat like we are today and our development against Russia and China I want to follow up on a question that was a Oh answer a little bit earlier while I was in here but basically keeping on the future vertical lift theme your written testimony breaks out the budget requests into funding both a future tech recon aircraft and a future long-range assault aircraft and and the question I think earlier whether that's is how hard can be able to deliver if you have experienced developing two different aircraft systems and the answer was well yes we did both Apaches and and Blackhawks at the same time and that was well over 30 years ago and and in general I'm not sure what you flew but you and I know darn well that the difference between an Apache and a Blackhawk same same engine same power system same transmission system it's not the same as what you're doing right now with fel with fel you have talking very different aircraft different ranges different uh you know a system so how are you going to be able to do this moving forward and and I just want you to elaborate on on how working on both of these lines simultaneously is driving or changing the requirements and improving overall odds of each of these programs will be a success and I'm concerned that the army is now developing a system that may be really meeting the requirements of the Marine Corps a far smaller branch that has a very different requirement than what army needs well I have Jim talked about it from a budgetary perspective but these are absolutely a right to separate program senator the priority the Secretary of the army has set is our neck is for our future attack reconnaissance aircraft followed by the replacement for the Blackhawk which is a future vertical if assault aircraft today as opposed to years ago when we wrote a requirement we just wrote a requirement say go buy it today we're learning and as you well know with the joint the demonstrator that we've been working on for the last four years we are learning daily with the technologies that that demonstration is producing and taking that technology and going to put it into the aircraft as we go forward therefore reducing the risk of failure as we go forward they are going to be different aircraft with similar capabilities speed range survivability but yes they will be different come on different systems there are different aircraft different engines yeah so it's not the same as the Hawk and Apache it's not it's going to be you know the the future attack reconnaissance aircraft will will utilize the iTap engine that we've designed for the Blackhawk and the Apache but as you well know it keeps at three that the replacement for the Blackhawk is a bigger aircraft and will require different engines so you're right there are different systems we're trying to make as common as we can for an example the cockpit but they are different aircrafts their their difference in size difference in weight difference in power but based on the what the approach that we're taking with our experimentation we're learning as we go and they both may not come out at the same time obviously money has a lot to do with it and the Secretary of the army has set priorities so as we go forward we will see I am very concerned with with this process and that I hope that we have a tight rein on it and Thank You mr. chairman I hope that we can follow this train of thought maybe in another hearing at some point

it's the right to affordable daycare and universal pre-k so I've been to a lot of places around the country whether it's just not enough affordable daycare in fact there are states where there's just not enough daycare slots for the number of kids that are born and so that forces parents and two really tough decision making we the federal government should do a lot more to making that possible that's why I want to have tax credits for affordable daycare so everyone can afford good high-quality daycare in their communities and I want to make sure we have universal pre-k because that would be a whole year where a child can be in school learning numbers and letters and getting ready for kindergarten my plan will lift the financial burden for so many parents and level the playing field for so many kids [Music] you

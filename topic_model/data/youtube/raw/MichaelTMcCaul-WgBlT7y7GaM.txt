the man Patrick show KPRC am 9 30 and very pleased to have a good friend of mine texas congressman mike mccall who was also the chairman of the committee on homeland security mr. chairman welcome back to the show well he works Matt hope you were well sir I am I like that song to on the border you know I'm thinking to myself I got it I have it I have some good walking music for you when you come on that's good stuff right there it was very good very appropriate indeed now I this is very interesting you just release this you're coming to Texas you're bringing the show on the road you're coming to mcallen and explain why you are coming I mean I certainly understand because this is ground zero as far as what is taking place on the border what do you hope to achieve well we want to call attention to this crisis which is exactly what what it is and yeah these now we have refugee camps being set up in the united states of america which i never thought we would see so I want to bring members of Congress you may not be from the border down to see this DHS intake Center were the children or process and then hold a field field hearing with our governor steve McCraw is the colonel dps and then the Rio Grande Valley sector chief with the Border Patrol who i think it was going to give us a pretty unvarnished state of you know what is really happening down there when i talked to him on the phone you told me that they're def printing 250 children per day just in that sector alone so we that this is a this is a crisis i talked to a member from peter king from New York who told me that they're looking at opening a warehouse in his district up in New York to housing children and so it's a problem but I also want to look at solutions how we can stop this and I think the best way to do is a federal prosecutor you don't you can't stop the illegal conduct unless you have a deterrent value out there and they I think the message of deterrence in terms of we're not open for business if you get here we're not going to let you stay we're have mandatory detention and removal I personally think that's about the one way you can you can stop what's happening right now so and I agree so the the understanding that most of us have chairman is that these families in Honduras and Guatemala and other countries in South America think that all they got to do is get their kids in there they get it for me so and you know they're going to travel through the United States so they put their children these unaccompanied minors with drug cartels right organizations of the worst of the worst of humanity on this planet I don't know what parent does that regardless of how bad things may be at home to put your child I'm talking about an eight nine ten year old in a situation where they got to go from Guatemala to to Texas through Mexico with drug cartel members uh you know there's something missing in this scenario to me as a parent you're a parent I'm a parent who does that and for what purpose I just don't believe that it's simply because the violence is so bad where they are you're going to put your child in that situation a lot of them are going to die on the way well and that's that's exactly right i think the number one goal here is to really protect these children from a very dangerous journey that they take because you're right Matt when they leave and they're all coming from Central America what happens is the cartels and the traffickers market this for five thousand dollars eight thousand we can take you take your child you know in across Mexico into the United States typically the loves that doesn't most lethal cartel that are with and we're fighting lottie's till dhryn just traumatized they've been abused exploited in some cases sexually exploited at a very young age and some actually killed because they want to show an example to the other kids or they didn't get the money so it's really an awful experience and it's a presence executive order that he issued that basically said that it's your child in the States before 2007 you can stay and what the cartels and traffickers have done taking that executive order and taken said basically this president says if you get in you can stay so now I will ask you the same question I have asked senator Cruz the Attorney General the congressman Cuellar and Po and all of the the different lawmakers that I talked to this week the administration is telling the American people my god I wait we had no idea listen when did this happen what happened I heard about it on the news they're just now realizing that this could be a problem the policies of this administration and exactly what you just said do you believe that do you believe that the administration was caught flat-footed no I in you know there were there were warning signs even back in January this notice that the Department of Homeland Security put out about a 65,000 you ACS coming in that was in January so they they saw this coming it came and now they're scrambling to deal with it in the humanitarian way but but again we're not going to stop this we're not gonna be able to protect these children from the abuse they're getting you know along the way until we send the message of deterrence it would look it's we're not open for business you're not going to be able to stay if you get in yeah we did this in 2006 the Brazilians were coming up like this and this is what the Rio Grande Valley sector Chiefs home he said it was until we instituted mandatory detention with removal did it stop and we said once we did that Brazilian stopped coming but what do they think they can get in and the cartels are manipulating this making a ton of money off this they're going to exploit it was that was that as bad in 2006 as it is now you know and I I'm under the impression this is as bad as we have ever seen this is the worst I've seen it and I was a as you know a counterterrorism federal prosecutor dealt with the border I've been dealing with this issue for a long time this is a this is the biggest crisis i think i've seen on the border and with that you're going to see more legislation coming out to deal with it but also the policies of this administration need to change the other thing is mexico has got to cooperate with us and and start securing their southern border as well keep these Central Americans out uh soap dope I agree I agree so that was my next question so Mexico when we were only talking about half of the equation Mexico is doing little or nothing in it appears to me so here you explain this to me we've got all of this humanity coming into Texas we've got all of these children coming into Texas and gang members and God knows who else and we've got a marine sitting in a Mexican jail for three months that we can't seem to get out of there it seems to me that Mexico has a much clearer understanding of how to enforce their border than we do here in the United States how do we get Mexico I mean I think we should treat our Board of the way it seems Mexico treats there is you come over here we're going to throw you in jail and that marine by the way should be out well he has a couple issues there what one is Mexico's cooperation you know in that you may not like this in your listeners man we've appropriated money to go towards securing their southern border we have actually offered to bring you know what's called NORTHCOM SOUTHCOM or military that could help seal that overnight I'd like to see that happen in this country but Posse Comitatus prevents that from happening so that's a certain law but you know we've got to get both these border secure in my judgment with respect to the marine I talked to the Mexican ambassador about it I said in the interest of goodwill between our nation's just doing the right thing why don't you release him and the response was well he has a court date just got a new attorney and we feel very optimistic about the outcome of that hearing so we'll see what happens when he appears in court i'm hopeful that he's been down there for how many months now that they'll just say time served or you know what you go they know that a lot of lawmakers like myself have raised it as an issue they don't want the bed publicity in the United States and and I think they're hopefully they're listening and they get our message loud and clear we're talking to the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security Texas congressman mike mccall joining us this afternoon so we look at this border and we see the children coming across as parents as just people that have hearts and feelings and what we've heard the descriptions of what these kids have been through we feel bad what do we do with those that are here my understanding is from from what people tell me they're here they're not going back I mean ninety percent of them are here for good what what do we do with them well here's the deal 14 and older they can be detained and removed that that's not happening right now under this administration I've called upon this administration to do just that and i think that would most of our 14 and older so I think that would take care of a lot of the problem right there the other issue if there are 13 and younger there was a law passed in 2008 that requires Customs and Border Patrol to hand the child over within 72 hours to Health and Human Services who then deal with the child in the humanitarian way and under the law it says what's in the best interest of the child and that's been interpreted to mean if they have family in the United States they can reunify with their family we are currently looking at changing that law so that that that their hands will be tied on you know when they're 13 and younger but this is also an issue Matt that I've been I think that the churches the clergy talked to Catholic Bishops about helping us in terms of messaging so that these kids just don't make this dangerous journey in the first place many of them are as I said abused exploited killed some on the way and so this is better this is better than within what they're leaving I me this is what I can admit you know they say were leaving all of this violence yet look at what happens I don't think they realize when they leave what they're even getting into it the ones I there yeah they have that blank look on their face like their eyes they're traumatized and they're just sort of staring off into space and you can tell they've been through a horrific experience and I think that's what we really need to focus on stopping a congressman let's let's talk a little bit about the other folks that may be crossing the border we have over in Iraq that situation taking place where that is you know collapsing into chaos and you know ISIL wants nothing more I think than to bring that to our doorstep at some point so you know God knows who else is coming across that border and what their intentions may be we heard former Vice President Dick Cheney was kind of an ominous claim that he doesn't think we escaped this decade without some kind of horrific attack in this country that's another a very big concern of mine you know aside of the the children coming across God knows who else is coming in here well in let me say that the situation in Iraq and Syria with really called Isis or ISIL it's the Islamic state in the Levant which is Syria and Iraq that is the top number one threat to home then I I say that because these guys are so brutal and so such savages that even core al-qaida is all we hear is denounced them as being too extreme I mean key majan yeah when al-qaeda denounces you as being too extreme cure that is maybe we're laughing about it you have to sometimes you have to laugh but I mean that's comin this way there you know at some point you know that that they will be a staging ground for another attack in it when i get my my threat briefings and i get them often this is always at the top of the list why because they've created an islamic state that doesn't know any borders it's the largest terrorist training ground now in the world surpassing anything that we saw in afghanistan and pakistan prior to nine eleven and so with that it comes a threat of not only a threat to the region stability in iraq but also to the homeland and so remember lottie's you have american theory of europeans you appeal from australia many of whom have legal travel documents to get into the united states so from my perspective where i sit as chairman homeland security this is the threads the biggest threat to the homeland that I want to see kept outside of the United States and outside our borders which goes back to what you're talking about and that is the border security issue all right so Thursday third noon in mcallen you've got your field hearing your you're taking the show on the road leaving Washington which I always think it's a good idea and coming to Texas which I also think is a very good idea yeah you let that you'll have the governor steve McCraw DPS headed DPS Kevin oaks G Patrol agent Rio Grande Valley sector and you know let's talk about you know Texas taxpayers are also dumping what are we paying a 1.3 4 million a day or a week you know enforce our border so that's coming out of our pockets here oh yeah I know the governor is going to be pretty vocal on that issue that this is not a state responsibility to federal responsibility on the Constitution and as such the federal government should be paying for this tonight that I completely agree with you know and I just know we have this border security bill but the department's not implementing anything they're not doing their job you know I had many conversations with the Secretary event how they need to ramp up these efforts get assets we had in wartime and get them down on the border but you know look if all these kids can come in what about the next terrorist absolutely and that's my biggest concern Chairman I want to thank you for your time as always good talking with you likely look forward to talking with you again keep up the good work thank you hey thanks Matt I appreciate it you better believe it Texas congressman mike mccall also the chairman the Homeland Security Committee House Homeland Security Committee

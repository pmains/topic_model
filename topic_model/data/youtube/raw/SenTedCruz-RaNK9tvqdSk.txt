councilman let's let's start with you what we have heard asserted in this meeting that that there is no pattern of discrimination and censorship against conservative views or against pro-life views that assertion seems manifestly contrary to all the available evidence although I would note that that the social media companies keep much of the evidence in a black box where we're forced to argue by example rather than what would be preferable arguing based on the actual data but but let's focus on your example because that is one specific and immediate example the movie unplanned tells the true story of Abby Johnson Abby Johnson was the clinic director of the Waco Planned Parenthood clinic she was not just briefly a Planned Parenthood employees she spent as I understand it seven years working for Planned Parenthood she was named Employee of the Year by Planned Parenthood but then horrified by the practices she saw at Planned Parenthood by what she saw happen she left the abortion industry and has become an outspoken pro-life advocate I will say when I attended a screening and watched the movie it was one of the most powerful and moving movies I have ever seen I thought I was prepared to see the movie and I was not as I understand it virtually every TV network refused to carry trailers for the movie we blocked you from advertising the movie Twitter took your page down an undisputed fact for which Twitter apologized here today and not only that but both Abby Johnson and Ashley Brasher the actress who plays Abby Johnson in the movie were prevented from following the Twitter page for the movie is all of that correct and my understanding the facts correctly yes was so only some the most minor Corrections she was actually the clinic director of Bryan Texas it was eight years for her whole stint there from volunteer to clinic director and I think that's about the only amendments I would I would make to the what you just said and what were the consequences in particular of Google preventing you from advertising as you noted Google itself touts that its advertisements are very effective what consequences did you face from that that that censorship well given that there's blanket and kind of systematic censorship social media was where we turn to we assumed that we would be allowed to engage in a commercial transaction having the money to buy advertising we soon we'd be able to buy advertising and even though certain news organizations and have treated us with tremendous journalistic respect there isn't there's a psychological mechanism and the in the mind of a movie ticket buyer until they see some paid advertising they don't really associate that it's a that is a real movie and that it's coming out at a particular date and you need to try to create somewhere between estimates go between eight and twelve impressions so we were not able to create those impressions very easily for that market and as I understand it despite this almost total social media blackout although you did give credit to Facebook for not engaging in this practice and despite this almost total media blackout the film nonetheless in its opening weekend became the number five selling movie in the country despite concerted efforts to prevent moviegoers from hearing it it was actually number four and when the number is fine it got finalized we thought it was five it actually jumped to number four when the numbers were finalized and just so I can give a relative measure of what I believe the importance of the film is before it aired Michael Ferris who's the president of the Alliance defending freedom had said I believe this is the cultural event that can overturn Roe now that would thrill some and scare others but I will say that after about ten days and release or a couple more now we have had approaches through Abbie Johnson's organization and then there were none we have which transitions workers out of the abortion industry I believe we have something approaching 1 percent of the abortion workers in the United States seeking help to relieve the industry now that's based partly on a hard number and partly on an estimate the number of actual workers who have reached out is 94 I believe there's something on the order of about 700 clinics nationwide if they all did had 12 employee I wasn't a math major but I think we still get to about one little better than 1% so I think on the order of 1% of the abortion workers in the United States after getting one look at them being portrayed on film and it serves I think also some evidence that they're not being portrayed as monsters have decided to change their lives and their profession and what they do for a living that is truly extraordinary and let me commend you one of the things that I like best about the film is that it was not a cartoonish portrayal that that it was compassion and it was compassionate to workers like Abby who were working for Planned Parenthood although it displayed the the practices of Planned Parenthood the pressure women into having abortions and sometimes against what what they would otherwise wish for that was our attempt Abby was very firm that she wanted this film to be a love letter to those who were still trapped in the industry congressman Musgrave

Bishan was shocked by the behavior of Wells Fargo but was easily shocking is that Wells Fargo seems uninterested in atoning for what it did was there any discussion at the board ms duke of being on the right side of history and instructing your lobbyists to lobby in favor of the overdraft protection act so that you could do something good for the consumers of the country having having ripped them off by the tens of millions yes or no was there a discussion of supporting that act in the board meeting we've discussed overdraft programs but we've not but you did not discuss what your lobbyists do in Washington which affect not just your customers which might be one on 10 or one in 20 Americans you didn't even discuss the idea of being on the right side of the history for all the consumers did you discuss whether you should assert the rights under the arbitration provisions so that the arbitration provision kept somebody out of court for the phony account when they only signed it for the real account was that discussed in the board we did not well it sounds like the board is terribly disinterested in atoning for the harm done to consumers in general in the country or the particular consumers there were consumers of the bank but let's shift from the outrages of the past to the crisis of the present the stress test is designed to deal with what happens when you have a catastrophic event in the economy because we know that every year there's some chance that such an event might occur but what's one event occurs that does not diminish the likelihood of a second event occurring so we've had one called the coronavirus you could almost call it a to the decline in oil prices which is shook up a bit bit of the economy that means we could very well have a third it's no more likely or less likely that something else that you did this dress test for it would every dollar of dividends you pay or stock buybacks that you do makes the bank less able to deal with these catastrophes you testified that America needs a strong Wells Fargo in today's economy you put together at the board level back in July a stock buyback and dividend program did that program anticipate what you would do if the country had one call it one and a half catastrophes that could affect the bank and the economy and could very well have another one I believe the design of the stress test actually does that so within the stress test there are not only changes in the economy and economic variables but also plugged into it or assumptions about different risk so the the the board is karate you were still on the board when the coronavirus hit you were there a couple days ago you believe a strong Wells Fargo is needed for our economy and that you have a national duty to provide o strong Wells Fargo and after the corona virus broke did you have discussions of ending or scaling back your stock by that buyback program so I have not attended a board meeting since then but I spent a lot I would assume this being a national I did speak with Charlie about the actions the company was taking internally the about the stock buyback program the weakening the bank endangering the nation because you are too big to fail in order to enrich the management by keeping the stock price up no discussions of that since this epidemic arose the design of the the stress test on capital R to include the effects of unforeseen events but once you have one of unforeseen event then it's much more likely that you that you'll end up with several well once you you plan for one or two or three once you have then the likelihood of four increases because you already have one and you're saying this coronavirus you never thought about doing anything to diminish the payments to shareholders so I I joined the Federal Reserve in August 2008 I am very much aware of the risk to banking I know absolutely what it looks like when a run on a bank starts I know once it starts how difficult so we're just I know how important capital is to these so you know all these things when we have a change in circumstance you'd think we'd have a change in policy unless only the interests of management matter to the director to the directors I yield the gentleman's time has expired

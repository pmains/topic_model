Speaker I have an amendment the desk the clerk will designate the amendment amendment number 5 printed in house report number 112-485 akin Lee of West Virginia pursuant to House Resolution 691 the gentleman from West Virginia mr. McKinley and a member opposed each will control five minutes the chair recognizes the gentleman from West Virginia a mr. mr. speaker under this legislation a Congress creates a transportation fuels regulatory committee with the Secretary of Energy chairing the committee my amendment is simple it will require the secretary and the committee during their deliberation to consult and receive input from the National Energy Technology Laboratory if we're going to analyze and report on the impact of the rules and actions of the EPA on our nation's fossil fuels then we should make sure that the committee committee established under this legislation consults with our nation's fossil energy laboratory nettle is our only governmental research designed developmental laboratory dedicated to domestic energy sources it's only fitting that we make sure we are included that they are included in this process nettle works with academia on over 275 projects across this country as well as private entities having provided over 450 projects in 2011 nearly 400 private sector projects and not an over 100 not-for-profit laboratories nettles work in 2011 alone provided over 2,000 projects eighty nine thousand jobs in over 18 billion dollars in total funding in every state in every congressional district nettles research and development into our transportation fuel sector began back in 1918 in Bartlett's ville Oklahoma with petroleum research in fact synthetic gas research began at nettle in 1946 to note some other successes that will work with conjunction with academia and the private industry to develop horizontal rolling in our nation's natural gas fields now some say the Secretary Chu being the chairman of this committee will consult with his own fossil energy team maybe that's true mr. speaker but this is the same Secretary of Energy who has worked with President Obama to slash our fossil energy research budget by forty percent over each of the last two years this is the same Secretary of Energy who should be promoting coal oil and gas but instead makes derogatory comments such as coal is my worst nightmare what we can do here today is ensure that the transportation fuels committee and the secretary consult with our government's fossil energy experts if you support having input from government private sector and academia experts then support this amendment would be appreciated Mr Speaker I also wish to thank chairman Upton for his support of this and I yield back the balance of my time the gentleman yields back

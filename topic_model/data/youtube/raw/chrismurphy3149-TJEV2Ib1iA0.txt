it thank you very much thank you there are days when I wish I hadn't been there there are moments when I try to forget the things that I saw the things that I heard that soul-crushing morning at the firehouse in Sandy Hook Connecticut the grief the unending mind-altering paralyzing sorrow that comes with losing a child to gun violence it is unimaginable and only those who live in know it in Newtown Connecticut families of 20 first-graders and there are six teachers they live with it every minute of every day and across the country each day unbelievably 90 families join them my oldest son is the same age as those kids in Sandy Hook he just finished first grade my wife and I are the same age as those parents and I am furious I am furious that in three years in three years since Sandy Hook three years of almost daily bloodshed in our cities the Republican Congress has done absolutely nothing to prevent the next massacre it's Stokes inside me a sense of outrage that I've never felt before and that's what drove me to stand on the floor of the United States Senate for 15 hours to demand change and I'm here and I'm here today because I want a president who shares that same sense of outrage outraged that the gun lobby fights to keep open glaring loopholes that ninety percent of Americans want closed outrage that a suspected terrorist can walk into a gun store and walk out with a military-style semi-automatic weapon now Hillary Clinton she didn't have to make fighting gun violence the centerpiece of her campaign frankly I'm sure people told her that it wasn't worth the political risk but she held firm she stood up to the NRA and Hillary Clinton pledged to take Washington back from the gun lobby and I'm Donald Trump and Donald Trump when when he sees gun violence devastating our communities it's just like everything else he sees it as an opportunity another opportunity to convince Americans that they should fear one another another opportunity to do the bidding of the gun lobby listen ninety percent of Americans want our background check system strengthened and expanded to cover more gun sales so that dangerous weapons don't fall into the wrong hands but Trump says that in his first hour in the Oval Office he'll roll back safeguards that we already have and even more sinister Trump said that by the end of his first day in office he'll mandate that every school in America allow guns in their classroom think about that for a moment of all of the things that Donald Trump could have promised to do on his first day in office he chose weakening background checks and putting guns in elementary schools this this is a fate that we cannot accept and so my friends there is no reason to feel helpless about the horrifying trajectory of cascading massacres because you know what we can change this smart gun policy like background checks it can make this country safer now I stood on the floor of the United States Senate for 15 hours because I had had enough enough of children dying in our classrooms enough of the nightly bloodshed on our city streets enough of our police officers being outgunned ambushed and cut down in the line duty I've had enough and friends it is time to take Washington back from the gun lobby and I know just how to do it I want you to start I want you to start by texting the word laws 247 246 you're going to learn there about the dangerous loopholes in our gun laws you're going to turn yourself into an activist and then you are going to go and elect Hillary Clinton as the next president of the United States because she is a leader who has the empathy and the guts to declare with every fiber in her being that we have had enough thank you

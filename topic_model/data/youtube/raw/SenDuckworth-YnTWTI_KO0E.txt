terr duck Thank You mr. chairman thank you for holding today's hearing on the implementation of fast act freight and passenger rail programs and mr. Anderson mr. Jeffries I'd like to start with you last week I extended an invitation to the heads of Fr a Nitsa and FMCSA to meet with me to discuss their ideas and priorities for surface transportation reauthorization I think it would also be helpful to discuss industry and quasi-governmental perspectives would you each come to my office in the coming weeks to discuss your specific ideas and priorities for this Surface Transportation reauthorization absolutely would love to Thank You mr. Anderson and mr. Jeffrey's implementation of PTC continues to be my priority primary focus as it is for many of my colleagues for the rail industry the December 2020 deadline is right around the corner and while significant progress has been made I'm still concerned about the interoperability component specifically in dynamic areas like northeastern Illinois mr. Jeffrey's are you still confident that the interoperability issue will be fully addressed before December 31st 2020 I am as you know you know we've we briefed your office on a few occasions and as issues come up we've been able to work through those and you're absolutely right Chicago is the epicenter of interoperability and we've got an interoperability working group amongst industry including all stakeholders so we're working through it and have you know full confidence in you equally optimistic yes we have great relationships with the freight railroads and our last mile of PTC implementation for Amtrak own tracks is a mile going into Chicago Union Station and we are on schedule to have that completed on time if I could just note for the committee a real challenge for PTC implementation by the deadline is going to be commuter railroads particularly in the Northeast Corridor and Ron Batory has actually done a very good job marshalling everybody there's a big summit meeting in July at the fr a to get the heads of all those railroads and Amtrak together to make sure they're gonna hit the deadline thank you mr. Jeffries I assume aar supports raising funding for both the freight formula program the infra grant program and eliminating to catch an on highway spending under both programs is that a correct statement with the yeah they are absolutely supports you know the federal grant funding programs multimodal programs you know they've been enormously helpful to programs like create and our members have been active contributors in those projects so yes thank you mister Anderson last week fr a administrator Batory for whom I have the highest respect highlighted that Amtrak's nationwide on-time performance is seventy seven point nine percent and on par with US airlines sounds pretty good but as you've testified many times today that's really not the true story when you scratch we needs the surface so mean give some figures the Chicago ten to San Francisco set four line is actually forty eight point eight percent on time Southwest Chief forty seven percent Empire Builder forty six point three percent on time New Orleans forty five point one Capital Limited 41 percent Texas Eagle thirty nine percent and dead last the Saluki line from Chicago down to Southern Illinois 35 percent on-time performance I myself have been stuck on that train oftentimes for hours at a time parked on a sidetrack reliability is the entire game as you have mentioned for passenger and commuter rail it doesn't matter if there's one train per day or ten take trains per day if your customers cannot rely on that train to arrive on time a scheduled as you have said they might as well drive a book a flight it's that simple last week I press administrative Pretoria to direct his staff to be more engaged on the shorts fronting issue in particular on the Saluki line and I'm confident that he will keep that commitment I am kau ever curious if Amtrak is experiencing this signal activation issue in other areas of the country and on other rail lines has Amtrak experience short shunting issues elsewhere in the nation the real place we've experienced short surrounding issues is on the line you've described we did have some of the trouble I think on the Hoosier line but state of Indiana has discontinued the Hoosier service so I think it's been principally there and romba Tories been really good about pressing the host railroad to come up with solutions so did you ever find a solution for the Hoosier line you never did we haven't found a solution the solution that they've told us is to put more cars on the train and just haul more empty cars in the hope of closing the circuit which seems goofy but that's what we're doing I am deeply concerned I hope that we can really try it's been years yes your trouble probably this and he has said that he will commit to has been good about it yeah he has been but you really haven't seen this anywhere else no Stephen says in Missouri on the Union Pacific a little bit but perhaps you this is a supplement the record didn't check with staff on that yes thank you very much thank thank you senator Doug thank you

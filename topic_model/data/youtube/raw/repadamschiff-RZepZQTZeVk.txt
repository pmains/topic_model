chris joining me now is congressman adam schiff of california he's a member of the house select committee on the january 6 attack and the chairman of the house intelligence committee congressman it's always good to speak with you i i don't know if you had a chance um and you're busy man uh to watch much of this hearing today but it watching it made me think huh maybe the january 6 committee might want to talk to marjorie taylor green what do you think well it looks like uh we're getting a real sense of what our testimony would look and sound like and there would be a considerable failure of recollection on some very key things it's hard to imagine if you were calling for the imposition of martial law to overturn an election that you wouldn't remember doing so um but uh but look as we are reminded again so vividly this week there are a number of members probably kevin mccarthy principally among them with very relevant information about our investigation uh mccarthy earlier said when we asked him to testify that there was no point is testifying because he had said everything that he knew publicly but of course we found out that was yet another lie and we found out just the magnitude of that lie in the last 24 to 48 hours and you know you brought up kevin mccarthy i mean these new tapes um that are coming out of this new book um that show that he said precisely what was reported in the new york times that he said about donald trump he had a moment of clarity like lindsey graham and then suddenly reversed it and i think a lot of people are are wondering what happened in between the moment of clarity movers again was it just talking to trump was it just people um suddenly laying on him how much the trump base loved uh loved him and a lot of people have that question do you think that it might be worth even trying to talk to kevin mccarthy well i i think these latest revelations will kindle another discussion among our committee members about what to do about these members like mccarthy who have relevant information who are refusing to come in voluntarily and do their duty uh i don't know how those conversations will conclude um but uh but what's so staggering to me about this joy is kevin mccarthy fox republican colleagues after this attack on the capitol he acknowledges the president bears responsibility he says he talked to the president the president admitted bearing some of the responsibility for that attack uh he talked about calling on the president to resign and then when he's asked about this he lies about it not just lies about it but he attacks the new york times and how dare they suggest this and isn't this just them doing their fake news thing just the audacity of his lies uh and the fact that that the reason he drove liz cheney out of the party is that she wouldn't join him in those lies uh and those tapes give such uh evidence of the fact that he knows what he is saying is just another big lie what do you make of the fact that you know this series of events that he's on these leadership calls with liz cheney she at the time was in leadership so he must know that he was on the calls with her then he flat out denies that he said what she heard him say a lot of people are trying to source those tapes to liz cheney do you want to disabuse anyone of that the release of the tapes you know this cheney is not the kind of person that's going to be leaking tapes uh and denying it that's just not who she is you know one of the things that this chapter of our history has revealed something that the historian robert carroll once said power doesn't uh corrupt as much as it reveals uh it doesn't always reveal us for our best but it says a lot about who we are well power reveal liz cheney to be a person of of great courage uh and conviction uh it revealed ken mccarthy to be utterly craven uh and in fact uh so many of the other members of his team like elise stefanik who when liz cheney said i'm not telling a big lie that he's at the heart of our democracy at least upon it put up her hand and said well i'll tell that lie or any other you need if i can have her job and so i think that those uh attacks suggesting that the liz cheney was the source of this or just an effort to tear her down when it's kept mccarthy who's being torn down by his own falsehoods let me play one more thing because this is the person who for whom beyond donald trump kevin mccarthy works marjorie taylor green here's another thing she did not recall and this was calling speaker pelosi a traitor take a listen in fact you think that speaker pelosi is a traitor to the country right uh you're i'm not answering that question it's speculation you've said that haven't you miss green that she's a traitor to the country no i haven't said that okay put up ponies exhibit five please oh no wait hold on now i believe by not upholding the uh securing the border that that violates her oath of office according to the attorney for georgia voters who are challenging marjorie green's candidacy there was a plan and a plan b plan a was that the vice president united states would simply overturn the election plan b had a code name 1776. um apparently marjorie taylor green has tweeted out a rumor that the lawful objections by republicans would be blocked by a rules change and ali alexander who is an organizer of the insurrection replies saying 1776 is always an option by 1776 he means 500 000 people will do what they will do to that building if the objections are suppressed by rules change do you believe that marjorie taylor green knew and understood that violence was coming to the capitol well speaker yes i think listening to just the excerpt she played where she has a failure of recollection about her conversations uh raises serious questions about what she knew about the propensity for violence on that day i'm not ready to draw a conclusion and as a member of the committee we are reserving judgment until we hear all the evidence about the role that members played but she is certainly a person of interest to our investigation uh she and others uh uh who played a role in january 6 i'm speaking at the rally uh others meeting with the organizers uh such as that meeting that she just described walking out of in that clip these people have relevant information about the first effort in our history to stop the peaceful transfer of power uh and uh and they ought to do their duty but of course uh it doesn't appear that's at all what they have in mind yeah indeed congressman adam schiff thank you very much sir really appreciate your

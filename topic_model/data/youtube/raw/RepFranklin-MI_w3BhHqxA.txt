all right before we do that we'll bring in florida congressman scott franklin congressman good to see you and thanks so much for coming on a lot to get to here i want to play this and we touched upon this the president only sitting down with one reporter at one news network here is that abc news um interview and how the president viewed the handling of the afghan crisis i i don't think it could have been handled in a way that there we're going to go back in hindsight and look but the idea that somehow there's a way to have gotten out without chaos ensuing i don't know how that happens i don't know how that happened so for you that was always priced into the decision yes he doesn't know how that would happen chaos was always going it was inevitable essentially congressman your thoughts well if he thinks that's not a possibility then it just shows that he's not up to the job of being commander in chief it was absolutely a possibility we should have planned for it and clearly a month ago he felt that that was not he thought it wasn't a possibility when it looks like all the intelligence was showing that it was and you could pass the buck off if you'd like um to general milly but general milley said this about not having intelligence that there would be a rapid fall of the country here's general milley the time frame of a rapid collapse that was widely estimated and ranged from weeks to months and even years following our departure there was nothing that i or anyone else saw that indicated a collapse of this army and this government in 11 days congressman i'll get your thoughts on that you know you think a viewer at home has enough intel to know that if you pull the security which would be the troops out first and leave american citizens there under taliban there is going to be issue what intel did they not have well we're going to have those hearings we're going to find that information out but no matter what your timeline is a civilian withdrawal should have come before the troops and uh you know we'll get all these answers quickly enough what do you think needs to happen at this point would you say that heads need to roll our secretary of defense secretary of state nsa jake sullivan president biden who who needs to take uh responsibility for what we're seeing in this chaos in afghanistan when it comes to the withdrawal well we need to find out if the intelligence was actually sound or not and then what our military leaders did without intelligence but at the end of the day president biden is the captain of the ship and he's run the ship of ground he's ultimately responsible regardless of what he was or wasn't told by his leaders so uh he bears full responsibility for this and this notion that we don't have the capability of getting people out here hearing secretary austin say that just is disgusting to me we absolutely have a capability we fought our way into that country before and we can do it again if we have to but no matter what we've got to get our american citizens out of there right now it's reported that there could possibly be according to president biden 15 000 american citizens still in afghanistan wanting to get out ap reports tens of thousands of afghans wanting to get out clearly that situation still unfolding the mission uh is a go until august 31st so they're still in the thick of it i want to ask about something you touched upon which would be in an investigation they have a committee to investigate what happened on january 6th do you see an investigation into how the withdrawal is being handled and what can you tell me about that absolutely and i am encouraged this is a bipartisan issue we are all extremely frustrated on both sides of the aisle this is the kind of thing that america can't afford not only in afghanistan but it sets the tone for how we're viewed by our allies and our adversaries around the world we cannot uh further bundle this any more than it has but it's been disastrous on so many levels congressman we appreciate the time weighing in on this congressman scott franklin of florida thank you so much thank you still ahead how

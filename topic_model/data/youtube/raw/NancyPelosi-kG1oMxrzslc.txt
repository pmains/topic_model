for over two decades in the Congress I have been fighting for fair trade with China whether it was removing obstacles to our products going into China whether it's ending the piracy of our intellectual property or whether is the manipulation of their currency by the Chinese that manipulation of currency is a subsidy for their products I'm very pleased that in the house I'm congressman mark Critz has taken the lead with a discharge petition on the China currency bill in the Senate Senator Schumer and Senator sherrod Brown have legislation that they have introduced this is the least that we can do in fairness to the American worker and also to end again the exploitation of our trade relationship when I started this fight two decades ago the trade deficit with China was five billion dollars a year we thought it gave us all the leverage in the world to end unfair trade practices to free the prisoners at Tiananmen Square and to stop their proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to Pakistan in other countries everybody opposed that business community and the rest we did not prevail but now all this time later the trade deficit with China is not five billion dollars a year it's five billion dollars a week something has to be done about it I think this China currency bill is an important bill to pass it has bipartisan support and I hope it will be the law of the land and and change the trade relationship between the United States and China which is an important one thank you

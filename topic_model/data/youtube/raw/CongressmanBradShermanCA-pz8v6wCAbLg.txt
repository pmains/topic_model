and we are back at the rockin raucous lit grill and Philadelphia Pennsylvania the Democratic National Convention welcome back everyone I hope you're enjoying our coverage President Barack Obama saying no one is more qualified no one more qualified to be President than Hillary Clinton I want to bring in congressman brad Sherman of California's senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and of course my dream team is back with me political commentator Peter binder to contribute the Atlantic Hayley McEnaney at Donald Trump supporter political commentator Angela rye and also Bakari sellers on Hillary Clinton supporter Thank You congressman team adore for being with us on this was another big moment I want you to listen and get your response to it here it is watch this and most of all I see Americans of every party every background every faith who believe that we are stronger together black white Latino Asian Native American young old gay straight men women folks with disabilities all pledging allegiance under the same proud flag to barrick gold country that we love that's what I see that's the America I know and there is only one candidate nice who believes in that future has devoted her life to that future a mother and a grandmother who would do anything to help our children thrive a leader with real plans to break down barriers and blast through glass ceilings and widen the circle of opportunity to every single American the next president of the United States Hillary Clinton so congressman which a reaction one of inclusion instead of exclusion I think the president showed that the America of the future is consistent with the values of America of the past that we can all embrace the America the future and I think he said it very well what was your reaction tonight to the President's speech and then Hillary Clinton coming on say the President's speech was inspirational one of his best the night in the day was just an outstanding one for our candidacy we had a flawless day of the Convention and inspirational day and then Donald Trump um said something even stupider than he does usually does the with this request that the Russians get involved in our political process so at Peter I want to you mention President Ronald Reagan and then John fed her to pot hurts right was a Reagan speech ready to meet it this tonight he said take about five paragraphs out of that obama speech and it could have been a Reagan speech trust me I know what do you think of that yeah what I think Obama did which was fascinating and hung fisherman mentioned it is Donald Trump is peddling nostalgia he's peddling nostalgia for people who think that America was you know it hit its high point in 1985 or 955 and has been on the downhill ever since and Barack Obama was saying we can honor the past the mic-n kansan ancestors and their values but America doesn't we don't lose those just because a lot of Mexicans and Muslims come in and because men and african-americans get empowered those values are you so just because we Revere the past doesn't mean that we lose it when the demographic face of America changes and that I think was in a way a very powerful response to Donald Trump and it was a personal response because remember Donald Trump question his Americanism question whether he was really an American he said I am the grandson of Kansan Kansas I have a black father and a Muslim name and I grew up in Indonesia but I embodied those same values yeah I kaylee I want to get your reaction for this moment Lori's been in the room she's been part of those decisions she's she knows what's at stake in the decisions our government makes what's at stake for the working family for the senior citizen or the small business owner for the soldier for the veteran and even in the midst of crisis she listens to people and she keeps her cool and she treats everybody with respect and no matter how daunting the odds no matter how much people try to knock her down she never ever quits that is the Hillary I know that's the Hillary I've come to admire and that's why I can say with confidence there has never been a man or a woman not me not bill nobody more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as president of the United States of America so Donald Trump has never been in the room how does he convince voters that secretary Clinton's experience is invaluable well I wouldn't want Donald Trump to be in the room of the people who have orchestrated this foreign policy i mean the facts speak for themselves called Isis JV he said al-qaeda is on the run and then Isis grew to 40,000 strong we have an Isis terrorist attack every 84 hours Hillary Clinton called Bashir al-assad a reformer before he proceeded to gas his own people and this administration over stalled the destruction of Syria and the rise of Isis I don't want Donald Trump in the room with these folks I want someone with a different vision with executive capacity and that's what Donald Trump has so I just think that it's important for us to acknowledge and I'll defer to you after this one point again I'm going to continue to go back to Congress and Congressman I know you'll appreciate this the president requested military authorization his continued military force against ISIL he was not granted that it wasn't even considered he's been asking for it since februari 2015 the president is important lawyers have said that the existing authorization to use force passed in 2001 gives him the authority to do everything he's doing and what we couldn't agree upon was a replacement as a matter of fact he did not ask for repeal and replace of that very broad resolution to be passed in 2001 so he's got the authorization but can you go back to what you just said you said you couldn't agree on before you came on set my only point is that at every turn he's faced opposition and it's made it very difficult to accomplish some of the but just to just to kind of go just one step further and look at this from a fifty thousand foot view I mean I understand what Kaylee was saying earlier but that doesn't actually give credit to the president and the Secretary of State John Kerry and others because every day we're bombing the hell out of ISIL and every day ISIL is losing ground we do know that but even more importantly and in this up in mind we're not experiencing thousands of casualties every and most of our way we did underground good push and we bring a psycho them to manage we're managing the problem without thousands of our uniformed men and women dying and that matters by and by 5pm by negotiating the Iran deal we are we make we allow ourselves to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon without a third Middle Eastern war so I think we'll go down I know you were opposed to it but most Democrats supported barack obama people go down like dwight eisenhower a man who at the height of the Cold War when people were pushing him to get into Vietnam when people were pushing him to reckless intervention avoid it doing so and we'll look back kindly on his photo makari someone get the congressman you gotta be here all night go ahead final words on the subject our final words on what on this subject that we've been discussing here look we can't just put Donald in power and he'll just pound the table and Isis will go away radical Islamic extremism is going to be with us for a while it needs to be managed needs to be gained it needs to be driven down even when you crush it some of it comes out of your fingers and that in order to avoid putting ground troops in and losing thousands and creating more terrorists you need to calm him that's what Hilary provides congressman thank you very much we'll get the congressman back everybody else stay with me much more are you gonna stay around you're staying around as much more to come live from the scene and grill here in Philadelphia the Democratic convention don't go anywhere

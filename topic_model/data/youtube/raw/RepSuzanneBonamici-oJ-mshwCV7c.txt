I want to start by welcoming to the markup the chair of the Judiciary Committee representative Nadler I know representative now there who was the author of the pregnant workers Fairness Act has been working on this issue for many years so we're glad you're here today pregnant workers should not have to choose between a healthy pregnancy and financial stability as both a mom and a policymaker I am so glad that we're advancing a bill that was already bipartisan when they came to this committee and continues to be bipartisan to combat pregnancy discrimination in the workplace according to a better balance their representative came and testified at the subcommittee hearing 75% of women will be pregnant while employed at some time in their life yet more than four decades after passage of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act federal law is not preventing discrimination because it does not require that pregnant workers have access to reasonable workplace accommodations pregnant workers may need a reasonable accommodation like seeding or water light-duty something that will help protect their health and the health of their baby and when pregnant workers do not have access to the accommodations they need they are at risk of losing their job being denied a promotion or not being hired in the first place unfortunately a pregnant woman today can continue to suffer workplace discrimination at an alarming rate according to a recent survey from the National Partnership for women and families more than 60% of women have experienced some sort of pregnancy discrimination on the job now my home state of Oregon is helping to lead the way on protections for pregnant workers last year the state legislature passed a bipartisan bill to require employer's to provide reasonable accommodations to applicants or employees with known limitations related to pregnancy childbirth or related medical condition unless it would impose an undue hardship now I have to say that the results have been very positive pregnant women have welcomed the accommodations and the business community has welcomed the certainty but we need to make sure that all pregnant workers regardless of where they live can access the protections they need to stay in the workplace and I want to add that before I chaired this civil rights and Human Services subcommittee hearing on pregnancy to termination last October I spoke with some of our state leaders including our state Labor Commissioner about how the bill is working in Oregon it has been very positively received especially as I mentioned from the business community they like that certainty of knowing what they need to do to accommodate they were many members of the business community we're very pleased to find out that an accommodation can often cost nothing just just making arrangements that help accommodate that pregnant women so we heard very compelling testimony in our subcommittee hearing from witnesses who establish that far too many pregnant workers are denied access to reasonable workplace accommodations despite federal law providing for equal treatment on the job so this bipartisan pregnant workers Fairness Act is our opportunity to address pregnancy discrimination in a meaningful way and to protect the health well-being and economic security of all pregnant and parenting workers and their families by clarifying the right of pregnant workers to fair treatment in the workplace we will finally guarantee pregnant workers the accommodations they need without facing discrimination or retaliation I urge my colleagues to support this amendment in the nature of the substitute and I want to thank the Chairman and the staff for working so hard between the subcommittee hearing and today to reach this amendment the nature of the substitute I encourage everyone to support it and I yield back the balance of my time

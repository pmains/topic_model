uh thank you chairman buyer and uh thank you for this uh great hearing that was uh really we needed to have thank you again uh miss gaines uh following up on uh representative chris comments and and questions you know when i hear the space station gap i think of the shuttle gap between the last space launch and the first commercial crew launch nine years later um you know it left a gaping hole in florida's space coast economy and workforce for sure uh loss of many many uh veteran space workers and and left us to rely on russians to ferry our astronauts to the iss you know can you give us some idea of the the platforms and the destinations that you expect the private sector to propose thank you for that question yes uh in fact we are seeing a very strong response to our uh request for proposals for commercial leo destinations and so we expect to see a wide variety of concepts and i'm looking forward to to seeing what our industry partners are proposing there in addition so we we believe that can you give us just some idea of some of the concepts we might expect to hear well i haven't seen the proposals i have seen some earlier industry studies that show different free-flying concepts uh made of uh repurposed elements in some case um upper stages and um and other more traditional and inflatable uh kinds of structures so i think we have that to look forward to but i have not seen the proposals yet and if i i might just follow up on the previous question uh regarding standards nasa did work with our international partners to develop an initial set of international standards for our artemis program so we are i do agree with uh with bill shepard and we are that's very important and we are working to uh towards those standards thank you uh and i'm glad to hear that we we know that china is trying to change standards uh in all disciplines over the globe uh to favor them and and i think we need to take the lead on standard setting for sure do you maintain communications with our space force and other military sectors yes um i know our administrator routinely communicates with general raymond of the space force and we work with them obviously uh at cape canaveral for our launches and they do our range activities so we we have a close communication with space force for our activities and human space flight thank you uh what parts of the is of the iss are becoming dangerously outdated i mean i'm wondering if there are elements of the iss that can be used for other purposes besides just deorbiting oh yes good question um so parts of the iss are older than others and there are are newer modules that have a lot of useful life left that uh could potentially be detached and become part of um future leo platforms so we're not opposed to entertaining those concepts we haven't studied those in detail but that is certainly quite possible uh is it at all feasible to move any usable portions to a lunar orbit or or possibly the surface of the moon i'm not an orbital mechanics expert i could take that question um i do not believe that anyone has uh really proposed doing that okay thank you mr harrison in your written and your royal testimony today you mentioned the wolf amendment and how it originally uh intended to pressure china to make human rights reforms and to stifle development of its space capabilities then you say after 10 years it's clear that china has not improved its behavior when it comes to human rights and and china space programs military and civilian have only accelerated and we know their civilian and their military activities are enjoined the wolf amendment doesn't uh preclude nasa from working with china it says that nasa must notify congress and vet it through the fbi and the state department are you suggesting that congress and the fbi not be notified for the requirement of the wolf amendment that you imply is problematic in your written testimony well i think the effect of the wolf amendment has been to limit that cooperation uh and so there have been some examples there was some recent low-level cooperation on the chunga four mission uh chinese mission with the lunar rover where nasa was able to share some information with china they did jump through all the hoops and go through the fbi and the vetting process and submitted to congress and were allowed to do it so it certainly is possible the problem is that it has stifled uh that ability to cooperate um i mean there are examples where nasa you know was being a little uh overly aggressive in enforcing uh those restrictions early on not allowing chinese scientists to come to conferences where nasa scientists were going to be participating but that's just those things have been worked out since then but that's just an example of how it has really stymied our ability to engage in a meaningful way with china when it comes to civil space and as you say we can't really tell the difference between many of their military and civilian space activities and i think that's a shame we can tell those distinctions with the russians because we cooperate with them on the civilian side uh we don't have that kind of relationship with china and importantly you know from a military space perspective we don't have those direct military to military space contacts that we would like if we had civilian to civilian contacts through our civil space activities that could actually be a good channel of communication to develop so that we don't end up with misperceptions and actions and potential mis intended escalation in space in a future military crisis environment thank you for your indulgence to letting the witness answer my question mr chairman i time is expired and i yield back

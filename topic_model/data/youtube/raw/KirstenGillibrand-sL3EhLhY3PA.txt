there's been several attempts over the last few decades to unwind women's reproductive freedom they first started with efforts to say there was medical issues for example they'd say you need to have admitting privileges and so they started to close down different facilities then they started to talk about religious freedom and saying no federal money can go towards any abortion services that's how Hyde got put in place over the last few decades they tried pretty much every measure they can think of to make it harder for women to get access to medically necessary procedures limiting title ten for example title ten funding really hurt Planned Parenthood and so they've been trying everything now under these thirty legislators around the country some of them are actually criminalizing access to care criminalizing a woman who is seeking abortion services regardless of her circumstances no exceptions for life or well-being of the mother no exceptions for rape no exceptions for incest and criminalizing the doctors that are providing the care with 99-year sentences that's how serious what's happening in this country is today and it's up ending our constitutional rights it's saying that women don't deserve a right to privacy number one number two it's saying we don't have basic human rights autonomy over our body bodily selves and that we have no agency that we're not allowed to make the decisions that are fundamental to our lives how many children were having under what circumstances were having them those decisions are ours and for many women and just look at our maternal mortality rates in this country they're the highest of any industrialized country in the world and if you're a black woman you are four times more likely to die in childbirth because of institutional racism in our health care system so when you're telling a woman that she doesn't get to make those decisions it's a life-or-death decision for her it should be her human right [Applause]

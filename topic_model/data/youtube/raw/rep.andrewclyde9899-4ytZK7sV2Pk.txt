joining us now to discuss further Georgia Congressman Andrew Clyde Congressman great to have you with us here as we were discussing with Mark Morgan President Biden uh didn't really seem to hear what was needed at the border and certainly didn't see the reality even a local Outlet there saying that the president skipped the worst homeless areas he didn't even meet with the media in El Paso uh during his stop what do you think it will take for this Administration to really see what's going on or do they just want to ignore it all together well thank you for uh having me on you know it's amazing what a republican majority and simply the electing of a speaker can do to move the Biden Administration here President Biden has not been to the southern Border in five decades his entire political career and yet here we are now with the Republican majority and he finally goes to the Border but what he sees at the border is a whitewashed El Paso this is not the real deal of what's going on and he needs to to see that but this is a photo op and that's not what we need we need real policy changes uh you know we in Congress are going to do that if the president refuses to do that now part of our agreement with uh with speaker McCarthy the framework was that there would be a vote on the Texas border plan within the first uh three quarters of this year and I'm really excited about that but the president could fix this this is the president's debacle it's it's his crisis he created it with his executive orders and he needs to see it firsthand not a whitewashed photo op but he needs to see the reality of what's going on and I'm really thankful for the Texas governor for presenting him with that letter that outlined in such great detail what was needed or what the Biden Administration needed to do to fix this problem Congressman I wanted to ask you about your voting on the speaker ultimately you voted for Kevin McCarthy you had started Mr Biggs Mr Jordan Mr Donalds um and what what made you hold off on voting for Ken McCarthy and then brought you around and and give us a feel for what you see the future looking like well first off it was never personal it wasn't a personal thing it was about the country it was about the way Congress operates it was the fact that this was an opportunity with a small Republican majority that we could make fundamental institutional changes on the way Congress functions I mean I asked my constituents uh if not now then when if not us then who who is going to take up the mantle and make substantial changes that are necessary so we can make sure that we end up with a balanced budget so we can stop the out of control spending so we can go after the the three letter agencies that continue to weaponize against the American people these are the things along with accountability of the speakership these are the things that I was committed to and I told my district Georgia's Ninth District that I was committed to and that's what I fought for and once we got them then at that point then I'm fine with Kevin McCarthy a speaker in fact I was happy that he fought so hard because it shows the the White House and the Senate that this man can fight and I'm so I'm just excited about that you know he'll fight hard for us I'm certain Congressman what are you uh most looking forward to tackling once the house gets back to work uh what's my greatest concern I would say that we're looking forward to getting I'm sorry say that again what are you most looking forward to tackling what what uh what are you most looking forward to really getting to work on when you start oh well I'm a part of the oversight committee and I'm really looking forward to oversight over the federal government that those three letter agencies that we talked about I think um you know we're going to have a phenomenal opportunity to bring Clarity to exactly what these three letter agencies are doing to the American people to restore the First Amendment like it has not been restored in a while the people's voice can be heard now our constituents can be better represented uh and I'm really looking forward to that to holding the gun and that's all part of holding the government accountable and that's so so important and is absolutely necessary for a properly functioning government a constitutional republic all right uh Congressman Andrew Klein thank you so much sir thank you very much appreciate being on go Bulldogs yeah go dogs right that's right it's tonight yes Georgia that's right oh dogs there you go we're gonna win I know a lot in my family they're hoping that uh thank you very much congressman

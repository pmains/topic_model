thank you KCRG for hosting this debate tonight and to all of you for watching as well it's been my absolute honor to serve you as your congresswoman both here in the district and in Washington DC and I think you heard tonight about some very clear difference differences between us about our our future vision for this country uh my opponent Liz Mathis believes this country is headed in the right direction the Biden Pelosi Mathis agenda will look a whole lot like the last two years of failure for you I am proud of the work that I have done to deliver for Iowa taxpayers to deliver for our farmers and to deliver for our veterans and most importantly as a mom to Max and Jax I will make sure that I'm fighting for our children's future and your children's future and that starts with firing Nancy Pelosi and putting in new leadership that will respect Iowans and respect taxpayers so I'm asking for your vote on November 8th so I can continue that good work for you God bless and thank you for joining us today

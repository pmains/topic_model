congressman what are you hearing from constituents about the stimulus bill how badly do people in the seventh district need it what are they planning to do with it thank you so much uh andrew we we needed this yesterday uh and what are we planning to do with it we're planning uh to get our kids back into school faster we're planning to get our restaurants uh up and running they'll benefit from a special grant program under this bill uh we're planning to pay our our bills and uh and to make sure that we can make it uh through the next uh few weeks until every single person in new jersey gets that shot in their arm so that we can get back to normal hopefully by uh by july 4th this is an incredibly timely and helpful step by the government to crush this pandemic make our recover of my our our economic recovery twice or three times faster than it otherwise would be and uh honestly just beyond the next few months um to to build a a more fair and just society in our country it's a very good day for new jersey and for america we know that state and local governments are going to get some badly needed assistance local businesses are also going to have customers returning soon with added cash in their pockets what are you hearing from small businesses in your districts about the impact that this will have oh my goodness our our main street businesses have struggled to hold on as you know uh these last few months we've been able to get them a little bit of help through the paycheck protection program but the best help is customers as you say with cash in their wallets coming back to stores coming back to restaurants spending money locally which is what we expect uh folks will do remember the the the preponderance of aid that we are providing exactly the opposite of that big 2017 tax bill where it all went to the wealthiest americans this is going to middle and working-class americans who spend every single penny they get mostly locally at small businesses it's going to be a huge huge boost to our local economy and remember it's not just the direct checks it's not just the unemployment uh insurance for folks who are still out of a job there's going to be a three thousand dollars plus per child tax credit in this bill that the experts say will cut child poverty in america in half um we are delivering on the promise that i ran on in 2018 to make health care in america more affordable we are going to be subsidizing fully affordable care act obamacare coverage um for the middle class that wasn't there before so the average middle-class family will save a few hundred dollars a month just on their health insurance that this is absolutely extraordinary overwhelmingly supported by the the folks i represent back home uh and i can't wait to get started and you've set up my next question perfectly because i was going to ask how much do your constituents know about what's in the bill i've seen reporting that a lot of parents had no idea the child tax credits were there or the day care assistance was there or the obamacare assistance was there is voter education on this law going to be a challenge i think people are going to know uh what's coming when it comes they're going to feel it in their pocketbooks they're going to see it when their kids are able to go back to school and into daycare and they're not going to have to struggle as they have for the for the last few months juggling work and and schooling at home uh yes president biden's going to be on the road talking about it and i will be uh holding uh more town halls as i always do in my district to let folks know about how they can take advantage of these benefits but i'm absolutely confident the american people are going to know uh that the changes that uh are soon to come and very important they're gonna know who is responsible for delivering them because you know this was a hundred percent bipartisan back home in my district and across the country but unfortunately none of my fellow uh members of congress who belonged to the republican party voted for this um it was sad and strange to see them um somehow unable to step forward and do what the overwhelming majority of their constituents were demanding and i think folks are going to remember that you mentioned that the president and the vice president are scheduling events around the country next week to support the stimulus bill is he the best salesperson for this and how critical will vice president harris's participation be in selling it to the public i i think they're both good spokespeople i watched president biden's address to the country last night as did i think many millions of people and you know folks trust joe biden they know that he's sincere they know that he's somebody who's not in it for himself somebody who takes responsibility um someone who will take responsibility of this this fails as as he said what a refreshing change from uh from the egotism uh and self-serving uh politics that we got used to over the last four years so i think folks trust joe biden and they're certainly going to trust the money that's arriving in their bank accounts starting this weekend when the irs is going to start to distribute it and how the build is sold will be something of a challenge for the president but also for you and for your democratic colleagues when you all run for re-election in 2022 and especially because we're talking about individual stories of individual people and businesses and their needs in meeting those needs you're a veteran campaigner at this point how do you turn the stories of joe and mary smith into a sales pitch for the stimulus for joe biden and for tom malinowski we have all been suffering through this pandemic together this this last year there's no light at the end of the tunnel i think folks understand that that light is coming in part because we now have a government that is more intelligent more effective that is more focused on helping people rather than just sewing divisions in in this country so you know we will will tell that story but i think that story is going to be told for us um by the the ordinary americans across this country who are going to benefit from from the results we are delivering perhaps even neighbor to neighbor as they do are there aspects congressmen of the stimulus that we're not talking enough about are there provisions that you do you think are critical that just haven't gotten enough attention well you mentioned one of them it's it's the fix to the affordable care act or obamacare as many folks know the affordable care act was pretty successful in getting a lot of americans enrolled in health insurance but it was not affordable enough particularly for middle class americans who did not qualify for the subsidies that's what we're fixing in this bill so you know if you're a family uh with kids making 60 70 80 000 a year and you were you were paying uh an extraordinary amount for health insurance um you're now going to qualify for the subsidy and it could save you hundreds of dollars a month um so please please look into that if you are in that situation in my office will be putting out more information about that soon i think another another big issue here and this is for new jersey having passed this bill if we now go forward and pass joe biden's rebuild america plan um the build back better plan infrastructure past these two things uh it's been estimated uh new jersey's going to get back around 17 billion more dollars than it currently receives from the federal government finally congressman before i run out of time we've got the checks going out this weekend are starting to go out this weekend we've got the president saying americans will all american adults will be able to sign up for the shots by may 1st and he's hopeful about a normal july 4th how excited are you how excited are people in your district about the prospects for this summer i i can't wait to get back to the beach and to fourth of july barbecues and uh a personal wish is uh getting to play in the congressional baseball game again this summer in front of a real crowd of people i can't wait to know that that my mom can can go visit her uh her two very young grandchildren who were born in the last uh last couple of years and i think across my district and across america every single person has something that they are looking forward to that will be enabled by the work that we are doing here today um and this is what i want to stress this is not a natural inevitable recovery where if we'd done nothing it would have happened anyway this is the work at last of a government that is beginning to deliver for the american people that is being run by intelligent affected compassionate people politics does make a difference when we choose the right leaders and i hope that people take that message from from the optimism and hope that we all feel today congressman tom malinowski is a democrat representing new jersey's seventh district congressman i hope to see you in person soon have a good and safe weekend thank you so very

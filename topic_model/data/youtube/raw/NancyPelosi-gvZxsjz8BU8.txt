gentle woman made you so I would like to yield three minutes to my colleague from Illinois representative jan Schakowsky gentlewoman from Illinois is recognized for three minutes I thank my friend the gentlewoman for yielding to me and I rise in support of her point of order the American people are begging us to work to get to create jobs to bolster the economy and instead we're here once again to consider legislation that endangers and attacks the right of women and is far out of the mainstream of American priorities HR 358 is extreme legislation it is another attempt to unravel the health care law while at the same time expanding anti-choice laws that will harm women's health it would take away a woman's right to make her own decisions about her reproductive health even with her own money it would allow public hospitals as you heard to deny emergency abortion care to women in life-threatening situations it would expand the existing conscience objection to allow providers to avoid providing contraception we're talking now about birth control this legislation revives a debate that has already been settled there is no federal funding for an abortion in the health care reform law legal experts have cited independent fact checks organizations have said it yet Republicans continue to insist that the possibility of funding remains federal funds are already prohibited from being used for abortions under the hyde amendment at the expense I should add a poor women federal employees women of the District of Columbia and women in the military but this bill goes way beyond that law the attention Republicans are focusing on the private lives of women what American families do with their own money makes it clear that their real goal is to ban all abortions and end access to birth control and contraceptives Republicans don't want government to protect the water we drink oh no or the air we breathe or the food we eat but they do want to intrude in a woman's right to choose we are now at 280 days in this Congress without passing a jobs plan yet the Republican majority has consumed an urge to pass extreme and divisive legislation targeted at women's health the administration strongly opposes HR 358 and this bill has no chance of becoming law now is the time to work on the issues that are most important to Americans creating jobs and improving the economy rather than restricting reproductive choice and access to family planning American women would suffer if this bill becomes law but we're just wasting time here because it will not and it just shows how mean-spirited and extreme this legislation is and it's a way to rollback women's health and rights it's too extreme for women too extreme for America and we should reject it right now I yield back gentlewoman yields back thank you madam madam Speaker I would like to reserve

as I said in my opening comments so one of the focuses this morning I wanted to do is see where you are in terms of getting the programs up and running as soon as possible can you tell us what the timeline currently is with the national animal disease preparedness and response program as well as the national animal animal vaccine and veterinary and countermeasures Bank so as we believe at USDA that all three legs of the stool are important and play a role in the the steps were taking you know I know you said that but what is the timeline and so on we were prepared to be able to meet our expectations to invest at least the first five million dollars in the preparedness effort before the end of the year we're meeting regularly with not only the about the countermeasure SPECT the countermeasures bank ooh that's what we're meeting with poultry as well as swine and beef to understand how we might balance that you don't have a timeline there yet we hope by the end of the year we might be and prepared to advertise or put out a RFP - and what the changes that have been made to the national animal health laboratory network in the farm bill last year where are you in terms of implementing those changes so we continue to invest money in the laboratory network most recently we invested money to be able to increase the capability of the that lab network to test for African swine fever and we're going to continue to evaluate where we can bolster that network well I think many of us are hearing different things from the industry folks that are dependent upon that it what alarms me mr. secretary is that the President's budget request for a four in the fiscal year 2020 does not show any overall increase in spending for the 2018 levels that would be difficult enough but in fact it proposes to cut the National Animal Health Laboratory network as well as other key programs within your budget the point of these new authorities and funding was not to reduce the funding in existing areas or to replace your current work so I guess I'm looking and I think members of the subcommittee what assurances you can give me that the new mandatory money you're getting for the farm bill will actually be used to improve our preparedness and response capabilities and not not offset cuts budget cuts in other areas you know the you've been around long enough to know the president proposes in the Congress disposes so we're working on the budget but I hope that we're going to have a budget that allows you to implement the changes as a livestock producer myself and and beef producer I understand the importance of animal health at a at a producer level as well as at a regulatory level we look forward at a fost to being wise stewards of whatever so I understand that but I mean and they're representing the administration I get that but the bottom line is we can I certainly don't expect you to do more with less that wasn't why we made the changes last year and that's and and those are the things we're going to keep coming back to you on this to see how that's going let me get a little local here as I noted we had the egg producers in here last week some folks got some nice omelets I think but one of my local producers compliment at the USDA in response to the outbreak but they were frustrated that in terms of the indemnities because of the avian flu losses that we had in California that they were based on prices that didn't reflect the markets in in California can you which were higher in terms of the reimbursement rates is there some way to make sure that in dem DS better match market values that's one of our constant struggles and the indemnities is something that we worked on to try to make them appropriate without making them attractive to have animals brought in to be able to take advantage of the indemnity you know when we look at production Birds versus some of the exhibition birds that we're looking at there can be a wide range in what producers deem the value of those birds to be no I understand there's a dispute but obviously we would like you to work that out and so that the indemnity reimbursement is fair and equitable based upon regional markets and that's the question there I've also got a question with regards to foot and mouth disease which is a used concern for cattle sheep and and pork the recent Government Accountability Office made many recommendations on how usk could improve your preparedness what actions have you taken to improve preparedness against fatten mouths rice I think that that's part of what we're ever looking at the border well how we work with CBP to identify countries that are of greater risk at perhaps being a vector for it to come into the United States

hello everybody Anthony Gonzalez here with another letter from our mailbag this one comes from Kevin in olmstead Township dear congressman Gonzalez I would like to address the trade war with China and asked whether you would support it to its bitter end or whether you will draw a line China seemingly has nothing to lose in this trade war the worst case scenario for them is they survive one more year and at the max five more years and then a new president is voted in who will likely ended why are we harming consumers for a stable saber-rattling trade war against the country with nothing to lose and who seems unlikely to fold to the president's demands first off thank you for the letter I very much appreciate it so I'll give you kind of China generally and then and then a little bit more of a discussion on trade so my perspective is that China has been an abusive horrible actor on the international stage for a very long time but certainly since 2001 when they came into the WTO if you look at manufacturing jobs in this country and in particular in Northeast Ohio from 2001 to the present the bottom just falls off of it completely part of that is because of the labor scenario over there that's just cheaper to pay to pay workers over there but a lot of it also has to do with them cheating and working around the rules that they agree to in the WTO they do that with every single agreement that they've ever been a part of and the one thing you can count on when you're doing business with China is they're gonna cheat you you talk to any business over who does business over there talk to any government official on either side of the aisle who's ever trying to negotiate an agreement with China it's the same thing over and over again they do respond to power though and so I personally am happy that President Trump is taking on China the the trade war specifically we can argue about the tactics I think that's fine but but the notion that we're actually going to stand up to China and insist that that they behave like a normal partner in the global economic system would I think is ultimately a good thing now like you I want to see all of this end I want to see stable markets I want to see free markets that are fair and I want to see our farmers have the ability to sell their product all over the all over the world I want our manufacturers to be strong I want that exact same thing and I want our consumers to have low prices we all want that so you and I are aligned on that I think most people are how do we get there I think that's the important point the best thing we can do is to sign the u.s. MCA us MCA would solidify the North America trade relationships so that in those negotiations against China we are that much stronger and our markets are that much more certain so that's step one we have to do that right now we are waiting for speaker Pelosi to put it on the floor I have not heard a single economic argument against the u.s. MCA that I think is valid enough to defeat it and and I want to see that get done so that's step one step two is I believe we have to get China back to the negotiating table they agreed to and this is common with China they agreed to 85 percent 80 85 percent of a new trade relationship with the United States only to walk away you know three weeks later and say well we can't actually agree to any of that stuff again it's typical that's what that's what you should expect when you're dealing dealing with the Chinese government I do think it's starting to work for whatever it's worth so you are seeing their GDP numbers slowing considerably you're seeing factories move out of China and into places like Vietnam and Bangladesh and basically the supply chain is reorienting out of China and into the rest of Southeast Asia that is showing up in slower number o'the numbers in Germany and across across the EU as well as sort of globally and so at the end of the day what we really need as I said earlier we needed to solidify that North America trade base and then we need to go finish off the deal with China as soon as we do that all boats will rise you'll see more jobs in Northeast Ohio and and you'll see a calming of the waters a bit so thanks for the question it's a little bit detailed but hopefully that was helpful and thank you

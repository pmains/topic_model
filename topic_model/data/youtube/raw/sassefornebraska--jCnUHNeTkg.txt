guys i want to talk to the state central committee i've heard from many of you in the days since the attack on the capitol threatening another censure for what i said about the president's lies after the election as a friend and fellow republican i want to shoot straight i'm not going to spend any time trying to talk you out of another censure i listen to nebraskans every day and very few of them are as angry about life as some of the people on this committee not all of you but a lot political addicts don't represent most nebraska conservatives when melissa and i first ran back in 14 we spoke with hundreds of thousands across this gorgeous state and we promised to speak out when our leaders not just democrats but any leader in either party crossed the line we pledged to put the constitution ahead of party politics you gave me standing ovations my election night speech the first time i ever ran for or got elected anything was a simple promise that i would always vote my conscience even if it might be against the partisan stream you cheered but many of the same party officials who applauded in 14 cussed me out in 16 when i refused to vote for candidate trump and again when i declined to serve on his re-election committee in 19 and again when i didn't vote for him in 20. now many of you are hacked off that i condemned his lies that led to a riot let's be clear the anger in the state party has never been about me violating principle or abandoning conservative policy i'm one of the most conservative voters in the senate the anger has always been simply about me not bending the knee to one guy but my disagreements with president trump have never been personal they've always been about genuine affection for the constitutional order something every american regardless of party should share january 6th is going to leave a scar for 220 years one of the most beautiful things about america has been our peaceful transfer of power but what americans saw three weeks ago was ugly shameful mob violence to disrupt a constitutionally mandated meeting of the congress to affirm that peaceful transfer of power it happened because the president lied to you he lied about the election results for 60 days despite losing 60 straight court challenges many of them handed down by wonderful trump-appointed judges he lied by saying that the vice president could just violate his constitutional oath and declare a new winner that wasn't true he then riled a mob that attacked the capital mini chanting hang pence if that president were a democrat we both know how you'd respond but because he had republican behind his name you're defending him something has definitely changed over the last four years but it's not me personality cults aren't conservative conspiracy theories aren't conservative lying that an election has been stolen it's not conservative acting like politics is a religion it isn't conservative i still believe every word from the campaign trail what makes america great isn't power politics it's what happens in the communities where you and i are raising our kids happily most nebraskans still believe that too i think that's why nebraskans just gave our campaign tens of thousands more votes than president trump got in our state it's why our campaign just set all-time vote count records in both the primary and general elections despite being primaried last year for not being trumpy all-time most votes for any candidate in nebraska history and look at omaha which he lost by a lot and we won handily why i think the reason simple nebraskans aren't rage addicts and that's good news you are welcome to censure me again but let's be clear about why this is happening it's because i still believe as you used to that politics isn't about the weird worship of one dude the party could purge trump skeptics but i'd like to convince you that not only is that civic cancer for the nation it's just terrible for our party but either way i'm going to keep doing what i promised we still agree on some big things rule of law constitutionalism limited government unlimited human potential extending the american dream to more of our brothers and sisters we can lead again but only if our party is willing to change we're gonna have to choose between conservatism and madness between just trolling versus actually persuading the rising generation of americans again that's what i'm focused on and i sincerely hope that many of you will join in celebrating these big worthy causes for freedom look i know i won't always get it right i make a bunch of mistakes but i'm always going to work hard for nebraskans and i'm always going to tell you the truth thanks for listening

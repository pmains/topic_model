Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition
to the budget released by President Trump. It is cruel and short-sighted. In the extreme cutting
essential investments driving job creation, protecting our environment, finding breakthrough cures, and providing
a safety net for the neediest among us. Among the most objectionable are the Presidentâ€™s
cuts to education. Funds used for college work-study programs,
loan forgiveness for those who enter public service, and dollars used for schools for mental
health will  not just be cut, will be eliminated. 21st Century Community Learning Centers, which
offer learning opportunities during non-school hours to those from our neediest communities,
would be completely eliminated. We know these programs work! An evaluation showed program participants
improved math and English grades by 30 to 40 percent. In my district, Waukegan Community School
District #60 uses these funds to offer an extended day program at seven schools to increase
academic achievement and build life skills. Mr. Speaker, this budget irresponsibly mortgages
our future by shortchanging our children. I urge my colleagues to reject this budget
and let's work together to chart a path that ensures our future prosperity.

Wow well good afternoon everybody I'm Don flame of the Tana Hampton supervisor and we're here for an important meeting to talk about the corona virus steps that we've taken and more portly steps that you can take at home to help stop the spread of this the first thing every resident needs to know is we need to relax by working together and being together and doing the precautions that are necessary we will get through this epidemic I'm joined here today by two individuals dr. David Newberg head of our emergency services for the town and Councilman Anthony D Esposito former fire chief as well as former New York City detective and again the purpose of this interactive meeting is to try and answer the questions of the residents to alleviate their concerns and also have you know some of the steps that you can do in your house and in your daily life to help stop the spread of this virus many of you may or may not be aware a little while ago the county executive announced that here in Nassau County all schools will be closed for the next two weeks and why was that done the county executive again stressed the fact that this is protocol procedure to stop the spread of corona and again that's part of the discussion and it's a part of why we're here today the doctor is going to go through simple protocol simple things washing your hands maintaining social distance from those around you but most important remaining time that is the essential thing all the residents need to know we all have fears you know we are husbands and wives we are fathers we have grandparents we have you know little children we all have right concerns our lives but the idea is when we remain calm we stick together we will get through anything and be able to accomplish it for a couple of remarks before we bring up the doctor I'd like to introduce councilman Anthony D Esposito well thank you supervisor I just want to give the message to all our town of hempstead residents that we are really doing everything that we can to make sure that we provide all the resources necessary to keep everyone healthy and safe we've been working great together with the supervisor with dr. Dave with my colleagues on the Town Board and the message is pretty simple is to keep each other safe to take the proper precautions and proper proper hygiene and make sure that we all stay smart use common sense wash your hands and take the advice of people like dr. Dave I think we need to make sure that we're not taking advice from our people that become doctors quickly on social media but from the real novice so so with that and Thank You councilman and thank all the colleagues it is about working together we are have open lines of communication with NASA Canada national County Department of Health the doctor will touch base on that a little bit with the governor's office and with all localities including mayor's villages and cities why we want to all be on the same page we want to be cohesive and give the proper recommendations and be consistent and with that I'd like to now introduce and to take questions dr. David Newberg he is the head of the ante for the Town of Hempstead he has been a steady hand we like to refer to him as dr. Dave because is a great demeanor and a real calming source during you know times that people have a lot of eggs so with that I'd like the doctor if you'd like to introduce himself to any of the viewers here as well as give some some basic information on precautions they could take we appreciate you taking your time out of this very hectic schedule to help us absolutely supervisor very much and thank councilman so hi everybody I'm dr. Dave Newburgh dr. Dave's fine if you wanted for questions to dr. dave board-certified in emergency medicine and I've worked for the town for more than twenty years I am the medical director for the town and I'm helping to lead all of our medical efforts to combat the corona virus and slow the spread and my background is also in emergency medical services and I work very closely with the fire and EMS services throughout our County again with the councilman as well the two of us have many contacts throughout the Fire EMS service so we are ordinay ting the town's medical response through our own ems department we have that emergency medical services department here at the town that while in the summertime sometimes covers our beaches actually always covers our beaches they are now providing a public health role as well and we've activated them and we're using them to help us come back the spread of the virus so we've been working very very closely with the health department actually have a meeting with them and after this so we're making sure that that we are connecting with all of our partners in government and our health partners as well that to make sure that we're all on the same page and that we're doing everything we can and I just want you guys to be very clear as the supervisor said we are actively monitoring the situation as a physician I am providing medical support to the town and making sure that that everyone that works for us stays safe and that they have the proper information to keep you safe so just like that the supervisor said it's very important that you know you guys do not panic there is no reason to panic but it is important that you take this seriously you know we do not want to ignore that there is a virus spreading that can cause some people to get very sick the good news and this is the thing that really you have to remember is that most people do not get any symptoms from this virus more serious than a cold so for about 80 to 90 percent of the people they will just have cold symptoms and it would be just like any other cold and they'll be fine but there are people especially the elderly and people with other medical conditions such as heart disease diabetes emphysema and other breathing problems immune depressed people with cancer they if they get exposed to this virus could have very serious complications and some people have died from it so why we're doing all the things that we're doing is we want you to be healthy and safe we want our neighbors to be healthy and safe and it's very important that as a social as a social environment and as social community that we want everyone to be safe we don't just want ourselves to be safe we want our friends and our family members and our neighbors to be safe so the tips I'm about to give you will keep you and your family safe but you have to remember this will keep everyone around you safe and when we slow down the virus by doing these things then that will help us get containment of this and we'll get this under control and then we can move on with other things and get back to our normal activities of daily living so please just bear with everything that has to be done to make sure that we keep everybody safe if for a few weeks you're a little inconvenienced just understand we're taking the steps we need to take we're not going to do anything we don't have to do but the things that we're doing are very important to make sure that everyone stays healthy and safe so that's that's the most important thing and then just before we get to the questions that the basic tips so that way you guys know so we can just put that out there the first thing is very good hand-washing so this is a virus that is spread like the cold obviously it has some more serious characteristics for certain people but just like any other virus the most important thing is hand-washing it's a respiratory virus so it goes in through your nose and it goes in through your eyes and it goes in through your mouth and you notice I'm not touching my face because that's also a very important thing is you don't want to touch your face if it's not somebody very close proximity that sneezes or coughs on you the only other way to get the virus inside your body is to touch a surface where it's on and then touch here and it gets inside through your eyes nose and mouth so if you continue to wash your hands on a regular basis that is the motion understandably people are concerned because the hand sanitizer issue where I know that lots of people are working on that but soap and water is always your primary control here so there's plenty of soap right now do not worry about that just make sure that you do your soap and water hand washing don't touch your face that's also extremely important if you don't touch your face then that you're not going to get it introduced into your body and then the social distancing also what the supervisor had mentioned it's about a six foot radius if someone coughs or sneezes that that those droplets could get in your vicinity so for most things if you could stay within about six feet obviously there are things that you have to do where you can get closer to people you want to minimize that contact and direct contact it's much better no more handshake sorry guys that would like to do that I know but we really want to go to the the foot taps like people have been doing or the corona elbow or you know that that way that way we're not we're not you know we're preventing the spread of this I'm sure there will be some other questions but just just those very simple things I just wanted to put that out there before we start answering other questions that's the that's the best way to go and then we'll get the questions and I'm sure more stuff will come up from here great thank you doctor one of the key questions that I've received it's already come up on the pager a couple inches people are hearing about testing and they've heard about the testing facility the first one that's been created up in New Rochelle before for drive through what if any information or can you tell about testing that is going to be taking place for what is happening in Nassau County okay that's a great question so the first thing you guys have to understand is that testing is helpful for folks that are high-risk and to help us figure out how to slow this down but the first thing that you can do is if you develop symptoms of a cold a fever a cough runny nose stay at home that is the most important thing if then if you if you're not sure what to do after that or if your symptoms are getting worse trying to reach a doctor by phone or a lot of the health systems now including NYU and northwell health they have telemedicine and you can do a telemedicine conference that way they can give you instructions on what to do for the folks that that get directed by a doctor to do testing or want to inquire about testing we are going to have some more information on that very shortly that is part of the reason that I've been reaching out to our partners at the state and our partners in the Health Department but there are a number of testing sites at both urgent care locations and at another larger location that are currently in process and as soon as we have the details and when those are open we promise that the town will release that information immediately and we'll have that in real-time so the testing is coming that capability is coming but the tests are not required for you to stay at home to stop the spread and to keep everyone safe and if you're curious or you're not sure if you need a test calling your physician's office or doing one of those telemedicine consult is the best way to find out because then they can direct you where you need to go and then obviously if someone is severely ill you call an ambulance but it's best if the folks that are healthy stay home and and we maintain the the hospitals for the folks that may need a little bit higher level service you know and then in the background of what's been going on take an interesting question that just popped up so I know when we started you said that a lot of people who are going to experience the corona virus it'll just be like the common cold so one of the questions which I think is a good one for those that may have experienced corona symptoms weeks back before it really became as prevalent as it is now do people have the ability to get Corona twice okay so that's a great question you do not have the ability to get this virus twice it is a singular virus you know people can get the flu more than once because there are actually multiple flu viruses depending on the ears sometimes between ten and maybe more but this is a singular virus so anyone who gets this virus once your body immune system will fight it off and then you will be immune to it so you cannot get around a virus again and you know and to also your point counselor a great question and I this is being spread in our community it may have been here for a few weeks prior to us recognizing that it got here so there are lots of people that probably have already had this and did not realize it just thought they had a cold because this also is flu season and there are also just rhinoviruses and AD know viruses and lots of other viruses that call and we've had a terrible flu and it's been a terrible flu season an in terrible respiratory season so you know this is we're noticing this now and we're taking the very important steps to slow it down but it's probably been here for longer than VA then we were aware because of you know we were catching up with the information that was coming over them overseas and there's always going to be a bit of a delay in that so we've had a couple of questions out there regarding town facilities and I do want to let residents know we did closed Echo Park to be consistent with the county's a state of emergency where they closed the county swimming facility we closed Newbridge Road and we've also taken the liberty of closing senior centers we do and are concerned about residents who do get lunches at our senior centers and we are taking that to account Haley that's a good question I just want you to know I appreciate you pointing that out if a resident or senior who came to the Senior Center really counted out for a meal we're taking that to account and we'll follow them as the doctor is stressed so many times our seniors are very very sensitive in this in fact what we could go we took the precaution of bacterial spraying our senior centers but now that the County Executive declared a state of emergency we wanted to remain consistent with them so we've closed them a Echo Park the other parks as of right now are open and the county has urged people you know with proper social distancing go on get some fresh air we don't want people you know getting together in them mingling in a regular normal social setting but those operations are and if and it's things change and will keep the residents updated we'll keep it through our web page or Twitter accounts and things are going to change away and a lot of it stems from the advice of the doctor and what NASA can I Department of Health wants him to do another question I think there was a few questions I know that some of our armed awesome CSEA workforces asking questions and I think one of the common questions that has come up is you know what is the town doing to protect our co-workers so maybe you could just touch on a few of the steps that we've taken in order to make sure that our workforce remains safe and healthy absolutely and you know it's very important from the beginning from when we first started our task force that that I joined with these two gentlemen the first thing we've always been on our mind is making sure that our workforce is safe as the town's physician I am responsible for the health of every person that works for our town and I fielded probably more phone calls in the past two weeks and I had probably in the past two years of my life and literally my you know through the town heads into the department heads all everyone that works for the town can reach out to me anyone from the town or any of our workers that were not aware of this that are watching this right now you just have to reach out to your department head and they have my cell phone number and they will put you in touch with me directly and we will make sure if we cannot take care of the public if our folks are not healthy and that that is extremely important that government continues to run that has been part of the task of these gentlemen have put me on is water will steps do we need to take to make sure that our workforce can continue to function government continue to function you guys still need to be able to live your life within the restrictions that we need to take to keep everyone safe but we want life to continue albeit in a restricted way we still want people getting out like the supervisors were saying we still want people living their lives I mean this it's important that we we'll do that but we are monitoring the health we're actually setting up a task force right now and they'll probably more details to follow soon on that our workforce will get some more information but we are going to make sure that everyone has access to health information and that our connection with the Health Department and with the state anyone that needs anything we will make sure they get that right and we've also had we've set up a hotline right for our workforce if anybody needs to contact you right and that and that hotline information will be getting out very shortly guys that's in the process and that deal you'll get information on that as well as well provides it to you know real proactive steps to make sure that we had hand sign and sanitizer at every scanning station you no more washing stations if needed yeah we have you know abundance of supplies available so everybody keep cleaning proper hygiene yeah we're doing everything that we can yes that's actually correct we took we took the proper steps act town hall to make sure that everyone had the safety precautions that you need also our town workers that you may see our town workers and you go to the clerk's office or if you go to the tax receivers office particular use work then you may see them with gloves on please don't take offense to that that is just so that they can stay safe I actually also the supervisor and the councilman had me go out to all of our talent departments and we'll continue that that process where we're actually teaching them how to keep their family and they're helpful they're healthy ones safe we've been to a number of the departments in in Town Hall and we're also extending that as well to any other departments that want it that way our town workers have the information they need the cake did stay safe and then we just asked you guys you know again took part of the social responsibility that comes from this for us all to keep each other safe if you're not feeling well please don't go to town hall please do not go to the receivers office you know we want to make sure that we're minimizing the spread of this you're gonna set up some I remember surprise you're gonna have a way that they can call or if they need the information they you're gonna send some remote stuff yeah absolutely so that's in process so if you don't feel well but you need to interact with us then they'll be number of Nepal and we'll figure out how to help you out with that and you know if you go there and you have a cough or you know the sneeze you're gonna do that in your arm piece you know again this should be just in general you don't want to touch your face again so if you're in our facilities just please remember don't go there sick if you have to cough or sneeze just please do it into the arm or in term so that way you're not spreading that around and if you see our town workers wearing gloves or doing some social distancing they're not being rude they want to help you we want to keep everything open for you but we just want to take the proper steps to differ one saying no and then was that the recommendation of the doctor over over a week ago we did install additional hand sanitizers on all the floors and in town buildings as well as the senior centers again we're all coworkers we want everybody to be healthy and we want everybody to work together and we're very very cognizant of that I know and the people who work with you recognize that you know the doctors on staff for a particular reason and that is for the safety of yes the general public but everybody we work with in the town and those steps are being followed and again as procedures and guidelines change we will implement that and most importantly you know the resident should also you know take that advice that if you're not feeling well don't go to work yeah hey I didn't be your work I should not be just we're making this message to the town workers because that's where the question came from but this would be for any job you're in do everything we're telling you to keep all of your co-workers safe it's the same it's the same for our town workers it's same for your where if you work for a county if you work for a private organization it's all the same you know the recommendations are the same we want everyone to be safe there's an interesting question here it says um doctor what is your take on reports that while kids are not impacted they can best they can be best undetected carriers even when adults use precaution and then the second part of the questions will you be closing schools any time so the town of times it doesn't have the authority to close schools but I think right before we started this Facebook Town Hall County Executive Karen did advise that schools to be closed for two weeks right today did the county executive in formed the town supervisors she had a public press confidently 10:30 this morning making that announcement that the schools are in Nassau County are going to be closed for the next two weeks and again you know it's a necessary step but the the ideas you know the overall health and safety of all the residents and those are precautions that we need to take into account here's here's a question I think okay so the question about the children the really good news about this coronavirus this is similar to one that we saw 20 years ago actually the SARS epidemic that was in Toronto I was actually a medical student in Rochester so why actually is the second time I've seen I've seen that a corona virus some of those viruses were very impactful on children of the Spanish flu back in 1918 really impacted the young the good news with this one for this question is that young young children especially do not seem to be having any serious or fatal complications from this it is the older people it is the the people that have medical conditions we have to protect them so so the folks out there that have children if you're worried about your children getting sick or dying from this and we do not see evidence that that they are having serious complications however while initially reports were that children could not get this disease we're now seeing that they can they actually had one somewhere overseas I saw our infant had this so there is a possibility that that children can be carriers for this just like any other virus I mean I mean that most viruses are spread by children the flu you know cold viruses we call other viruses such as the other upper respiratory viruses like by H flu and and providers and stuff they they all are spent by children but thankfully the children don't get sick from this one but if your kid is having viral symptoms it is very important that that you treat that you know you good hand-washing you know the same kind of thing is your kid says uh snotty-nosed you don't want to touch your kids snotty nose and then touch your eyes and face and stuff so it's gonna be the same precaution that you're going to take you're obviously can't warm it to your child but you want to make sure that if you're to give your kid is sick you're taking the proper precautions to make sure that your hands are clean and that you're not touching your face but that way you don't spread it to you and and the spread it to other people but but children being a reservoir for viruses is actually a very very normal thing in the land of biology but this one thankfully is not causing them to have bad complications but it's mindful that you don't want to spread any viral syndrome from your child to other people so that should be for any virus not just for this question comes up is quarantine yes the necessity of quarantine so residents will maybe understand a little bit better what what is the overall purpose of why they're asking people to self quarantine if there's consider if there's a concern okay so again to understand the the importance of this guys for each individual person the risk of a bad complication from this is still fairly low there but the problem is is for society especially for the older people and the sick people that risk is higher than usual so for a normal flu season if you look at the numbers the the rate of fatal or serious complications is typically around point zero five percent maybe lower than that depending on each year this has been a very bad flu season and we've had more than 20,000 flu deaths in the United States and many like thirty million people are so get it but you don't quarantine people for the flu because the risk of really bad complications is still low for a society as a whole they're seeing across the board on this one that the list is about two percent so when you're looking at a society perspective we don't want that risk because then you're gonna start overwhelming system with very sick people and then the hospitals will start to get overwhelmed and it will start using up resources very very quickly the reason we quarantine people for something like this is not because individual people necessarily should be worried but we don't want the society functions to be impacted we want the hospitals to work we want the ambulances to respond we want the police to be involved be one we want the doctors to be able to see sick patients so we want to conserve the resources for the folks that need it and then don't use resources that we don't need so by asking someone to quarantine we're taking the people that are not that sick and asking them to stay home so they don't spread that virus to somebody that may get very sick and use up a lot of those resources and then that way eat the folks that do get very sick we can put our resources to helping them so we push that number down you know depending on the country some of the countries have only had a 1% complication risk from this but some of them have had very high ones from coronavirus the seven eight or nine percent we're not anywhere near that that high one right now but we are seeing some other countries getting very badly impacted Italy and China especially and we don't want to end up in that same situation so this is basically like I was actually saying these gentlemen in one of the meeting this is kind of like a fire alarm going off you hear the fire alarm go off you walk outside of the building because you don't want you know we're all used to that that's something we're used to you hear a fire alarm to go outside because you're the building could be on fire but usually most of the time the building's not on fire and for each individual person your building is probably not on fire but if we don't heed the fire alarm now and there is a problem then we're not going to have the resources to take care of that problem so it's much better to to be a little bit inconvenience to mr. ballgame to have to postpone your your banquets now and then society moves on normal and you don't you know and people stay healthy and then then not heed these warnings and not do these days and then run into a problem where suddenly we have a lot of sick people and then and then that's gonna be a different situation so so this is no need to panic it's precautionary but this precaution should not be ignored it just like you would not ignore a fire alarm in a building you should not ignore the things we're asking you to do because this is how you can contribute to keeping your friends and family healthy that's that's the thing if people feel powerless that's why everyone's buying toilet paper and all these things that don't fight a virus but but in this case this gives you the power to take care of this you can keep your family healthy you can you can keep your neighbors healthy do the things we're asking he the things we're doing understand we're not doing this because we're overreacting we're following very clear instructions and we looked back at previous pandemics and we're following the same things that they've done so we've done this before we know that these work and that's why we're using these these controls to slow this down and to allow us to continue to function and do what we need to do to help and our EMS system cannot shut down our hospitals cannot shut down our Police Department our fire departments so we want them to have the resources to continue doing their job and that's why if you have to stay home and that's not using up those resources your your your you're safe and community safe and that allows us to do what we need to do to keep the the people calm and healthy yeah and I noticed one or two people talking about some of the town programs we've actually cut down on the town programs that because of crowd sizing there are a couple of programs that you know one of the one of our two special needs camps that we had to stop the program it's gonna be reschedule a later date and for overalls we're trying to limit the size of people who can participate the state said for some guidelines we're actually having more rigid guidelines on how many people were allowing to get together but also if it does come to it and we have to cancel additional Pro we will whatever steps need to be taken to protect the public at large the co-workers we will do that and that's a necessary thing and I know everybody who watch this understands that but again it is about not spreading the fear that is starting to paralyze people out there you see it when you go to the store you see it on people's faces you seen in something responsive again the idea the doctor is is helping to address some of these questions to put people a little more at ease you know this is we have not seen something like this in our lifetime this is unprecedented my president yes and it's a change and like I said and it is going to be you know their concerns people with their kids being home you know how it's going to affect business there are also going to be other ramifications down the road economically that are you know what we don't even know what those potentially could be but but again it is by asking these questions and dr. by you trying to address them I hope people are listening and having and then taking this message and understanding it and passing it on to their friends about why these precautions are bit are done and the steps that are being taken into account to help protect everybody because we're all one big team yeah oh so guys just there's also confusion over what quarantine means and I just would like to address that because we get a lot of those questions and then I'll get to that the quarantine does not mean that somebody is sick and it does not mean that they're going to get sick but if they're in direct contact with someone we know has the virus it can take sometimes up to five days and maybe a little bit longer for that person to develop symptoms so again it's this um there's two ways to control a virus one weakly to contain it but we were unable to contain this one for many reasons we didn't have the right information we attempted it but it had already been here and we didn't know so once you can't contain it then you have to flatten the curve it's called so basically a virus will peak and inactivity and then come back down kind of like a bell curve what we want to do is stop that peeking and flatten it out by this and then that will shorten the time it's here shorten the athlete all of the impacts medical economic all the stuff you guys are talking about so that's what we're doing by quarantine and doing is doing these steps it slows that and flattens that curve the quarantine is just taking people that might get sick but have a high risk and taking them out of the picture so then we don't have to keep chasing after it so being quarantined if you know somebody that's been quarantined that does not mean that you're gonna get sick and that does not mean you need to panic what we do suggest is if you know someone that's being quarantined the only thing you need to do is self monitor check your temperature everyone should have a thermometer that would probably gonna cause it run on thermometers now nobody left in it so everyone should have a thermometer and be able to check their temperature so that way if you develop a fever then you stay at home and then you call your doctor but if you know someone getting quarantined that just means that that person is voluntarily staying at home to do the right thing for society that does not mean that you're in danger so I guess one of the questions that has come up over the last couple days I know there was a specific question on here is you know the summer is coming should we still go to the gym and idea the answer to that is you need to be responsible obviously if you're not feeling good you shouldn't be that going out in public but if you are using the gym so to speak make sure you have wipes with you to wipe down your stations each time correct but in general supporting local business so obviously our local business local restaurants local shops are the lifeblood of our communities and with the the panic so to speak there you know there's less people shopping and less people eating I guess the question is are we following the same protocol like if you were going to the gym obviously if you're feeling good and you don't have any symptoms it's okay to go out and support your local deli or get takeout from a restaurant or you you know a local pub shop at a local store this isn't about everyone staying inside that's correct so that a couple other just to this point if it's on a surface guys it's very easily killed with just disinfectant the usual wipes Clorox wipes even even if you have to do soap and water and then wash your hands you know it is you're able to clean the surfaces it's not this is not this is not anthrax this is not a bola this is not something that requires some high-level disinfection to kill it's a cold virus also it's not floating around in the air that you can't walk outside it is not it is not something that you can look at person it requires direct contact to spread this virus direct contact is within six feet of somebody for 10 minutes or directly touching them that's why we telling them you know don't touch your eyes and face don't touch your hands that's why we're doing the the social distancing stuff okay but but if you just walk into I was in I was in they're gonna shout out I was a TC bag with TCBY yogurt yesterday and dart city I stopped them every day this week because it's been a long week and I like my yogurt and III and I went in there and meat that stores clean this can be any way and someone was in there asking the manager you know geez the store clean and he's like I cleaned the store anyway like there you do not get this new Cassady walking into a store you know we have to minimize large groups large gatherings because because then there's the high risk if one person sneezes that a lot of people but if you're doing just casual stuff in a store and you walk in and you can do your interaction you walk out and then when you're done you wash your hands and don't touch your face and you know and it requires um to be within someone for about ten minutes within that six feet distance for that to be considered a close contact where you have to worry about quarantining somebody so if there's someone that has coronavirus the they are kind they're close contacts get warrant eand but that is within six feet for ten minutes or direct contact hugging kissing handshaking that sound that's why we're doing the social distancing but but if you walk in and out of a store you're not going to be in anyone else's vicinity important ten minutes so you go to large crowds so I get I think someone's asking what is what is the so to speak definition right now of a large crowd okay so so the the governor has restricted anything less than by anything greater than 500 um some other states have have put restrictions of about 250 just so you know from the beginning when I've been on the task force in the instructions that I've been given the task force it's between 60 and 100 there's not the data changes constantly so we felt at the Town of Hempstead that giving the recommendation to be more conservative was a much safer way to keep everyone protected but again just any time you're in a group with a lot of people you want to be doing that social distancing so you know if you have 20 people somewhere but they're all spaced apart that's not really the problem if you're on line at the local bagel store keep your distance yeah yeah or you don't you but you can still go to the stores go back to that week we want our businesses to function we want our community to function we want people to live as much of their life normally as they can with understanding the restrictions they need to take so we keep everyone safe but you know I would not go to you know I would not go so it's just up wherever you have a bunch of people in a really close like like a lot of our a lot of our fire departments have cancelled their banquets that is the responsible thing on top of the fire department a we are we are the responders that are going on helping people be that there's no way to social distance in those type of it you know you know so you have large gatherings planned like that where it's not essential then then you should not be doing that but but but essential services and your normal life should continue as as planned so just to follow up on the commerce questions so there was a question when people get shipments from say Amazon or Mail or something like that can the virus live on the boxes and the second part of the question was how long does the virus live on a surface okay so there's there's some literature this again is a virus similar to one we saw twenty years ago so they do have literature on that original virus and there's a new article that I just recently read where they did some research on this one it looks that it does seem to like certain surfaces better than others especially some cardboard surfaces it made them and hard surfaces like plastic it seems that those two surfaces it may stay a little bit longer work it's a little bit unclear so I don't want to give you guys the wrong information I want you guys to have the right information depending on the environment it may be up to 48 hours that it could stay on the surface but it must be the right environment and the right time and remember this is a cold virus so it's very easily killed by cleaning by soap by rain by heat might various things you know so if you're getting boxes from Amazon or something like that the best advice I can give you is just all you need to do is just open the box outside your house this would be the easiest thing so no one panics right outside your house open the box wash your hands and then the inside of the box I'm sure every single company that's doing this is taking the proper precautions with everyone's being safe so then you know you can unpack your box and then you know if you've touched the cardboard box then again just wash your hands you don't need to go crazy you don't need to and especially if people are staying home you know they're gonna want to be doing a lot of stuff I think about it if there was really a risk from from the amount of Amazon I mean Amazon must send how many boxes in a day then this thing would be you know so then just the fact that all of those boxes are being sent on a regular basis and we don't have all these sick people that can tell you that the box is not a huge deal but but mentally people want to do things to feel like they're doing things so I think those advice I gave you that's a very reasonable way to take steps just protect yourself but then you don't have to panic for other surfaces again that's why if you touch a surface it's important that you don't touch your face without washing your hands and why actually town of hempstead we've had the Department of General Services wiping down all the services why you have that that company that you guys have coming out that are cleaning and you know if you work if you're in your house just make sure your countertops are clean make sure to wipe down your doorknobs I mean that's the kind of general things that you should do just to be safe again it's not in the air it's not floating around it's not radioactive so so you know that's the kind of stuff that you need to do and don't panic so much it's on the surface just just you know keep things clean and wash your hands right and I think that that's part of its not to panic and I think so you know we appreciate you taking this kind of dues we do have another Facebook live set up for next I believe it is Friday March 20th at 2:00 p.m. where the doctor scheduled now things change as well will again be answering some questions but we appreciate you taking the time we appreciate all the residents here in the town the entire work force all the people we work with for their interaction again this is about stopping the spread of the virus taking all the precautions we can while at the same time recognizing no we our government they're their government has to function everyone has to continue but we are taking into account procedures and steps to modify again for the safety of the entire work force which passes on to the to the general public doc maybe in closing if you want to give some some last minute suggest as the Lessman advice to all the viewers out there really would appreciate and thank you again councilman that gives you see how I felt and put this together I mean again guys it's the most important thing is just be calm you know do all the things that we've been talking about to keep yourself safe your family's safe your colleagues save your co-workers safe and your community safe and if if we additional steps have to be taken you know this is monitored every day by multiple people many different levels of our government the county government state government the CDC I mean there are there are many people behind the scenes that you don't see right now I can tell you that I have multiple EMS workers right now setting up additional resources that we're gonna employ this week to make sure that we're keeping you safe so is this whole you know background of the things that we're doing that you don't see but understand that we are actively working on this and I can tell you that working for the town for many years working with these two gentlemen and in the past we're gonna have two weeks this has been seamless everyone's on board it is a team and we are here to make sure that you're safe I'm offering the medical guidance I'm connecting with all of our colleagues these gentlemen and our task force and the government's are making sure that we do the things to keep you safe and keep us running like the temp that the supervisor has been saying and just it don't panic it work with everybody you know ask questions that are smart don't listen to everything you see on social media and like like the iclear councilman said talk to a real doctor don't just don't just you know you know it's that's important it's going to be a constantly fluid situation and and also try not to watch the news every five seconds because it's because there's going to be more cases there's going to be different things there's gonna be things changing that doesn't mean it's getting worse it means we're doing the things we need to do and if you get kind of caught up in that whole panic then then the panic is what gets you and not the virus and we don't want either one of those things getting you we don't want you panicked we don't want you sick we want everyone calm we want everyone working together we did this after sanity everybody remember a bad thing happened it was terrible we had never seen it before and then we got together as a society we got together as a group you were you were doing your stuff as a fire chief and we fixed it and we put everything back together and look like we're I mean there's still things that we're fixing and it's not perfect but it's a lot better it's gonna be the same thing with this do the things we need to do work together don't panic this is something we've never seen before but we got through it once we're gonna get through this one here and it's gonna be okay that's not good I saw some questions as we were going through people asking at least the workforce about their their workspace their pool cars just want to point out that we are providing any resources needed to all the departments to the depart it's to get out to them to their employees so we can keep those areas clean yeah and it's just standard wiping you down it's not just a nothing this is this is nothing other than that that's that's them i prevail I do want to remind people that there are a couple of hotlines that have been set up by Nassau County New York State if you need them you know the Nassau County hotline is five one six two two seven nine five seven oh and the New York State hotline is one eight eight eight three six four three zero six five again we'll be providing more information the doctor is gonna be sitting later this week if things change I would ask residents to pay attention to social media the Twitter of the town feed the Facebook app as well as their local papers to see if there are any changes and again by remaining calm you're following the advice of the good doctor we are all going to be working together so we can all get through this stage and again is by keeping and maintaining a level head and more importantly you know what I decided taking the steps that are necessary to stop the spread of this matter so I want to thank the doctor I want to thank they the Katzman and I want to thank all the residents that participated and I

representative from north carolina mr mchenry uh not to bring the subject matter this hearing back to the subject matter this hearing but uh i'm sorry mr hicks the senate is in charge of of those types of movements of our ambassadors in the confirmation process i but i hear uh uh you know there's a wide variety of islands just to the south of uh florida that are lovely but the subject matter of today's hearing is to get at the root cause and the root facts of an awful tragedy that occurred the mismanagement then the political cover-up that resulted from that mismanagement and a rush to judgment by some very ambitious political operatives within washington at least that's nearest what i can tell having gotten into the facts as we have today and knowing what we know today so i want to thank all three of you gentlemen for your service to the american people and to our government and i want to say to you that uh the tough treatment you've gotten as a result uh not only on that day in september but since then is uh a horrible tragedy i want to go back to mr gowdy's line of questions here mr hicks was there a protocol within the consulate in the event of a protest yes there was was there any evidence in when you were there in libya on that day that this was uh a protest no there was none and uh i'm confident that ambassador stevens would have reported a protest immediately if one appeared on his door the protocol of course was for us to evacuate immediately the from the consulate and move to the annex okay was was there anything in connection to a youtube video um was there any awareness uh that was the uh the events occurred because of a youtube video the youtube video was a non-event in libya okay and did you know about that within a couple days or the day of yes okay um and so did you report to anyone in washington within the first couple of days that there was anything in connection a protest in connection to a youtube video no the only report that our mission made through every channel was that there had been an attack on a consulate not a protest no protest you can leave your microphone off i'm going to come back to you a few times uh mr gowdy mentioned this earlier but on september 16th ambassador susan rice went on the sunday shows recited a whole group of talking points were you a part of uh those talking points no i had no role in their preparation okay so one month later we had an under secretary kennedy let's play his statement always made clear from the very beginning that we are giving out the best information we have at the time we are giving it out that information has evolved over time for example if any administration official including any career official had been on television on sunday september 16th they would have said the same thing that ambassador rice who said she had information at that point from the intelligence community and that is the same information i had and this i would have made exactly the same points clearly we know more today but we knew what we knew when we knew it by september 16th did you know what you know what you know which is apparently what susan rice said let me let me rephrase that actually let me actually make that a question if you will ambassador rice recited a set of facts a month later they defended the state department defends that you are a career state department official would you have said the things that ambassador rice said not after hearing what president magariah said especially considering the fact that he had gone to libya to benghazi himself at great personal and uh political risk and for him to appear on world television and say this was a planned attack is by by terrorists is phenomenal i i was jumping up and down when he said that it was a gift for us from a policy perspective from my perspective sitting in tripoli and did that occur before september 16th he said that on the talk same talk shows with with ambassador rice and did you report that was there knowledge that he was going to say that no there was not okay mr chairman i know we have a lot more questions about this including what that did in country ambassador rice's rhetoric what that did and the impact it had in country for the work that you were doing and the delay that resulted because of that of the fbi investigation on the ground if you could speak to that and mr chairman if you'll indulge me uh and let him answer please thank you great yes sorry uh again it took 17 18 days for us from that interview to get the fbi to benghazi and we dealt with people at a low level and we got them to benghazi by stringing together a series of basically low-level commitments to help us get them to benghazi thank you the gentleman from wisconsin

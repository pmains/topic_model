hi congressman tracy mann here joining you from my washington dc office really full week legislatively last week i flew back into washington yesterday for votes all this week a couple things last week since i joined you last number one h.r 37 55 the pro-abortion bill did pass on the house floor friday morning this is the most pro-abortion legislation in the history of the country we spoke out against it on the house floor very disappointed it passed every indication is it will not get 60 votes in the senate so it shouldn't go anywhere but this legislation is very bad very concerning the other legislation that did pass last week is the ndaa which stands for the national defense and authorization act basically for decades every year congress passes the budget for the military for the next year there's a lot of good things in that legislation there's also a couple of things i strongly disagree with as well on the good side i think the amount is appropriate i think it positions us well to really look at how we combat and uh and go toe-to-toe with china uh militarily uh here in the future and positioned us well for that it also makes sure that people are soldiers that are not willing to be vaccinated that it's a honorable discharge not a dishonorable discharge i strongly oppose these vaccine mandates in the first place uh but but if they're going to be in place we need to make sure that that those are as minimal as possible for our soldiers some other things in there that are positive overall holds the taliban accountable after this afghanistan withdrawal debacle a couple things i don't like one of the biggest things is the red flag laws that are in there those laws that are in there originally are horrible how the ndaa works is it's always voted on twice so the first version passes the house a version passes the senate they come together and will come back i have been reassured repeatedly in writing that the red flag logs are going to come out on the second version the same thing happened last year both parties have actually said that they're going to strip that language out if that language is in the second version that comes back for final passage i will vote against it uh but but that's where that sits as of right now so far as this week you know four big things that are hitting all at once here uh infrastructure bill which is being tied to a 3.5 trillion dollar reconciliation bill you know this is the biggest tax and spend legislation in the history of the country strongly oppose it i've been speaking out against it that will continue a third thing that's happening this week is the fiscal year for the federal government ends here on thursday september 30th so without action by congress a continuing budget resolution uh there'll be a government shutdown here as of friday and lastly the debt ceiling which will be coming up as well so a lot going on here in washington as always if you have any questions or need anything at all contact me at our washington dc dot city manhattan office thanks a lot and more to come

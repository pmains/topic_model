gentlelady is recognized for one minute thank you madam speaker i thank the gentlelady for yielding and thank her for her exceptional leadership uh and that of uh the ranking member of the full committee mr conyers and the work of your staff uh the facts to the fore on this subject i rise uh in opposition to all of these amendments for reasons that i spelled out for half an hour last night not to go into them again but i want to just say how disconcerting it is after we have seen the president act with authority in the law under the law and also according to precedent of every president democratic and republican since president eisenhower that's why it's very disturbing to see the speaker of the house by saying that president obama has cemented his legacy of lawlessness legacy of lawlessness that's that's just simply not what it was reagan president reagan lawless was president george herbert walker bush law was president george w bush lawless i never heard him say that about any executive actions taken by them but i rise in opposition to all of these amendments speak specifically to the desantis amendment as can opposition contain a letter from the national catholic conference of bishops on behalf of the bishops they write to us that we oppose immigration-related amendments in the bill specifically to desantis they say representative desantis immigration amendment the bishops say would prevent the department of homeland security from implementing its memoranda setting civil immigration enforcement priorities while presented as a measure that helps domestic violence victims we fear that it actually would discourage many such victims from reporting abuse immigrants face obstacles to reporting crimes that have been perpetuated but that have been perpetrated against them this amendment would perpetuate this problem so i urge our colleagues to vote no on all of the amendments call to their attention and direct the letter from the bishops urging a no vote on the amendments and submitted for the record and again say this what is disturbing about this you have a difference of opinion about immigration or this or that but to describe the president is lawless to use the constitution of the basis uh for this debate when in fact the courts have upheld the rights of our presidents to uh to act on an executive take executive action in relationship to protecting immigrants in our country every president democratic and republican from president eisenhower to the president i urge a no vote on all the amendments particularly in this case the desantis amendment and submit my the bishop's letter for the record in opposition uh to those amendments you'll yield back general

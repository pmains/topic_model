Mr Speaker I rise today to honor Earl and Doris Sorrells a remarkable couple who dedicated their lives to bettering their community Earl passed away on January 2nd and was preceded in death by his wife Doris last year leaving a hole in the hearts of many and since then their beloved town of Raymond Illinois has shown a little less bright almost everyone in town knew Earl he ran a radio show that aired at 5:30 every morning dedicated to the latest in Illinois agriculture off the air Earl and Doris and their entire family worked hard running their small business in Raymond I knew Earl and Doris for over 25 years they are some of the most generous people I have ever met giving back in every way to their community not only with their financial contributions but with their time and talents as well there's nothing that made them happier than their home town of Raymond Illinois except maybe the st. Louis Cardinals Earl and Doris were very well-loved by me and by everyone in central Illinois they're missed immensely

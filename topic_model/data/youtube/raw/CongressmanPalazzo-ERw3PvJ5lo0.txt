mr. pallazzo well thank you chairman Admiral yeah that's great to see you again thank you for being here today during last year's hearing secretary Ross made a commitment to me into this subcommittee to work with the Gulf states to find a solution to better manage our red snapper fisheries and Admiral you and I have spoken about this issue as well fast forward to today this administration has stood by these commitments and I want to first say how much I and my Gulf colleagues appreciate the wilderness of this administration to work with our states and the recreational fishing community on ways to improve red snapper management and which as everyone knows is by far the most popular and contentious offshore fish in the Gulf of Mexico and I'm proud of the work that Mississippi and the other Gulf states have put into developing proposals that will allow each of the states to manage recreational fishermen in both state and federal waters over the next two years Mississippi is more than capable of managing its fishery in a way that ensures conservation while maximizing access and I believe it should be given the maximum management flexibility possible under this proposal and I know that the question I'm about to ask could very easily be answered at any time this week or next week so without being a spoiler Admiral will you commit NOAA Fisheries to working with Mississippi and the other states to ensure these proposals are approved and provide whatever assistance is needed to ensure their success yes congressman we will and I think the red snapper story this year is a fantastic one and especially in light of the last year's season and so I think we're gonna be very successful and I will work with Mississippi and all the Gulf states and in managing the in Cocoa managing the red snapper fishery thank you for that commitment shifting gears a little bit as you know from your own science background as the crew in career at socha nog referred the Navy maintaining the competitive edge in the maritime environment is critical for both defense and non-defense there is legislation introduced in both the House and Senate for the purpose of developing a NOAA Navy program for the assessment and acquisition of unmanned maritime systems to the benefit of several NOAA offices including ocean exploration and research however the President's budget has reduced or eliminated programs that aim to maintain that competitive edge especially through competitive programs and cooperative and Institute's with the university scientists such as with the University of Southern Mississippi my alma mater and others what is your strategy for maintaining the United States competitive advantage in the area advanced technologies relevant to the NOAA mission especially in unmanned maritime systems and ocean exploration with such dramatic reductions to the budget so congressman I I understand and appreciate your interest in support of our technology development certainly with respect to ocean capabilities as well as the unmanned systems work we are doing and we've discussed together personally and so yes the the budget choices in terms of the unmanned systems work in our office of ocean and Atmospheric Research as well as many others that are important we've made because this administration is committed to prioritizing national security funding and in it from my past experience in the Navy I support that prioritization and so we had to cut we decided to reduce programs that we felt were either redundant or had were primarily supporting grants to local or local stakeholders or States and was the core government work that we preserved the it with respect to unmanned systems and ocean exploration it we didn't zero those out so even though we removed the unmanned systems research effort there is still a vast amount of great unmanned work going on all across NOAA our fisheries for example are doing amazing things serving marine mammals and and and acoustically with unmanned surface vehicles and underwater vehicles looking at fish and fish stocks that in ways they're just much more efficient and cost savings compared to our previous efforts and so we're flying drones we're doing underwater and an on surface type of activity and an advanced thing that still in our in the current line of funding we have today but I will look forward to working with you and the and the Navy going forward to see how we can best continue those operations and the research and development behind it well Thank You Admiral thank you for your service and with that I yield back thanks cumson mr. bean

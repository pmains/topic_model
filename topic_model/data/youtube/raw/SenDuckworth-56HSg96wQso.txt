every American deserves to breathe in clean air and drink clean water no matter their zip code the color of their skin or how much money they make in areas like the south side of Chicago the air quality is so poor that the children african-american children there have twice the asthma rates of other communities folks in Louisiana are still living in what's been nicknamed cancer alley where our government looks the other way in places like Newark New Jersey we have parents being told not to let their toddlers drink the water because it is poisoning them still today 6 million homes continue to get water from lead service lines a half million kids under the age of 6 have elevated levels of lead in their blood low-income communities African American communities are being poisoned by large industrial animal agriculture that's poisoning their water poisoning their air that are undermining their very well being it's 2019 and even today far too many lower-income communities and communities of color still don't have access to the safe air or water they need to survive enough enough this isn't just an environmental issue it's a matter of health and safety it's a matter of systemic racism of discrimination against those in poorer neighborhoods it's a matter of justice environmental justice we believe that the federal government cannot turn its back cannot do nothing because the opposite of justice not always in justice it's often apathy indifference and inaction we must act that's why today on Earth Day senator Booker and I are launching the Senate's first-ever environmental justice caucus I hope that you will join us and our efforts to make sure that our words are true that every child every family every American has justice in their environment that's why we've started this caucus and it's why we're going to pour our hearts into getting every American the environmental justice they deserve

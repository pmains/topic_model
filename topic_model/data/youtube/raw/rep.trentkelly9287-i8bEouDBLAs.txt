I have a little theory that if we don't do it this time in a fashion that is proportionate to the amount of damage that he's done with us we'll never do it probably in the next 50 or 60 years or Calamity whatever the ending of the USA is simply because of this we can see and we have tests not not four generations ago when things were good but just two years ago we saw how to do it and we saw what works and we went the other way now if those people the supposedly 81 million don't learn a lesson then they're just brain dead it's a little scary Paul and just you know I want folks to remember when they took over two years ago with both uh the house senate and the presidency the first bill that they brought to the floor was their hr1 they even numbered it their number one and it was to change elections to be like the elections in 2020. that's right they they only didn't pass we cannot allow them to take over elections fatally because we will never have another fair shot if we do that well in um if you think about it and I'm I was talking to somebody I said it's almost to challenge the election now and they've been working on this and it's not by chance that they've done this and I think they've done it because of the past and also the future and the future is November the 8th if they are planning on cheating then they've built in this where challenging election results has almost the sensitivity of the inward in other words you do it you got to get punished one way or the other you could lose your job you could lose your social media platform and if you're a business that's not good and and and they have they have done that they have cultivated this to where we are at this point well I mean they refer to us as seditionists and Un-American and all those things but let's remember they are the ones who started objecting to elections Stacy Abrams Al Gore I mean you go on and on and so it is only bad to think there's something wrong with the election if you're a republican if you're a Democrat it's quite fine Stacy Abrams has still not seated her last election but there's no problem with that Stacy uh is has uh as a matter of fact here's a well-timed soundboard I did not say and nor do I believe in defunding the police he is lying again and I've never said that I believe in defunding the police flashback some defunding we have to reallocate resources so yes yes I've never said that I believe in defunding the police so but here's here's the thing about this Congressman when it comes to the funding employees fracking from Ketterman and all these other things out there and even Joe Biden the lies are there and these people still vote for them well they they they did want to defund the police you remember their Summer of Love in Seattle Portland where they burned down cities let me tell you I think Americans should die under two years of democrat role feel less safe than they have in the last 50 years whether that is from our border whether that is from crime in the cities whether that is being afraid of being attacked anywhere everywhere we have to get folks in who do not believe in defunding the police but supporting the blue backing the blue that's what Republicans are for when and not if but when the Republicans take over and have the gavel in the House of Representatives uh I know you're going to be playing a key part uh in on some of those committees well to your thoughts you've seen all of these I mean the January 6 deal uh Hunter Biden man there's some major major hearings that need to be held in the right way they've never ever gotten anything behind a thing like re-ups by the way Ted Cruz and the Senate tried to and here's the way it sounds to turn to the FBI how many FBI agents or confidential informants actively participated in the events of January 6th sir I'm sure you can appreciate that I can't go into the specifics of sources and methods uh did any FBI agents or confidential informants actively participate in the events of January 6th yes or no sir I can't I can't answer that did any FBI agents or confidential informants commit crimes of violence on January 6th I can't answer that sir February 5th 2021 Epps wandered around the crowd that had gathered and there's video out there of him Channing tomorrow we need to get into the capital into the capital this was strange Behavior so strange that the crowd began chanting fed fed fed fed fed fed Miss Sanborn was Ray Epps the FED sir I cannot answer that question it goes on and on and on and she answered nothing but do you think what hearings would you call first well I think first of all we've got to look into what Hunter Biden's doing and has done and continues to do and I think that is one of the very first ones that we're going to bring up uh probably on the house Intel committee uh and then also a lot of the January 6th let me tell you we got a fighter on our side Jim Jordan will be in charge of Judiciary and in coordination with the Intel committee we're going to dig down into the bottom of some of these truths it's not going to be one of these like the Democrats have done with uh two so-called Republicans on their committee calling it bipartisan which has been a theater production you know it's not been anything about getting the facts it's all about trying to get votes and so I think those are going to be some of the important ones you know but also a lot of these uh these orders on the border and and some of these uh presidential uh executive orders that have passed just to get to the bottom of those because a lot of these I think are borderline illegal well if he if he does lose one of one house the house or the Senate and hopefully both of them but if he doesn't lose just the house it's going to be a block there from any future legislation for the next two years it certainly becomes a lame duck with all already a lame mine but uh I I guess the only way he would have to go is more executive uh uh more executive decisions yeah we're going to have to continue to fight those I mean when he first came in I mean he killed all by killing the oil pipeline uh day one he did away with all the all the other progress we've made on the border and stopping illegal immigration and so we're just going to have to contest him at every turn for executive orders that he doesn't care whether they're lawful or not he's just punching them out at a rate that we've never seen before and again we got word yesterday that the confirmation uh this week that Wuhan uh Laboratories is where the coveted vaccine did emanate uh once again Donald Trump proved to be right it is amazing it is amazing uh over and over and over and in this Paul Pelosi deal where they're talking about um the threats issued against Nancy Pelosi my God we've had almost five years of threat threats against Donald Trump yeah you know Paul and this is personal to me listen it is wrong for anyone to attack any political figure or their family regardless of how heated they are but you know they want to blame this on right wing we probably could but when a Bernie Sanders fan and someone who was spun up by his by all his rhetoric attacked me and tried to shoot me with an AK4 SK ads you know we didn't blame that on Bernie Sanders we claimed that I'm an idiot with a gun but they're trying to blame it on us that's the difference in the press and that is a difference in parties and and your colleague Steve scalise almost died from there too it was uh very very close

uh thank you madam chair in late february russia launched its unprovoked and its violent invasion of ukraine and president biden has organized our allies to impose crippling sanctions on uh or has organized our allies to impose sanctions on russia i recently returned from visiting eastern europe where i heard thanks for president biden's and america's leadership on these issues but also concerns about american oil and gas companies profiteering from russia's invasion you know for the most part oil companies have rightly stayed away from trading russian oil during this global crisis and several of your companies are discontinuing investments that have long fueled putin's war machine but among our witnesses as my colleague representative tonko pointed out there has been one company that continued to purchase russian oil even after russia's invasion of ukraine on march first after the invasion began shell purchased a hundred thousand barrels of russian oil shell got this oil at a deep discount because no one else would touch it miss watkins i'm aware that your company has since apologized but what do you think it says about shells values and credibility that you bought russian oil while the russian military started carrying out its brutal attack on the people of ukraine i think it says um you know we we within a day or two we announced that we were walking away from three billion dollars worth of investments um and i think that says a lot about how we despise what is happening certainly i am aware of your recent actions but the reality is after the invasion uh you know you put the prophets ahead of the lives of innocent ukrainians and before our ability as a nation to hold vladimir putin accountable i mean each of you have been crystal clear in public statements in the past month that putin's invasion has been great for your bottom line not only have each of you taken advantage of this war and the crisis that it has produced to return even more profit to shareholders it also appears that at least five top oil executives have cashed out some 99 million dollars worth of stock personally since the invasion began these include top executives with from hess marathon continental resources and represented here today pioneer mr sheffield you sold 22 247 shares worth of 5.3 million on march 2nd a little over a week after russian russia invaded ukraine was the value of pioneer stock when you sold it after russia's invasion higher lower or the same as it was prior uh to on february 24th yes uh madam the stock is only up about eight to nine percent since the uh invasion and i still have not over 90 of my net worth in pioneer stock it's the first time i've sold stock in several years well thank you mr sheffield but the undeniable reality is that you did sell over 22 000 shares of your company's stock and pocketed millions from putin's attack on ukraine look today's witnesses they've talked extensively about industry externalities and the global nature of oil prices that aren't in their control yet at the same time i hear how these same executives and their companies are independently deciding not to invest in new supply or produce more which would drive down gas prices for consumers in order to return value to the shareholder you may not directly control price but you do manipulate supply to decrease the amount of product on the market and you do that to create scarcity which at the end of the day drives up costs for hard-working americans it's easy to make prices skyrocket overnight and that's great for share prices and stockholders mr sheffield has showed us that much but it's bad for working families in my district and in every congressional district across our country your companies made a combined 76.4 billion dollars last year you're on track to make more this year you're cashing multi-million dollar paychecks and you're profiting personally off your stock options telling us that your hands are tied meanwhile there are millions of folks who are seriously considering taking a second or third job just to make ends meet so i'll close by asking you what any working parent who is struggling with their home heating bill or their gas prices in my district would sitting here today no evasion no pivoting no slick lobbyist talking points how do you plan to change course today will you stop prioritizing obscene profitability buybacks and dividends over the livelihoods of working americans because after all you represent american companies and that used to mean something especially when we've been faced with threats abroad it's my hope that you'll take this opportunity to make it mean something again

once again you've shown brilliance by starting your questioning regarding sri lanka i will imitate that brilliance as i understand it i bastard well well we're talking about a 92 percent decline in our aid to sri lanka does this request include any support for reconciliation and reform efforts in sri lanka and what signal are we sending with a 92% reduction ambassador turn to my colleague to discuss the specific USAID programs but again I recognize the severity of the percentage decline in ESF but I would point to the totality of our programs and on the reconciliation side diplomatically we have always been the leading partner in driving the original agreement with you know with Geneva which produce the government so we do a great job of talking which is what diplomats and congressmen do but in my world money talks and a 92% decline and money cannot be covered up by eloquence or good offices or even the art of the deal negotiations MS steel we're talking about 3.3 million dollars that's basically I hesitate to ask you about the aid for Sri Lanka because it's basically been zeroed out I'm sure Congress will not do that but can you support reconciliation reform with three point three million dollars mr. shermin we have invested seventy million dollars since 2015 and we worked in reconciliation economic growth and good governance and we have been using those resources which continued to be still available some of them to build their capacity to continue to be able to do what you what we started I thank you

I thank the gentlelady for yielding too often our communities of color are left behind too often they are on the frontlines of a marginal unjust injustice that's why I'm proud to co-sponsor this bill with representatives to leave and Ocasio Cortez our amendment makes sure that help gets to the people who need it the most it requires the newly established PAS community water systems grant program to prioritize communities that are disproportionately exposed to environmental harms and public health impacts from pollution many of those communities are communities like my very own district communities of color and low-income communities are disproportionately exposed to fifa's contamination they often face a variety of environmental threats such as das from congested highways water runoff or air pollution from toxic chemicals and close proximity to landfills when there's a grant application to address P Fox contamination when it's under consideration these communities that have exposure first and worst should get priority it shouldn't be an afterthought afterthought that is why this is a critical first step to ensuring the Safe Drinking Water Act prioritizes environmental justice thank you I yield back

senator kennedy thank you mr chairman madam secretary thank you for being here according to the department of labor i believe inflation was annualized was 5 in may i know you're not clairvoyant but you're experienced where do you think inflation will be at the end of this year well let me go to 2022. no if you could go to end of 2021 first for me so i i believe that my my expectation although there's a lot of uncertainty is that the monthly data the data that would pertain to what happened in a given month that those numbers will come down but by the end of this year i i expect the inflation to be more than 5 or less i believe that the monthly numbers are likely to generate annual inflation rates if you take the monthly number and ask what would inflation be if it continued at that pace for a year i believe that will come down toward two percent but typically inflation rates secretary i'm sorry to interrupt you but my question was pretty simple right now in may on an annualized basis we both know what that means inflation was five percent i know you're not clairvoyant where do you think it will be at the end of this year so most the type of inflation number that you're talking about compares the level of prices this month with what they were a year prior that's correct and that's different than what happened over the span of the month i understand that but i'm like by the end i'm asking you inflation on a year ago this is not a complicated question i'm not trying to be rude but but this is not a complicated question we're at five percent now based on where it was a year ago so now we we know what we're both talking about for the rest of will it be higher at the end of this year or will it be unless 12 months i believe it will come down you think it'll be less by the end of this year than five percent yes okay what makes you think that because i believe that as the economy is opening up again um prices that fail enormously at the beginning of the pandemic are returning now back toward normal levels and so what we're seeing in these year year-over-year comparisons is of prices which are now reasonably normal or in many cases at levels that are still somewhat below normal we're comparing those levels with highly depressed prices a year before i understand and that will i mean we've got a limited amount of time madam secretary um if what you if you think in five percent inflation in may and you think it'll be less at the end of the year yes then why did the federal reserve announce that it was going to uh thought they were going to have to move their interest rate increases sooner and faster than what they had originally expected well i don't really want to comment on the fed but i would simply say that is not an announcement that they made well the market sure reacted sounds like the federal reserve's worried about inflation um i i would just refer you to the comments that share powell made in testifying yesterday and it is press conference but i'm talking about the action the federal reserve took the federal reserve met recently and they said look we know we told you this but things have changed and we're now telling you that we're likely to have to raise rates sooner faster let me just finish then we originally uh told you why do you think they did that that is because they're concerned about inflation aren't they that is not what they did several individuals several individuals wrote down in their own individual forecasts which were published that they saw uh inappropriate to raise rates sooner than previously why then did the federal reserve last week raise the interest rate on excess reserves that's a technical adjustment that they made because the federal funds rate had fallen uh to the very bottom of their target range and it was a purely technical adjustment look i it's not appropriate for me to discuss fed policy i don't want to comment on it is i'm not asking you to make fed policy i'm asking your opinion and and usually when the federal reserve raises interest rates on excess reserves they're trying to contract the money supply no they're trying to contract the money supply is because they're worried about inflation it's a purely technical adjustment they made clear in that the stance of monetary policy has not changed at all but because short-term overnight rates were drifting to the very bottom of their target range they made small adjustments i've only got a minute left here's my worry madam secretary and i hate to have to interrupt you but we we only have so much time um i i know your jobs put the best face on it and i understand the federal reserve's job is to put the best face on it but inflation at five percent annualized gets my attention uh when the federal reserve says or even certain members they say nothing to worry about here nothing to see but by the way we're probably going to have to raise interest rates sooner and faster than we thought and when i see them raise the interest rate on excess reserves to soak get money out of the money supply that tells me they're worried about inflation and here's my question nobody's clairvoyant a lot of these experts that you talked about never call the recession in 0809 a lot of these experts at the reserve at the federal reserve what if they're wrong and the president has been adamant that he's not going to raise taxes on middle-class americans he's allowing that to happen right now because inflation prices are rising higher than than wages and five percent inflation is a tax it's a tax on food it's a tax on energy it's a tax on everything and we can say it's temporary but the actions of the fed indicate to me they don't think it's temporary your thoughts madam secretary i'm gonna have to leave it at that senator we'll have another round um but uh well others went over mr chairman what's that some others went over yeah actually they went over about the same time um but uh let me call them i'll give an answer on the next we'll have another round because i i i'm just trying to keep everything um you know with within the fair range here

  TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES NOT TO COOPERATE WITH THE  CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION. JOINING US NOW IS ADAM SCHIFF,  CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE  INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AND A  MEMBER OF THE HOUSE SELECT  COMMITTEE INVESTIGATING JANUARY  6th. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING  US TONIGHT, MR. CHAIRMAN. I WANTED TO GET YOUR REACTION TO KEVIN McCARTHY'S THREATENING OF  PARTIES WHO YOU AS INVESTIGATORS HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH ABOUT  YOUR INVESTIGATION. >> WELL, FIRST, LAWRENCE, I JUST WANT TO SAY HOW REFRESHING IT IS TO SEE ZELL INSKI FINALLY GET  THAT WHITE HOUSE MEETING AND  WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN. IT WAS TRUMP'S EFFORT TO TRY TO  SNEER BIDEN AND WEAKEN HIM AS A  POLITICAL OPPONENT THAT ENDED UP GETTING HIM IMPEACHED. SO VERY REFRESHING TO SEE THAT  MEETING TAKE PLACE AND TO TAKE  PLACE WITH JOE BIDEN. IN TERMS OF McCARTHY, McCARTHY  UNDERSTOOD EVEN AS WE WERE  INVESTIGATING PRESIDENT DONALD  TRUMP'S UKRAINE MALFEASANCE A  COUPLE YEARS AGO THAT DONALD  TRUMP WAS GUILTY, BUT  NONETHELESS, HE AND THE  REPUBLICANS IN THE CONGRESS AT  THE TIME DEFENDED THE PRESIDENT  AND TRIED TO THWART OUR  INVESTIGATION, EVEN THOUGH WE  ALL UNDERSTOOD THAT IF HE WASN'T STOPPED, HE WOULD DO IT AGAIN OR WORSE AND, IN FACT, THAT'S WHAT  HAPPENED. SO WHAT McCARTHY IS DOING NOW BY ISSUING THE STATEMENT  THREATENING THE TELECOMS IF THEY COMPLY WITH A LAWFUL PROCESS BY  SELECT COMMITTEE, HE WILL PUNISH THEM IF HE SHOULD BE THE SPEAKER ONE DAY. IT GOES TO SHOW YOU NOTHING HAS  CHANGED FOR McCARTHY. HE'S STILL PROTECTING THE FORMER PRESIDENT. IT'S STILL A CULT IN THAT PARTY  AROUND THIS FORMER FAILED  PRESIDENT. AND THE FACT HE WOULD GO TO SUCH LENGTH AS TO THREATEN THE  TELECOMS SHOWS HOW DESPERATE HE  IS IN THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S  DEFENSE. IT'S AN EGREGIOUS VIOLATION OF  ETHICS AND SHOWS YET AGAIN WITH  KEVIN McCARTHY WILL NEVER BE  PERMITTED TO GO ANYWHERE NEAR  THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE MAINTAIN A DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY IN  CONGRESS. >> I JUST WANT TO DWELL ON THIS  McCARTHY THREAT BECAUSE IT COMES FROM A LEGISLATIVE BODY. HIS POWER, IF HE WERE TO BECOME  SPEAKER, WOULD BE LEGISLATIVE. SO HE'S SAYING IF YOU COMPLY, IF YOU TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES COMPLY WITH LEGAL PROCESS, WE  WILL WRITE A LAW AND WE WILL  PASS A LAW THAT WE WOULD NOT  PASS. WE WOULDN'T DO THIS AT ALL, WE  WOULDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT AS  LONG AS YOU DIDN'T COMPLY WITH  LEGAL PROCESS. BUT IF YOU DO, WE WILL WRITE A  LAW THAT WILL HAVE TO BE ABOUT  SOMETHING LIKE TAXATION OR SOME  REGULATION OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS IN A WAY THAT IS -- THAT THEY  HAVEN'T EVEN CONTEMPLATED. HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT IS. HE COULDN'T EVEN ANNOUNCE WHAT  THE ACTUAL LEGISLATION WOULD BE, BUT WHAT HE'S CLEARLY SAYING IS  THIS LEGISLATION ISN'T  NECESSARY, THERE'S NO REASON TO  DO IT. THE ONLY REASON WE WOULD DO IT  IS AS SOME KIND OF VINDICTIVE  ACT AGAINST COMPANIES THAT  COMPLIED WITH THE LAW. >> WELL, THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. AND HERE HE IS FOLLOWING AGAIN  THE FORM OF HIS BOSS FROM  MAR-A-LAGO. TRUMP WHEN HE WAS IN OFFICE ALSO THREATENED THE TELECOMS BECAUSE  HE DIDN'T LIKE WHEN THERE WAS  SORT OF ADVERSE FEEDBACK ON  SOCIAL MEDIA ABOUT HIM. SO HE THREATENED, FOR EXAMPLE,  TO REPEAL THE IMMUNITY FROM  LIABILITY THAT THE TELECOMS  ENJOY. NOW, THERE MAY BE GOOD REASONS  TO DO THAT, BUT PUNISHING THEM  BECAUSE HE DOESN'T LIKE THEIR  CONTENT ISN'T ONE OF THEM. AND HERE IT'S ALMOST MORE  EGREGIOUS FROM McCARTHY BECAUSE  YOU HAVE CONGRESS, THE VERY  BRANCH IN WHICH HE IS SERVING ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS TELLING THESE COMPANIES PRESERVE THESE RECORDS BECAUSE WE MAY NEED THEM IN OUR  INVESTIGATION AND HE'S  THREATENING THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE ASKED TO COMPLY WITH LEGAL CONGRESSIONAL PROCESS. HE'S TRYING TO UNDERMINE HIS OWN BRANCH TO PROTECT HIS FORMER  PRESIDENT. IT SHOWS JUST WHAT A SACRIFICE  OF OUR OWN INSTITUTIONAL  INTERESTS McCARTHY IS WILLING TO UNDERTAKE TO PROTECT THIS  WOULD-BE AUTO DEMOCRAT. >> WHAT YOU TELL US ABOUT THE  PACE OF THE COMMITTEE'S  INVESTIGATION OF JANUARY 6th? WHAT CAN WE EXPECT NEXT? >> WE ARE WORKING THIS AS  EXPEDITIOUSLY AS WE CAN. WE'VE BEEN HIRING NEW STAFF,  MAPPING OUT OUR NEXT HEARINGS OR HEARING. AS YOU CAN SEE, ISSUING A BROAD  REQUEST OF INFORMATION AND  PRESERVATION LETTERS. WHEN YOU COMPARE HOW QUICKLY WE  HAVE ASSEMBLED OUR SEARCHES AND  MOVING FORWARD COMPARED TO, FOR  EXAMPLE, THE 9/11 COMMISSION,  WE'RE MOVING AT PRETTY BREAK  NECK SPEED. I THINK IT'S IN PART BECAUSE WE  FEEL A REAL SENSE OF URGENCY  HERE. THE COUNTRY IS STILL NOT OUT OF  THE WOODS. THE VERY FORCES THAT BROUGHT  ABOUT JANUARY 6th AND CONTINUE,  AND AS YOU WERE POINTING OUT,  REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS ARE NOW  TRYING TO TURN THESE CRIMINALS  WHO ATTACKED THE CAPITOL,  TERRORISTS WHO ATTACKED OUR  FORCES AND BLUDGEONED THEM AS  SOME SORT OF POLITICAL HEROES. THE LIES RESULT IN JANUARY 6th  CONTINUE TO BE PROPAGATED BY  McCARTHY AND MARJORY TAYLOR  GREEN AND ALL THESE PEOPLE. THIS IS REALLY QUITE URGENT BUT  WE'RE ALSO DETERMINED TO BE VERY THOROUGH, WHICH IS APPARENTLY  WHAT FRIGHTE

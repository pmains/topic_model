President Trump gave Turkish strongman president air Tawana greenlight to invade northern Syria or a week ago and then as reporting continued to bolster the case that his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani has been working on behalf of Turkish interests the president followed up that decision with an impossible to summarize set of wildly contradictory often racist pronouncements about the situation in northeastern Syria that as the u.s. was forced to evacuate its troops and bomb its own bases while Kurdish civilians were fleeing civilians were being killed and the Turks and Syria's President Assad basically carved up that strip of earth that was a reality when vice president Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in Turkey to meet with air Dewan emerge today with a deal quote unquote that gives Turkey everything they want president Trump said Turkey has been trying to get this deal for years and in a way he is right for years air Dewan has wanted to ethnically cleanse northeastern Syria of Kurds that's what he wanted and that was the ultimate point of this mission the deal struck today is that for five days Turkey will pause to allow the Kurds to leave the area thereby ethnically cleansing themselves so that Turkey can go and get the rest of that territory and in exchange the u.s. agreed to remove economic sanctions imposed earlier this week as well as the threat of further sanctions meaning the sum total of this is that turkey has gotten everything he wanted the Kurdish allies who lost 11,000 of their own people fighting side by side with American soldiers to defeat Isis have now been repaid with us approved removal from the land joining me now senator Tammy Duckworth an Iraq war veteran Purple Heart recipient was a member the Senate Armed Services Committee senator the the vice president the president might Pompey all saying this is a huge deal struck in Turkey today but the facts appear to essentially allow the Turks a kind of campaign of ethnically cleansing the area of Kurds and u.s. withdrawal of sanctions how do you see the deal how is this a huge deal to have essentially 120 hour pause on a situation created by the White House we are absolutely far worse off today than we were up roughly 10 days ago when they started this whole process so I'm not quite sure that they should be congratulated or they should be patting themselves on the back for getting a pause to a situation that they initiated themselves you obviously fought in Iraq and I know that a lot of US service members have been expressing their feelings about Kurdish folks that they had fought with or talked to obviously that Kurds in Iraq are different than those in Syria although they occupy a large part of that part of the world do you have reflections or feelings as you watch this unfold based on that experience the Kurdish fighters have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with American troops in this fight against Isis they've lost 11,000 of their fighters in order to help us defeat Isis they did everything we asked them to do to go after and get rid of Isis and then to take the remnants of Isis and put them into the into the prisoner camps that they were in and what have we done we've abandoned our allies and all that Trump has done with this move is allow us to basically put our allies in a position where they're being slaughtered by the Turks and now we're sending a message to the rest of the world don't work with the United States you can't trust us to stand by you there are concerns I've seen from certain quarters about the president's temperament behavior and actions in the last few weeks particularly there are always concerns about that but particularly last few weeks do you have particularly acute concerns over the last few weeks do you feel like his conduct is is appreciably different in the concerning way well he's managed to create much more damage than I ever thought that he would possibly be able to to commit does this situation Whitaker's and then with the president what concerns me is less the president than the people around him you know he's got general Milley he's got secretary Esper he's got military leaders around him who what they they don't have a say in this he's he he moved forward with this decision without talking to them and now there stepping up you saw that picture in that the president tweeted and then speaker Pelosi made her her cover photo you know those men are hanging their heads through the president's left and right because they know that he's wrong and that he has no strategy for defeating Isis he has no strategy strategy for Syria and it's taking speaker Pelosi to confront him on it and what are they doing nothing that's my concern is that the advisers around him and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are enabling this man to do the kind of damage that he's done to our national security there was a House vote yesterday with an overwhelming bipartisan majority to condemn the the president's policy in this area Chuck Schumer the Democratic leader in the Senate has called from Mitch McConnell to bring up the same piece of legislation resolution in the Senate would you like to see that as well I would love to see that I'd like to see that vote coming down because I think the message would be clear to the White House that there's bipartisan opposition to this decision the president has made the president also through his chief of staff today announced that the United States government will be hosting a global summit at the president's on personal property which is essentially awarding a contract to himself it will force the federal government to spend money that will go into the president's pocket it will force foreign governments to spend money to go in the president's foreign pocket do you think that's appropriate do you think that's lawful it's not at all Pro print and it's not at all lawful I'm actually part of the emoluments lawsuit that it has its basis in this very same thing that's happening with foreign governments booking stays in the Trump Hotel here in Washington DC and in various places are trying to curry favor with this president time and again this president has shown he's consistent on a couple of things one he's consistent when it comes to lining his own pockets in the his family's pockets with whatever he needs to do in order to further Trump properties and the other is that he Boyd this he sure loved his dictators less he has cozied up to North Korea and now to earlier on in Turkey all right senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois always good to talk to you thank you very much thanks having me on still

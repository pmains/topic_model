[Music] so there's potentially quite a bit of money at stake for folks if they're in the situation where their 2020 income was a lot less than their 2019 income so barack thank you so much for making some time uh first of all would you mind just introducing yourself uh to the people of georgia giving us a sense of who you are and what you do my name is rama morty i'm one of the deputy directors of the national economic council which is the team that helps the president formulate economic policy thank you so much for being willing to help inform folks about the american rescue plan the stimulus bill that we just passed you know folks have a lot of questions about the stimulus checks one of the most popular provisions of the bill and a lot of folks have already received payments some folks are still waiting for starters can you just give an overview of what are these stimulus checks and who's eligible for them 100 million plus households are going to receive these stimulus checks which are intended to help families help people who were struggling through the pandemic any american who makes up to 75 000 a year is eligible and any couple making up to 150 000 a year is eligible for the full 1400 per person check also every child in this country who lives with parents making those under those amounts is also eligible for a 1400 check so you have a situation where a typical family of four two parents two kids is eligible for fifty six hundred dollars in total checks and how do folks receive this money and how do they find out if they're going to get it for example by a check in the mail or a debit card or direct deposit to their bank account sure so i would encourage folks to go search get my payment and that will take you to an irs website once you go on that website you just put in some basic information about yourself and it will tell you have you has the check already been sent out to you what form is it going to come in i should note that generally speaking a lot of the payments are going to go out by a direct deposit and if you're going to get the check by a direct deposit you should have gotten it by now if you haven't gotten it by direct deposit yet and you're eligible you'll either get a check in the mail or you'll get a debit card in the mail so keep an eye out for that and how many of these have already gone out more than 100 million of these payments have already gone out that's the vast vast majority of them there's still several million left that have not been sent out and those should be going out shortly by a debit card or via an actual paper check if you go to the irs website i mentioned it will tell you if you are eligible if your payment has or has not been sent out yet and what form you can expect it to come in let's talk about folks who haven't yet received checks some social security beneficiaries and folks who are on social security disability insurance are still awaiting their payments what's the deal with that and when can they expect payment and how can they check up on the status of their payment the issue is that the irs has to do some additional validation for those payments before they go out they are working hard at that they expect to start sending those payments either in the form of direct deposits or checks or debit cards by april 7th for those who are eligible and if you go to get my payment on the irs website starting on april 4th you can actually track the status of your stimulus payment and these payments and eligibility for these payments are being calculated on the basis of the most recent tax return filed but for folks who lost their job last summer they may still be eligible because they lost income last year and are now within the income threshold how do those people who maybe haven't yet filed their 2020 taxes but will be eligible based on their 2020 income make sure that they receive their payments even if they weren't eligible based on their 2019 income right so these payments are going to be based on your most recently filed tax return so if you're a person who is in the situation that you described where your 2020 income was lower than your 2019 income i would encourage you to go and file your 2020 tax return as soon as possible because that will determine your eligibility for a check based on this most recent round of payments but also importantly you can go and top up your previous payments so in other words this is the third stimulus check that we've had over the last year and a half roughly speaking because the irs determines your eligibility for these stimulus checks based on your most recent tax return that means that even if you're excluded from the checks that went out last spring but you would be eligible based on your new tax return if you file your new tax return you will get that previous check as well so there's potentially quite a bit of money at stake for folks if they're in the situation where their 2020 income was a lot less than their 2019 income so let's say somebody made sufficient money in 2019 that they wouldn't be eligible for the stimulus check but their income was reduced because of job losses or other issues last year and so they are going to be eligible based on their 2020 income but they haven't yet filed their 2020 tax return when they file their 2020 tax return this year the irs is going to send them a stimulus check if they're eligible based on their 2020 income correct that is exactly right that's really helpful let's talk about children and dependents households are going to receive 1400 not just per adult but also per child let's say a family has a child this year so welcomes a newborn in october of 2021 will they be eligible to receive a dollar stimulus check if they fall in the right income bracket for that child yes they will so it is based on your your position in 2021 and as you said uh if you are eligible you also get the full 1400 check per child and if you have a child in the fall or in the winter of this year that will entitle you to an additional 1400 check and the way they would do that is when they file their 2021 taxes so in the spring let's say of 2022 and it says on that form that they had an additional child that is what will then trigger the additional payment so it'll come as part of your 2021 taxes next year got it so barad a question that we get a lot from constituents if folks owe back taxes to the federal government if they have debt to the irs will that be withheld from this third round of stimulus checks uh the short answer is no you'll get your full check okay that's great and everybody listening if for any reason you believe you've not received the check to which you're entitled please contact my office and we'll work with you to get to the bottom of it so this round of stimulus checks unlike the past adult dependents are also eligible can you just briefly explain what that means and who are adult dependents sure it's any adult dependent that you would claim on your tax filing so a couple typical examples of that a college student would qualify typically or if there is an adult with a disability that you care for and that you claim on your tax return they would qualify as well okay let's talk about two cases that we're hearing about folks who have some confusion either they've changed their address or their direct debit bank account information is no longer valid how do those folks make sure that they're receiving their payment so if you go to the irs and fill out a form if you've changed your address they will then send you a check to your new address and if you just search for address changes at the irs you will pull up the right website for that second obviously you should always make sure if you can to make sure that your mail is forwarded to your new address you can do that via the united states postal service website we're going to put that website up on screen right now for folks who need to notify the irs that their address has changed and again everybody if you have any questions about this just reach out to my office my staff is here to help so barack thank you so much for leading us through this has been very clarifying i'm sure it's been helpful for folks who are listening everybody we're going to do another one of these upcoming on the child tax credit eligibility for the child tax credit so that you know everything that you need to know about that when you file your taxes this year for your 2020 taxes but what's the bottom line on the child tax credit who's eligible and how will they receive it basically any single parent making up to 200 thousand dollars every couple making up to 400 000 is eligible and it is a three thousand dollar annual payment for any child between the age of six and seventeen and a thirty six hundred dollar annual payment for a child between the ages of zero and six and that's up from two thousand dollars from what it was previously so it is a significant boost in the benefits that we are sending out to parents with young children well rama murti thank you so so much for joining us thank you for your service to the country and your work in the white house thank you for taking some time out of your busy schedule to help inform georgians about the stimulus checks and reminding everybody to reach out to my office if you have any questions barack

I'm surprised I rise this afternoon to pay tribute to an American hero this man right here American hero and patriot who was taken away from us far too soon earlier last month I was standing on the flight line at the Dover Air Force Base alongside our Congress Mona Lisa Blunt Rochester alongside my colleague in the Senate Chris Coons alongside of Governor John Carney and we were there to join the members of three families who had come to receive the remains of their loved ones all Marines have been killed in action on April 8th a couple of weeks earlier when a roadside bomb went off in Afghanistan near Kabul as their convoy was passing through true service members killed were active duty corporal Robert a Hendricks of Long Island New York Staff Sergeant Benjamin s Hinds of York County Pennsylvania not too far from us in Delaware there is a third Marine Staff Sergeant Christal Edmund Christopher a reservist and a 15-year member of the New York City Fire Department and Delaware e'en 43 old the US Marine was also a loving husband to his wife Shannon and father of three girls McKenna age 10 Tenley age 8 Wessling age 4 in life and death Staff Sergeant slap many epitomized the best of this country the selflessly put his life on the line to protect and serve his country and his community we read in the New Testament these words and I'll paraphrase him no greater love hath a man than his willingness to lay down his life for a friend these three Marines lay down their lives for our country they also laid down their lives for a nation we are allied with the government the people of of Afghanistan it was Winston Churchill who once said these were he said Churchill used to say a lot of memorable things but one of the most memorable to me as a retired Navy captain is that a reservist is twice a citizen a reservist is twice a citizen by that measure Christmas Luckman was three times I sentences he wore two uniforms and service to our nation one of them was this uniform Fire Department 15 year decorated veteran of the New York City Fire Department and also that was staffs charge in the United States Marines serving in the 25th Marine Regiment 4th Marine Division and the Marine Force Reserve was based in Harrisburg Pennsylvania friends say that Christopher always dreamed his family calls him Chris Chris always dreamed of being a firefighter he grew up in Maryland graduated from Frederick Douglass High School where he played football basketball and wrestled and achieved an Eagle Scout status there's a father to Eagle Scouts that's quite an achievement eventually a volunteer to the fire departments in Maryland and in Washington DC most recently he spent his time between the Bronx and Wilmington Delaware his wife and three daughters live full-time I as my colleagues know I live in Delaware and I commute to work here by train almost every day three maybe four days a week and Christopher selectmen had a similar kind of commute his family was in Delaware and instead of coming this way he would go north to work as a fire fighter in New York City he took the train in the opposite direction to do his job but he so wanted to serve that he would travel from his home in Delaware to Ladder Company 27 in New York City almost every day in fact he was on military leave from Ladder Company 27 and near at the end of his most recent deployment with the marine reserves in Afghanistan when he and his two comrades lost their lives it was Chris lemons work in the Bronx where in 2014 he won the fire chiefs Association memorial medal for rescuing an unconscious woman from the 11th floor of a high-rise apartment building I heard a first kind of first-hand account of that rescue and it tells the story of a hero and why a woman who could easily have died and she didn't it was because of his actions Staff Sergeant slummin lived that kind of profound love he dedicated his life to serving others even at his own peril and it seems that this kind of selflessness and devotion to service was a hallmark of this sluttin household staff sergeants lemon is survived by three brothers one of his brothers is in the Marines another is in the art the army the third is a firefighter in Washington DC right here the father was an Army veteran and was also a volunteer firefighter as was Chris lemons mother what a family Marines army volunteer firefighters firefighters up in New York City and I'd like to say leadership is leaning by our example leaders we leave our example it's not do as we say but do as we do they provide an incredible example for all all of us last Friday I was honored to have been able to join Maher Governor John Carney staff sergeants altman's family friends and follow service members in New York City to pay our respects along with the mayor of New York City and many other dignitaries there to pay our respects to a man who gave his life for this country the first speaker at his funeral was Marine Sergeant Major Christopher Armstrong another Christopher who served alongside his friend Chris for eight years marine sergeant major Armstrong remembered Chris Lemmon with these words here's what Christopher Armstrong had to say he's had upon joining the unit I began observing the Marines who they watched how they looked at their leaders and what they said he went on to say there are a small number of men that when they spoke silence fell when they issued an order the response was immediate and when they were looked upon it was with reverence he went on to say Christa a minh immediately stood out as a leader who was both respected and admired he did not pound his chest he did not try to impress or go to go on about what he's going to do he just did it he just did it sergeant major Armstrong continued he said Chris slummin placed his Marines welfare before his own Chris never sought credit but he always gave it think about that that's a good lesson for all those even here Chris Lemmon never sought credit he always gave it to others fire department New York Commissioner Dan Nigro also spoke and he described the Chris lemon is quote the type of American we can all be proud of he continued Chris was a protector of those in danger a defender to those who needed him a rescuer to those who needed saving and a leader who demonstrated his valor on every tour of duty both here and abroad those are the words of the Commissioner of the New York City Fire Department mr. president I believe there's a point named Edgar guests I like to be a houseguest Edgar desk I think he spent his life most his life in Detroit Michigan he was oftentimes referred there to as a poet people's poet people's poet here's some of the words that he once said he used to say I'd rather see a sermon than hear one any day think about that I'd rather see a sermon than hear one any day and Chris lemon your life was better than any sermon Chris demonstrated the absolute bless best of our country every day with the terrorism and his service to others the way he lived his life the way he gave his life is the language that is clear to one and all so it is with heavy heart that I along with the entire first state that's the state of Delaware the people of this country who offer our sincere condolences to Chris's wife Shannon and there are three girls their dad is an American Hero in our congressional delegation and our governor promise you that he won't soon be forgotten and I know that his legacy lives on and his daughters and his wife Shimon a friend of mine once married to a Navy SEAL number of years ago they that marriage produced a daughter who's 18 years old and will graduate from high school later this month her died their dad died complications PTSD were served in Iraq and Afghanistan is recall later came down with ALS Lou Gehrig's disease and he succumbed to that about a year ago members of my staff in Delaware considered services staff have worked worked for months try to make sure that that 18 year old daughter would be eligible for the benefits of her Navy SEAL dad now deceased and we learned last month that she will be eligible and one of the things that our congressional delegation will work hard to do is to make sure that to the extent that Chris Leben was eligible for the GI Bill and I guess in said he is it was that those benefits were under the law if not used by the veteran by the soldier sailor Airman can be used by spouse now used by spouse can be used by a dependent child and their three a dependent children here three daughters that beautiful girls that any parent would be proud to claim as their own child or a grandchild or our niece and we're going to work hard to make sure that those judge the I bill benefits anyway to do this legally make sure that those benefits accrue to Chris and Shannon Shannon's two to three daughters and with that mr. president I yield four I want

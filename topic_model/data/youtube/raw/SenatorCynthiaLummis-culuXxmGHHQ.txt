very proud of you Senator Braun for bringing this forward and encouraging all of us to recognize the impacts this has on every American who works hard and saves for retirement and that's a lot of widows and I'm a widow and I get how scary it is to get to this point in your life and be alone to manage the rest of your life to have enough money to live the rest of your life it is investment malpractice pure and simple to depart from the fiduciary responsibility when you're investing other people's money so for the labor department of all people to thwart the ability of people who have labored all their lives to save enough money to retire on by forcing an agenda on them that they may not even agree with or know about is investment malpractice this ESG agenda when applied to investing is investment malpractice pure and simple so I'm very proud of Senator Braun and I urge others to support this bill this should be a massively favorable vote in favor of working people who saved for their retirement

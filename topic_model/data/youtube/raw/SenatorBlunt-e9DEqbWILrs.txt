it's great to celebrate the centennial of Negro Leagues baseball founded in Kansas City Missouri the Negro Leagues boasted some of the most iconic baseball players in history from Jackie Robinson to Buck O'Neil and satchel page in Kansas City and from cool Papa Bell to Willie the devil Wells and George mule subtles in st. Louis the league's players transcended the game of baseball and helped break down the barriers of segregation I've had the opportunity of business the Negro Leagues baseball museum many times and I always put it on my list of places to visit I'm so appreciative of the work Bob Kendrick and others have done to preserve the league's legacy happy hundredth anniversary it's great to tip this Kansas City Monarchs cap to Negro Leagues baseball history

when I first ran for congress in 2010 I spent a great deal of time driving across Southern Indiana in every County it seemed there were markers on the side of a road by a field in front of an old building one afternoon I spotted a marker in the town of Napoleon it was a little worse for wear but what it commemorated Barry's Trace was emblematic of Indiana's story and the doers and dreamers who wrote The Early pages of our state's history historical markers throughout Indiana till part of our state's unique story I believe it's critical to preserve and share our nation's history while never overlooking its painful passages as a small part of that effort my office launched marker Mondays in November of 2020. at the beginning of each week we've posted the back story of one of Indiana's historical markers on social media it was a small gesture a way of telling unique stories and raising awareness of our Hoosier heritage after more than two years and roughly a hundred markers highlighted were concluding the marker Monday series and we'll move on to other ways of raising awareness of Indiana's and America's history by shedding a greater light on our nation's past celebrating its highs remembering its lows we make greater progress towards our ongoing journey of a more perfect union

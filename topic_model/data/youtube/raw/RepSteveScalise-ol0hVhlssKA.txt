first let me express my prayers to all of those families who are grieving as they continue to try to recover bodies in the miami building that collapsed last week i have a family from my district in kenner louisiana that had reached out the mother whose daughter was in the building and actually was on the phone with her husband while the building was collapsing and these are heartbreaking stories these families are grieving so our prayers continue to be with them here this week we're dealing with a number of crises and yet on the floor we don't see legislation that speaker pelosi is bringing to address any of them as at least talked about the border crisis continues to get worse when vice president harris went to texas she didn't go to the border areas where the worst crossings are i went to mccallum texas with many of my colleagues she should have gone there she should have gone to donov detention facility but most importantly she should be working with our border patrol agents who all will tell you what they need to do to solve this crisis and frankly it's all things that president biden himself did to start creating this crisis at our border they can solve it today we call on them to do that there is a crime crisis in our country as well and interestingly over the last year democrats have embraced the defund police movement and it's had detrimental results it has had devastating results in so many cities across america where democrat mayors participated in this defund the police movement we've seen unfortunately police officers leaving the police force in record numbers and what is the answer from democrats to finally reject this radical idea of defunding the police no they're trying to blame republicans now for the dumpster fire that they created so we're going to continue to call them out on their extremist radical agenda that included defunding the police and it's time for democrats to admit that it was a failure when they embraced the defund police movement and start reversing it stop trying to blame other people actually own up to what you created that is causing out-of-control crime in our cities across america and finally on holding china accountable for more than a year now house republicans have been calling on speaker pelosi to hold a hearing on the origins of covet it's perplexing that speaker pelosi refuses to have any committee of jurisdiction hold a hearing on the origin of a virus that's killed over 600 000 americans and 4 million worldwide and so with the the mountains of evidence that continue to grow that show that it may have started in that lab in wuhan house republicans decided that we're going to have our own hearing and so today at noon we're having a hearing on the origins of covid we have many respected scientists and others who have done research extensively into the origins of covid and we're going to be having that hearing it's going to be uh noon over in hvc 215 we invite everybody to come and learn about what we at least have on the table and then ultimately to continue to press speaker pelosi to have hearings where we can have subpoena powers to bring in others who refused to come testify nobody should be trying to cover up for the chinese communist party least of which should be speaker pelosi the fact that the senate passed a bill unanimously that actually will show some of the data and declassify some of the information that's out there past unanimously in the senate speaker pelosi won't even take that up so house republicans are going to continue to press to get the answers to get to the bottom of how this virus started it's about time long past time that democrats join in

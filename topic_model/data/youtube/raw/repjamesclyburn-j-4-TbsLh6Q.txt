[Music] my mother was diagnosed with multiple myeloma back in January in 1971 when she was 54 years old and of course I did not understand the import of it when I said now the doctors after driving back down to touch Elson they told me that she had at most eight months to live my mom's had been the businesswoman all of her life and she had been saving for this house she always went this ranch-style house and she was insured orally she thought she was well about three months into her illness we found out that she used up all of her insurance and of course she was not getting any better and she was not going to get in the better we never fully disclosed the extent of her illness and so one night she put everybody out of the other foot room in and told me she wanted to talk to me and she said to me on that occasion tell me the truth and do I have any chance of getting better because if I don't have any chance of getting better I don't want you all using up all the model life savings trying to keep me alive well I I lied and said you do have a chance of getting better and don't worry about your savings well that's a turn job assurance was gone we did use of all of her savings and of course we knew that there was no no hope I thought about that throughout the entire time that we were discussing the Affordable Care Act and every time we had a chance to do something I would try to make sure they put stuff in that law that will protect those kinds of situations a child born with diabetes or not be denied insurance coverage especially when the parent has been paying for a family policy and doing so [Music] hoping to be able to cover the family when someone gets sick they'll not be worried about whether or not they can have the medical attention that they need and so I dubbed the Affordable Care Act and when I spoke about it on the floor of the house the Civil Rights Act of the 21st century because it outlawed discrimination against people who got sick discrimination against children both the diabetes discrimination against men that prostate cancer and women with breast cancer is discriminated against women just because they're women so these things to me were very very important and they remain important and I find that a bit disingenuous for my friends across the aisle to be denigrating our ability to protect people with pre-existing conditions because in reality every one of us did one day be subject to a pre-existing condition [Music] you

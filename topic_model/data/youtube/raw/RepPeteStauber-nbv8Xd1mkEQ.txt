i'm pete sauber for Minnesota AIDS and I think the state of Minnesota eighth District that puts 66% of the iron ore that makes it steel in this country should be considered a national security district we have iron ore copper nickel gold platinum palladium zinc titanium and we're just opening the first copper nickel mine in the state of Minnesota we talked about cheating those 232 tariffs gave families life on the Iron Range Minnesota and if you don't think it mattered people coming up tears in their eyes we're finally working taconite timber tourism transportation and shipping the economic drivers in our district the Iron Range normos or the matter when we have those Lakers leaving the port of Duluth for southern ports to make the steel to melt those technical stone that is economy that is men and women their jobs good-paying jobs and I will say this that to the to the senior members on this party I am so proud to be here with you the information you're sharing we are going to bring it back and we can work to make America steel the number one product for this country what I have to when I was on the campaign trail I made sure we told people mining is our past our present and our future northern Minnesota if we don't have mining in northern Minnesota we don't have any economy and we have those minerals right there we have the biggest iron ore mine in northern Minnesota 66 percent of our steel data comes out of those mines I've been to every one you talk about making infrastructure packages out of America steel I want to share two things with you I come out of st. Louis County Minnesota as a county commissioner we put in place every piece of steel that is used every single project is made from American steel the only thing that's not made is the motor grader blades come out of Canada because we can't find an American manufacturer every bolt every nut that puts a street sign up highway sign is made of American steel and I want to bring that to Congress that's what I promised Minnesota that's why I've got a bill for we can talk about immigration and we have different points pro or con but I want to share with you in the caucus the American workers for Security Act means that when that southern border is club every piece debating about whether it's either or not when it goes up it's made in America hands american-made America mr. Gerard from with that perspective what does that type of legislation do for the steel workers and let me congratulate you for doing that there was you would well know there was made in Minnesota bad mining and steel workers Union took up the challenge and we were created committees all over the state and we said mining matters you may have seen some of the ads some of the work that we did I come from a mining industry my dad was a miner my brother was a miner my uncle was a miner you can't make anything in the world less you mind it if you want to have wind turbines you need copper copper doesn't grow on trees you got to go dig it up you want to have batteries you've got to have nickel cadmium doesn't grow on trees you go dig it up so as far as we're concerned our ujin is a mining Union we believe in mining we believe that mining is tight-ass steelmaking can't have infrastructure with steel if you don't have mining for iron ore you don't have nickel for batteries and all that stuff they want to use everybody's time but I'm with you man

thank you very much chairman thank you to both of you for your tremendous public service there is of course no way to unwind our policy towards Russia with our policy towards Ukraine and we're gonna have plenty of opportunities in the house in the Senate to litigate what our policy has been in the past towards Ukraine but I thought it might be appropriate to level set and just clarify what our policy is currently towards Ukraine and so ambassador Hale just a few quick questions is it currently our policy with respect to Ukraine to request investigations into a entity called CrowdStrike no is it currently our policy towards Ukraine to request investigations into the connection between the former vice president's family and a company called Purisima not that I'm aware of is Rudy Giuliani involved today in any diplomatic conversations with Ukraine not that I'm aware of sir okay I think it's important to acknowledge those facts because part of the defense of the president's actions will be that those requests were in fact appropriate and I think it's relevant that since the uncovering of those demands have been made they are no longer part of official US policy query whether or not if those actions were appropriate they would have been dropped after these investigations began I'm on another topic one of the sort of ways to talk about our competition with Russia is through a prism of what is called asymmetric warfare they have capabilities that we don't have and it's always struck me that that is a choice it's not an inevitability there are some things they're willing to do that we just aren't willing to do from a from a moral standpoint from a standpoint of conscience but there are also capabilities that they have that we choose not to utilize in particular the way in which they use their energy resources to bully nations around them and to win friends and influence adversaries we have chosen not to use our energy resources in the same way but there are appropriate means by which we could provide more direct assistance to countries in and around Russia's periphery to make them energy independent a bunch of us senator Johnson senator Rubio myself and others have a piece of legislation that would set up a billion dollar financing capacity in the federal government to help actually finance energy independence projects in and around the Russia periphery it strikes me as a way to sort of close this gap that exists without asking our private sector energy companies to throw their weight around in a way that's completely integrated with us security interests do you agree that there are ways in which we could increase the support that we give countries around Russia to try to end this asymmetry that exists today in the way that they leverage their energy resources and we leverage ours yes I agree very much with the thrust of your comments and it's also I mean part of that is making sure that our allies have alternate sources of energy and that's been a major thrust of our strategy on Nord Stream 2 it's because we don't want Germany and others in Europe to be even more dependent on Russian energy sources I myself have had multiple conversations in my travels in Ukraine and Belarus and Eastern Europe on this very theme the private sector of course would have to be hopefully a very prominent partner in that enterprise if I might do that I think the undersecretary is quite right and you're quite right about the importance of manipulated energy relationships and Russia's strategic policy and one of the things that we are also doing to try to meet this challenge is through not just promote promoting any particular type of energy alternative but also focusing upon civil nuclear cooperation we are working very hard for example in my corner of the State Department to promote improved relationships with partners and friends around the world in order to help provide them with alternatives in the form of carbon free nuclear energy from you suppliers which serves our non-proliferation interests it serves our strategic interests and in promoting those kinds of things and trying to find alternatives to Russian relationships and Chinese relationships which often come with very elaborate and too good to be true you know debt bondage sort of financing terms at least and I'm not familiar with your particular bill but in principle on being able to offer more financing alternatives to our partners and the civil nuclear business would be would be very helpful my continued hope is that we get that bill before this committee as soon as possible I think it enjoys support of the administration and on both sides of of this committee my time is up all in there thanks mr. chairman thank you

bringing north dakota senator kevin kramer a republican on the budget committee and i'm just i got to imagine senator that you hear from your constituents a lot we'll just put them up on the border for everyone to see they see it when they go the grocery store the cost of meat milk eggs everything is up sir well it certainly is dana thank you for the opportunity right now i'm in the snowpocalypse here in bismarck and the price of fuel is being recognized by the people blowing their driveways out uh on day two of a three-day storm but there's no question in rural america you're hit the hardest by particularly fuel inflation because you drive further to get to places um deliveries you know come from a long ways away the products we create that we produce our food goes further has to go further away from the center of the north american continent to around the world so no we we get hit harder than most places on the other hand we are a commodity-based economy so when the price of groceries is up that means the price of cattle and wheat is also up when the price of fuels up the price of oil is up so so there's parts of our economy that that benefit as well but none of this is good for for all of us or really any of us yeah uh and we feel it in north dakota as we do i mean everywhere hard to get it under control as you know based on history did you see senator manchin's statement from yesterday it was pretty strong uh a little bit to our audience if you don't mind here it's a disservice he writes the american people to act as if inflation is a new phenomenon the federal reserve administration failed to act fast enough in today's data is a snapshot in time of the consequences being felt across the country instead of acting boldly our elected leaders and the federal reserve continue to respond with half measures and rhetorical failures searching for where to lay the blame is is manchin still a democrat well every now and then he reminds us that he's a democrat for example when he wants voting regulations but but joe's right on this point you know i'm beside the budget committee i'm also on the banking committee and we were pleading i was pleading with with the federal reserve over a year ago to to you know start easing back a little bit on on free money you know inflation is a simple issue when demand outpaces supply you're going to have inflation and the federal reserve was very slow they when it was obvious that there was inflation happening they called it transitory now they still talk about the hope for soft landings and every now and then when you have a really bad cancer you need to cut it out you can't just simply hope it goes away over the course of time and so you have that on top of that of course you you have an administration and a democratic party that just keeps pouring fuel on this it's like joe biden showed up at the west wing one day and said kamala that the oval office is on fire get some gasoline quickly we'll try to put it out everything they do is counter to solving the problem in front of us one of the people that actually and he's not alone larry summers uh the democrat and other there are other democrats who are trying to sound the alarm and trying to tell the administration that you have to do better larry summers says this to the washington post we have a serious inflation problem in the u.s the problem didn't get made in a week or month and it's not going to be resolved quickly or without pain you know we live in a society now where there's a lot of things that you can get like on amazon prime right two-day delivery here it comes but on this one in inflation are it feels like the administration is basically saying it's putin's fault and there's really nothing else we can do about it our consumer is just in for a lot of pain for a long time as this gets worked out well i don't know how long necessarily dana but if we'd act faster and more boldly it wouldn't have to be all all that long i do think expectations need to be managed properly but you can't continue to to you know put the clamps on energy production in the united states where we were once energy dominant and at least energy independent and now we're becoming energy dependent when when they started those actions flooding the the this supply side with free money with the american rescue plan shutting down energy development in our own country and now this story i heard just a little bit ago on your show about california trying to go to a 32 hour work week that's exactly the opposite of what you need to do you need to boost the supply side of the economy not boost the demand side and shrink the supply side of the economy and that's what we see over and over how about this this latest desire to forgive every student's debt forever i mean just more fuel on this fire of inflation so we need to take some tough positions i think republicans and democrats like like joe manchin are willing to talk about it but we do have to talk about it in realistic terms rather than just blame somebody else blame the big oil companies blame putin blame you know the previous president or whatever the case might be we need to admit we have a challenge and take it on thank you senator we'll see when that happens right good to see you apocalypse thank you a late storm moving through there

uh thank you mr chairman uh let before i start with it i wanted for the the committee to recognize that uh that uh chairman tomko and i are gonna be in west virginia in the district uh next week uh this is an effort for bipartisanship to show how we can work together and understand that we're going to wind up going back to new york to continue this uh message we did this with peter welch and now we're with paul congratula i really i think we all want to take a message from that uh but paul before i go i look forward to it my friend oh we need i think congress needs to set an example though not only on bipartisanship but but on this on this other matter we all want we all wanted our schools and our businesses to open uh uh and and and and doing the covet uh so and if the senate and the house and and some other house committees are having these hybrid in-person meetings we're congregating paul as you know on the floor there who is directing you not to allow our committee to have in-person meetings it seems to be guided by the messaging coming from the physician the house physician so william so the other committees are violating it i just know what our subcommittee is doing in our committees i think i think people are hiding from having these meetings so look back on the subject matter though paul uh everyone wants to clean up these superfund sites they're a blight on america unfortunately as you pointed out there are over 300 designated super sites across the country under president obama he cleaned up 82 sites in eight years that only averages at 10 a year so do the math under that scenario it would take us 130 years to remove these blights all across the county and during that 130 years as you know paul other sites will be added to the list so it's a never-ending this is it's never gonna stop america deserves better mr chairman so what was the problem under obama his focus has been set entirely uh on climate and that superfund sites were neglected and and they weren't pursued in an aggressive fashion but how does that differ from what trump did trump cleaned up the site at twice the rate annual rate 20 per year he made cleaning up our sites a priority as compared to under obama his his task force developed an emphasis list that they were following a plan one that wasn't politically driven as a result sites like west lake landfill up in missouri miami alkali company in new jersey tar creek in oklahoma madison creek and missouri they were all taken care of they've been on the list but under obama they couldn't get them taken care of trump did he did what he said he was going to do so they're all done he also put together a lean management system that made the superfund process more efficient and cleanups happen even faster he did he also did it with community outreach programs that and all across america that we got responses back from elected officials who appreciated this attention to their problem sites as former chairman walton said uh mentioned in the previous hearing in a thank you note an elected official from portland oregon hardly a republican bastion wrote that they have been waiting for years for the epa to clean up the wilmette river in the portland harbor but trump made it happen he focused on it it wasn't climate change he said i'm going to clean up these sites mr chairman and according to a political article last year a prominent superfund activist said even though she couldn't stand trump she said he actually was getting something done he was doing what he said he was going to do she went on to say quote obama was terrible on these issues and gene mccarthy only cared about the climate uh so she she went on to say that until the trump administration until the trump administration the last time she said that that much work had been done on superfund sites was never never happened before so mr chairman this legislation doesn't seem to be supporting building atop the trump successes but rather it's going to slow things down and and it's tied to the clean future act the super bowl program will be mired again down in climate change debate and buried under reams of new bureaucratic requirements and and obviously if history's repeats itself be relegated once again to the back burner like it was under above the obama biden administration so in so doing we can only expect the cleanup process to slow down again and with less less empathy to rural communities saddled with these horrors of super sons fun sites in their backyard so mr chairman don't tell me that congress is going to clean up these sites show me show me i can't go back thank you the gentleman yields back and i'll remind

mr speaker i rise in opposition to an amendment in block number four and the underlying bill i have a long list of concerns with this bill and at the top of that list is nationwide ballot harvesting democrats in california already legalized ballot harvesting in our state despite our concerns with a practice republicans were determined to play by the rules utilize legal ballot collection methods in the last election one amendment in this package offered by my california colleague puts this hypocrisy on full display under current law with my colleague's amendment a foreign operative maybe a russian operative maybe a chinese spy could still handle ballots for untold numbers of people my colleague's amendment is a blatant attempt to criticize ballot harvesting only when the other guys do it in other words california democrats think it's fine when their paid opportunities collect ballots from strangers and throw them in a bag but they object when churches try to collect them for members of their congregation and put them in a box don't be fooled democrats don't want to facilitate ballot collection for all americans they just want you to make it they just want to make it easier for their operatives to harvest ballots and will cry foul whenever republicans try to play by the same rules i yield back

almost 600 000 americans have died from the coronavirus and lawmakers want answers about the origins of this pandemic and joining me now to talk about this is democratic representative tom malinowski of new jersey he's on the foreign affairs and homeland security committees congressman thanks so much for joining me your colleague and the top republican on the foreign affairs committee congressman mike mccall uh told my colleague jake tapper this weekend this let's listen i do think it's more likely than not it emerged out of the lab most likely accidentally for several reasons this is the worst cover-up in human history that we've seen resulting in 3.5 million deaths creating economic devastation around the globe what do you think congressman do you agree with that and is the bight administration taking this seriously enough do you think i i think they are look we've we've been briefed by the intelligence community and right now to be honest there are two highly plausible explanations uh either it was uh transferred from animals in a in a market or there was an accidental lab leak our intelligence community doesn't have a conclusion they don't know for sure and we may never know but whether it was a lab leak or not we do know that the chinese government was covering this up because they have blocked the world health organization and and every other independent body from going in and investigating this uh i think that the biden administration is doing the right thing by expediting a review of the intelligence because we do have to try our best to figure this out if we're going to pred prevent future pandemics and you want to put some pressure on china you recently co-sponsored a bill that would ban the federal government from contracting with businesses sponsoring the 2022 beijing winter olympics your co-sponsor mike walls congressman mike wallace cites the quote cover-up of the covet 19 pandemic as one reason for the ban how does this bill go beyond the work of the intelligence community and trying to uncover what happened well i think these are these are two separate things and and and just another word on the the covet issue i i want to hold china accountable because there's no question whatever the origins there there was a cover-up um but what china is hiding again are the origins of kovid not the fact of kovit which was known to us from a very very early point last year i mean it wasn't china after all that called this a hoax or that said that you know we should take hydroxychloroquine or that it would go away by the summer so we need to know the facts to prevent future pandemics but we shouldn't use this investigation as a way of absolving ourselves of responsibility for what happened in our country and on the olympics look i just don't think it's appropriate to hold the olympics in a country that's committing a genocide that's you know this is in some ways worse than 1936 in that respect and what our bill does it doesn't force the athletes to boycott i don't want them to lose this experience but it would put pressure on the us corporate sponsors of the game by saying that they can't contract with the us government if they sponsor these games and former fda commissioner scott gottlieb said on cbs on sunday quote leaks lab leaks happen all the time and often the chinese government is so opaque uh it is up to journalists to find out the truth what mechanisms should the international community put in place so we don't see another pandemic on the scale this is why we need to have the answers as best we can as to how this happened in in the first place if if it was animal to human transmission that suggests a certain strategy going forward to prevent the next one if it was a lab leak it suggests a different strategy so uh you know i i do think we have to put as much pressure as possible on china to to cooperate with an international investigation i think there should be consequences if uh if they don't uh regardless we we need to to uh do more to ensure that the critical supply chains for dealing with infectious disease pandemic pandemics are within the united states that we're not dependent on china or any other country that in and of itself would be punitive all right congressman malinowski uh thanks so much for joining us great talking to you we appreciate it on this memorial day weekend and on this memorial

and Congressman Brad Schneider from Illinois 10th district joins me tonight from the Capitol congressman thanks for joining me and I just want to start by saying why now there's been a Monuments issues there's been obstruction issues and now we have the Ukraine issue but this is what it took to get you to come out to support impeachment proceedings why now well first of all thank you and it's good to be with you today in August I actually came out calling for impeachment inquiry based on the reports from the Moller report based on the president's actions refusing to provide information to the committee's in their investing investigations but at this point this week we see it entirely different set of circumstances that rise to a entirely new standard what we have in the facts are clear here we have the president united states and his personal attorney publicly stating that they put pressure on the president of Ukraine to initiate a sham investigation of the president one of the president's political opponents this is an abuse of presidential power it is it is clearly reaches a threshold a standard of considering impeachment and the fact that the president is putting his own personal interests before those in the United States compromising our national security and our foreign policy objectives all to try to get dirt on one of his political opponents this raises a new standard and this is why I'm calling for moving towards article of impeachment at this at this time so to date while Democrats the number of Democrats is growing it's still not hitting the number needed to actually vote for impeachment is this what it will take do you think have we hit that watershed moment well I think what you're seeing is more and more of my colleagues on the Democratic side looking at the PACs again this is the president and his personal attorney publicly stating that they're putting pressure on the president of Ukraine abusing the power of his office for his own personal gain I think you're seeing more people saying this crosses the line this raises to extent a new standard of impeachment that we need to give consideration to so my expectation is that we're we're having a meeting this afternoon to talk about the issue within the Democratic caucus we will be talking about what actions and what steps we take moving forward but I think you're going to see a new level of concern from all of my colleagues on this issue I'm sort of curious if Nancy Pelosi looks to you and says congressman Schneider what should we do and hear your options we go for the kitchen sink and we hit him with everything we've been talking about for three years now emoluments obstruction and this or we just focus in on this one item what would you suggest so what I'm saying today is that what we saw this week with the president publicly stating that he put pressure on the president Ukraine we need to focus on this and in the process of developing the articles of impeachment we'll have a broad analysis will continue the investigations and decide what goes into the ultimate articles of impeachment but in my mind this one incident the president abusing the power of his office for personal gain and putting his interests before the countries interest that raises to a level standard all by itself you know as you know the Republican Senate is not going to remove President Trump from office it's just not going to happen unless you want to differ with me on that but that being said is this a political risk for some of your colleagues who come from perhaps red districts and turned them blue this time around maybe that's what Nancy Pelosi has been real concerned about sure I mean there has been that that common theme presented especially in the media I think what you're seeing for my colleagues is this is not about politics this is about each of us taking an oath to the Constitution understanding that in that oath to defend our Constitution against enemies foreign and domestic all of us including the president have certain expectations certain standards by which we need to live by and in this case in particular with the president putting his interests before the interests of the country putting undue pressure on an ally threatening that all I withholding military aid at a time when they're being challenged by Russia on their eastern border this is something that none of us can stand and we have a responsibility to our oath to our Constitution to future generations and if we're not going to take action at this then it will make it that much harder in the future to take action against any president who violates the Constitution or commits high crimes or misdemeanors assuming Democrats move forward can you give me just a brief explanation of what the process will be moving forward so I think that's going to be a part of the conversation this afternoon when the caucus meets there's discussion whether it goes through the standing committees or special committees set up that's something that we'll resolve in the in the days ahead I think what most of my colleagues are coming together and saying at this point is we need to step forward take action in the in the near term what the president has done raises to a new level of violation of his oath to office puts our nation at risk puts our allegiance --is and allies throughout europe at risk and we can't let this stand so we need to make sure that we're moving forward in a in a straightforward straightforward way so do you have concerns about what this will mean for the nation mark it down a little bit if this proceeds market could take more of a hit and secondly just as all of this proceeds there's nobody who directs the national conversation like President Trump so he will have people in the country talking about Joe Biden's problems and this is all about Biden and this is a which on are Democrats prepared for that battle look the president has a long history of dealing with conspiracy theories that's his modus operandi the facts are clear here the president and his personal attorney have said publicly and continue to repeat the fact that he put pressure on the president of Ukraine to initiate a sham investigation of Joe Biden those are the facts this is what we need to focus on and we need to make sure that all of us in Congress and in the elected office are protecting our Constitution that the president is not just protecting our Constitution but the most important responsibility is protecting the nation our national security and that no president not this one or any president in the future ever puts their own personal gain or political interests ahead of those of the nation as a whole you know one of the pieces was that he was holding the money to Ukraine absent this this investigation of Biden now the president has come out and just said no no I was withholding money because I wanted other nations to pay again he's great at the spin you're ready for it I get that the president is good at his spin but I'm going to keep coming to the simple fact the president leaned into and put pressure on the leader of an ally country asking that leader to conduct a sham investigation of the president's political rival this is not acceptable under any circumstances and we need to make sure that we hold this president to account and if the process goes forward the president will have his day in court he'll make his presentation in the Senate but the facts as we have them today is that President Trump and his personal attorney have said publicly clearly that they that President Trump put pressure on the president of Ukraine Paris Madrid Schneider villa noise tenth District wishing you and your family a very happy new year

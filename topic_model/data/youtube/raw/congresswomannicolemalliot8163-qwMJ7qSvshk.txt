structure committee congresswoman welcome when i spoke to you on this program about a month ago you said that uh our president needed to show more strength with regard to uh supporting ukraine do you think that he has done that in the months since we last talked well congress has certainly been taking the lead here and pushing for so much more support whether it be monetary support or military support to ukraine and certainly uh we've we've been able to accomplish many things you're seeing more u s sanctions placed on whether it's putin's family members or other companies that are doing business we've officially uh removed uh the russian banking system uh and also we suspended trade and that was a major major thing that congress had passed but what you should be seeing right now from the president of the united states is what you saw from the british prime minister what you saw from the uh austrian chancellor where they were in ukraine meeting with president zielinski that is true leadership and that is leading from the front instead unfortunately while they were there meeting with president zielinski in person our president was in delaware once again hiding in the basement the us has sent more than three billion dollars worth of of aid to the ukrainians what else should we be doing in your view well we're certainly seeing some progress here with our nato allies a tremendous amount of support whether it be weapons or defense systems anti-tank systems that are making its way to ukraine which is why you're seeing how russia has now sort of took a step back here now moving east away from kiev because of the strength that we've been able to provide the ukrainians and because of their passion in fighting for their country we're seeing today also that slovakia which is a very small nation so this is a very brave move for them to provide the s 300 missile defense system and they probably have the biggest thing at stake right now because they are such a small country to the west of ukraine and they are a nato ally and so we certainly want to make sure that this is stopped in ukraine and that doesn't spill over into nato territory so the united states will be backfilling slovakia defense system so they can also protect themselves general wesley clark is the former uh nato top commander he wrote this as part of an op-ed in the new york post he writes ukraine needs heavy weapons and air support tanks multiple rocket launch multiple launch rockets i should say and self-propelled artillery air support migs and sukhoi aircraft and mobile air defense they need hundreds of thousands of 152 millimeter artillery rounds the u.s supplied javelins and stingers are necessary but no longer sufficient he goes on why because there is a window of opportunity now for a week or two perhaps in which ukraine can counter attack in the north south and east to expel russian forces this will require mobile armored forces and air power and if this window is lost the future is darker and more uncertain again that from general wesley clark a guy who knows a thing or two about military operations um are they reading that at the white house well you know we've been advocating many of us in a bipartisan fashion particularly on the foreign affairs committee for the migs to be provided to ukraine in that the united states transfer our jets to whichever country has those migs and is willing to do it and poland had offered but the president had declined this offer for some reason the s 300s i think is also a very important thing and now that slovakia is providing them with that that will be very helpful but i do agree that there is a window of opportunity here you're seeing weakness in the russian army they've lost approximately about 15 000 soldiers it's estimated by nato that's about forty thousand uh soldiers that have been uh either uh killed or wounded and so that is a tremendous victory for the ukrainian people who in their defense because remember they were out mans they were out uh weaponed they were out tanked uh and and because of the support that they're receiving from nato they've been able to put up this fight you know most people thought they wouldn't last a week and here we are uh well into a month of this and you're seeing ukraine but they need support and we also need to send a clear message that anybody will be brought up anybody who helps kill civilians will be brought up on war crimes everyone from planning to those who are carrying these missiles to those who are launching these missiles and that is something we haven't heard from the president of the united states that we should unfortunately it appears vladimir putin doesn't really seem to care how many of his soldiers he loses during this horrible war quickly on inflation you're on the transportation and infrastructure committee what is the most important thing that you think president biden should do to try to bring down the rate of inflation we're seeing now i think the the president has to stop any spending that doesn't have to do with either infrastructure defense or security of this nation they are continuously looking to spend more money on the backs of hard-working american taxpayers if you look at our open borders policy right now millions of people that are crossing into our country that the american taxpayers paying for attorneys for housing for health care and all sorts of additional spending flights to go to various cities uh that is completely unfair to the hardware taxpayer during this economic pressure uh you're also seeing the president what he really should be doing is also ramping up energy production because energy costs hurt everything else right and not just it fuels uh right now we have supply chain issues but when you look at the food prices when you look at gas prices when you look at heating costs these are things that are all driven by energy and we've been pushing for some time for him to repeal his executive orders that have increased the cost of energy prices for american families that are struggling to get by or just put gas in their car to get to work or put food on the table so those are the things i think the president needs to focus on and we need to slow down uh spending the budget that he has introduced for next year is very problematic many many built tens of trillions of dollars in new taxes over the next decade and about 65 increase in spending over the next decade completely unsustainable also likely that those millions of illegal immigrants are going to be competing for jobs and pushing down wages especially at the lowest end of the economic spectrum congresswoman nicole maliatakis republican of new york thanks for coming on be sure to stay

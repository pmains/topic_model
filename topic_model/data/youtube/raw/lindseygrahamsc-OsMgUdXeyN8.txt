Senator Lindsey Graham joins me now he's been pressing the White House to make the names of the survivors known and let the survivors speak freely senator Graham welcome back it's good to have you on again I want to begin with awesome moment well thank you senator and I appreciate your tenacity and this you've been one of the voices that has been just absolutely unrelenting in demanding of the White House a release of information you and two of your colleagues have written a letter to the White House asking for the release of information and the names what a response have you received from them nothing bottom line is I think the survivors and those involved need to be made available to the Congress so we can get to the bottom where it happened and there's no better evidence than the people are there mr. Hicks is going to testify Wednesday I've been talking to him about for about two months people are scared to come forward and the president needs to make sure that those who come forward are going to do so without having the fear of losing their job or being any reprisals this administration has been trying to hide the story of Benghazi and finally it's going to come out thanks to Fox News and a few other outlets what did mr. Hicks say to you I mean can you give us some indication of what we might anticipate hearing this week I think the whole construct of how bad it was before how many times they asked for help and nobody would listen you're going to be surprised hear what he says about the interaction between him and Washington he's the number two guy he was Chris Stevens deputy he was on the phone with Chris right before he died he's going to give you a chilling story of what it was like and how much how little help he received and he's going to tell you about how he felt when he heard Susan Rice write this off to a spontaneous riot caused by hateful video everybody there knows that that was a complete political smokescreen this is not the fog of war she was not confused by the fog of war this White House seven weeks before an election tried to continue the narrative that bin Laden's dead al Qaeda's receding in terms of influence and power and Benghazi destroyed that narrative in that storyline and that's this has been all about for a very long time so that you heard the president this week at the press conference say to our at henry you know i am not aware of any attempt to quiet these people and not let them tell were you as shocked as I was when you heard it and you've been right in the middle of this from day one trying to get the White House to answer questions react to me when you saw the president dumbfounded the witness statements of the survivors taken in Ron mine Germany two days after the attack are still being held by the FBI and I've asked for him a hundred times we've sent probably 30 questions to the president the only question he finally answered after we made him answer is what did you do did you call anybody in libya during the attack and we found the president never picked up the phone he never called anybody in libya to get help the rescue team was stuck at the Benghazi Airport three and a half hours come Wednesday you're going to start hearing the truth about Benghazi and it's going to make you mad it's going to make you upset our people were abandoned they were denied assistance this leading from behind is a wrong model the world is falling apart and what you were told by by this administration after the fact was a complete political smokescreen just stay tuned there's more to come senator how far will you push this how far will you go to make sure that we get answers and not just answers but someone is held accountable and responsible as high up as is necessary to really vindicate these four Dead Americans I think the point is well made right there until somebody's held accountable for the fact that four people were allowed to die seven and a half hours they were under attack nobody could come to their aid on 911 of all days our consulate became a death trap every request for info for assistance was denied this leading from behind model does not work and what we were told afterwards was quite frankly just a political story not not based on the events on the ground how far will I go I will go to the point that i can look mr. woods in the eye and other family members and tell them exactly what happened in Benghazi until somebody's held accountable quite frankly Secretary Clinton said she had a clear-eyed view of what's going on in Benghazi in Libya she never heard of the request from our ambassador on August fifteenth about a month before the attack saying we can't defend the consulate against a coordinated attack and al-qaeda flags are flying all over the place you know richard nixon was held accountable for watergate this administration needs to be held accountable for benghazi and stored of americans abandoned by their government at a time when you get their garment the most senator I appreciate your being here and again I would say thank you for being a voice of persistence when so many people have just moved on to other things and I thank you that you've decided we can't move on until we have the truth until somebody's held accountable it's an honor and pleasure to have you here thanks for joining us

good evening my name is erin mintzberg and i'm the district director for congresswoman lizzie fletcher thank you so much for joining us tonight on a webinar on changes to the national flood insurance program many of you submitted questions ahead of time tonight and we're going to try to get to as many as we can if you are not able to submit a question or you have another one that pops up this evening you can click on the q a icon at the bottom and type in your question please include your email address because we will be following up with everyone when we conclude uh later this week um again thank you so much for joining it us and i will hand it over to congresswoman fletcher well thank you so much aaron for getting us started and thank you to everyone who's joining us tonight um i am glad to be here with all of you i know we had a very large probably record turnout for a zoom event that we've done and it really isn't a surprise uh because this topic is so important as are the folks that we've assembled tonight so i'm really grateful to be here of course with councilmember abby kamen who is just a fantastic advocate for uh her constituents our community um couldn't be a better partner as well as chief recovery officer steve costello who i have been talking to since uh before i assumed this office talking about how we can work on blood mitigation and recovery in houston and he's just uh such a such a leader um and so thoughtful and really helping our community um respond to the challenges that we have so thanks to both of you for being such collaborative partners and vocal advocates on these issues for our constituents um and i also want to thank gilbert giron regional flood insurance liaison from fema who's joining us tonight and who will give a presentation very shortly i'm going to just do a few uh opening comments here uh and then turn it over to councilmember cayman um and then we will turn it over to mr giron and then steve costello will wrap up then we will uh turn to your questions and and so uh in order to get to those um i'll move very quickly but i think it's important to um to remind us all why we're gathered and uh how excited i am really to kick off this program to talk about the changes to the national flood insurance program that are taking effect right now for new customers and in april of next year for existing policyholders who have flood insurance through the nfip it's an especially important issue in congressional district 7 as well as in houston city council district c where we have experienced repeated and devastating floods and of course our community has been so resilient in the face of these storms so supportive of one another as we work to recover from our 500-year floods that we all know by name harvey tax day memorial day but also the storm since you know we know that sometimes these rainstorms that we've had will cause localized flooding um things that don't make the news or stay in the news as long but cause tremendous damage for people and communities across our region and so it's really important for us to know and do all we can to prepare and of course we've been going through this uh rebuilding process um for several years and um and i know that we've made some good progress i know that there's still a lot of work to be done that's something that we are all working on together both on big projects and small projects working together with harris county flood control district working with the army corps of engineers making sure that we're doing everything we can to really understand and respond to these problems um but i also know that um these traumatic events are still very much present for many people who live in our community and i remember my very first town hall people coming up and talking to me in particular about what we could do to get past the trauma that's been caused by the flooding and the fear that they still have every time that we get a heavy rain so before i even got here i said earlier i i started talking uh to steve costello and folks in our community about what we could do and i think it's so important for all of us to work together um and to make sure that the city county and federal leaders on both sides of the aisle are working to secure aid and resources to recover uh to prepare for the next storm with smart policies um we know that that can make a huge difference and so um i am i'm so glad uh to be here with uh with these incredible leaders and um and i think you've heard from all of us at different times um and you know personally probably by being on this call that in houston and harris county the flood insurance really is just critical to secure our homes and our families from disasters and to protect our financial security so today what we wanted to do is provide a space where we can take your questions about fema's new flood insurance methodology and get those questions answered we know it can be hard to navigate we are navigating it ourselves and we know that you want to keep your families your loved ones your neighbors safe and prepared in any kind of rain event or storm as possible so we want to talk briefly about how best we can do that and as i said earlier this month fema implemented its risk rating 2.0 methodology using industry best practices and cutting-edge technology to get a better understanding of a property's unique flood risk and how that risk can be reflected in the cost of your insurance national flood insurance program policyholders who signed up for new policies on or after october 1st of this year will have their rates calculated under this new methodology and in april of next year as i mentioned earlier all remaining policies will be subject to this new methodology um i've seen estimates saying the majority of texans will be paying more because of risk rating 2.0 um and that translates to about 86 of texas's national flood insurance policies um the vast majority of these policyholders are expected uh to pay an increase of up to 10 a month um because of harris county's unique position we have approximately 320 000 active policies so we lead the state in the participation in the flood insurance program and the majority of these policyholders are um are looking at these changes and so while it does represent a more accurate uh maybe real risk because it takes into consideration other factors and property characteristics i know how important it is to make sure flood insurance continues to be affordable um and that is a priority here in the congress we've been talking about how we can help address the changes um and make sure that those who need it most can afford to get that that flood insurance so i look forward to hearing tonight um from from mr jerome um about his um his presentation and how these changes will affect our community um and so i know that they will both be happy to answer any questions you have about uh the nfip program and its new methodology um and i will uh be glad to answer any questions i can as well but before we turn to to uh i guess gilbert and steve first i'll hand it over to council member abby kaiman again a real champion for our community and an incredible partner so grateful for your leadership grateful for your partnership and glad to be with you tonight well thank you congresswoman uh it's really your leadership and advocacy especially when it comes to flood protection at the federal level um that enables us at the city to really do what we need to be doing uh to help protect residents so i want to first off acknowledge you because we cannot achieve a resilient houston that's capable of withstanding and recovering from flooding without all levels of government working together and i'm it's such a privilege to be able to have that type of partnership with you uh many of you who are listening and i think we have hundreds of people that are tuning in right now which again just highlights how important an issue this is for so many families but many of them know on the different projects that we've been working on but really tonight is about how new insurance rates are going to impact each one of us and our families and i could not ask for a better voice in washington to pursue the vital federal resources and relay the concerns that some of our residents have i also really quickly want to recognize your staff who has been really amazing in working with us to launch tonight and uh everything that goes on behind the scenes so please relay my appreciation to them and i also want to thank each of you that's tuning in all of our residents we as your representatives and local and federal government are working tirelessly to protect our community from the threat of flooding but again it does remain a threat and flood insurance is that vital tool to protect all of our homes and our livelihoods and as the congresswoman said many in our district are going to be impacted by these rates because of the consecutive floods that have occurred in so many of our neighborhoods i've personally gotten many questions about how the new rules to nfip are going to impact us and again it was the congresswoman and my intention to provide an avenue for you to hear directly from fema to ask questions and i really appreciate while we'll try to get to as many questions as possible tonight there were so many uh that we will actually thanks to the congresswoman uh be submitting those questions to gilbert um and his team will actually be trying to respond individually if there were more personalized questions so even if you don't hear your question tonight uh they will be taking it back to respond and hopefully get an answer for you so gilbert thank you for doing that as well my ask is for anyone that's listening tonight uh please take back what you're learning into your neighborhood into your community and help make them aware as well of the changes that are coming we don't want anyone to be blindsided and you play an important role in that so in addition to appreciating fema for being here tonight i really quickly wanted to introduce to you all um steve costello our chief recovery officer he wears many hats at the city he has an extensive background in flood control and drainage he's an absolute authority on flooding and storm water management having advised governmental agencies municipalities county state all different levels you name it and he's also responsible for coordinating the city's efforts in this regard so we'll be hearing from him later on and steve thank you for joining us i wanted steve actually i have to give a lot of credit to uh we've been talking about these flood insurance rates and uh this was also him uh driving the need to uh educate constituents as well so steve thank you for really pushing this issue alongside myself and congresswoman fletcher i really appreciate your work and look forward to hearing you uh but first again i'll hand it back to congresswoman fletcher to kick off for fema what i hope will be an informative presentation well thanks so much um for that um and i i really do think it's uh important and useful to get right into the the questions and so i'm gonna just turn it straight over uh to to gilbert quirone from fema and uh he's the regional flood insurance liaison for fema region six uh which includes texas as well as arkansas louisiana new mexico and oklahoma so we know what a big territory that is and really appreciate the time that you're spending with us um here in houston tonight thanks so much my pleasure thank you are we going to be able to get the presentation up please we go all right i'm going to go ahead and turn off my video to help just stop with any uh technical issues uh so my name is george i am the regional flood insurance liaison for fema at a region six my roles and responsibility are interact between our insured our customers and flood insurance or anything that involves flood insurance such as filing claims such as concerns about overall premium costs and to provide education outreach as we're going to do tonight next slide please so as we we've heard several times tonight that we are transitioning the mythology of how we write flood insurance the legacy system has been in effect since the late 70s and while it's been actual sound it is a complex it is confusing and it is behind the times risk rating 2.0 is a transformational leap forward it is a opportunity for us to come in line with industry best practices and to adjust to address the issue of inequality in equity uh by changing the methodology how we write the flood insurance what i mean by that is under the legacy system you could have a house side by side two houses one valued at two million dollars one valued at 250 000. the current system of writing flood insurance only goes off the flood zone and the baseline elevation they would both be charged the same rate for flood insurance we all know that the house that is two million dollars will far exceed damages than the house valued at two hundred thousand so under risk rating 2.0 we are addressing this no longer will lower valued homes be subsidizing higher valued homes when it comes to flood insurance premiums in in return all structures in fema's book of business we have 5 million active flood insurance policies will now be rated on an individual risk assessment from each and every structure and one of the main variables that have been added on is the replacement cost value now this is really important we're going to see roughly two thirds of policyholders across the united states we'll have a uh reduction of their flood insurance premium those are the older pre-firm houses those are the houses that have a very low replacement cost value and they've been paying the same rate as higher valued homes this entire time we are finally addressing that now when i say we are changing the methodology we are revamping the way flood insurance written and what i meant by industry best practices is if we go to the next slide please if you look on the left that was what the legacy system used to write flood insurance in essence we really just looked if you're in the in the special flood hazard area and then there was two types of flooding that we took in consideration one of them was flooding from river rain and the other one was flooding from coastal storm surge we compared that to the basement elevation and the structural elevation and that was really all we used to determine the risk associated with that flood insurance premium but in reality a home can face multiple perils from flooding and we have now taken that into consideration if you look to the graph on the right you'll see the rating variables now we have six instead of the two that we had before we had six and they're going to be distance to ocean uh a coast river distance to flooding source they're going to be stream order flood type now this is a big one the flood type is fluvial or fluvial one of them is from riverine one of the new variables being added in is rainfall events uh we all i'm sure majority of you have heard of noah atlas 14 and one of the things that really impacted harvey was that we didn't take in consideration the increase of rainfall events not just in texas but across the country well we have taken those in consideration uh other variables are going to be the ground elevation and surrounding elevation so we're going to ping the house's location we're going to be able to determine by our geolocation tool that was a proprietary product we had built just for this that we are going to be able to look at the ground surrounding elevation and use it as a direct variable on the flood insurance premium we're also going to provide the first floor height now this is important because as the regional flood insurance liaison one of the the worst things i have ever heard is that we can't flood afford flood insurance because we can't afford the elevation certificate that is needed to get a flood insurance policy well fema has procured what's called the first floor height tool through core logic they are going to provide the they're they're really going to answer the question is what is the distance between the lowest stage grade which is the lowest part of the foundation touches the ground and the first floor and we are going to provide that information for all of our insured so there will no longer be the need for an elevation certificate for flood insurance purposes we're also going to take in consideration construction types and foundation types we have learned that wood frame construction suffers more damage than masonry type construction so if you build your home using brick uh other type of masonry products you're gonna receive a lower premium than if you were wood frame this type of incentivizing mitigation is really important moving forward on a risk rating 2.0 because we do have discounts that are achievable under risk rating 2.0 but let's talk about some things that are not changing let's go ahead and go to the next slide please so statutory rate caps on annual premiums are not changing um bigger waters 12 and hefaya uh homeowners flood insurance field over the act of 2014 2015. we set statutory caps congress that caps on how much fema can raise flood insurance premiums that cap is remaining in place at 18 we cannot exceed that only in a few cases such as a house that may be deemed severe repetitive loss that means it has multiple multiple losses that have they far exceeded the valuation of the home but most of uh policies far by large will have a 18 cap on them flood insurance policies will not increase more than 18 now the availability of premium discounts are not changing as i mentioned earlier pre-firm will still receive a discount and so will newly mapped now those discounts are going to be in the way of a lower glide path you're going to hear me say glide path several times for this presentation and the glide path is simply um a way to achieve the full risk premium and i'll talk about that here more in a few minutes another thing that's not changing is the ability to assign an existing flood insurance policy to a new or prospective buyer we call those people call them transfers but in our lingo is called an assignment so it is still very beneficial to maintain your flood insurance policy and if you are on a glide path and you do have one of these discounts it can still carry over to a prospective buyer makes that house more marketable makes that policy more marketable the use of flood insurance rate maps are not changing however they will not be used to determine the overall flood insurance premiums like they once were what they will be used for is to determine what is called mandatory purchase of flood insurance if you live inside of a special flood hazard area and your mortgage is touched by federal dollars now think of fannie mae freddie mac va hud those are all federal mortgages the mandatory purchase of flood insurance will still be required through your lender now other things are not changing is the availability of premium discounts for the community rating system now houston is a crs member community and all your constituents are receiving a percentage discount because of the additional hard work the city has put into maintaining a a high level in the crs one of the things changing about this is before the sierras program percentage discount only applied to those who lived inside of the special flood hazard area under risk rating 2.0 i'm happy to announce that it will that percentage discount will now be available to every policyholder in these jurisdictional boundaries of houston so if that percentage discount is 20 percent that we now be carried by every policyholder in the jurisdictional boundaries the only caveat for those outside of the special flood hazard area is that their policy has to be at the full risk premium first before they can achieve that now now that i mentioned flourish premium let's go ahead and go to the next slide and i'm going to show you what a declaration page is going to look like under risk rating 2.0 now these numbers are not actual numbers these are kind of give you a visual representation of what to expect on the declaration pages provided by your insurance providers moving forward under risk rating 2.0 we are now going to provide all of our insured a number that is called their full risk premium this has never been provided before under the legacy system uh fire requires that we increase flood insurance premiums every year no less than five percent but no more than eighty percent until they hit full risk rate the full risk rate was never identified so in reality those increases would have continued forever without end under risk rating 2.0 we now have identified the full risk rate so once your policy has hit full risk rate unless there's a significant change to the ground information or the insured changes a the amount of coverage or the value of replacement costs vary the home changes significantly they can anticipate no further increases under risk rating 2.0 now if you'll take a look under here you have the full risk premium on the top of the page but on the bottom you have the total annual payment those are two different numbers the full risk payment is what your policy will be when you hit the full risk rate but since we are not allowed to increase flood insurance premiums more than 18 they will start with what they were paying the last year in this particular case the annual payment was one thousand sixteen dollars so now that the full risk premium is higher than the annual payment this particular policy holder will increase 18 percent a year until that annual payment matches the full risk payment and then the increases will stop now this is a mock-up i have seen some actual decoration pages and they are very similar to this uh what's important is that all the discounts are kin are added in such as the crs the mitigation discounts um and those are really important and we'll talk more about those and we'll answer questions on those so the next slide is a nationwide a breakdown of how we anticipate the risk rating 2.0 to go now on average we have 5 million policies in female book of business we anticipate 23 almost a million policies to experience an immediate decrease once they transition the risk rating 2.0 now we are losing some of our popular products we are losing what's called the preferred risk policy uh we are losing that because the preferred risk policy was not based on any individual risks for a building it was in essence you're in a zone and since you're in this zone this is what your pay scale or your schedule rate schedule will be now we have the ability to do an in-depth individual risk assessment for every building in our book of business so with that being said we're going to rate every building according to their true risks so even though peer peas are going away prefer this policies are going away we do anticipate a increase in policies that did have a preferred risk policies because they were not rated on risks before they were rated on being in a zone and that was really it now in a few cases we will have some about the 11 that can experience increases anywhere between 120 to 240 per month those are going to be far and few between one of the things the risk rating 2.0 is bringing to us here is a cap on single family homes policies right now believe it or not under our existing book of business we do have some policies that can exceed 45 000 a year for most people that's just unattainable under risk rating 2.0 the most high-risk single-family homes will not exceed 12 125 for a year for their flood insurance policy a significant decrease for what the maximum amount maximum amount that we are seeing under the legacy system now let's take a little bit more of a look of a texas breakdown now this is state specific i wasn't able to break this down uh uh for jurisdictional boundaries but risk rating 2.0 equity in action is actual a website now on this website you can find the state profiles and actually break this information down by zip code i didn't have the manpower to break that down by zip code and create products that are easy to see but i'm sure your constituents are really smart and and be able to pull up their zip codes maybe someone from the city of houston can create some type of product but under the state breakdown for the next slide please there we go for fully fourteen percent of that we have approximately 760 000 flood insurance policies in the state of texas 14 of those will experience a decrease on plan upon transitioning to risk rating 2.0 now we do see almost 80 percent of um of uh [Music] policies can experience an increase now that can be anywhere from zero to ten dollars per month it depends on the individual risk assessment of that now we do have about seven percent that's going to be in the higher risk bracket that can go anywhere between 120 to 240 a month but by far and large we have about 80 percent of our book of business in texas that are going to experience incremental increases now that they're going to be based on the individual risk assessments for their policies now let's move on over to the next slide please i already touched on this a little bit and i'm under i want to leave as many as answer as many questions as we can go so let's go to the next slide which is our phased approach now this one is really important for this constitution to hear we have already initiated risk rating 2.0 it started october 1st for new business but what is not known we try to get the message out there as much as we can but some people are missing this if you have a renewal for your flood insurance policy that is after october 1 but before april 1 2022 you can get two different quotes you can get a quote under the legacy system and you can get a quote under risk rating 2.0 if your quote under risk rate 2.0 gives you a better premium it gives you a decrease you can opt into risk rating 2.0 at that time or you can choose to remain in the legacy system and then transition to risk rating 2.0 in april 1 2022 when all existing book of business transitions to risk rating 2.0 upon the renewal time so last slide please so fema just didn't do this on its own this was a an effort between universities between engineers between our what we call the write your own partners those are the uh 60 odd companies of insurance providers who write flood insurance in our behalf we had mitigation experts we had actuaries on here we had industries best practices the brightest minds for private sector insurance all played a part of this we've also created new products using private sectors such a private sector companies such as core logic such as cat risk we've incorporated the newest and best data from the army foreign engineers from from noaa we have created new products that we believe are not only going to help with risk rated 2.0 but help with other branches within fema moving forward so that was a really quick breakdown of risk rating 2.0 i can literally i have an hour that's i have a presentation that six hours on risk radio 2.0 we can talk about this for a lot so now let's move on and i believe we're going to go to mr castillo and then i'll come back to try to answer as many questions as i can steve i think you're muted there you go i mean in the interest of time i just want to just talk a little bit to the community about what the city's role is in actual flood insurance basically where the participants in the national flood insurance program and because we are a participant national fund insurance program there are a couple of things our community is able to buy flood insurance and it's always been a subsidized product for our community one of the other roles that we play is what google was talking about which is a community rating system based on our flood insurance and based on our flooding policies we are actually better than minimum federal standards and as a result we get a credit that is applied to all flood insurance policyholders within the city it's uh nice to hear that gilbert was saying it's not only limited which is currently limited to just within what hazard areas but now it's going to be all policyholders inside the city limits and so we are one of the highest rating major metropolitan areas in the country relative to the crs system and we're really proud of that and then finally i saw a couple of questions briefly about map necks and the changing of the flood insurance maps uh we do not participate in the actual preparation of the maps our sister agency harris county flood control district is doing that and if you want to get an update on their timeline please go to their website harris county flood control district website and just type in map next m-a-a-p-n-e-x-t and you'll see you can scroll down to their timeline their current timeline is that they'll have some preliminary information forwarded to fema next in the next couple of months and then shortly thereafter we'll see preliminary maps once the preliminary maps come out we as a city will be responsible for administrating our flood insurance policies according to those draft maps even though it will take another 18 to 24 months to become final maps but by law we are required to use the most available data so that's really where the city's functions are relative to flooding and flood infrastructure as well as relative to these flood insurance rates so i'm going to turn it over to the moderator i guess is going to be aaron taking care of some of the questions and whatever questions that are non-fema related i'll be happy to try to address them if i can wonderful um well uh i will start with a question from gail where is a link to fully show the fema changes to our property price for information on insurance so i think you mentioned a site um in your in your comments um i think it'd be helpful to give folks that website that they can go to yes risk rating 2.0 equity in action it looks like a general just website at first but if you scroll down halfway down you'll see a link called technical documents and in that technical documents you'll see examples of what's called a premium calculation worksheet and it gives multiple examples about how each uh variable is weighted uh and once again those are not real numbers but it gives you a really good idea of how the uh the calculation worksheet will play a part in how the premium is determined okay and we will um put that in the chat box for folks uh so that they can click on it easily um nora had a question how are the floodplains determined so the floodplains are determined by a it's called a study now the studies are done in person boots on the ground and also by a lot of lidar planes flying over they shoot down special laser emitting diodes come back and they go off of a a model that represents what we call the one percent annual chance of flood now that does not mean water is there that means if we exceed a one percent this is where we anticipate water to be that's why a lot of times you'll have homes that um say i've been here 30 years and never seen water well that's probably because there's never been a one percent annual event in that that specific area uh so we go off of one percent annual event for all of our mo all of our maps now we do have a cooperating technical partner such as harris county flood control disc district which can increase that in fact uh the map next product we don't anticipate new maps coming out until 2023 uh it was a graph this project is funded by fema by a grant but harris county flight control district is doing all the work they are doing the study they are putting the boots on the ground to capture the most accurate ground truth that they can before the maps go active in 2023 but it is a time consuming process when fema initiates a map project it can take in order from two to five years and cost millions upon millions of dollars okay thank you um robin asked how was the new assessment of risk developed and how will they adjust the new risk versus previous claims so under risk rating 2.0 prior flood loss history all of our insured are starting with a clean slate so let me uh let me go into a little more detail prior flood loss history will be a direct variable on how your flood insurance premium is determined but since this is a new process all your previous flood loss are not calculated under risk rating 2.0 until your first loss until your first claim under risk rating 2.0 and then all the prior flood loss will come back into play so you're starting with the clean slate it's the best way we could do that it gives the homeowners the opportunity to mitigate to make their home more resilient maybe follow some uh flood resistant materials and areas if they flooded before but everyone started with the clean slave but eventually if they have to file a claim on a risk rating 2.0 those variables will come back in play okay thank you we got this question a couple different ways um so mary asked if a person has national flood insurance do they remain eligible for assistance from fema in the event of a flood yes but in under fema's eyes we cannot duplicate benefits uh so if you if you have a flood insurance claim now if you're underinsured maybe and there's some individual assistance is not my areas of expertise but there are some other programs where you still could be eligible for certain benefits that's why you'll hear us say that if you have flood insurance policies still please register for disaster assistance let the professionals determine who you or what you may be eligible to receive thanks and aaron i just want to uh to chime in there too and say um of course many of us uh do know about the um the individual assistance and the fema assistance that comes in after a disaster and um that while that's separate from the flood insurance policies obviously when there is a disaster uh folks are dealing with all of these things simultaneously um and so i just want to remind everybody that um our office our team is here to help whenever people um in the district uh need help with a federal agency and so that would include fema as well as of course many people took out sba disaster loans after harvey as well as um you know there have been some other um loans over the last uh year and a half with the pandemic but certainly uh anytime that you are dealing with a federal agency and need assistance i just want to put in a reminder that that's what our constituent services team here in the 7th congressional district is here for thanks thank you councilman that's true here at the city i get a lot of emails from people asking for assistance and even though we don't provide the assistance we do provide assistance in helping them get to the right people whether it's on the county level or on the federal level okay i'll get into some more of the technical questions that we got submitted um if brian asked if our home is raised above the 500-year floodplain as is required by new construction in houston will flood insurance be required if you have a mandatory purchase of flood insurance yes it would be your elevator yeah but i want to jump in real quick for a question um and i want to remind everybody that what the new system is looking at is both riverine flooding as well as urban flooding they call it peruvial or heavy rainfall and it doesn't matter where you live you need flood insurance and no matter what and it's probably the most cost-effective flood insurance especially if you're out of a hazard area and you're only subject to maybe what we would call urban flooding but everyone should have flood insurance and it's important and steve thank you for bringing that up i think it's also important to remember the distinction between home insurance and flood insurance and that they are in fact separate a lot of people and we unfortunately see this in so many in the aftermath of disasters they say oh i thought i was covered and flood insurance is a separate purchase so again echoing the message of it is so important whether it's required um through fema or not to make sure that you're covered and that your family is covered with flood insurance thank you um jordan asked uh if your home didn't flood but you're in an area that did flood will the insurance rates go up if you're in a flood zone but your home never flooded what recourse do you have could you still use risk elevations to change the high risk rate elevation is important it's just as important under risk rating 2.0 as it was under the legacy system uh the thing to remember is we are going to go off more individual risk assessments so elevation alone is not going to maybe lower your premium anymore because at one time if you elevate it it could lower your premium but that was one we were only comparing your risk against either flooding from coastal storm surge or from riverine flooding but now we're going to compare it to coastal storm surge riverine fluvial we're going to compare it to tsunami if it applies we're going to compare it to great lakes so there's new variables being added in so the elevation is still going to help but you may not see as much help as it once did before in the past okay um larry asked uh after harvey we elevated our house if that will be if that will be a factor in our new insurance rating how do we communicate the fact that our house is now material elevated and to whom so we should have that new elevation material uh when we uh created the first for height tool we're able to determine the first store height or almost 80 percent of the buildings in our book of business now however that doesn't mean we're always right if you have an elevation certificate especially after a mitigation project a post construction elevation certificate you can verify that information in fact if you submit that information into fema and we show that that information is better we're going to always give the insured the most advantageous rate that we can so that means we would accept the information on the elevation certificate and incorporate that uh into our own um calculations and give the homeowner the best possible premium okay and this might be a good follow-up question then um how can we potentially challenge higher rates uh elevation certificate is one way a new variable for risk rating 2.0 is replacement cost value so if you have some type of a professional appraisal uh or if you have something different from the uh the city's tax appraisal rolls uh something that shows that the replacement cost value is a different amount those are two ways to really uh offset the or contest the information that we're using we are using tools um it's an algorithm it happens behind the scene so we are allowing homeowners to submit this information uh to compare it and if it does lead to a more advantageous rate then we are all for that aaron can i can i ask you a direct question relative to that so gilbert you in your presentation you are comparing two side-by-side houses one two million dollars and one 250 000 is it now a policy the new policy will allow people to insure for higher amounts other than let's say the limit of 250 000 no those are statutory amounts set by congress we hear a risk rating 2.0 we changed a lot of things but we did not change anything that had to have a statutory approval so no those are statutory amounts 250 000 building for single family home hundred thousand dollar content same for business 500 000 building 500 000 content uh the increased cost compliance also is a statutory requirement so we are not to change that it's still up to thirty thousand dollars so we could not do that those are examples were just to show that even though the higher valuation home it will achieve damage a lot more damage a lot quicker than a 250 000 home that they're paying the same premium yeah okay thank you okay um peter asks what are the best first steps to estimate the potential costs for someone thinking about being a first-time homeowner so if someone's looking at a property what would be the first steps for them to assess this well location is always important we have six new variables that are going to determine the overall flood insurance cost um if someone wants to live near water the rivers the lakes they should be prepared to experience increase in flood insurance costs especially with mandatory purchases of insurance for federal mortgages the further away you can live from the direct variables the better route you're going to be 5 million policies in our book of business 1 million of them are going to experience a immediate decrease well those are all going to be a million in the interior of the united states your your nebraska's your wyomings your mountains of colorado those further away from the variables are going to achieve a lower rate now that doesn't mean um that the entire state of texas is going to be very expensive for insurance there's going to be some cases where i'm going to use my my own personal preferred risk policy that i had decreased almost 300 because i'm i bought my house further away from flooding stores to try to get as far away from water as i could so they can experience decreases as well so look for those higher elevations for natural natural terrain look for construction methods you want to build your house out of masonry you want to have an elevated foundation remember if i know slab on great foundations are popular in texas right but it doesn't allow the unrepeated flow of water to go underneath it uh by having an elevated structure pure pylon post even on sugar wall or our crawl space allows water to flow through unrepeated and that way it doesn't provide the hydrostatic the pressure that builds up on the walls and causes implosion you know it just allows the water to go through it doesn't cause a negative impact because when you build slab on grade oftentimes you bring in fill you bring in fill and you create a dirt a mound right well water has to go someplace so it's going to come up to those mounds and then it's going to go to your neighbors adverse impacts unintentional but they happen all the time so those are the type of scenarios i would look for out i'll look for higher terrain and then build construction from there as risk rating 2.0 is designed for new construction my personal opinion new construction has the ability to receive the most amount of discounts on a risk rating 2.0 both mitigation and statutory discounts i get with your floodplain administrator for the city of houston and ask these questions how do i receive my my venting discount how do i receive my construction discount how do i receive my machinery and equipment discount that's me five percent three to twenty seven percent discount for the venti five percent for machinery equipment you add that ion and i'm i looked this up while you're talking steve st houston is a five crs5 that means every policyholder in houston receives a 25 discount already so you start adding these discounts as a new construction and you can see you can receive substantial savings um and gilbert can i ask when you said earlier um that people can supply that where should they go do they do they work with their insurance who's with the plan is that where somebody would you know submit that information or sort of what would be the steps for that person well the first step would be discuss this with the floodplain administrator for the you know the city of houston make sure make sure that the plans are going to provide uh the the discounts that want to be achieved at the end but you wouldn't be able to apply for the discounts until the construction is complete and you're ready to actually write the flood insurance policy at that time the homeowner will work with their insurance provider a lot of these discounts are self-reporting but they do have to have necessary and supporting documents to show that the discounts are achieved such as the venting you know a uh engineered document saying that the flood venting meets the criteria for one square inch for every one square foot of the crawl space area are the uh the construction type is the proper type of material that will experience less uh damage during flooding as opposed to wood frame so a lot of this is self-reporting with just the uh the supporting documents yeah and to bear in mind we our floodplain administrator is a young woman by the name of choice morrow in our uh permit department uh if there's anyone who has any questions wanted to reach out to her you can send me an email and i'll go ahead and forward it over to choice but bear in mind any requests for insurance rates discounts or insurance rates beyond what we're doing in terms of permitting has to be with their insurance broker because that's not what the city does thank you very helpful um so a couple people had uh this question so my my home is never flooded but i've always purchased flood insurance if i sell my home can i sign over my existing policy to a new seller to keep the premium low yes the assignment of a policy is still carrying over to risk rating 2.0 so that's actually very advantageous of them because under risk rating 2.0 i mentioned the glide path while the homeowner when they start their glide path will start the glide path at what they the rate they last paid okay so if you had a preferred risk policy and this the hypothetical that preferred risk policy is 571 dollars that will be the starting point and then you will experience an 18 glide path moving forward until you hit that full risk premium number so if you have a very low starting point it can take you years to achieve that full risk premium giving the homeowners time to plan accordingly put money to the side and then roll that over to any potential perspective buyers so yes okay and then the other question is what if anything will be grandfathered lorraine asked that so let me uh let me tell you this first right now under fema's book of business 5 million policies less than 4.8 percent of those policies are grandfathered that's about 165 431 policies nationwide we don't have a lot of grandfathered policies anymore we have slowly uh they have slowly reached the point where grandfathered premiums are no longer advantageous to those insured but because of this and to re to reduce the complexity we are no longer going to have any type of grandfather products under risk rating 2.0 okay um francis asked are there protections for senior citizens to allow affordability for persons on a fixed income that's a great question so this is one of the times i i don't like this position risk rating 2.0 was done because our system was archaic it was confusing and very complicated but one of the things that is not in our criteria to use to determine flood insurance premium is affordability we have submitted several studies to congress uh to try to bring affordability into the fold maybe by some type of cost means our [Music] income to help but right now affordability is not a direct variable is not a direct action on fema's part to determine flood insurance premiums and um i just chime in very quickly after that because i think it is important to know that there are certain things that members of congress can do certainly working through the process and it's really important to know uh that those recommendations have been made and uh hopefully sent to the appropriate committees uh certainly there is legislation making its way through congress right now i heard a question earlier about um about the cap uh the two hundred and fifty thousand dollar cap for residences and a hundred thousand for uh contents uh as well as the the separate 500 and 500 business cap um and certainly there are ongoing discussions about raising those caps about uh i actually just filed a bill last week to extend uh temporary housing assistance under fema not the same thing as flood insurance but really taking the lessons we've learned in all these different disasters to try to get people the help they need but addressing uh the cost but also the coverage um and seeing if there can be more coverage is really important so those conversations are going on um here here in congress and i do think it's um i just want to mention that and for those of you um who you know who support those kinds of things or have ideas or things that would be useful for us please don't hesitate to let me and my team know as we are trying to do things to help make this uh more affordable and more accessible for everyone i i can't echo enough what um steve costello said that you know no matter where you are in houston uh you want to have flood insurance and so we want to make sure that everyone who needs flood insurance uh meaning everyone in houston can afford the insurance that they need um we've got a couple more minutes so we'll try to get to a few questions um jennifer asked is there a limit on the number of times you can claim flood damages our house has repeatedly flooded no but eventually the increased number of claims would lead to higher premiums uh i did mention that the glide path experienced by most will be 18 if you fall into the severe pet of loss category that glide path could be as high as 25 so that's something we would like to avoid and i know um it's hard to mitigate slab on grade type structures but i would encourage some type of mitigation replacement flood materials elevate electrical components reach out to local floodplain administrator for other ideas on how to mitigate a home that can't be elevated so before we before we exit that topic gilbert does that mean when we have a house that's substantially damaged and then they have to follow our floodplain policies or can they just leave the house the way it is repair the house and just absorb the higher flood insurance premiums i think that's really where that question is coming from well no so they've they uh they said for follow claims they didn't say substantial damage uh so the only the only way a house can be determined substantially damage is if the community does it itself now if the community determines this house to be substantially damaged they have to follow the ordinance um and that's that's a given but if it does not if it does not equal to the amount or if the community does not deem it as substantial damage they can they can experience multiple claims and that will they'll be fine but the premiums will reflect the claims okay thank you okay just a couple more um catherine asked are the flood maps being redrawn to reflect flood mitigation being done in jersey village i don't know since this is a a local study being done they would have to ask that question from harris county flight control district their map next program yes and i would encourage them to reach out to harris county flight control district for that question i would assume that there is a specific time period that map next is reflecting and whatever capital improvement projects that were done on whether it's white oak bayou or any other stream at that specific point in time it's what's reflected in the map next model great and we will put that um in the chat but steve can you remind people again where they can go uh to see those maps well the maps aren't available just yet and so they're still in the process of doing all their calculations and it'll be probably i think probably sometime next year when the draft maps come out available for public comment and then it's a 18 to 24 month period before they become finalized but once the maps come out in preliminary use we will then be using them to administer our flood insurance policies and i'll just add in terms of the time table so that people are aware i believe you can go to mapnext.org but it's spelled m-a-a-p-next n-e-x-t dot org and there's a timetable there um with flood controls maps okay we're coming up just at the end of the hour but i'll add one final question um lenae asked um inch our insurance agent told us they can't tell us our renewal rates until the end of the month or so before the policies end is that correct i would encourage you to find a new agent agents have had access to the risk rating engines since september now there have may have been uh different internal procedures from each company i know one company even though they had the engine they didn't want to release it until to their franchise agents until they had their own internal operating procedures down uh but it's been available i have we have uh thousands of new policies under risk ready 2.0 and we have hundreds of thousands of quotes for risk rating 2.0 um we have done specific training for agents across the nation uh i was very disheartened to learn that uh 1425 agents have taken 2.0 training for the entire state of texas 435 for louisiana and my other states less than 50. so training is out there uh but it's like you can lead a horse to water but you can't make them drink i would personally shop around i would actually go out and get three quotes not because you're shopping for prices prices are going to be the same but what you're looking for is a knowledge and experienced agent when it comes to the peril of flooding if they are knowledgeable in writing a policy they're more likely to be knowledgeable in submitting claims and that and that makes a world of difference if you have an agent who knows what they're doing thank you gilbert well that that brings us to the almost to the end of the hour um so i will pass it back over to you uh congresswoman and council member can i have just one more second please yes please okay so there was one more question so i have not had flood insurance in years do i need it now yes you do uh flood insurance is a single-payer policy homeowner's insurance does not cover the apparel flooding and i i i was telling this group earlier the entire country is a flood plain it's just a question of what risk you live in and at no times on any affiliate maps will you ever find that this area will not flood it's going to happen when you least expect it and a flood insurance policy is one sure way to help you recover from that peril flooding so thank you that's all i want to say well thank you for that follow-up again i think it's really important for folks to know and understand uh that the flood insurance policy uh is important because it's not covered in traditional homeowners policies that you need to get flood insurance to have coverage which unfortunately too many of our neighbors uh have learned that they needed uh especially in in recent years uh in houston and harris county um so i will um i will turn it back to council member cayman uh for any concluding uh thoughts and then i'll just wrap us up uh with the questions we've done tonight with more to come well again congresswoman thank you for working with me to launch this um mr costello thank you for all you do from the city side and working with every level of government and as steve said my office is here so is our recovery office in terms of connecting residents with additional information and gilbert thank you for your presentation i do know that a lot of it we may want to break down into layman's terms for folks at some point but i think that the starting point is going to fema.gov to the flood insurance risk rating website um looking at some of these maps to see where we will be impacted congresswoman i know my staff was kind of doing some of the numbers and unfortunately some of our areas are going to be the most significantly impacted by these rate changes uh gilbert i wish we could uh wave a wand and find higher terrain uh than what we have in houston but we have what we have and i know we're doing as much as we can to make houston as resilient as possible from project braze and additional mitigation we're trying to do in the southwest corridor near the bayous all the way north and south of our districts east and west you name it but we are in this together please again tell neighbors about this ask questions we will continue to be a resource and congresswoman fletcher again thank you for your advocacy at the federal level because we cannot do this without you without the partnership and without the resources that the federal government can be providing the city well thanks so much councilmember cayman it's always a pleasure to work with you and to be your partner um and the same is true for everybody here tonight um gilbert rhone so helpful so knowledgeable uh very direct uh which is always very useful um and of course steve costello everything you've done for our city and continue to do uh is so so important so i'm really glad to be with all of you tonight um i will also note that i'm really glad we scheduled this for tonight uh and not tomorrow night uh when we might have had a smaller audience uh folks might have something else to watch uh around this time um but i'm really grateful that we were able to do this and as council member came and mentioned early on um we did our best to respond to the questions especially uh kind of prioritizing ones we got a lot in different forms but we will get all of your questions asked um that is thanks to our terrific constituent services team and the great team at fema uh that's gonna work to get these uh these questions answered uh but this is an ongoing process so please remember um if you have a question about this or anything else if you need help with the federal agency or if you want to share your thoughts with me at any time about what you think we should or shouldn't be doing here in washington um or back home in houston you can call my office anytime my phone number in houston 713-350 um and my office in dc where i am right now 202-225-2571 um so please don't hesitate to call that's what we're here for and um i thank you all for being here and go astros and congresswoman i forgot one thing i'm so sorry um in addition to my office i did want to recognize while she's not on screen um one of my colleagues council member sally alcorn who recognized uh represents at large the city of houston who cares about this issue and since you put your information out i'll put mine in the chat in terms of our office email for residents to reach out and again sorry to jump in but i absolutely wanted to make sure we recognized our other partners working with us on the city level terrific yeah well it takes all of us and it takes a great partnership um we've got great leaders in the city of houston we've got great leaders in harris county and i can just assure all of you i know my constituents are always asking and want to know whether we're working together uh we are and especially on flooding issues across the aisle across the different uh departments and divisions and um and you know layers of government uh we're working together because we know how important this is to our community uh not just recovery but planning for our community going forward so thanks so much for being here uh great to see you all and thanks to everybody who's participating take care

mr. speaker as a third-generation farmer from California's San Joaquin Valley I would like to wish everyone a Happy National Agricultural Day something that we do throughout our country I'm proud obviously to represent the heart of California San Joaquin Valley but our agricultural productiveness throughout the country beginning with the very origins of the history of the United States has truly been one of the tremendous assets that we have had we are home of the most productive agricultural land in the world not only throughout the country but in California our farmers our dairy men and women our ranchers livestock folks feed the country I have often said that our food security our food security that dinner that we have on our dinner table every night is a part of America's national food security as a senior member of the House Agriculture Committee I'm proud that we delivered a comprehensive farm bill last year now it's part of our job to ensure that we implement that that farm bill as a safety net for agriculture throughout the country but it's also a safety net for those who are working poor those who are unfortunately recipients of food assistance programs and the school lunch and the school breakfast programs so the farm bill does a great deal to help all Americans this year the agricultural committee will work to ensure that those promises we made in the farm bill will be implemented in the way we intended and the subcommittee chair the subcommittee that I chair in livestock and foreign agriculture will be at the at the vanguard of that effort so today on national AG day let us thank those who grow America's food and fiber and put it on America's dinner table every night I'm talking about the farmers the dairy men and women and the farm workers who through the hard work and the fruits of their labor make this all come together

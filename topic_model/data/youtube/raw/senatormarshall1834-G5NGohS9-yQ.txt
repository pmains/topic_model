while the president's remarks last night should be a moment of celebration the atmosphere felt more like a morgue and the bearing of american exceptionalism was at hand the speech itself was the lowest energy speech i've ever personally heard on the house floor now obviously this was a speech about government control of our lives and it was so hard to listen to the radical policy carefully hidden between colloquialisms false claims and boast what we heard last night from president biden was more of his pitch to sell his partisan wish list that raises taxes spends more money increases regulations and pushes the american people to government dependency we heard him talk about how he wants to lift six trillion dollars from the american people's wallets that's six trillion dollars now that he's spending in his first hundred days history will record president biden as having spent more money than any other president in us history in his first few months in office all at the expense of the american taxpayer his plan for the american people is really just more steps to socialism and more steps to further divide our country president biden mentioned unity nine times in his inaugural address and mentioned it several times in a speech last night but unfortunately it's all lip service the unity president biden keeps preaching about is nowhere to be found from the white house 100 days in office and there's been zero zero bipartisanship from them on any major issue we've seen zero effort by them to take any republican idea or concept seriously in fact they've done very little to reach across the aisle engage republicans or have a serious conversation with us they've shown they are not interested in bipartisanship as they continue to jam through their radical agenda and seek power grab after power grab the bottom line is this the president's speech couldn't have been a more horrible message for american exceptionalism and unity if president biden truly puts unity above all else we can accomplish great things for our nation for its unity that will see this country come roaring back not president biden's radical partisan ways that have further divided this nation

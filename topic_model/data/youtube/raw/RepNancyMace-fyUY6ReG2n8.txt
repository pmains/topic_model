I represent the first congressional district of South Carolina and South Carolina has had its own history um very bad history with black South Carolinians black and brown and African Americans I recently took a vote to move statues like Supreme Court Justice Taney removing his bust out of the capital rotunda because he wrote the Dred Scott opinion the one that said the black and brown and African Americans could not become citizens of the United States of America I voted to move you know someone like Wade Hampton who encouraged the murder of over 150 black South Carolinians during his run for governor and I so I appreciate your comments about the 60s I've I've was not around then but I've watched and read a lot of the history and seen the videos and seeing the moments of violence against Black America so I applaud your work on that my understanding is you were elected in 1972 in Texas is that correct it is correct right and I I applaud you for um for for uh making history I imagine in Texas and being a strong voice for black men and black women coming from South Carolina we've got we've got voter ID um and I'm assuming taxes are the same way do y'all do you all need IDs to buy alcohol when you're purchasing at the store yes to be sure that you are capable of doing that right do you need an ID in Texas to buy cigarettes you can't buy them unless you're at least 21. but you have to show an ID to buy cigarettes um do you need an ID when you're getting a job and trying to get on payroll in Texas yes do you need an ID to go to the pharmacy and get a prescription in Texas it depends on this prescription but do you need an ID for some prescriptions in Texas yes do you need an ID to get Social Security Services in Texas you do do you need an ID to rent an apartment in Texas yes do you need an ID if you're going to buy a house and finance it via a mortgage in Texas yes do you need an ID in Texas if you're going to board an aircraft and fly commercial yes did you fly commercial or fly a private jet on the way to D.C a chartered planes do you have to show an ID when you fly on a private charter jet yes I wouldn't know I've never I've never flown on one um so did you did you need an ID to get in the building here today yes um do you need an ID in Texas to open a bank account yeah the cat yeah to cash your check if you're working do you know representative Thompson um how many what percentage of blacks and taxes black and brown African Americans are registered to vote oh a huge percentage 70 do you know what percentage of African Americans black and brown Texans uh have voted on average or in the last election about 64 percent correct uh do you know how many uh whites are registered to vote in Texas far more than African-Americans 72 percent that you have 70 percent of blacks in Texas you're registered to vote you have 72 percent of whites in Texas you're registered to vote do you know the percentage of whites who turned out to vote in recent elections I want to say over 50 some percent uh 65 um do you know what percentage of Hispanics are registered to vote in Texas no I do not 63 do you know what percentage of Hispanics voted in the last election I think it was over 40 53 percent uh Hispanics are are not voting in as high in numbers as blacks and whites in Texas do you know uh the percentage of Democrats that support voter ID would you repeat your question do you know the number or percentage of Democrats who support voter ID in this country I do not but I don't think it's a whole lot 72 do you know the number of black and brown and African Americans in this country who support voter ID no 75 do you know the number of Hispanics that support voter ID in this country no 81 do you know where the state of Texas is ranked uh with black voter turnout in this country with black voters turn on do you know where Texas is ranked oh 40 by uh 44 the latest numbers that I read this morning was that Texas is ranked 10th do you know where Texas is ranked so then top 10 in the country do you know where Texas is ranked with Women Voters oh way up in the 50s in the bottom third of this country so I would argue that we have a Texas has a more difficult problem with getting women out to vote than black and brown and African Americans thank you and I yield back

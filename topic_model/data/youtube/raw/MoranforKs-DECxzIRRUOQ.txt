what we'd love to have it approved and hopefully we'll be able to persuade enough people I hope there are enough minds still open ready to consider this on its merits that could be persuaded then we're going to work very hard both of us will be on the hill next week we look forward to this interaction with the Congress and we very much hope we can persuade enough people to approve it of course turning now to Iran the nuclear agreement with Iran is now in the hands of Congress tomorrow begins day 1 of a 60-day review period the Senate will also begin hearing starting on Thursday now both sides have already made cases for and against the agreement so what next joining us now is Republican senator Jerry Moran of Kansas thank you very much for talking to a senator you know Congress and the Obama administration are making their case for and against continuing sanctions Obama and his team believed that we've got to do this because otherwise US sanctions and resolutions will be ignored eventually by other countries my question to you is that the right approach do we lift sanctions because we're worried about how other countries might perceive us Julie thanks for letting me join you this is probably the most important decision issue that many members of the United States Senate will face during their time in the United States Senate and I certainly agree with what secretary Kerry just said which is I hope that the decision about whether to approve agree with the agreement will be done on the merits and what I'm fearful of is that this will become a political issue in which Democrats find themselves in a position of having to support what I think is a terrible agreement simply because the president happens to be Democrat I don't oppose it because the presence of Democrat I oppose it because it's bad for our country it's bad for our you our national security and it reduces the stability and peace prospects in that very difficult part of the world called the Middle East and what's next should be the American people and their elected representatives in Washington DC spending the time not on the politics of this issue but on the merits to make certain that to reach the right conclusion whether it's beneficial to peace and national security are very harmful talk about the dangerous terms of this proposed because not only do they not enhance our national security as you just mentioned but what about verifying accountability from Iran where will there be accountability well you know that's what the sanctions were put in place for is to change the behavior of Iran related to the development of a nuclear weapon and what we see is the sanctions going away under the agreement and what should have happened is there's no sanction relief until Iran dismantles their nuclear program I serve on the Banking Committee that's responsible for the congressionally mandated sanctions our goal was to change the behavior of Iran using the sanctions not to remove the sanctions and hope that Iran does something different and so the this agreement is has been negotiated agreed to in a way that the benefits come way too soon and the bad behavior can continue and perhaps most troubling is the ultimate end of arms embargo and ballistic missile opportunities for Iran as well this is just we're headed in the wrong direction in a way that's so troublesome to the peace and security of the United States and the rest of the world I'll tell you what else is troubling is Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who held to his people yesterday for demanding death to America and Israel and in that vicious speech the leaders said that he hopes God will answer these prayers and vows a nuclear deal won't change Iran support for Palestine and its opposition to America I mean this is the kind of rhetoric President Obama feels can be negotiated with this we are negotiating with a country that is the leading exporter of terrorism that funds and promotes the death to Americans to to attack Israel the rhetoric matches their behavior this isn't just talk this isn't just a leader of Iran making a rhetorical set of statements this is a country that actually practices the things that the leader is saying they will still will continue to do and I guess that you could argue I mean I would make the case that even if this was a perfect agreement all right is this a country that you would trust and the answer to that is absolutely not Republican Kansas senator Jerry Moran thank you very much for talking to us we appreciate it Julie thanks Julie if you heard

agree with him joining us now republican congressman adam kinzinger one of two republicans on the january 6 uh committee uh congressman kendrick i appreciate you being with us as always the fact that leader mitch mcconnell republican leader mitch mcconnell is backing senator rounds at least off camera about the 2020 election is that significant is it i mean obviously in normal times it would just be okay yeah that would be a normal statement but you know these are not normal times you know i guess any uh any vision of you know optimism in telling the truth is good uh we're collecting it strong i mean you know mitch mcconnell from the beginning he was one of the first to acknowledge joe biden's victory it's it's interesting because after the election i just tweeted something about how sophie and i congratulate the president-elect and you think i just you know offended everybody in the world yeah basic truth is that joe biden won the election and i'm glad senator mike round said that we need to encourage that but it is utterly crazy that we're here saying that that's a big deal i want to play something republican lead senator lisa murkowski said recently about the january 6. let's listen the passage of time can kind of soften things but the facts still remain the facts there was an effort there was a concentrated effort and we're learning more day by day through this commission i wish it had been a commission that that was wholly sanctioned by the whole congress rather than than uh just a majority of democrats but we're we're learning more and more that this was a concerted effort to thwart an election now again maybe again clutching and straws but the fact is the majority of congressional republicans are not saying what senator makowsky is saying you said there's a truth crisis in the gop can can it ever be turned around as long as the former president is still the standard bearer of the party well i don't think as long as he's the standard bearer um but i think it can be turned around pretty easily which is just simply you know we all occupy titles that have leadership in their name to some level in the description or in the word and part of that contract we make with people that elect us is yeah you got to do things to get elected you know you gotta you gotta you gotta win but at the same time we all we also have to lead and part of leading is telling the truth senator murkowski's great she always has been she tells the truth and she's taken a lot of heat for that and you know for people that claim that basically they're doing this for religious reasons or whatever in terms of trying to overthrow an election i would remind every one of them that went to sunday school one of the first lessons you ever learned was that telling the truth matters no matter what the consequences well everybody knows in the republican party that occupy a position like congressman or senator that donald trump lost they know that but they won't say it either because they can raise money on the lie or because they're too scared to say the truth and they or you know any of those another they're cowards but that's the truth and it's it's very basic and a self-governance compact cannot last in this country if truth doesn't exist or doesn't matter can you shed any light on these three new subpoenas including a former white house official who helped draft the former presidential rally speech on january 6 also to advisers to donald trump jr i don't know i mean i was surprised he has advisors but what information is the committee seeking from them and and is there a way to get closer to the former president's thinking that day i think so and you know all of this is is part of again this this idea if you have a puzzle and you pull all the pieces out you don't necessarily know what the picture is until you start putting it together so every one of these people we're talking to and particularly this batch of subpoenas is about what are the pieces of donald trump's thinking of maybe when he was talking about the speech that we can get so that we can make this broader picture so are they going to be the silver bullet maybe maybe not but they can certainly shed light on this broader picture which is going to be important to present to the american people your colleague chairman benny thompson told cnn today that the committee plans to try to seek information from rudy giuliani at some point would that mean actually calling him to to testify it certainly could i mean obviously rudy was in a lot of those conversations we see in after the fact reporting he was you know actively pressing the president on these conspiracies and and convincing him and you know worming his way into these meetings so he'll have some information i fully expect he probably won't be super cooperative but again congress has ways to compel that and we have ways to ensure that he's telling the truth under oath but it's it for me it's been sad to watch you know rudy giuliani go from being america's mayor after 9 11 to this conspiracy driven power at any cost person and i certainly want to know what's in his thinking and what he knows about the president according to the um the the new york times though there's reporting by the new york times that that vice president mike pence uh is now upset i guess about the you know reports about cooperation of of his allies uh there's been reporting mark short and and others around vice president pence have cooperated and do you have any sense of his willingness now to to cooperate willingly uh with with the the the investigation look all you know all i know is what what's been reported what you said you know all indications his team has been cooperative and it's not like this is necessarily a good anya although you know we can say good for doing it but the reality is you have to you have to you have to cooperate i mean that's the the law the the subpoena from congress for instance has the force of law it's the same as if you got subpoenaed from court um so you know if the vice president's losing a desire to cooperate i certainly hope that changes but we'll get the information we need and we'll pursue whatever lead we need to pursue uh thank you so much for joining us i know uh just on a personal note that that you have a new addition to your family coming very soon any day now and i just wish you the best to you and your family thank you i appreciate

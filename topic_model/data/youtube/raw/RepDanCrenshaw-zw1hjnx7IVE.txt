we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw welcome back folks pushing out another podcast in short order here because um like i think it's important to talk about this issue with israel and palestine and uh you know peace in the middle east and um this is just a situation that infatuates the world uh there's there's there's almost a romanticism to it it's um it's so long-standing there's so much history to it it's so complex and despite that complexity it seems very easy for people who know very little about the situation to take a very strong stances uh in this situation and and those strong stances have increased over time i put on social media today the best way to understand this is is is is through the lens of victims and oppressors or at least that's the way many on the left wants you to understand it i don't think that's actually the way to understand this in reality it's far more complicated and that's why i'm putting out this episode uh i again have on on the podcast uh one of my staff who shall not be named we'll call him kevin uh he's a real expert on this stuff so we're gonna have a great conversation we're gonna dive into what happened recently uh why these rocket attacks are happening what the conflict actually is right now but then we're gonna we're gonna go down a few layers and help you understand the history of this um and it is complicated i've taken a couple trips to israel at this point and gotten the best of the best uh information and you know so i've gotten pretty well read on the issue and it's still i i still feel like i'm just scratching the surface and um we'll we'll try to scratch that surface a little bit more today but look if you wonder why so many of your kind-hearted left-wing friends always seem to take the side of the palestinians well it's because they view everything through the lens of victims and oppressors this is there's this belief that palestinians are are eternal victims and that the israelis are eternal oppressors now this isn't the only place that that sort of optic plays out for the left right you see it on our border you know you you had aoc comparing the israeli-palestinian situation to the u.s and our border crisis now there's a lot to unpack there but it goes to show you how they see things all right the blm riots throughout the entirety of 2020 this was fundamentally about spinning a narrative that there are oppressors and that there are victims and that you must be in either category unless you're on the left then you get to be the champion of the victims this makes them feel good this helps you understand i think why this has become so popular on college campuses and in democrat circles to be cheering for palestinians now the problem is again truth gets in the way of this and it is not necessarily true that just because you are are smaller and weaker that you have some kind of moral high ground and that's a really important point and that's we're going to unpack i think for through the rest of this episode uh kevin thanks for being back on um can you give us an update on on what you're hearing you follow this stuff really closely where are we right now in israel this has been going on for three days we'll get to why it started here in a second but what's the current status out there so as of right now there there's been right under 2 000 rockets uh fired from gaza into israel um so that's the main thing that a lot of people are hearing about so these rockets range from homemade improvised weapons that they take a pipe attach tail fins improvise an explosive and shoot it these don't have a lot of range but what's really unique about what's happening now with this current rocket garage isn't just the intensity of it but it's some of the armaments that are being used more advanced rocket systems not to mention drones um so loitering munitions as they're called so what these are is their their kamikaze drones which are piloted are able to linger over a target um they're able to be moved by the pilot and and strike so these drones look very similar to an iranian product that they've been putting out and that they've been sending to their proxies um in yemen uh shia militias in uh syria and iraq so so that's the indirect fire aspects going on the israeli response has been to target hamas leadership um operative infrastructure such as rocket launching sites caches intelligence facilities and recently so so that's mainly been done by the iaf the israeli air force but last night the idf the ground component joined in and they moved to the gaza border now there was a little bit of uh some clumsy tweeting which led um a lot of people to think that a ground operation into gaza had begun but what's really happened is now it's been opened up with um some artillery fire um that has been used to target what's called uh gaza metro so um thinking of a metro as an underground tunnel system that you used to get around that's exactly what it is in gaza except here it's used for a bit more nefarious purposes um i i read a story i read a story that that um that sloppy tweeting might have been purposeful uh in order to to get um hamas leadership to basically sequester themselves into that tunnel system so that israelis could more properly strike military targets that those military personnel as opposed to um other places where you might kill more civilians and then and then that might have been an information operation intended to do that i have no idea read one story about it i don't know what your thoughts are on that no i mean i i think that's very possible uh i mean it's things aren't just done by the seat of their pants um you know things aren't done without thought um they're usually very good about their plans and how they do it and then also when they're done with this operation they'll go through and they'll do a proper aar where they'll do an after-action review where they go through and look all right what did we what was our intent did we achieve it what can we do better what um what should we sustain and continue to do so so while it looks sloppy yeah i want to discount that opinion um also i wanna also know just just some numbers for people this is what i have most recently hamas has killed seven israeli civilians and injured more than five hundred uh i don't have the numbers here on how many uh how many hamas leadership has has been killed and potentially how many civilians have been killed in gaza but it's also important to note that about 300 of the rockets that hamas has launched have fallen within gaza itself injuring and killing gaza and civilians what will happen oftentimes is they'll blame israel for that they'll take a bunch of pictures of it they'll even they'll bring in toys they'll put them on the scene and then they'll take pictures of it and send it out and our wonderful college activists um here back in america you know they they believe it they take it all in hook line and sinker uh just important to know these these are just strategies there's plenty of evidence for this uh and and people have to know this when you're when you're assessing what's going on here um i won't also quickly paint a picture geographically for people when you're looking at israel um uh let's see it it's you know it's in sort of a i don't know like a what what shape would you describe israel in look it's like a it's like a pointy melon kind of okay and on the west side of it there's there's the uh the mediterranean sea gaza is situated in that southwest corner okay it's a it is blocked off it is it is like an island within israel it's it it's on the coast it's in that southwest corner it's important to note that gaza is run by hamas and the west bank which is also the palestinian territory is separate from that there's nothing linking these two places uh there's okay israel is is in between them both the west bank is where the palestinian authority uh has control we're going to get into some internal politics within the palestinian uh politics uh here shortly as well i think that's also important for people to know i just want to paint that picture so people understand what we're talking about when we're talking about gaza and also important to note lebanon is to the north of israel because we're going to talk about what hezbollah has been doing as well hezbollah is the iranian proxy group that is lebanese uh they are shia muslims that's why they are an iranian proxy group uh and it turns out that israel has also been taking some rocket fire from syria which is also to the north and east of uh israel borders and the golan when you hear the golan heights that's their border with syria okay i hope that pull out a map if you listen to this podcast and just just i think look at it because it'll just be much easier to follow along because i want this to also be a you know just a good a one-stop shop for a quick everything you need to know about what's going on in israel right now anyway uh kevin keep keep keep going as far as current situation anything else to add well if i if i could add to what you're talking about the geography of it something that's hard for a lot of americans who haven't been there and as a texan especially um that's hard to understand is how compact it is so you can rent a car at ben gurion airport which is not not dead center but pretty center of israel you drive two and a half hours three hours to the north and you can be on the in matula which is on the border with lebanon or you could be in the golan heights which is on the border with syria um you turn in the other direction and you drive south from ben gurion again and within four hours you're down in a a lot if you look to your east you have jordan and saudi arabia if you look to your west you have egypt and the sinai peninsula so it's a small country but not just is it a small country but jerusalem the capital of israel and ramallah where the pa is based the palestinian authority has their main headquarters as a crow flies those are 10 miles apart so we're not talking about a huge geographic area we're talking about somewhere where um you can easily get to and from so yeah so and you mentioned something else before when you were talking about the the hamas rockets that have fallen within gaza and that have um injured and killed gazans well two of the victims uh in israel were israeli arabs were muslim israeli arabs so hamas is saying that they're fighting to liberate um muslims they're fighting to liberate arabs but at the same time they're killing them so that's an important thing to understand is that while a lot of times we talk about the battlefield that's just one of the domains in this fight um where the idf and hamas will exchange fire and there it's clear that israel is far superior but where there's closer parity is in hamas's understanding of the media and political aspects right oh they're they're amazing propagandists excellent this is probably a good time to talk about this this sort of myth or proportionality before we get to the so people were listening let's talk about the the the myths of disproportionate response then i want to get to the background of this particular situation then we'll go into a deeper dive of the history of israel how it was formed and and and why these basically what it's like six families that are possibly being evicted uh in east jerusalem and how that supposedly led to this whole thing but there's there's a lot more to it than that so but let's talk about this myth of disproportionate response um we were talking about it before the podcast and i think it's important for people to note because if you know nothing about warfare and if you nothing no nothing about tactics you've never been shot at um it's it's easy to believe that that there's some moral authority granted to someone with uh less military capability than you but this isn't true and we need to think a little bit deeper about this and about about what is happening about who is doing what and uh and kevin like you you pointed out something really really good it was like okay let's let's take your let's take this comment about a disproportionate response to your logical conclusion if what you're asking for is a proportionate response then what you're saying is that israel should just lob about 2 000 rockets in a non-discriminant fashion on gaza that would be the proportionate response now of course they don't do that they take every possible measure to avoid civilian casualties um i think it's also worth noting you know when you when you instigate conflict um it's what kind of what kind of response might you expect and that's just that's just brushed over so quickly in liberal media it's very very unfair to the situation look we do it we do it here in the united states also right when we're having riots in the streets because there's a there's another police shooting before anyone asks what led up to that police shooting now it doesn't always mean that that police shooting or the police action was justified but at least we should ask the question and try to put yourself in that situation on what you would do and there just doesn't seem to be a lot of that critical thinking with respect to the situation yeah absolutely and i think that comes from a very simplistic understanding or just a pure lack of understanding of proportionality um because i i mean i guess in a sense it is kind of a a a term that's more jargon when we're actually talking about law than just when we're using it um generally in everyday speeds because what proportionality actually comes down to is damage versus advantage so so it comes down to is the amount of damage that this strike will cause acceptable given the military advantage that this would provide um so it's not that simplistic well if you should have me with a rifle then i can only shoot at you with the rifle so so there's a lot of pure misunderstandings in um that that need to be corrected on that and you're exactly right with the with if we if we keys that out to its logical conclusion that means israel stops using precision-guided munitions yeah so it doesn't you know and like with this conversation overseas and our own wars that we fight in iraq and afghanistan you know clearly we're in a sense we're fighting against um like if you want me to use a proportionate response against the taliban well then again by by logical implication you want me to lay ieds indiscriminately everywhere of course we're not going to do that you know that's so you know it's it's just warfare is far more complicated than people realize and um let me add one more thing to the current situation they're a little bit worried that the iron so the iron dome is basically a uh interceptor a missile interceptor system um that that tracks incoming rockets and sends up an interceptor and destroys them very effective but there's only so many interceptors available you know there is some worry that we might run out uh in israel do you have any extra comments on that yeah so the the iron dome is an amazing piece of technology i think anybody who's been on social media have probably seen some of the videos of the interceptors going up to um to destroy these rockets so it's a lot of people may remember the patriot missile system and and the gulf war and how those were used to take out studs um iron dome is like patriot on steroids for far less money so it's an actual network that tracks um trajectory speed um point of launch and so they're able to determine where it will land with that data and so if it's threatening a population center in israel they'll launch one of the iron dome interceptors which i believe the patriot patriot missile was something in the millions of dollars um iron dome is um the estimates range twenty to a hundred thousand dollars per interceptor so there's still an asymmetry when we talk about asymmetry of cost when we talk about improvised rockets yeah um but that's the extent that they're willing to go to is launch these um these iron dome systems so with days of sustained rocket fire from from gaza um israel's having to dip into their supply so with when right before we got on this podcast and i got a tweet notification about um missiles fired from syria um if there's a second front open like what happened in 2006 when israel was fighting both hamas and hezbollah that could really strain israel's supply and another thing to talk about when we talk about the israeli response i'd encourage anybody listening if you don't have it you can go to your app store download red alert so so it's an app that is a lot of israelis have on their phone um you set your notifications on and it will alert you anytime a red alert goes off in the country so if you just in the comfort of your home here in the united states and you have that and you hear it going off pretty much non-stop at times you can kind of better understand what's happening in israel and then you'll also see that the number of rockets shot um into israel there's actually a lot of patience displayed by the israelis when they're not in an active barrage yeah i mean i mean imagine imagine you're in a county like houston's large county um and imagine our our neighboring county is uh lobbing rockets into us that's what you're dealing with in america would never let that stand well i don't know anything's possible under this administration but i think generally speaking we we would not let that stand and we would take care of that problem real quick okay if there was a bunch of rockets being lobbed over from from tijuana or juarez you think we'd we would have zero patience for that um the the amount of patience by so let me let me say something else real quick the on is you know i try to you know play devil's advocate here so if there's if there's one of our favorite college activists is still sitting there and listening listening to this podcast amazingly and i thank you for it if you are and you're like you're screaming at the uh at your put your headphones because you're like no dan i don't mean that by disproportionality i mean palestinians are out there protesting you know exercising a first amendment right and then they just get mowed down by by israeli guards and soldiers they just get killed they're just throwing stones and they get killed for it now but is this true i mean i don't know i think it never has happened um but it's i don't i don't believe it's true this time um what is what is the ground truth on this uh is that really happening and where does this belief come from from the american left that this kind of injustice happens all the time i wish i had an answer but i don't have a clue because you can look at how look at even the palestinian authority who's the more quote unquote moderate of the two when you when you talk about hamas and patha so even looking at fatah and the in the pa compared to israel so in in 2015 and 2016 there some people called it the nifentafada but there were a bunch of stabbings going on throughout the country in jerusalem in tel aviv uh taylor force a u.s veteran who was over in israel studying and the the taylor force act is named after him which puts much more severe restrictions on usaid to the palestinian authority because how they treat their people who kill civilians if if you kill if you're a palestinian and you kill an israeli civilian um and let's say you live you go to jail your family will then get a stipend um that's largely called the pay for slay program um and it's colloquial terms so if you kill someone we'll pay you for it and depending on how long you go to jail for um the longer you go the more we'll pay you so your family's getting taken care of and guess what you may have a street named after you you may have a square in the town named after you no no now the palestinian authority but the palestinian authority denies this right they say that's a myth and we're just giving people welfare right so that's their argument but but does that create a sentence an incident or a difference in them right right the fact is is whatever you call it the money's still going there and it's it's um it's directly related to this to this action yeah exactly and and a large part of that is because of con and not get into palestinian politics just yet but a major concern that the palestinians have is the corruption of the pa um but you look at how the palestinians treat the palestinian authority treats palestinians who kill israelis but then you look on the other side go back to 2015 and 2016 the knife and tifada which is why i mentioned it um an israeli soldier in hebron shot a palestinian who was currently who had been restrained already and the judges found that this person didn't pose a threat you illegally killed him so the israelis will actually enforce the laws of war on their fighters on the idf soldiers right so and that's just when we talk about war now if you want to talk about the differences between a palestinian who lives in israel um whether it be in in jaffa nazareth in the north and a palestinian who lives in ramallah from what you hear it's both of them are being persecuted um they don't have rights there's no freedom well guess what the the the arab the palestinian who lives in jaffa who lives in nazareth um they get a vote in regularly scheduled free and fair elections um well and and in israel with israeli politics it's been a lot of elections in the past couple years but they get to go vote they get to go have their voices heard and guess what in the knesset the israeli parliament there are arab representatives there are muslim arab representatives on the israeli supreme court there are muslim arabs on the israeli supreme court there's rule of law in israel there's freedom of the press now they're a little bit different but if you go into the west bank in gaza well mahmoud abbas the president of the palestinian authority he's in the 16th year of his four-year term he hasn't held elections because he knew he was going to lose so you don't get to vote in free and fair elections um i mentioned the major concern in the palestinian authority is corruption well there's a lot of corruption because there's no rule of law it depends on what family you're from how well connected you are um in arabic do you have the wasta who do you know um there's no free press you if you want to put something out that's opposed to the palestinian authority and god forbid hamas because if we want to talk about people killing gaza um try to be a palestinian in gaza who speaks out against hamas you're not going to last very long no that ain't going to happen so let's it's kind of nuts when people when people try to group it all in together because that one line separating them has maybe the the the arabs who enjoy the most freedom in the middle east in israel yeah it's very possibly true um it's not to say there's not problems i mean like you know with with some opportunity especially in east jerusalem but there's a lot of amazing i've traveled there a few times a lot of amazing groups trying to it's i i would say the problems are similar to to problems that you see in a lot of western countries uh with downtrodden neighborhoods versus more uh well-to-do neighborhoods and um you know it's you know there's more complicated than that i i i understand that but when you compare it to being in a in say in the west bank as you alluded to you know in ramallah it's a very very different place and um it's just not what people think it is and you know i would just this this podcast is about getting folks to open their open their minds a little bit to what's really going on let's talk about this week's situation so so there's there's a couple different i think um sources of conflict here um on the surface it seems the current round of hostilities goes back to this uh this neighborhood in east jerusalem sheikh jarrah where six palestinian families may be evicted due to a court order so these families were given their homes by the jordanian government after 1948 when the families fled their homes during the israeli war of independence prior to the war the homes had been owned by jews since 1967 there's been a legal process leading to the current situation which is now before the israel supreme court um also happening but also distinct from is what i just said there is probably so confusing if you don't know any history about israel we'll try to we'll try to unpack a little bit of that for you here in a little bit distinct from this but everything's related the al-aqsa mosque that's been a scene of violence as hamas's stoked tensions and and and muslims have begun stockpiling weapons in al-aqsa mosque it's important to note if you see pictures of israel and the old city in jerusalem you see everybody praying against the western wall that big wall you've seen our presidents often visit there this is an extremely holy site um it's called the temple mount uh it is it is it has long been in in jewish history it has been uh multiple times throughout history and it is is the holiest of the holiest places now and the reason there's so much tension there is because there is al-aqsa mosque right on top of the temple mount it was built there on purpose and so if you understand how how long this goes back to and and kevin you'll you'll be able to to unpack that history just a little bit better than i do but just laying the groundwork here a lot of tension there but they're stuck buying weapons in this mosque okay this mosque is near the big golden dome you see in pictures a lot that's the dome of the rock also a muslim holy site that's not what we're talking about all aksam mosque is near that okay so this leads to israeli police moving in force um uh into uh to to deal with this uh i guess weapons caches and leads to violent clashes on the temple mount as palestinians are throwing stones shooting fireworks and israeli police attempt to disperse the crowds with tear gas okay that's that's there's no shooting going on all right that's it's terri i believe that looks like a proportional response um violence has come to a high point as um as muslims are concluding their celebration of the night of power so it is ramadan marking the day the quran was revealed to muhammad and at the same time you got below the temple mount on the western wall again it's below the temple mount because that's as close as jews can get to their holy site because the the top of it is is is um only for muslims uh so below the temple mount at the western wall israelis uh mostly the orthodox religious zionists they begin celebrating their jerusalem day this is when jerusalem was reunited in 1967. a lot of history behind that so between the evictions um between these other outbursts you you you see this escalation happening uh hamas issues an ultimatum says israel needs to withdraw by a certain time or it's going to begin a rocket barrage withdraw from where kevin what exactly were they demanding the demand withdraw from the temple mount yeah they were demanding that israeli police move off the temple mount um because sorry to add another layer of complexity to this um and there's already been a lot of dates but so in 1967 when jerusalem was reunited which is what the israelis at the western wall were celebrating um there was a lot of uh moshe diane the minister of defense the guy with the ipad exactly he didn't really know what to do quick quick quick story quick story so last uh not last time a couple times ago i was in israel and uh it was purim purim is a holiday that looks a lot like halloween um now it's it is a religious holiday i asked one of my jewish friends at the time what does purim mean why do you celebrate it he's like like most of our celebrations it's a time when everybody tried to kill us and we survived so we celebrate okay got it that's basically every jewish holiday um and uh and i so i just wore an eye patch uh to try it because i didn't have a costume or anything it looks like halloween and everybody's like uh moshe diane got it i was like oh this is perfect i'm the old minister of defense for israel anyway keep going yeah so so um melissa diane he didn't really want the temple mount to be taken um because it would create political constraints and political problems because he recognized how holy it was um so when the temple mount was taken um and and he arrives on scene he tried to defuse the situation to make it known like look we're not conquering this um you know as as we're not turning this from a jewish site uh into a jewish site from uh from an islamic site um the israeli connects it within i think two months passed a law to respect the holy places and so even though it was under their military power the state of israel never kicked muslims off in fact they allowed the temple mount to continue to be administered by the islamic waco that's like a charitable trust which is funded by the jordanian so you can go on to the temple mount if you're christian or if you're jewish but you cannot prey on the temple mount so israel is responsible for the security of the temple mount but the actual administration um day-to-day is by the islamic walk-up and they've been known to if um if they do is on the temple mount and closes his his eyes and they can they think he's mumbling a prayer they'll kick them off if you're a christian and you bring your bible you open it up they'll kick you off if you're thumbing your rosary beats they'll kick you off so when it comes to terms of worship it's purely an islamic site so so that's what's unique about it so hamas demand was that israel stop imposing secure stop insuring security on the temple mount so they make that ultimatum but in the days leading up to the outburst of violence more than normal people on the temple mount during ramadan as the night of power and eid approached were forming into groups with hamas flags and and chanting anti-anti-israel pro-um pro-hamas slogan and and trying to rile people up and they were largely successful and this is part of the propaganda techniques that that are used look instigate some kind of conflict uh get it going knowing full well that on on the world stage you can make it look like you can make yourself look like the victim and they've got this down to a science i mean i mentioned before they're they're how quick they are with with social media bringing toys to to bombing sites they've done this in the past i don't know if they've done it this time um but it is but it is a um a tactic used they're experts at this um and maybe maybe at this point too we go we go backwards in time you know let's unpack this whole story with six palestinian families being evicted due to a court order so the families given the homes by the jordanian government after 1948. so what happened in 1948 well um this was the this was the time period where um the british decided to pull out of what was then called palestine and agreed to um to give the jews a homeland is that is that is that the correct technical way to say what was happening there yeah um yeah so it's it's a little bit complicated um so everything is with this of course of course so so prior to 1948 so the british government expressed support for a jewish homeland in palestine um the the british this was during world war one um when the jews were aligning with um some arabs in the in the arabian peninsula and it was all to fight the ottomans so i won't go too far back and delve too deep into that but after the war in the ottomans lost the british had control of mandatory palestine they ended up splitting off what is now jordan to become a purely arab state um as the british empire started declining world war ii comes about um britain was trying to look for the britain was trying to look for a way to extract itself um from its colonial holdings and empire so during this time you had a lot of um you you had the creation of a zionist movement um where european jews were looking to get out of europe to go to a place where they could be jews and not suffer persecution um a lot of it was spurred um spurred on by the driver's affair a whole thing about a jewish french general who was accused of treason um for nothing other than being jewish um so this was even pre-holocaust so you had a lot of you had a lot of inflow of european jews um into mandatory palestine um as the british were trying to figure out what to do and to leave when they decided to leave they're like how do we do this in a delicate way real quick it's it's important to note it's it people have this idea that it's during world war ii you have you know millions of jews all of a sudden appearing in in a in a palestinian homeland this is not the case that this for a long long long time jewish families have been moving into this territory and this is a very very gradual process that basically just came to a head uh in 1948 yeah absolutely so in fact um the the british actually did not allow european jews who had just been freed from concentration camps to enter into mandatory palestine they they redirected boats to uh to i forget if it was cyprus or crete and put them in refugee holding camps and that's because they didn't want the balance in the land to be to a skew um so there have been some recommendations that look these populations need to be separated um land swaps trades british really didn't come to a solution um who came to a solution was the u.n the u.n voted in favor of creating a jewish homeland in an arab homeland so leading up to this vote there was a bit of a civil war with arabs and jews fighting each other in what is now israel um after the vote and actually today may 14th 1948 is the day that israel declared well today is not may 14th 1948 um but on may 14th 1948 that's when israel actually declared its independence by the jewish calendar or by the western calendar so after israel declared its independence full-fledged war broke out um this new country that just said we are our own thing now was then attacked by egypt jordan syria lebanon um iraqi soldiers came so you had this small country this small new country that was facing the weight of the arab world so as this happened you had a lot of populations um so when the u.n said this will be israeli or this will be jewish this will be arab those areas weren't exclusively arab weren't exclusively jewish so you had a lot of people start moving into the areas that were going to be quote unquote theirs well then with the break out of a full-fledged war you had people fleeing war which is what people do if you're not fighting right so you had a lot of population movement you had a lot of displaced people and it was going in both directions yeah so yeah yeah and that's interesting and and it's important to note that's what people mean by the refugee camps so when you when people talk about the refugee camps in the in the west bank by the way when you go to these these aren't camps by any stretch they're just neighborhoods and what they are what they're referring to is people who left their homes after that conflict in 1948 these are descendants of them that's what they mean by refugees okay and it's just it's just and you can you can still have an opinion one way or the other on what that means but i just want to paint the right picture for people on what they mean by because you hear the word refugee and you think tent city you think these people were just displaced as their as their homes were bulldozed five months ago by israeli bulldozers it's just not true and uh but that's that's the picture painted and i bet if i asked uh your again your average college activist that's what they would think is true but it's not true yeah absolutely they may have started off as camp um but they are full they're they're sitting you if you unless you were told or unless you see the umrah the um the signage that the u.n puts up for their uh refugee works agency right um you want to be able to tell the difference right i've driven through these places right there exactly well and what's interesting is that that and sorry not to not not the side track too much but on the other side of that refugee coin are the millions of jews who had to leave the arab world right to come to israel so um baghdad um huge jewish population some people say it was up to a third of the population of baghdad was jewish they had to get up and leave and come to israel um so so there's two sides to the refugee argument um but not not to get too off topic but yeah so when the war broke out a jewish family or six jewish families who were living in these homes that are now at the center of this legal battle shekjara was not going to be an israeli-controlled territory so they left um there were six arab families who left what was going to be in israel um they came to the west bank which after the war um the west bank as we know it is was under jordanian control so they these families came and the jordanians put them up in these houses um so you had six families in these houses which up to them had been bought and paid for by jewish families that's 1948 you fast forward to 1967 and the six day war happened israel takes full control of the west bank to include east jerusalem and now they are back in control of these six houses let's let's let's rewind a little bit so the six day war happens because everybody decides to invade israel right yeah so it's important to know because this story was being told on the new york times podcast today and they just rush right past the fact that the arab world was trying to destroy israel during this time and that's why there was a war in the first place and that's why they had that that's why this this uh basically redrawing of lines occurred it just goes to show how dishonest our mainstream media is about this and why so many americans are so deeply misinformed about it but anyway yeah it can continue so the six day war happens yeah and they'll also say well it was a preemptive strike which is true israeli intelligence was it was seen um the egyptians the syrians and the jordanians were matching their forces um and they were intercepting signals intelligence talking about the plans for battle and so israel decided all right before they can put their planes in the air and establish air dominance we're going to take their planes off the chessboard um so they they knew that they were going to be attacked and rather than sitting back and waiting they acted because the the survival of the state was on the line um so they attacked they won um the west bank east jerusalem it was now under israeli control um israeli administration there's a lot of discussion how do we deal with this what do we do do we give it back do we keep it do we establish full control do we annex it well you have this issue of these six houses so the jewish families who live there now they could actually have a legal recourse so they started legal proceedings um i don't know if it was 1967 or 68 but it was around the time that they actually could start legal proceedings well interesting 2021 jewish jewish families started the legal proceedings those jewish families won those six houses before right yeah okay just make sure it's all clear it's been a long legal battle which is now pending before the supreme court of israel um so they're trying to so uh stoke up this safe check jara um like it's a huge wide wide scale evictions in repopulation um so yeah so there's a bit more to it than just the uh hashtag yeah well there yeah i mean there's because there's i guess in the worst case scenario for palestinians and arabs living in east jerusalem this would set legal precedent for any descendants jewish descendants who used to be in those homes to now be able to take them over right would that be the argument well and there's also some concern on the israeli side that this could set a precedent for the officer to retake their home right right so that's why it's very it's very it's a very unique and um it's a very complex situation did we just have they decided to evict these palestinian families yet or no that's still not decided no it it it's still pending okay and that so that supreme court decision has not taken place yet not to my knowledge no okay so so yeah so it's still something that's in the works it's still something that that may be happening um so so yeah so that people are pointing to that as the catalyst um but really going back to people using that and then hamas stoking the riot and the the demonstrations on the temple mount and i said hamas doesn't usually do that they do have a presence they will be active but the degree to which they were active was unique so i would say actually that the reason that what's happening right now with hamas is because of what happened on april 30th when the palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas declared that the parliamentary and presidential elections which were set for later this month are going to yet again be delayed this is the same mahmoud abbas who as i said earlier is 16 years into a four-year term so hamas i believe is looking at this through electoral terms because polling of palestinians um shows that if hamas tries to hang on to power um it it could bode well for the lead the political leader of amma uh hamas uh ismael hamiyah so it's all electoral or at least a large component of it is electoral hamas is looking at this and saying i can appear tough i can appear to stand up to the israelis and i can win palestinian votes by killing israelis yeah and that's another thing people don't understand about this dynamic there are um these two factions within the palestinian people hamas which is an outright terrorist organization has um lots of uh support from iran i think we should move on to how iran fits into all this here in a minute um and then you have the palestinian authority um so um i think that the palestinian authority is is what you gen people generally recognize as sort of a somewhat more legitimate government of palestine for mahmoud abbas um and and before him um like why is his name escaping me yes sir fat right every you know i'm sure everybody would recognize that uh figure if you saw him um you know he's part of the famous uh camp camp david peace of course all of these peace accords that ended up really going nowhere that might be a whole different podcast on you know how you actually solve this problem whether it's a one-state or two-state solution or status quo whatever it is um but what is interesting about these um well actually let me let me pause there that the one question i have for you kevin maybe you have an answer to this is polling amongst palestinian people um how do they generally feel are they pretty are are they are they susceptible to the hamas argument that the only the only way is to is to fight and exterminate the jewish homeland uh or are is there a growing number that are sick of it um and want some kind of peace is it split what what's your take on that so it fluctuates i i've been watching i i look at occasionally a a certain site palestinian center for policy and survey research and they do topical polls so the the poll that i'm looking at uh the most recent poll that stuff is from march and it's asking about the mayhem so back in 2015 and 2016 when the knife intifada when these stabbing attacks were occurring they would pull palestinians on is this legitimate is this just is this right so what you generally see in in the palestinian electorate and i'm not an expert here by any means i just kind of look out look at polls now and then and try to pay a little bit more attention to most people but but i think what you see is you have a hardcore um all hamas wing all hamas never fatah if you will and they are 100 in i i don't want to assign a numerical value to it um but then on the other side you have the never hamas fatah wing who are largely people who benefit from the current situation um because you mentioned going up to ramallah and actually seeing the reality um there there's quite a few mansions and villas yeah yeah people should understand that in the west bank i mean i was there i wasn't sure what to expect to be honest and um what's interesting by the way is israelis have did need very very special permission to get into the west bank it's very rare um there are there are some groups um you know for us some members of congress but i also went when i was at harvard and um and uh to me just having spent a lot of time in the middle east it just looked like another middle eastern city there wasn't it wasn't i guess what people imagine again everything needs to be needs to be observed in context and i happen to have a lot of perspective in context because i've spent so much time all over the middle east i know what normal looks like this looks very normal to me there's a lot of trash everywhere uh they don't clean it up um and uh there's a lot of mansions there's a lot of nice cars and there's a lot of poverty it's um it's a typical middle eastern city so uh yeah important for people to know uh we ate at restaurants like there's normal restaurants there's places to shop um you know again it's not kfc in ramallah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's not uncommon yeah right they uh there's a lot of things like that uh that yeah your western eyes would recognize so just trying to paint a picture here um for for people uh but i interrupted you where were you going with that thought or did you oh yes i mean like everything you have people on the extremes uh the people who benefit from the status quo of the trade and then this goes back to the corruption issue in palestinian politics um and then you've got a lot of people who in the middle who it fluctuates it varies a lot um so let's let's move on yeah let's move on to iran um so one of the uh key trademarks of the trumpet let's talk geopolitics for a second here so under the trump administration gets no credit for this but massive successes uh when it comes to the so-called unattainable peace in the middle east and what do people mean by peace in the middle east look i don't think we got peace in the middle east obviously uh usually what people mean by that is is some kind of accord between the palestinians and the israelis we haven't gotten that yet but what the trump administration did get which is amazing was various peace accords between arab states and israel this was always thought to be totally impossible and um turns out it's not because look and as i put it on social media today not even the arabs buy this oppressor victim narrative anymore they don't look behind closed doors they they really never have uh but now they're saying it openly and part of the reason was twofold one the united states under president trump finally took a a very clear position very clear positions are very useful in geopolitics uh and he took a very clear one here a pro-israeli stance we're not we're not going to put up with the lies that that that the palestinian authority is putting forth that hamas is putting forth we're not going to put up with it anymore we're also going to take a very hard stance against iran we're not giving an inch anymore okay that's very clear it sends a very clear signal now to keep keep in mind that the general conflict in the middle east is between sunni and shia muslims okay shia represented these are just different sects of of islam you know it's i think it's derived from from who um from descendants of muhammad and who's not a descendant of muhammad that's basically the division maybe some other things it doesn't make a lot of sense to westerners but look it means a lot to muslims and shia islam is represented by iran for the most part sunni islam is represented by saudi arabia this is why these two are foes in a geopolitical sense um all other arab states are are sunni um except for lebanon is very mixed um and uh iraq is majority shia iraq is majority shia but but but a lombard province in the west is all sunni uh but yeah the population centers in the east are all shia so um but for them all the gulf arab states all the rich oil states those are um those are all sunni uh yemen is mostly sunni but there's you know the um the houthi rebels iran supports them they're shia anyway the point is is that this is how this conflict always materializes so um iran likes to iran is incredibly skilled at supporting surrogates in in their type of warfare and then and then their type of let's call them asymmetric operations they're very good at this and they do it all over the region and when they're told and look we saw this after the first first time president obama signed the jcpoa which is the iran nuclear deal and immediately what was happening was additional funding towards the al-qud's force the iranian revolutionary guard the irgc this this is their special operations units okay and they're very good at surrogate warfare uh those surrogates all over the region are run by these um by these units so a lot of funding went there that means a lot of funding to hamas now hamas is sunni but if but it fits the geopolitical purposes of iran because iran hates the jews the most right they hate sunnis but they really hate the jews and so the enemy of your enemy is your friend i guess or did i say that right you know what i mean um so they support hamas via rockets uh kevin you were noting that earlier with the drones these these high-priced drones which we've seen throughout the region these are clearly have ties to iran um iran's other probably major and most capable force is hezbollah so that's the shia group shia muslim group within lebanon lebanon is split between christian groups hezbollah and sunni right um that that's and when i exposed some secular society lebanon's a whole other podcast but um but it but it matters for the sake of the conversation about israel because hezbollah hezbollah's strongholds are in the south of lebanon right on the border with israel and hezbollah hates israelis and hates jews so that's just painting the picture here real quick in the middle east and my point is this when you start talking about removing sanctions from iran you embolden them and you you encourage them to start spending money that they thought they wouldn't have earlier but now they think they will have it and they start becoming emboldened they don't think that the brighton administration is going to be hard on them they don't think that the but that biden would ever order a strike on solomoni and and reinvoke that sense of deterrence remember we talked about this at length uh geez who knows these like a year and a half ago was that when that happened um the my the reason i was so in favor of that was because we re-established deterrence and in a sense that's what israel has to do on a daily basis is re-establish some sense of deterrence and escalation dominance um you know that gets back into a more a more honest discussion about proportionality that's what's happening with iran right now they're becoming more emboldened they're sending weapons everywhere again they send them to their surrogate network they they send them in these basically little fishing vessels all over the place and i remember trying to track these so um do you have anything to add to that uh that i tried to paint the broad strokes there i bet you found a few things you'd want to comment on yeah so you mentioned iran um sending armament so uh i think it was earlier this week video from the fifth fleet of uh of a ship um they were they were doing a flag check and they they literally found a boatload of weapons uh we're talking about small arms uh rockets that were going to the houthis but another interesting thing that a lot of people don't understand too is that when iran in 1979 with the islamic revolution prior to that iran was an ally of the u.s and israel um even so they had a bunch of our f-16s f4 they had a bunch of our armaments well after 1979 and these are things that we sold to them that as allies have partnered um that's what we did well after 1979 and sanctions we we cut them off so a lot of advanced technology needs maintenance so tapping into the human capital of the persian people um the iranian regime figured out how to reverse engineer a lot of these things so they had to figure out how to build the equipment that actually keeps f-16 from 1979 still in the air today um so i say that to say that in a place like gaza when we talked about the blockade well how do they get this stuff in well it's pretty difficult but that knowledge that iran has of how to fabricate and manufacture your own weapons now instead of having to send these drones they send schematics so we've seen that in our own wars too i mean with the um efps yep um basically what is it explosively formed penetrators it basically it's it's it's very easy once you understand the physics behind it very easy to do in some you know maintenance shop in iraq because you're basically just molding a uh a copper plate in a certain way putting some homemade explosives behind it and boom that thing can punch a hole through a armored truck um same with the ieds you know the dirt farmers taliban and afghanistan weren't going to figure that out but iranians did and um and once they have that schematic they can make some pretty interesting ideas not just kind of one that blew me up uh but you know one of the things we were afraid of was was they had photo sensitive ieds at some point in afghanistan probably still do so um but but also very rudimentary technology uh and it's really not as advanced as it sounds but basically as a as a you find it you know and you might find it through a variety of tactics that we have um but as you as you brush away the dirt that's what you do if you want to uncover it and disarm it um as soon as light hits it it blows up these things were really screwed up stuff i mean that's just that's just nasty nasty armaments but also very simple and um that that kind of know-how comes from iran well and that's that's to their huge advantage all we talked about the cost asymmetry between um the the hamas rocket and the iron dome interceptors well iran they're minimizing their costs even further when they're able to just give schematics and say go build it so when it when it comes to financially this is a win-win for iran and i think in no small part that the reason that they're they do it this way is because of things like the maximum pressure campaign where we we turn the screws on the iranian regime because in 2015 when the assets run frozen hezbollah hamas palestinian islamists and god they just had an influx of money coming in um that you know they weren't using it for social services no no i mean we intercepted we intercepted conversations on that we absolutely know what they were using money for uh and that's why i look as as as a republican it's not just that we're just anti-things that obama did that's not actually how conservatives think believe it or not uh i think it is how democrats think unfortunately but uh no we have very good reasons for being against this and uh you talk to most people in the middle east uh who are allies of ours and they don't understand what on earth we're thinking with uh with with potentially another jcpoa or bringing iran back to the table it just removes our leverage to such an insane extent uh that that deal does you know it sets us you know it was it was kind of an immediate gratification right prevent them from from immediately sprinting to a bomb right then and there but almost ensuring that they get it in a legal way uh years down the road that's how i would describe in a nutshell uh what the jcpoa did because you have to remember the iranians and the chinese and the russians they're much more long-term thinkers than we are i really care about those pesky elections we unfortunately think in terms of elections and time frames such as that um which look is is good i think for our longevity i think it's the right thing to do but um there's uh we have a disadvantage sometimes in terms of thinking uh strategically in the long term and this is this is one of those i think obama was looking for a political win and wasn't good for american safety wasn't good for the region's safety uh that's for sure and what's the alternative well the alternative is what trump did and i think proved actually works which is hard deterrence yeah you guys can run to a bomb if you want but you won't be around much longer if you do there end of discussion like it you know and that was just never obvious from the obama administration trump made that very obvious and uh it turns out deterrence works it doesn't work with totally crazy people but the iranians are not crazy people it also helps us it also helps us dealing with iran to know that the iranian people are really sick of their regime see a second ago we were talking about what do palestinians think of this well they're a little bit more split um uh you talked to irani there's a lot in houston in particular is a lot of iranian-americans and um there is an overwhelming sense that uh the regime does not have support and that simple moral support by the united states is is everything to them and and could lead to one day a country that is that could be one of our best allies i mean it's actually possible because because the in the infection from the regime of iran it doesn't seem to have infected the people itself if that makes sense you you americans don't quite understand you probably have a lot more in common with iranians than you might realize um so what else do we want to talk about we've gone on for a while here uh i think that's a pretty good middle east conflict 101 yeah absolutely i mean because we could talk for another couple hours um but but for your sake so you don't have to hear me for the listener's sake um you know it might be best to maybe break it up a little bit yeah yeah maybe we'll get back to this well uh thanks for coming on and uh hope hope that uh left people um slightly less confused about what's going on out there but um appreciate y'all listening we'll be back next time bye

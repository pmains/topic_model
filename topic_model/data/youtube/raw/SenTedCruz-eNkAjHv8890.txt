Thank You mr. chairman gentlemen thank you both for your service congratulations on the nominations you received but thank you also for being willing to serve neither the countries to which you've been nominated are easy postings nor are they altogether safe postings and so we are grateful for both of you answering the call to serve serve your nation in challenging times general Abizaid I want to start with you Saudi Arabia is in my judgment a a deeply problematic outline their human rights record has been sorely lacking they have for many years been willing to fund jihadists on the principle that if you feed the crocodile perhaps it will eat you last their conduct with regard to mr. khashoggi was abominable and unacceptable on all of those fronts I think we should be clear and explicit condemning their actions at the same time there nonetheless an ally and critically they are a vital counterpoint to the nation of Iran and as I look to the Middle East the rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia any conduct that the United States Congress does to weaken Saudi Arabia the visa vie Iran to my mind is harming the national security interests of America because a stronger Iran with an Ayatollah Khomeini pledging death to America funding terrorists actively trying to murder Americans a stronger Iran makes for a more dangerous world do you share that assessment and what role do you believe Saudi Arabia plays in counterbalancing around Thank You senator Cruz for the question I certainly share your sentiments in your description about Iran maybe 15 years ago maybe I would have shared your description about Saudi Arabia there was absolutely too much turning a blind eye towards extremists leaving the country and causing problems elsewhere as I look at it today I don't think the problem is solved but I think it is getting better there are joint task forces for combating terrorism there's Joint Task Forces looking at the economic flows of money into the terrorist networks we notice here recently that Hamza bin Laden was stripped of a citizenship that others have been forced to pay a price for their support of terrorism to Al Qaeda Isis or indeed even supporting the Iranian state so it is incumbent upon the United States to continue to press the case that good allies do not support terrorism anywhere and can you describe the importance of a strong Saudi Arabia as a check to Iran senator I think you did an adequate job of that I don't know what I could add is there any coherent or rational argument that Saudi Arabia poses a a comparable threat to the United States to that of Iran senator when I look at the reform vision of 2030 if we can support it moving forward it's a plan for diversification of the economy it's a plan to begin the empowerment of women it's a plan to make the Armed Forces more professional it's a plan to give the young people of Saudi Arabia for a better future if that plan can succeed with the support of the international community I believe we will see a change an important change that will be good for all of us in Saudi Arabia what do you believe Iran is trying to accomplish in the Middle East you know senator we've had this conversation before and I appreciate we've had it and as we've noted before I firmly believe that the good people of Iran are just putting up with the higher GC codes force and the mullah government given the opportunity for a better future just like the Saudis if they had a vision for a reform movement if they had a vision for a better future the people would move in that direction but right now the IRGC Goods force and the radicals are in charge and we need to keep the pressure to cause them to ultimately be deposed by their own people I agree with you ambassador teller one of the more troubling developments in Iraq has been the growing influence of the Iranians both Iranian Shia militia and also direct or indirect Iranian control of the Iraqi institutions of government how significant do you assess that threat and what should we be doing about it the center I think it is a great threat it's one that concerns us and I know it's one that concerns the Iraqi people I think one of the most powerful forces in Iraq leaving aside the sectarian engine influences ethnic differences in political parties is Iraqis share a strong sense of pride in their rocky Arab identity they do not want to see their country weakened divided sovereignty impinged upon and they see the major threat of that coming from Iran so I think as we empower Iraqis to build the kind of country in future they want that's what we have to build on okay final question talk to me briefly about the Kurds the Kurds have been loyal allies they have spilled blood supporting the United States of America they have I think been neglected and mistreated far too often by United States foreign policy can you talk about the importance of assuring that we don't abandon the Kurds once again and and leave them subject to the predations of their neighbors senator that us Kurdish relationship is a historic one it's long lasting one I think it's a very important one I intend if I'm confirmed to make sure that that relationship between the United States and and the Kurdish people is one that's solid that gives the Kurds the sense of security they need that there never again in the future are going to be dominated by the type of regime that but Saddam Hussein represented in Baghdad at the same time I think it's very important from the US perspective that we see good saw the relationships between Baghdad and here real and I intend to do all I can to make sure that that relationship is a positive one thank you

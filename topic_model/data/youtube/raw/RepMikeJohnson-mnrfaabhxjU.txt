thank you mr chairman i offer a very common sense amendment that i don't think anyone here should object to the amendment would simply include employees at pregnancy care centers among those exempt from the restrictions in the bill now look here's the logic behind it and i dare anybody to challenge me on this there have been more than 50 instances of attacks on pro-life organizations since the majority opinion in the dobbs case was leaked in may that's just in the last 11 weeks 50. let me give you a short list of some examples may 5th 2022 portland oregon vandals smash numerous windows and spray painted graffiti on the southeast portland pregnancy resource center may 13th activists left threatening messages on the front of the alpha pregnancy center in reisterstown maryland including the messages if abortions aren't safe neither are you you're anti-choice not pro-life not a clinic etc may 18th vandals targeted a women's faith-based medical clinic in auburn alabama defacing the clinic sign and staff members vehicles may 25th linwood washington anti-life activists smash windows and vandalize the next pregnancy center with the threat if abortion isn't safe you aren't either june 6 asheville north carolina vandals broke windows and left graffiti on the mountain area pregnancy center services building including messages if abortions aren't safe neither are you no forced abortion and an anarchist symbol june 7th reports indicate that an abortion terrorist group jane's revenge this is from public reports firebombed the compass care pro-life pregnancy center in amherst new york june 25th longmont colorado vandals graffitied and set fire to the life choices free pregnancy services june 26 winter haven florida anti-life activists destroyed security cameras and spray-painted the life choice pregnancy center with threatening messages including your time is up we're coming for you jane's revenge june 11th activists vandalized the pro-life women's new life clinic in baton rouge louisiana by spray painting anti-life messages and jane's revenge on its exterior walls i have many pages of this i'll stop with that one because it's personal to me the women's new life clinic stands right next to the abortion provider in baton rouge and and the new life clinic has offered hope to countless women for years i'm proud to call many of the leaders of that clinic friends and they do not deserve the treatment they've endured but they certainly deserve the support of the house of representatives and condemning violence from the radical left and at the very least allowing them to protect themselves as they go to and from work there are 2 700 care pregnancy centers in the united states they serve over 2 million women in need a year they're supported by over 10 000 medical professionals and they do exceptional important work we've all said we want the safety nets uh for pregnant women and those in need and they these uh these facilities provide a vital service i used to be legal counsel for a number of these so i'm speaking from personal experience here's my point on this amendment it's very simple if any group deserves to be excluded from the provisions of this bill it is those who are facing real threats to their lives just for providing non-abortion pregnancy services to women if department of education and other federal agency employees are excluded then these folks certainly deserve to be i support uh and hope that you all will support this amendment i yield back

mr. president I rise to urge my colleagues to join me inviting in in voting for a bipartisan bill amendment two to nine for the military justice Improvement Act it will fix our broken military justice system I believe that our service members deserve a military justice system that is worthy of their sacrifice that means one that is both professional and fair and I think every one of my colleagues in this chamber agree that this is a priority no matter where you are from no matter your background some of my newer colleagues may be less familiar with this issue so I'm going to tell you what I'm talking about we all deeply revere our service members which means it's not easy to talk about problems in an institution that we treasure so greatly in this country but the fact is the military has a problem with sexual assault it is pervasive it is destroying lives and it's been going on for years listen to these most disturbing numbers since we first introduced this bill five years ago the number of cases that commanders have moved forward has decreased despite an increased number in reports in fiscal year 2013 484 cases proceeded to trial and in fiscal year 2017 only 406 cases proceeded to trial it is estimated that there were close to 15,000 cases of military sexual assault in 2016 that doesn't even include spouses and civilians in that estimate it's just an estimate of servicemembers in a survey of Afghanistan and Iraq veterans and supported by the Department of Defense's own data seven out of ten military sexual assault survivors have said that they experienced retaliation or other negative behaviors because they reported the crime and 14% of survivors have declined to even participate in the justice process after reporting that's how little confidence they have in this current system and this is after years years of our committee and working with the defense department to fix this problem I think we've passed every small ball incremental reform anybody is willing to agree on and it hasn't made the difference it's even after every Secretary of Defense since dick cheney was Secretary of Defense who have said zero tolerance for sexual assault in the military almost nothing has changed listen to these stories in one case a woman was raped by a service member she went to the hospital she told a friend and an investigation was started during the investigation two more victims came forward to tell their stories who said they were raped by the very same service member the military investigative team the military police recommended the case proceed to a court-martial because of the way our military justice system works today a military commander was in charge of the case not a trained military prosecutor and that commander chose to just discharge the perpetrator just send them right into the civilian world with no trial no court-martial no record not only were those service members who were violently assaulted denied justice but a serial predator was also released into the general public mr. president mr. president that is not right or listen to another case of a former Marine who was working as a Air Force civilian she's from a military family Army Navy veterans proud to serve loved the support the camaraderie but she was abused by her own immediate commander who had direct power over her in the chain of command she tried to seek justice but once again a military Mandor was in charge of the case not a trained military prosecutor who understands these kinds of cases and understands criminal justice and despite overwhelming evidence including text messages physical evidence eyewitnesses the perpetrator was allowed to retire without any financial penalty without any charges and with a full military pension my office hears all the time from women and men who have been raped in the military who have been abused who have been stalked who have been retaliated against it is an epidemic and it is not improving listen to the most recent headlines from USA Today quote marine corps general fired for calling sexual harassment claims fake news from the Navy Times quote officer accused of patronizing prostitutes worked in the sexual assault prevention office while waiting for his court-martial from stars and stripes quote Fort Benning drill sergeants suspended amid sexual assault allegations USA Today Bad Santa Navy top admiral kept spokesman after boozy party sexual predator warning and another from the same paper quote senior military official sanction for more than 500 cases of serious misconduct and from the AP quote pentagon misled lawmakers on military sexual assault cases these are just the recent headlines there's a pattern here our military justice system is broken and the Pentagon is not being forthright about this problem but Congress mr. president Congress is still hesitating Congress still refusing to put trained military prosecutors in charge of these cases this has to end Congress has to step in it has to do its job our job is to provide oversight and accountability over the administration over the Department of Defense on this very issue we have the responsibility to ensure that military justice is possible for survivors in the military and it shouldn't matter if the perpetrator has skills that the commander needs it shouldn't matter if he happens to be buddies with a commander what should matter is whether there's evidence that a serious crime has been committed that should be the determining factor of whether these cases get put forward to trial so we need to pass the military justice Improvement Act this legislation is as bipartisan as it gets it is supported by conservative Republicans and Liberal Democrats alike and plenty in between it has the support of some of the biggest veterans organizations women's organizations legal organizations and there's good reason for this because the bipartisan bill we have put together would ensure that survivors of this heinous crime and the alleged perpetrators of these crimes are both afforded due process the due process that they are entitled to under the US Constitution the bill in no way impedes a commander's ability to take action for military specific crimes like what a soldier goes AWOL what it would do is take the prosecution of sexual assault and other serious crimes serious violent felonies out of the chain of command and it would put it in the hands and a trained military prosecutor who actually understands how to deal with serious crimes this would allow our survivors men and women who sacrifice everything for this country the basic right to civil liberties and justice and this bill would also professionalize the military it would make sure that all people men women black white gay straight that every service member are not subjected to biased judgments and actually have the benefit of trained prosecutors looking at the evidence sadly according to report that came out recently in all four of the services Army Navy Air Force Marine black servicemembers are more likely to be court-martialed than white servicemembers this is unacceptable and this bill would help alleviate some of the unfairness in the current system by having trained prosecutors make those judgments based solely on evidence our commanders have a tough enough job defending our country so we should let these trained prosecutors do their job make the right decisions based on evidence alone we can only make this change if we pass this amendment so I urge all of our colleagues mr. president to look at this bill look at it anew look at the fact that we have not fruit we have not improved our rates of cases actually going to court-martial and our rates of conviction even though more are reporting it is a huge problem and I promise you every year the excuses let the reforms take more time to work ok well it's been five years and this has had a spotlight on it and if commanders cannot seem to put more cases towards court-martial and KITT result in more convictions we're not getting it right we are failing the men and women who will die for this country

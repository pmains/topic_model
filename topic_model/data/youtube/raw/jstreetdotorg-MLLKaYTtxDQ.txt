[Applause] [Music] hello thank you friends and welcome welcome to Temple Sinai into this memorial and celebration of the life and the legacy of almost oz I want to just take a moment if you would and I'll join you in doing this if you would just make sure that your cell phones are switched to a silent vibrate or something that won't disturb the service and the lectures I know you're here to learn and to celebrate and be together my name is Jonathan ruse I'm the senior rabbi here at Temple Sinai and I know I speak on behalf of the entire congregation when I say how honored we are to host you today how saddened we are by the death of a massage and how committed we are with you to keeping his work alive for generations to come that includes his literary work his love of and commitment to Hebrew and Jewish culture and his political and social activism especially in the pursuit of peace this program was envisioned by among other people Jeremy ben-ami who is the founder of J Street and were grateful to him and to J Street for this gathering along with the many partner organizations and communal leaders who are part of this today they are all listed in those programs that you received as you entered I once heard almost always when describing a tale of love and darkness he told a story about the postman from his childhood in the kerimov rahama neighborhood of Jerusalem when almost was a child he said there was a postman named mr. Melua who didn't just deliver the mail he would write letters of his own notes to the recipients on the outside of the envelopes that he would deliver maybe you've heard him tell this story mr. Malla wouldn't read the mail he wouldn't open it up he was reliable with his delivery but he would write unsolicited feedback on how a family was raising their child's or he shared his opinions about the British or how long somebody had left their laundry the lines Oh said that that is what he was doing with a tale of love and darkness that the real content was his parents Vanya and you who Daria and other family members who had died he the author of record was actually more mr. Melua a faithful deliverer of messages who got to add some of his own stories in his own comments that is what we must now do for him Hamas's left us more than enough content to fill the envelopes and encouraged us to see the world and ourselves as needing to add some more commentary of our own a bit of ourselves to it and to be sure that it is delivered to the next ones and the next ones and those who should read it for generations to come I mean if you probably know this but in the spirit of a memorial let me tell you a bit about his background to set the stage for our event today he was born almost Klausner in Jerusalem on May 4th 1939 the child of you who de Rea and Vanya who had emigrated from Eastern Europe and met in Jerusalem they spoke and read many languages but taught almost Hebrew the Jerusalem of his childhood is richly conveyed in his writings and as you no doubt know his mother's suicide when he was young impacted him significantly and only a few years later he left Jerusalem and his father's house and moved to kibbutz Wilda at the kibbutz he changed name to all from the Hebrew for courage and that Holda he met Neeley Zuckerman they married in 1960 she and their three children Vanya and Galya and Daniel survived him as do several grandchildren Vanya is with us here today and will speak with us shortly I know I speak for everyone here and beyond this room and offering our heartfelt condolences on the loss of your beloved father Amazon's completed his obligatory army service in 1961 and enrolled in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem studying philosophy and literature the return to hold after graduation and settled into a routine of writing and farming kibbutz duties he fought then in the 1967 and 1973 Wars and he spoke out against the occupation nearly from its inception and was one of the founders of peace now and a supporter of the peace movement throughout his life Bill's family moved later to Arad to where they lived for decades and he became a professor in the Department of Hebrew literature at ben-gurion University he wrote prolifically in several genres and his books as you know have been translated into dozens of languages he won some of the world's highest literary honors and prizes across the world in awarding him the prestigious Israel prize in 1998 the judges wrote that in his writing he has accomplished he has accompanied the realities of Israeli life and expressed them uniquely as he touches upon the pain and the ambulance of the Israeli soul he died on Friday December 28th 2018 at seventy nine years old that was the 20th of TV 257 seventy-nine young sheep the Shabbat of parsha mote which is a fitting coincidence in many ways not because he was such a traditionally religious person the opposite we know in an interview though many years ago almost always described what he found compelling in other people's writing he said when a work of literature suddenly makes the very familiar unfamiliar to me or just the opposite when a work of literature makes the unfamiliar almost intimately familiar I am moved to tears or smiles or anger or gratitude and we see that in the turn of events of shamoto in which a pharaoh arises who knows not of Joseph and suddenly the intimately familiar is made unfamiliar but even more powerfully connected to his life and legacy is the story of generational transmission at the heart of Schmidt the book opens with a group of relatives Jacob's family listed as individuals but soon conveys the emergence of an entire nation of people who are told before they are even out of their own slave quarters when your children ask you some future day about what happened here and what this means to you you must tell them you must transmit the story in their book Jews and words fun and almost wrote of just such a dynamic as an essential component of Jewish history and culture they wrote that the national and cultural genealogy of the Jews has always depended on the intergenerational transmittal of verbal content while scholarship matters enormous Lee they wrote family matters even more in this space on this day we offer a public celebration of the life and legacy in the work of al Moses we are especially grateful for and will emphasize his commitment to peace to speaking the truth and for a better world in a better life for all people in such a ceremony it wouldn't be surprising that we linger over his scholarship over his brilliance he was a literary genius one of the greatest Hebrew language scholars of all time an inspiration and a touchstone for Jewish identity for many many people around the world that would be right but in doing that we lose a bit of what he himself told us is so important family matters even more than the scholarship and so we also remember him today as a son and a grandson a father and a grandfather a husband and a friend I hope everyone has a copy of the program for today of the listing of the speakers or as at least sitting there somebody who has a copy all of today's speakers are listed there and they will come to the Bema and offer their reflections without further introductions so let me simply say thank you to rabbi's Esther Letterman and Stephanie Crowley to Jeremy ben-ami and to Roger Cohen Natalie Portman who sent a video message and to fajn euros salzburger there are many many people who Milt helped to make this event possible in addition to those speakers I'd like to just highlight Mindy Garfinkel who's the chair of Temple cyanides Israel committee and all of its members who have supported this program to our administrative and building staff and most of all thank you to Cortney robach from J Street who really ran point middle and rear for basically everything for this event thank you this is a celebration of the life and legacy of Olmos and it's also a memorial service and we're in a Beit Knesset and although a Moses would probably have passed finally actually told me she's certain he would have passed on the traditional prayers we will offer some of those traditional memorials at our clothes he loved or at least he signed on to the concept of irreverence that is inherently contained within Jewish forms of reverence we don't know about God he and Fania wrote but Jewish continuity was always paved with words so let us offer those words now that the lessons and values of our most O's may continue indeed as a part of that crucial continuity of Judaism itself good afternoon I'm rabbi Esther Letterman a number of years ago a faith leader from another tradition asked the question do you want to be the chaplain to the Empire or the Prophet to the revolution to me amazos was that prophet of the revolution so I want to read to you some words he wrote a little while ago that I feel encapsulate that sense of prophetic prophetic words and prophetic thinking I love Israel even at times when I don't like it even when I can't stand it I love it because I feel somewhat at home in Israel even though it is a flawed home it needs some mending if Israel at times is disappointing that is the nature of dreams to be somewhat disappointing once they are fulfilled Israel is a dream come true the only way to keep a dream rosy and intact is to never live it out this is true of planting a garden raising a family living out a sexual fantasy or building a nation some people expected Israel to be a moral light unto the nations others expected it to be a non-stop macho show and TB every week others wanted it to be an incarnation of the Jewish shtetl from Eastern Europe they visit us and say no bagels no LOX no Jewish state dreams can only remain wonderful as long as they don't come true but the real Israel is not one dream come true but a conglomeration of dreams fantasies blueprints and master plans there were people who came here to humbly wait for the Messiah there were others more ambitious who intended to make the Messiah come immediately others wanted to be the Messiah or to reconstruct the ancient kingdoms of David and Solomon with all their glory or to build a Marxist paradise so one day Stalin could visit and get the Grand Tour of a kibbutz and the kyboot sticks could have a lengthy discussion with him and teach him once and for all what marks Leninism is all about and then they fantasized he would rise to his feet say Jews did socialism better here than we did in Russia and die of happiness there were Europeans who hope to rebuild Vienna or Prague in the heart of the Middle East with good manners and tea and European decorum music peace and quiet between 2:00 and 4:00 in the afternoon next door there were people who wanted this place to become a 50-second state of the US or a Scandinavian social democracy the founders of my own kibbutz hold a semi religious social anarchists maintained that it was time for the Jewish people to come back to Israel to create a loose Federation of rural communities where the Jews would undergo a deep religious renewal not in synagogue but by being in constant touch with the elements of nature by hard physical work and sharing everything with each other there was in short a rainbow of fantasies Zionism was an uneasy coalition of diverse dreams and by definition it would have been impossible for all those dreams to have been fulfilled today some are partially fulfilled some forgotten and some have turned into nightmares Israel is a fiery collection of arguments and I like it this way alowed is no garden of roses there is something very creative about the situation Israel is a livening as a living open Street seminar about Jewish heritage but the meaning of Judaism about morality about the significance or marginality of holy places but a hierarchy of different Jewish values a whole nation has been immersed for the past 30 years in a debate which is superficially political or military but which is essentially ethical historical even theological about the kind of identity they want that's where I'm gonna end the excerpt I want to end just by lifting up something regarding the choice of a last name moving from Klausner to O's so OS is translated it's a biblical word that can be translated as courage or strength and the first mention of it in the Hebrew Bible is actually the book of Exodus that Rabbi Rhys was talking about before and the very first time the word ohs appears in the book of Exodus is in Exodus 15 and she rats how young in the song of the sea' and what makes that song of the sea' so significant is it's a song about redemption it's a song that the Israelites were singing as they walked through mud and water to get to the other side to escape slavery and oppression and perhaps learn what it is to be a free people and I just I find it so meaningful now that I know that one because I didn't know this before today that it was in Exodus was the first iteration of OHS and I know almost was not a religious man but perhaps in his words perhaps in his example and the legacy that he has created we will soon find a taste of redemption in our own time [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] good afternoon I am Jeremy ben-ami and thank you very much to Rabbi ruse thank you to Rabbi Letterman thank you to the Temple Sinai community which is my community for opening up your space and your arms and your heart to this important gathering I am so honored to be here with Vanya representing your family with so many others leaders and members of Jewish institutions in our communities synagogues and other organizations who have come together to honor the memory of your father and to celebrate his legacy I've only spoken twice at events like this once for my father and once for my mother Thomas oz was to me the ideological father or perhaps brother that I never had we shared much in terms of the journeys that we went through in our families and in our thinking almost his father was born on June 12th 1910 mine on June 11th 1913 our fathers and their families shared a political worldview they were both active in the pre state ear goon in pre state Israel and they shared a belief in strength and power as the key to the survival of the Jewish people and the creation of the State of Israel by the way there's another man on the world stage today who had a father of the same age who moved in the same political circles Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu I believe that all three of our fathers knew each other at that time while the Prime Minister remains a believer to this day that the Jewish people are destined to live by the sword never compromising or giving an inch to their adversaries I'm proud of my shared rebellion with Olmos the worldview of our fathers born into a revisionist right-of-center household he charted his own course turning to the political left and finding a home in the kibbutz movement in the Labor Party and ultimately in merits almost was the quintessential liberal Zionist he stood up to those to his right who rejected liberalism and whose power today is rising here and in Israel and he stood up to those to his left who reject Zionism and whose power today is growing as well I almost believed clearly in the Justice of the cause of the Jewish people's right to a state in the Land of Israel and he was equally clear in his belief in justice and the necessity of opposing zealotry on the extremes of all cultures and all religions the best way that I know to honor the legacy and the memory of a man who inspired me so deeply is not simply to celebrate the clarity of the values for which he stood but to commit to fight for them now that he is no longer here and in the fight himself so my first commitment to ammos is to proudly hold and defend the flag of liberal Zionism against those to the right and those to the left and to continue to balance the core values of Zionism with the humanistic values of liberalism the second commitment that I make is to continue to battle as I almost did the notion that the problems that Israel and the Jewish people face can be addressed as Israel's leadership today suggests by the sword as Fania knows well her father was no pacifist he may have been a founder of peace now and a supporter of peace as the goal to which we aspire and this week I would note by the way is the 40 year anniversary of the Camp David Accords of peace between Egypt and Israel and there was around that which almost and others founded the Israeli peace movement shallow moksha but having served in both the 1967 and 1973 Wars he understood there are times when it is necessary to fight he understood that without the ability to defend itself Israel wouldn't survive a day that said he was deeply concerned with Israel's fixation since 1967 on military force he quoted the proverb frequently that to a man with a big hammer every problem looks like a nail he knew that force has its limits and should only be used as a last resort Hamas for instance he wrote is an idea and no idea has ever been defeated by force to defeat an idea you have to offer a better idea he was very clear that force ultimately is no solution for the problem that the Jewish people are not alone in the Land of Israel I almost understood that as early as 1967 that occupation even unavoidable occupation is corrupting and to the end of his life he remained a passionate advocate against occupation and for an agreement with the Palestinians to partition the land into two States even in his final month when we at J Street were not aware of how serious the battle was that he was personally waging he still worked with us to craft our end of your message to our supporters in his name his views on the israeli-palestinian conflict were an inspiration to me and to all those in Israel and around the world who recognized that the Jewish people will only have a safe secure and democratic state of their own if and when the Palestinian people have won - how most gave me and those who share my worldview so much of the language and the imagery that we use today to make our case the israeli-palestinian conflict is a tragedy he would say it's a clash of right and right and tragedies he would remind us are resolved in only one of two ways a Shakespearean way or the Chekhovian way in a tragedy by Shakespeare at the end the stage is littered with dead bodies in the tragedy by Chekhov however everyone is unhappy they're disillusioned they're bitter they're melancholy but they're alive he and the peace movement he would say are working for a Chekhov Ian's not a Shakespearean conclusion he spoke of the need to look at peace with the Palestinians not through rose-colored glasses he's the first person that I heard discussed the israeli-palestinian peace process to her to discuss the issue not as a marriage but as a divorce in which the couple is consigned to live together for eternity in the same house and has to figure out the arrangements of how to live together without killing each other so my second commitment to you and to your father Fania is to carry forward the fight for the two-state solution and the two-state vision is the only way to resolve this conflict not out of starry-eyed idealism but out of stone-cold realism as to how we shape a better future not only for our children and grandchildren but those of our neighbors as well finally I want to say a word about the way in which we carry on the struggle how will we keep the intellectual and moral guiding light burning that almost provided we live in what I profoundly hope is a passing moment in human history in which thoughtful and intellectual argument are being devalued by our leaders and sacrificed for the rapid-fire sparring of the political arena both in Israel and in the United States our leaders have chosen to sink to the lowest common denominator to grasp and to hold power they play to base emotions of fear and hatred and intolerance rather than seeking to lift up their peoples and their countries to idealistic heights so a final thought for us today as we ponder how best to carry on the legacy of our friend and the memory of our mentor is to recommit to carrying on a spirited fight for what we believe in with elegance and with grace to seek to win based on the substance of our beliefs the morals that underpin them and the power of the words that we choose words can be weaponized to harm to harm and to hurt or they can be mustered in thoughtful and powerful arguments to inspire persuade and motivate perhaps the greatest way to honor the legacy of your father will be not so much in choosing to stand on the side on his side of the weighty arguments of the day about Israel and Palestinians but in the manner in which we choose to make our case and seek to prevail it is now my honor and my privilege to share a video address sent to us by Natalie Portman the award-winning actress who shared a special connection with ammos Natalie was so inspired by Thomas's book a tale of love and darkness that she went to on to write and direct her first movie based on it ladies and gentlemen Natalie Portman Thank You Jeremy knowing and working with ammos was one of the great experiences of my life amis was so fond of words of language and understood the particular Jewish power of storytelling and how important what stories we tell and how that shapes our reality he loved love he always talked about how much he loved his family and how much he loved art and stories and words and he was able to use it in a political way as well he understood that his position held great influence and he was able to always keep us looking forward with hope to peace always looking forward to living with our neighbors not in a Pollyanna unrealistically idealistic way but in a way of what is the true Jewish nature of being a good human being and of living with your neighbors and I'm so grateful to him for his words just as an audience member as as his work as an artist but also for his humanity both the way he showed it to me personally and to my family and the generosity he showed me in using his work to create my own and also in the way he was publicly in the humanity he showed everyday and advocating for peace till the last day of his life so I miss him terribly I send my love so much to his family and all the people who left him and I wish I could be there with you today to celebrate him Oh Sebastian is a nice Miami lie anything for Emily I show

everyone my name is Roger Cohen I'm a colonist for New York Times more important I was lucky enough to be a friend of a masseuse I would find a massage in his Ramat Aviv apartment after his writing was done that might be around 9:00 a.m. he was tousled tender strong and soft-spoken he had an old-world gentility an Israeli directness an American work ethic and a universal humanity the most fecund hours unfolded in the very early morning it was then that he created it's like reconstructing the whole of Paris from Lego bricks he told me once of writing a novel it's about three quarters of a million small decisions it's not about who will live and who will die and who will go to bed with whom those are the easy ones it's about choosing adjectives and adverbs and punctuation these are molecular decisions that you have to take and nobody will appreciate for the same reason that nobody ever pays attention to a single note in a symphony in a concert hall except when the note is false anybody who has read my michael or a tale of love and darkness or any other of Oz's masterpieces knows how successful he was in this endeavor listen to him deception always gives itself away it's like a blanket which is too short when you try to your feet your head is uncovered and when you cover your head your feet stick out the writer reveals from hurts and loss he draws illumination love and darkness are not antinomies but twins his business is truth and truth more often than not is brutal still I am sure a mas would never have claimed that there was not a single false note in his work he knew how intrinsic to humanity failure is and what a stranger to humanity perfect outcomes are he was suspicious of the idea of perfectibility a cousin of absolutism his soul was generous his credo as a novelist was that humankind is open-ended people are capable of surprising not only others but themselves he called this the single most promising phenomenon in history this belief I think was the root of his stubborn optimism he was a Zionist to his core he believed that Jews need a place where the bus drivers and the plumbers and the farmers and the soldiers are also Jewish a homeland in other words he was proud of his country belonged to it excavated it fought for it rendered it and loved it as one loves an unruly child to me he was nothing less than Israel's conscience be true as a Jew to what you are not what newfound power enables you to be he believed would equal certitude that Palestinians need a state this was a condition for peace millions of human beings present on the same land could not be chased away or conjured away or wished away to think otherwise was a day temptation an illusion whose fruit would be bitter the occupation was corrupting as Jeremy already said the settlement enterprise a grave error compromising and blinding when all's expressed this view it reflected more than a strategic conviction it reflected a human and ethical obligation it was inseparable from his conception of Jewishness how could a people who had been homeless for so long forever inflict homelessness on others that which is hateful to yourself do not do to your fellow man in our conversations he would return to this theme he was unbowed and unrequited there cannot be one state he would suggest because Israelis and Palestinians cannot become one happy family they are not one and they are not happy so the only solution is turning the house into two smaller apartments to me this truth is self-evident yet OSes voice grew more isolated today just down the road from here and over in Jerusalem a new breed or perhaps not so new breed of man beast rides the earth canny and manipulation convinced that phrases like the rule of law or human rights are just code for a leftist agenda that will stack the strength of the great ever greater sovereign nation they mock an independent judiciary they are shocked when the people come after them for they see themselves as invincible they value image over substance charm over character dominion over dignity and slickness of a decency they use ethno-nationalism to consolidate power they regard compromise as weakness whereas also the readiness for compromise as bravery yes the courage to make hard choices Lincoln Gandhi Churchill Bagan Sadat Rabine and Gorbachev were all called traitors of course that's worth recalling in this week that marks the little observed 40th anniversary of the Impossible israeli-egyptian peace by contrast in Israeli history books I believe the chapter on the past decade will be called the kick-the-can years the forging of a two-state outcome remains the great task before Israel and the Palestinians impossible or unfashionable as it may seem today yes it is hard and yes Palestinian division victimhood violence and bad leadership make it harder some say it can no longer be achieved it's gone forever but then I hear a Moses words echoing in my head I live in the desert at Arad every morning at 5:00 a.m. I start my day by taking a walk before sunrise I inhale the silence I take in the breeze the silhouettes of the hills I walk for about 40 minutes when I come back home I turn on the radio and sometimes I hear politicians using words like never or forever or for eternity and I know that the stones out in the desert are laughing at him perhaps you know the story of the old man on his deathbed approached by his children dad they say we were afraid to ask you this before but perhaps the time has come do you want to be buried or cremated a long silence follows oh I don't know the old man says surprise me a Moses truths will still surprise us perhaps as soon as April 9 in the winter we cannot imagine the cherry blossom the magnolias yet they come and here they are rabbi ruse mentioned a reverence a most loved humour I remember one of my last visits he had just been awarded a major literary prize by the Chinese and he told me that he went to China to collect the prize and he was ushered into a vast hall full of suited and solemn Chinese gentlemen mainly gentlemen and he went up on the stage and he said I'm most honored to have received this prize and I am particularly honored because between us the Chinese and the Jews represent more than 20% of humanity in conclusion in my Michael ours road instead of being a light to the nation's we have become just one of the nation's and who can say whether it is for better or worse this delicate question bears long dare I say Talmudic contemplation the Zionist ideal contained in Israel's founding charter of 1948 could not meet the reality of a tough even brutal neighborhood and emerge unscathed dreams are always prelude to disappointment besides us seemed too intimate with that question the beautiful idea of tikkun olam does carry a hint of messianic temptation it is perhaps not such a bad thing that Jews should simply have a country a home a place of belonging like other nations yet this outcome is insufficient Israel cannot be satisfied with existence alone millennial Jewish survival can only be understood through the force of ideas and ideals as Hillel put it if I am NOT for myself who will be for me but if I'm only for myself Who am I if not now when if not now when a mosque once said to me I would say that the patient Israeli and Palestinian is unhappily ready for surgery while the doctors are cowards in a tale of love and darkness as described walking out him to the desert adorned now he wrote you can hear the full depths of the desert silence it isn't the quiet before the storm or the silence at the end of the world but a silence that covers another even deeper silence this is how I imagine a mosque now inhaling the biblical silence of his scarred imperfect beautiful beloved Israel of still uncertain borders a silence that is also an admonition to the ambient shrieking of those cowards [Applause] I'm rabbi Stephanie Crawley and the assistant rabbi at Temple Micah almost owes lived a life that was an ode to words the written word of all types and language editorial and fiction autobiographical and imagined in Jews and words the book he co-authored with his daughter they expound on what they call a text line suggesting that more than blood and more than theology our lineage is text our inheritance is word but not only it is not only that we have these texts that we teach them and pass them down editing and commenting and rewriting but about the role of words they wrote Jews display a deeply rooted belief in the power of words to create and recreate reality both believe that words and books change us he believed that books might just save us from ourselves in 2005 upon receiving the Goethe prize he reflected I believe that imagining the other is a powerful antidote to fanaticism and hatred I believe that books that make us imagine the other may turn us more immune to the ploys of the devil including the inner devil imagining the other is not only an aesthetic tool it is in my view also a major moral imperative and finally imagining the other if you promise not to tell not to quote this very little professional secret imagining the other is also a deep and very subtle human pleasure he had a deep deep empathy which drew me which drew all of us to his writing whether it was the way he related to diverse people he conversed with in the Land of Israel or the nuanced and profound away he welcomed us into the imagined minds of converts Nick iam a Tel Aviv family of Arabs and Jews we needed and we need his words in a short essay titled events and books originally published in 1966 Oh sets out this as an agenda of his writing and it is the passage I would like to share today he writes words are connected to a place from which our capacious witness contemplates events the secret foreign agent is a traitor that in his heart of hearts he is not looking for a formula that will remove suffering but the right words to describe it is my aim to proclaim over the whole world of literature that I tell of myself that is all I can tell of my world is as small as the world of an ant no not always not in every sense true while the caravan is passing these men of words merely bark or howl but sometimes the caravan loses its way or its strength and comes to a weary halt then the blind man may be able to lead the sighted the word Smith's anguish his mockery his darkness suddenly become a landmark reality itself the realm of decision and achievement has its moments when it tries to get back to its original source to the darkness of desires and fears and dreams from which it comes at such times the blind man the sniper of stragglers the man of words can take events by the arm and say here this way or look out a chasm or stop rest and thus he can lead the way through agony loneliness and darkness which he knows backwards with his mental map of pathways may we only need these books to broaden our minds may all our actions succeed even so it is good to have them there in the corner on the shelf against a rainy day I stand here grateful for his books which fill a whole row on our shelves ready to be pulled off when we need a reminder of the importance of imagination of empathy he leaves us a legacy of words which are waiting prepared to help lead us through the darkness ready to help us find our way back to ourselves [Applause] Shalom dear friends my name is fanny all Salzburger I'm deeply touched to be here I will begin by thanking although there is no way I can thank you all thanks dear Jeremy ben-ami for thinking this wonderful event up and to your wonderful team thank you dear rabbis Ruth Leatherman and Crowley thank you dear Roger for your wonderful words special thanks and admiration to Chief Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg who has just joined us here and thank you all this place is full of the people he loved most his readers you are the ones who are helping me make sense of my terrible grief it's only been three months and the pain is immeasurable you know perhaps there is this extra little bit of pain for a secular person like my father was and I am because for us life is life but there is no afterlife and I will not see and hear him again and yet here he is because you see we Jewish seculars are not exactly a East's or agnostics or irreligious or non-believers or all these things that begin with a negative prefix we are not negative prefixes we are hale on him we celebrate life and we celebrate the miracles of life and believe me that life is full of miracles so thought my father so he kept telling me he thought for example that one of the greatest perhaps the greatest miracle on earth and perhaps the greatest mystery on earth is the family has been mentioned before by some of the speakers and I add not just the old fashioned family but any sort of family that carries the basics of family love gentleness warmth physical and intellectual nutrition Jewish parroting rate you see my father's personal life began with a terrible tragedy of losing fannia my grandmother still can't believe that natalie portman actually played my granny you know this is a strange thought let me also say that my father ended his life in relative peace with very little pain in his sleep so surrounded by the loved ones of his family children grandchildren his wonderful wife my mother but let me zoom out from be personal to the public to the historical I mean history professor by profession by telling you that my father's life began in 1939 with one of the worst the worst tragedy that ever befell the Jewish people and perhaps humankind as a whole and my father life and father's life ended in a very dramatic moment in Israeli and Jewish history perhaps also world history and we still do not know whether this will be another tragedy that will befall us or perhaps a miracle human miracle will open up I am here to speak not only about my personal father not only about his literature but also adamantly about his politics his deep politics because as you may know my father kept his literature his novelist soul and his political soul well apart he used to speak of the two pins on his desk black and the blue I can't remember which is which one for the novels and the stories and one to tell his prime minister whoever that would be to go to hell however there is a deep political aspect in the deepest not philosophical most moral sense of politics pertaining to each and every one of his books he used to say he used to tell us all my novels are democracies and I believe they are by the way full of characters elbowing one another to the top of the line like one of those tel-aviv bus queues and asking the right are not asking demanding demanding of the novelist screaming at the tops of their voices to speak for them and their clashing opinions worldviews interests and passions so that my father used his hundred string instrument in order to play out all those clashing souls running around his books that is a democracy could have been an anarchy if you hadn't managed to actually write them so well it goes deeper than that true literature is about listening and then voicing what you have heard with as Jeremy Sowell put it without false notes listening and storytelling the best kind of listening and the best kind of storytelling was for my father also a political secret whenever he met one of his numerous Palestinian friends and interlocutors he would say I want to listen to your story and perhaps you would like to listen to mine this is not only literary it is deeply political where politics meets morality and be humane now I have not flown all the way to BC in order to tell you things that you already know and I would like to share with you briefly three relatively novel ideas that my father has been playing out with in the last year perhaps the last months of his life I here to share them with you you may have heard something but all these were relatively new because he kept coming up with new ideas it was quite a young man in bed in this respect first I'd like to speak of his 11th commandment some of you have heard this before or indeed for him the first commandment perhaps even the only single commandment that we need he recently said told several audiences told us at home that he feels as though he could put together the ten commandments of the Torah and perhaps all the rest of those moral imperatives by the other philosophers Jewish and non-jewish that he respected pushing them together into just one commandment thou shalt not inflict pain typically in Hebrew it's only two words I mean English is a long language not our Eve do not hurt as far as you can and if you have to inflict pain do it as minimally as possible this is true for love this is true for family this is true for parenting this is true for politics this is true for every aspect of our lives thou shalt not inflict pain if you can possibly help it by the way also not unto yourself that's one little kernel kernel of his wisdom I wanted to share him another recent idea so very recent that maybe quite a few of you have not heard it before was brought out for the first time in public in that famous last lecture in Tel Aviv University but we have on YouTube and J Street has very kindly offered and added the English subtitles it is titled all the reckoning is not over or perhaps the reckoning is not over yet this is a phrase ending a wonderful novella by yourself Haim Brenner the early Zionists Hebrew writer bitter man a heartbroken man and also a man full of hope the reckoning is not over yet we have just made this little lecture into a tiny book that appeared in Hebrew in Israel last week hopefully also in translations to follow call hawkish bone Adlon Akmal and some beautiful new ideas appear in this lecture in this little book some of them you have heard here echoing before such as the idea that history is open-ended that women and men are full of surprises that we Jews are even more full of surprises and that nothing is determined as far as the future goes but the other little idea I wanted to share with you from that lecture now book is a term a medical term my father invented for this lecture in hebrew charles direct from the world Shizue Lazo huzzah in english sounds very medical recon strike this the idea of the romantic dangerous damaging idea of reconstructing our past exactly as it was nothing can be more dangerous than that to an individual or to a nation almost said and he went on to tell about a meeting with a Palestinian intellectual in Paris who said to him I hail from the village of Lifta that is not me but my grandfather Lifta near Jerusalem the beautiful Lifta with a spring of fresh water and the boats and the goats with the bells down the hill and the vineyards all I want is to be able to come back to Lifta terrine habit my grandfather's little house not forever just in the vacants coming from Paris and listen to the bells on the necks of the goats and my father said to this young man dear sir I totally and deeply understand you but you have caught dangerous case of recon Stratos because you see if all Palestinians come home to Lifta it will not be the village of 300 people that your grandfather knew it would be a big town a suburb of Jerusalem with supermarkets shopping malls and huge traffic jams take it from me same thing goes for the settlers in Judea and Samaria wishing to bring back the biblical landscapes of our patriarchs this will never be because even if we hospital illa god forbid pushed out the Palestinians from the Temple Mount and reconstructed the Third Temple of the Jews can you imagine what the holy days would look like can you imagine the sheer traffic jam can you imagine the failure of the air conditioning he goes on like that for Allah reconstruction reconstruct this is a dangerous disease you cannot and here I'm quoting a beautiful sentence from the lecture and the book you cannot find in space what you have lost in time what about Zionism isn't that one big case of recon Stratos when says my father I thought about it for a little bit but you know we're in the danger of becoming a case of recon Stratos to our own damage but it wasn't to begin with of course there was the flavor of the biblical past and the longing the nostalgia and the Jewish continuity lashonna haba RB osha lying there was all that but this was only the flavoring not the gist of the Zionist project the gist of the Zionist project was saving Jewish lives in real time in the 20th century the rest was a wonderful cultural additive but the truth of the matter is that if it has not had not been for Zionism neither my father or my grandparents or me would have been able to live no the Jews of Baghdad and Morocco who had to flee as soon as the British left Baghdad and the French left North Africa Zionism was a lifesaver deeply frayed flavoured with a cultural sense of belonging but first and foremost a lifesaver and strangely enough this universal human notion of a nation state for the stateless the persecuted and the refugee this non specifically Zionist need to save the lives of a million Jews from Europe in the last moment and half a million Jews from the Middle East in the last moment this non Zion is not specifically Zionist need that was served is the best possible justification of Zionism that we have and we should hope and pray which I do in my secular way that reconstruct this in the form of nationalist nostalgia will not take over the Israeli project because despite our biblical deepest biblical roots which are not biological of physiological or genetic but deeply beautifully textual despite these roots it is not the whole house we need it is a partition of the house a lifesaver for one nation and a lifesaver for the next-door nation recon straightest versus realism the first and last little takeaway I want to bring you is not from the book that my father and I wrote together Jews and words which by the way made him very happy but the book that we were just beginning to write together and that is a secret we're the first ones to hear he wanted that it was his idea to write a new little book about truth about literary truth about historical truth we used to think they were miles apart now we no longer think so perhaps even about legal truth what makes the Bible true if you are not a bit the depth of its literary wisdom the authentic voices of its female and male protagonists whether or not they existed this is literary truth this can become historical truth because the truth of Avraham and Sahar whether or not or not they actually lived on this earth the moment in which Sahar laughs in the face of God for us a very crucial moment both the laughter and in the face of God and God and most of all saw that truth is similar to the truth of the existence of Dostoyevsky's Raskolnikov invented figure perhaps but as true as they get this is the book we wanted to write and when we were going over his papers after his death I found several pages in his handwriting with the basic points that he already laid out for our joint book can I tell you what's there I can't because my eyes were clouded with tears I did not read them yet but in the age of false facts and fake news and alternative histories and what have you almost wanted his next book to be about truth in the deepest sense by the way not facts he used to say facts are sometimes the enemies of truth in the deepest sense where literature meets the political the moral and indeed the human and that is why he wrote as Jeremy said like a musician trying not to utter a single false note because literature too is about truth and when you read it you his beloved readers you know it you feel it I have to end with Jewish humor Roger has taken up much of what I wanted to say about a Moses love of Jewish humor he thought that Jewish humor was the best humor in the world with the possible exception of his father whose jobs were awful but what makes Jewish humor so good by the way this crosses totally cross cross of the Ashkenazi father line don't think only he distinct Ladino we've been through a few wonderful Ladino texts of humor what comes at the deep end of Jewish humor is not only the irreverence it is the fact that irony or sarcasm in their Jewish way are never directed at the powerless they are always directed at the powerful we laugh as Sarah did even in the face of God not to mention the rabbi and my father and even grandmother we laugh in the face of the powerful what about Jewish the famous Jewish self the reason the way Jews always survive by laughing a little bit at themselves well we have been laughing laughing at ourselves because deep inside we knew how powerful that made us and even deeper than that the love of an intellectual surprise and the good joke especially a good Jewish joke is always an intellectual surprise closing the circle going back to the beginning of what I said and some of the others will live in an open-ended world in open-ended history women and men are prone to surprise themselves and each other and that is probably the best hope that we have and I'm going to end with a joke you will have to forgive me because I know that almost is not only forgiving me but says funnier and you're going to end with a joke yes I will but it's not a joke it's a true story about me and the big rabbi on the l:l airplane may I me and the big rabbi on the ll airplane so here I am sitting on my ll seats back to Israel from London minding my own business and in comes a big rabbi now he was physically big but it turned out he was also very big in his yeshiva in nae Brock and the big rabbi has to sit next to me and he does not want to sit next to me has anybody been through this before yeah the rumor has reached you and there is some squabbling in the little passage of the ll plane eventually the poor guy has to sit next to me we take off I raise my glass my plastic glass of my plastic cup of wonderful el al fresh water and I say dear rabbi I know you did not want to sit next to me but I wish you a pleasant flight anyway to which the rabbi answers oh no no no no please don't take it personal it is not personal at all I assure you that my own wife would not have liked to sit next to your husband either thank you very much we okay we talked a national mood as usual we find out the interesting truth that the kibbutz reared child knows Madonna not Torah but enough then the big rabbis from fabric but the eastern mood was better than mine okay that's great I think it was the most enjoyable four-hour flight in his life if I may say so we parted as friends but I did mention to him that I happen to have all thought with my father at least little book called Jews and words could I send in to him he says yes why not send it I send him the book co-signed autographed by Olmos and myself and we thought we would never hear anything do I still have two minutes to finish the story two weeks later I get an email from Nate Brock now I want you to realize that getting an email from Edna brackish eva is like getting a fax from aristotle okay it was not from the rabbi it was from the rabbi's secretary and believe me the rabbi's secretary is not what you think it is a wonderful aver a good yeshiva man who wrote the email for the rabbi dear mrs. mrs. Oz Veritas the rabbi would like to thank you for sending your booked term but he shall not read your book because he knows that your book is against the very gist of his Jewish creed and therefore he will not read it but he thanks you anyway yours sincerely am NOT an zone secretary so I print out the email I rushed to my father's home in Ramat Aviv the same one that you visitor said Abba Abba here is an email from the rabbi he is not going to read a book so my father looks at the email he looks at me and he says fannia let me promise you something not only is the rabbi going to read our book but what is much more important his wife is going to read a book people are unexpected we can all surprise ourselves history is open-ended including both Israeli and US history let us continue speaking truth to power thank you very much [Applause] actually if you would just please remain standing we'll conclude with this traditional blessing perhaps this the greatest ending joke of all given his perspective on the tradition but I suppose if he could hear us I would say with such importance and such value given to words and to their passing ahead of Ahriman so these are the words this is what our tradition would offer in his memory these words of Allah male Rock Imam al-mahdi Rock'em Sock'em bomber Muhammad's a new hanahuna taka to convey Hasina in kudo she Muto him cos o hara qiyamat serum at knishmas ammos been fania vo who are a sha-la-la-la mo Baraka minister who bisetta can evolve the olamim by its Ribbit's rocky madness motto Rahu naka lot o be ánewá be Shalom al Mishka vovinam are and men may the source of life the fountain of all being open our hearts to compassion and our eyes to wisdom the we might glimpse in perfect peace and sadness the way of all things may the memory of almost all's be for us a blessing and may we never let the light of his love grow dim in our hearts may we remember all his worthy and righteous deeds that his memory be forever bound up in the bond of life God is our source and our destination our beginning and our end may almost as the death awaken us to this truth that the bond of love we shared and share not be severed in sorrow may he rest in peace as we together say a man Thank You friends for joining us in his honor and his memory today

this month after 40 years of service as a member of congress our senior senator from kansas will be moving his belongings out of his heart senate office building to a private library to best honor him i'd like to share some of his original wits some of the quips for which he's most famous number one take your job seriously but not yourself they're not self-made men or women in public service it's your family friends and staff who made you what you are another favorite you're only as good as your staff it isn't the best possible bill it's the best bill possible in reference to an opponent who sometimes disagrees with you he suggested go smother them with the milk of human kindness on his commitment to agriculture he once said we live in a troubled and hungry world food security is national security and when asked about why we need agriculture programs the senator once said you can't eat a shoe on life he's once said when asked about making a mistake he suggested that you go hunker down and take it like a donkey in a hail storm and remember this he once said remember when you roll around with pigs you both get dirty but only one of you enjoys it on sports at football games he was often said throw the ball to the tight end he's wide open and of course we all know the senator was the unofficial tight-end coach for the ever optimistic and fighting kansas state wildcats at a town hall when a rabbit constituent gave a forceful opposing opinion he once replied i'll mark you down as undecided and i loved when he referred to kansas university as that school over by baker the senator once a marine was always a marine he was often quoted saying take the hill and semper fi but my personal favorite there's lots of cactuses in the world but you don't have to go set on every one when i first meet successful influential people people who i've read about or know of i often ask myself is there any substance to this person is their character and integrity what's truly important to them and i'd like to share as we've gotten to know senator roberts and his wife frankie i found that their footprints are larger than their shadows their hearts are bigger than their words their love of this country their love of kansas more than any words i can find to describe and personally i can't imagine any memory of senator roberts without thinking of his bride his south carolina magnolia blossom as he often called her whom he married some 51 years ago she is absolutely his rock the person i always see standing beside him with adoring eyes and while occasionally she gives him a gentle nudge everyone knows she always has his back lane and i want to personally thank senator roberts and frank frankie who've embraced us with hospitality and kindness since are writing ourselves in washington dc some four years ago they've shown us what it is to be an ambassador for our state from christmas gatherings at the white house to farm bill hearings in a barn they've shown what servant leadership looks like representing our state with dignity and grace senator roberts is the only person in america's history to have his portrait in both the house agriculture and the senate agriculture committee hearing rooms senator roberts has had a hand in writing eight farm bills he's been on a federal congressional ag committee for 40 years running some of his greatest accomplishments include those eight farm bills and i'm going to reference two of them the federal agriculture improvement and reform act of 1996 which he was the first primary author and chairman and this became known as the freedom to farm bill chairman roberts has often told the story i've heard this maybe once or twice of senator roberts sitting on the tongue of the wagon of the farmer in dodge city kansas with all of his farm experts and his good friend leon torlini said pat we all need freedom to farm and sure enough this ag policy gave producers the freedom to plant crops based on market indicators not federal government set-aside policies and next i'll reference the first farm bill i participated in the agriculture improvement act of 2018. where he was the primary author as chairman and probably most notably this farm bill received more votes than any farm bill in modern history with 87 in favor i'd like to also mention the 2016 national bio injured bio engineer food disclosure act this federation federal legislation created standards for labeling the food with ingredients derived from biotechnology and then as two thousand agriculture risk protection act reformed the national crop insurance and led to its widespread use today and finally i'll mention senator roberts was always the leader in bio-agro security legislation as chairman of the senate armed service subcommittee on emerging threats senator roberts chaired the first in adhering on the threat to our nation's food supply i'll close with this though senator roberts will always be known for his wit being an entertaining speaker and a great interview his actions his accomplishments will always speak louder than any of his words he and frankie have been tremendous ambassadors for agriculture for kansas and for america they climbed many mountains and they planted the flag senator roberts semper fi may god richly bless you frankie and your family thank you mr speaker and i yield back

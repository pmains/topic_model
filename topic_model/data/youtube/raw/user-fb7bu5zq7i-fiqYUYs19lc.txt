  EDUCATION AND LABOR, MR. MRVAN. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE  GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. MR. MRVAN: THANK YOU, CHAIRMAN  SCOTT, FOR THE TIME. I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE  WORKFORCE INNOVATION AND  OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 202. I LONG BELIEVE -- 2022. I LONG BELIEVE THERE IS A PLACE  TO HELP OUR FELLOW CITIZENS  OBTAIN A GOOD-PAYING JOB. WITH A GOOD-PAYING JOB, MOST  FOLKS HAVE THE TIME AND  RESOURCES TO TAKE CARE OF  THEMSELVES, THEIR FAMILIES, AND  ADDRESS THE DIFFICULTIES THAT  SOMETIMES ARISE IN LIFE. I APPRECIATE THAT THIS  LEGISLATION PROMOTES THE VALUE  OF OUR WORKFORCE AND FOCUSES ON  THE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE  APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS, DIGITAL LITERACY PROGRAMS AND SUMMER  JOBS PROGRAMS FOR OUR YOUTH. IN MY EXPERIENCE FOR 15 YEARS AS SOMEONE WHO HELPED UPSKILL  PEOPLE, I WORKED VERY CLOSELY  WITH THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT  IN ORDER TO FIND JOBS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE SITTING ACROSS THE TABLE FROM ME TRYING TO MAKE ENDS  MEET. THIS INVESTMENT GIVES THEM HOPE  AND PROMISE. IT ALSO ABSOLUTELY ADDRESSES  WHAT ALL EMPLOYERS AND ALL SMALL BUSINESSES ARE LOOKING FOR -- A  READY, SKILLED WORKFORCE IN  ORDER TO GET INTO THE MARKET  QUICKLY. ALSO, WHEN IT COMES TO LABOR  UNIONS, I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE  INVESTMENT IN THE LABOR UNIONS  WHAT THEY PROVIDE FOR MY  COMMUNITY IN INDIANA'S FIRST  DISTRICT IS LIVABLE WAGES,  HEALTH CARE BENEFITS THAT ARE  AFFORDABLE, SAFER WORKPLACE, AND ALSO A SECURE RETIREMENT. AND ALSO, WHEN IT COMES TO THE  PREVAILING WAGE, THAT PREVAILING WAGE SETS A WAGE THAT ALLOWS FOR ALL PROGRAMS AND ALL DEVELOPMENT IN MY DISTRICT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS SACRED THAT ALLOWS US TO BE COMPETITIVE, TO HAVE A SAFE  WORKPLACE, AND ALLOWS US TO  PROVIDE FOR FAMILIES. SO WITH THAT, NORTHWEST INDIANA  IS HOME TO SUCH A DIVERSE AND  TALENTED WORKFORCE, AND I URGE  ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT  THIS LEGISLATION SO THAT  COMMUNITIES AND ORGANIZATIONS  THROUGHOUT OUR NATION HAVE THE  RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT  EVERYONE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY AND TOOLS TO THRIV

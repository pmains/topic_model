to the point with congressman bill Pascrell focusing on the concerns and issues facing the families of New Jersey's ninth congressional district hello I'm congressman bill Pascrell I'd like to welcome you to the latest edition up to the point our nation is built on generations of hard-working immigrants came to our shores in search of the American Dream and as a result of recent executive action taken by President Obama we are one step closer to making that dream a reality in November the president took an important step towards fixing our nation's broken immigration system by announcing his plan to put to protect up to five million undocumented immigrants from deportation as the grandson of immigrants in representing one of the most diverse districts in our country are now important this is to the millions of immigrants working hard to provide their families with me today are two of my colleagues good friends we've been on the front lines of comprehensive immigration reform in the Congress to discuss this critical debate facing our nation congressman Lewis gluttonous represents the fourth District of Illinois as a member of the Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on immigration in border security and is the chairman of the immigration task force of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Congress finger terrorists who joined President Obama on a recent trip to Las Vegas to discuss his executive action is the leading congressional advocate on immigration welcome to to the point Congressman Mike Quigley represents the fifth District of Illinois home to a large Polish American population has been a staunch advocate of expanding our nation's visa waiver program in fact legislation introduced by Congressman Quigley that would allow citizens of selected countries to travel to the United States for 90 days without a visa or included in the senate's comprehend immigration reform package thank you both for coming to the point it's great to see well I respect both of you highly not just on immigration but a lot of other issues and I brought you on here as a contrast in Lewis you've been kind of the spokesman within Latino quarters and Michael you've been talking about immigration because you would think by the discussion why many people by the pundits and by certain people on and within the Republican Party certain people that this is just folks coming in from Central America and South America people are coming to America from all over the place now I hear about this from Ukrainian polish tire about that Ukrainian polish Irish constituents it's a tremendously important issue to the LGBT community the agriculture industry is it's very important to them I hear from them as well as the hospitality industry my polish constituents under the current system most of the countries under the current system in Europe their citizens are allowed to travel to this country without a visa these are free for 90 days under the Senate bill that changes under the proposal that we talked about it allows Poland and other select companies to join this system and travel here it will add billions of dollars to our economy and create 40,000 new American jobs so this is a rainbow coalition of public-private partnership that is long past overdue so it's not just as you say one element of our important element of our community involved with this issue it's a broad spectrum we're going to talk about what the system is now because you can't reform the system which you know what is the system today Louis you've been a great advocate he spoke out long before this became a popular thing to talk about in political circles ah you would agree with what I think we've discussed this before if you're on a few occasions that you would think that the only people coming into this country are coming from the over the Rio Grande is that the case Louise well let me just put it to you this way I want to first talk a moment though about the president's executive action that you introduced us to so it's up to 5 million people but I want the American public to know who the 5 million people are that are getting relief because of the president's action the president said if you're working and you can go through a criminal background check you're going to provide us with your fingerprints at your own expense not at the government express and you come back with a clean bill of health and you need to raise your American citizen children or permanent resident children that are legally in the United States I'm going to give you a three-year work permit so you can get on the books right with the law pay your taxes and raise those kids around from the shadows I mean think about it a moment he's telling people come forward register with the government go through a criminal background check pay for it out of your own pocket paper the background check on another probably five hundred dollars for the application fee and you got American citizen children I'm gonna give you a work permit because you do not represent a danger or a threat to the country that's five million American citizen children whose parents because what's the alternative the alternative put them in foster care and deport their moms and death and have them live in this fear I long will it take us through the fourth those five million out of the 12 month ago put it to you this way if you had it because that's part of their fantasy right some people we should just deportable let us thank 11 million people at 200 people per plane it's 55,000 airplanes now you gotta go and collect we gotta catch him first she's you got to catch him first then you got to jail them and then once you detain them you got to try them and then once I mean begin to think look when you think nobody thinks about this seriously the Congress of the United States has never passed legislation right that would finance such a program in such an endeavor so what the president says is look he also said to the dreamers those that have come here as youth I'm going to expand to 250,000 more of you so what the president said so guess what now we have more agent for the border it has an important border which goes to all our borders at which goes to your question I know that's where you wanted to go bill it that you wanted to go to all the borders though they are no forty percent so nearly five million of undocumented workers in this country came with a visa and they came through the border called la a finished third and what is it Kennedy LaGuardia right you know Chicago O'Hare they overstayed their visa and they overstayed their visa so let me just say that and especially today when we know that the threat to our nation and our homeland comes from Isis come and let me tell you we are about kids with kids trying to leave Chicago to go giant to join Isis we have American citizens fighting with those who want to do harm to our nation and we know that they can come from Europe to our country so here's the point you want to keep us safe we need to control all I want to control all the borders and I want people to be right with the book because once you do that guess what it's like saying oh it just think for a moment if the police didn't have to survey a certain sector town because there's no there's nobody there because they're all right with the lock but the discussion on immigration work changes when I discuss it with my constituents or people in Jersey in general or the metropolitan area up there it changes dramatically when you start to talk about Ukrainian polish italian even was in the even Kenya you talk about Asian Koreans the conversation changes now why does the conversation change why do you think it changed well this has happened throughout our nation's history I mean it's the most recent round of immigrants and people's perception that received the burden they get Nick well it's clearly Italians and Irish and Germans at one point or another you know eventually we finally did my family history and discovered that my ancestors came to Canada first because there were quota limits during the potato famine and they crossed the Canadian border illegally when Jobs ran out there and eventually became productive citizens of the United States so if you follow history enough everyone took it at one point or another each of our families need to around some of this has to go with xenophobia and creating people who they can blame right it is you've got a pip what what troubles me most about this is that there are those who would be afraid of all outsiders who would pit one group of Americans against another and create saguaros divide us with a volume of Emily unitas unites us than divides us once we appreciate that and remember our history including other presidents Republican presidents who done very similar actions to the current president then we'll get something done okay bein what we wanted is we want to get people to be able so if we're going to fix our system right we have to find a way and because you you touch them and and Congressman quickly think of agriculture in the United States of America who's gonna drive me up no come on it no matter where you live right our food right it's going to be picked is going to be harvested with foreign hands here in the United States or it's going to be picked with foreign hands in foreign countries I forgot so you figure out because it's always going to be foreign hands because I'll be very clear I did not raise my two daughters send in the college once getting the PhD to go work in the fields it's not what I did it's not what Americans send their kids and America we are having a more sophisticated workforce a better educated workforce but you know somebody's got to pick the lettuce pick the grapes pick the cucumbers so the week somebody's kind of work in those meatpacking plants that well and I got to do that but on the other end of the economic spectrum the current system the legal system is broken as well because the quotas we have the limitations we have on stem on the higher educated folks who we train in this country then ship back our largest corporations are saying we need to keep those folks here to be competitive to continue to grow to continue to grow the American Hannah chambers of commerce support this right Oh what do you know about that you just quick so isn't it interesting chamber commerce afl-cio they spend millions of dollars here in Washington DC advocating loving for different positions fighting there together that's right evangelicals and Catholics Buddhists Hindus you know you named the religion right yeah ter all together give me a brief descrip why can't we be together on this well in the end we are if you do know that the Senate bill got to the floor on the house it would have passed I think so you agree with that I agree with that a hundred percent yeah well we should have brought it up but they do have the courage they run allow a vote no one hour and you know what as we're doing this program is set the clock tick tock yeah Senate did their job gave the House of Representatives almost a year and a half to figure out a response give me a quick minute each each what's the present system to you right now what is that system about well give me a brief one min right now it's a broken system it's not a modern system what is the system that the system should allow families first of all to be reunited right and should be strengthening and and and fortifying families it isn't it's dividing and destroying families it doesn't allow people it if it says two people come to the country illegally without the law instead of coming to this country within the guidelines of the law and with a visa and not a smuggler so I think we need to fix the system so that we can provide for our economic needs and at the same time provide you don't know it's always it's always been about mom and dad getting together and saying I want my brother yeah I want my mom I want my dad it's always been about yeah we realize forgot rarely do we get an opportunity to support something which is the right thing to do and the smart thing to do right people forget this would grow the economy dramatically improve the gross domestic product and reduce our debt and deficit it would help all local state and in our federal government from a financial point of view so is where that have an opportunity to do the right thing with our heart and our in our head this is that opportunity would you will the quota system continued after the executive order goes into effect if we even had a piece of legislation like the Senate legislation if that comes up again will the quota system continue how will we allow other people to legally come here from other countries I know we're going to i sat down with Senator McCain 12 years ago and when I left his office was so we got to work on immigration reform he said louise i gotta work on getting Republicans to allow the ones that are here to stay with their families and I said what do I have to do you have to figure out a way Louis to get Democrats to allow new workers to come well he was America's word is stay stuck with the with that program and thanks then we got it passed we're going to take a small brazier we're gonna come right back and get ten you want discussion with two great Americans I consider your greater man because only great Americans will talk about immigration reform we'll be right back folks stay tuned wait a minute all people are people stereotyping is wrong and it hurts all of us got Gary I'm happy a message from your American Muslim neighbors and we're right back here with our two great guests today congressman Lewis gluttonous and congressman Michael Quigley I just happen to like these two guys as you can well notice we argue sometimes but we still like each other when we respect each other that's what's important about this debate in this discussion you were saying Mike we started the show talk about not only Latinos want to come to this country but a lot of other people from around the world I don't know what the cuddle iron with the percentage is of Latino when we took all the undocumented 11 million plus what percentage are Latino oh I would say 60 60 % of the undocumented are from and that's logical we share a border with Mexico I mean the hemisphere is the America so that makes a lot of sense but then we have immigrants from all and and and I'm so happy quickly brought it up Chicago has more people of Polish descent living in the city of Chicago any other the only other city that beats it is Warsaw Warsaw and that's my damn no the city of Chicago if you go to quigleys district my district so you see the Korean part right you see the Polish Ukrainian part the Mexican but I mean a weekly average part diverse district we have very diverse desert and when you look the better my district and when you look at it you say wow all of these folks if you were to take away all of the immigrants that have come to the city of Chicago in the last 30 years Chicago would not be ranked the third city I think we'd be fit for six it's it's what's keeping the city I like they open up the stores you know that that they rehab you go to home depot and you go ask people okay were you born here or not born here you see all those people that weren't born in the United States of America going to fix it up there I add this though when it comes to just the Polish population eggs an example of what this means to the rest of the world one senator Kirk and I traveled to Poland and every person we met on the public-private sector side we met the Archbishop of Cracow we met their governmental leaders we met people on the street first thing they said is why is Poland excluded from visa waiver yeah most of the rest of Europe has this program I was we are one of your strongest allies militarily you could argue no one was better right better allies Colin's been there for us every times it so this simple they see it as a disrespect is a there would be a courtesy to include them that so our standing in the world has looked at the way we handle this then clearly visa travel is important to them but also the notion of how we handle on the undocumented can we talk about mass deportations how we look as a country to the rest of the world is important we need to remember that I I want to talk over briefly go back to the subject of that immigrants documented or undocumented are taking away American jobs I think that that's a ruse I think it's it's nothing more than a false argument like border security we can have a wall five miles high across the entire Rio Grande and we still be talking about security problems we want to have good relationships with Mexico I'm sure they won't have good relations with us we need to solve this problem for a lot of international regions homeland security reasons what do you say to those people say you're going to take our jobs these guys and gals are going to take our jobs and we should be training Americans for those jobs and not allowing them to take first of all they're already here working in our society they create jobs for the rest of us I mean just think one moment if you eliminated the 11 million undocumented workers you would eliminate one out of every 20 workers other words five percent of the purchasing power of the United States workforce would disappear from our economy everybody buys cars everybody buys homes everybody by his Goods everybody shops at the grocery store everybody is involved in the economy number one but I do want to say a couple of things quickly number one I want one system one labor system where everybody has the same guarantees and the same protections and the same safety standards and the same protections of wages one we don't have that and for those who don't want immigration reform what they are allowing is the largest guest worker program possible in the United States of America but it goes on monitor what I want is all Americans therefore you don't have one group of Americans engaging another group of Americans and allowing wages to be lowered because you know what you have unscrupulous employers who say hmm why should I hire an American citizen I can hire one of those undocumented exploit them pay them less and then not pay my fair share of taxes to the government that's why I think what the president is doing is sensational because he's saying come forward get right with the law pay your taxes your employer has to pay and the government does better and you feel more secure second and get out the by end of the line right get to the back of the line you know you're not going to Americans budget we're just going to give you a chance to wait for Congress that put another thing bill how do you protect us from future workers coming and protect American workers you have to have a verification system right yes so that here's what happens I go and I apply for a job and when I applied for the job my employer says oh I'm going to take Social Security and I'm going to verify that this is a good search and that you are eligible to vote to work mr. Gutierrez and then the government sends them back an email and says okay that person and if the employer hires people that haven't gone through that verification which is going on now then we send the crook which is the employer that employs people so we need that now of a sudden people saying not a good idea to go to the United States of America because if we go we can't get through the verification system because they're locking people up who hire people who haven't gone to the verification see I'm for security but I understand security is more than just the border and the government is also when people are here in the United government has a right to know who's coming into this country and was leaving too and a right to riddle lab that we have them right now to work and not to work in this cuz but our system is broken so we want what we want to do is bring people out from cover absolutely and this is good this is healthy and get rid of those people who are felons who've committed crime except no one another go after the felons not the families go after the gangbangers don't keep going after children and making them lose their parents um let's go after the criminal element and if we focus if we legalize people then the ones that are left outside we can now put our focus on our attention on them when I had you know I've always felt this way about him and we need to changes in immigration when it came to the Congress 18 years ago the thing that got me emotionally involved these are people who fought in the war Iraq and I've understand what a great point had to come home to abuse because they were colon called undocumented they came here on this visa or that kind of visa stayed I shouldn't have done that they met help that no wrong but we need to correct it can't you say it's wrong what are you doing about it that's what really got me involved when I saw how these soldiers being treated by fellow Americans they had laid down their lives practically for us on the battlefield and we are saying to those people you fought for us pre can't you can't be one of us that was the motivator for Truman desegregating the troops that was the motivator for many presents to finally turn it for Lincoln to take more bold actions he did during the Civil War when he saw who was willing to fight for this country that made a change I think it has affected up residence in Congress since that time to see if you're going to fight for this country you should be able to stay that's a band had the same rights as everyone else Jill that's why we did repealed Don't Ask Don't Tell killed in North Jersey and their parents are questionable as to whether how they got here and we treated almost being treated like axe murderers these are people that fall for us defended us regardless how you felt about either war that's not the case here we're talking about human beings and the other thing is that they always make the undocumented sound like they're the unamerican yes but if you look at them what is the president doing he's saying if you are an adult and working in the United States you got to be working you've been here for five years and ready to go register go to a criminal background check so you come back with a clean bones the glory adventure you have to have American citizen children I mean these are American families these kids what do you want their memories of childhood to be is an immigration agent gonna knock on the door and take away my mom or my dad oh you want their I want their memories to be the memories your children have my troll you know what the memory my grandson's going to have of scoring on the Sacramento no of being out to playing hockey of excelling and graduating first in his as of this first bicycle of his first girlfriend of his first everything those should be the memories kids have of joy and happiness and growing up in a family sheltered and protected we don't will the president's order stand in the courts I think so because again very briefly why his presidents such as President Reagan and President Bush passed under the same type of authority prosecutorial discretion they have been upheld therefore this press the fact Reagan Reagan did it after I bill was passed they didn't said then go far enough correct 1986 we passed the immigration reform and control that gave three million people a pathway to American citizens 1986 what happened was Congress explicitly excluded their dependents so it said Oh Louise you qualify for a visa or not you but that doesn't mean your wife and your children so you know what Reagan did Reagan said well that's not right yeah so I'm gonna protect them took Congress even though Congress explicitly said I'm excluded President Reagan said I'm and then Bush protected them and guess what happened in 1991 the law finally caught up with the protection of the president and we included them so then they stop protecting us right in the world in in and you know what the world didn't end not only that we got four we've got five million possibly that the president and you know I'll tell you what when we sign them up and we finally pass immigration reform they're gonna be ready and I just want to go back to something my friend Quigley said earlier if you legalize 11 million people in the first ten years it's a hundred billion dollars in the first ten years you gain to the Treasury because you put them on the books and they're paying taxes and you know what the interesting thing 11 million people guess what 11 million people don't do to they get legalized and they have uncertainty in their life they don't buy that car they don't buy that house they don't start that business once they have security there's an explosion of Economic Opportunity and activities we know small businesses are the engine of most jobs in America but guess what happens in the second ten years a trillion dollars because now they become fully integrated in our economy good for the Academy to your question who should care about this I dad senior citizens to the point that the congressman gutierrez just met in point you're helping Social Security be far more solvent you're adding a base there you know countries there are countries in this world very important point where they're facing serious problems with their aging population they don't have a base that's going to pay the price for Social Security as time goes on are the immigrant community the undocumented immigrant community want to just follow the undocumented to be younger yeah and has many more years to contribute to social security that's what we need we need more people yeah we're about these metal grams Sadie and they're all going to contribute that is some helps most of these two entitlement absolutely Social Security absolutely Medicare and that's a whole other poem but right now they're here working in their employer not may not be sending those FICA taxes to repelling look I want to thank both of you this is the tip of the iceberg but we I think we got to the point where you guys we got to the point very good very excellent and we want to have you back again to talk about the effect upon social security and medicare and medicaid as well for that sir thank you thank you thank you for watching this edition to the

this is congressman darrell Issa it's April 3rd approximately two weeks ago I spoke to many if not most of my constituents in the 50th congressional district in a tell a town hall meeting at that time we answered questions as best we could and his best scientist and our government could answer it we've learned a couple of things since that time the CDC and many other organizations working for the Trump administration have now issued new guidance our governor has issued new guidance and I'd like to quickly go over a couple of them because I think they're the essentials for this week first of all we now know that the corona virus can be spread by asymptomatic people so we can no longer rely on thermometers or whether somebody's sneezing or coughing you have to assume that everyone you come in contact with that isn't in your own home it is in fact a potential carrier and as such you need to take precautions no handshaking no touching and particularly protect your face and note your mouth and nose from being affected by incoming spray for the benefit of others because you may not know if you've become infected please wear a mask also to protect from spray going out that doesn't change the fact the distancing also matters the virus doesn't live for long in the air but we now know that it does live for a short period of time not just from sneezing but even if somebody just is breathing in and out it could spread the virus these steps in addition to the others we've taken of cleanliness not touching your face washing your hands regularly all are slowing the spread of this virus and giving government and private sector the opportunity to get caught up caught up on ventilators caught up on hospitals but also giving them a chance to develop mitigation techniques just this week the FDA has approved a No number of procedures that will be done in hospitals that can dramatically reduce the chances that an infection will lead to serious injury or death but again the message for this week is we now know that this virus can be spread by people that don't look like they have the virus or even by yourself not knowing you have it and we now know and we've been asked by our governor to wear face protection that could include a scarf or anything else that that in fact will keep the moist air from your mouth from going out and of course droplets from coming in I plan on making similar videos available anytime there's a development where I believe all of us would benefit from sharing that knowledge again thank you so much and stay safe

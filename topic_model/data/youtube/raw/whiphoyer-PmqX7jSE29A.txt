back well I thank very much the gentleman for Connecticut for his comments particularly highlighting how the majority party considering this legislation cut out the public entirely speaker Ryan when he took the speakership talked about transparency he talked about regular order he talked about doing things so that the people would know what we're doing not only were there no hearings in the house not only were there no witnesses in the house as the gentleman knows there were no hearings in the Senate there were no witnesses in the Senate and in a short timeframe the Republicans are trying to pass a massive increase in the national debt so that in effect as the gentleman knows they say they're cutting taxes I'm going to talk about how that's not really true particularly for the middle class it's not true but they are substantially raising taxes on every one of the children in this country who will become more indebted and in their time will have to pay back the money that is borrowed that is borrowed to give this tax cut so I thank the gentleman for highlighting those very important facts thank the gentleman and I thank him for his service on the Ways and Means Committee mr. speaker at this time I ask unanimous consent that all members have five legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of my special order without objection and the subject of my special order as we have seen is the dangerous very dangerous tax bill that this House passed and that the Senate is now considering in fact of course the Senate bill is worse than the House bill if one can imagine that on November 16th the Republican majority in this house passed a bill to raise taxes on 36 million middle-class households and place our country another 1.7 trillion now you'll hear 1.5 trillion and you're here 1.7 tree and what's the difference the difference is about two hundred billion dollars that we will pay in interest to others to affect this tax cut so not only is it going to be the 1.5 trillion dollars immediately impacted by the tax cut itself it will be the two hundred billion dollars additional that will have to pay to borrow the money to get the tax cut and as I'm going to point out give that tax cut essentially for the most part to the wealthiest enterprises in America two hundred and twenty seven Republicans voted to do that to their constituents every single democratic representative who was present joined by 13 Republicans who did what in my opinion many of their colleagues wanted to do but for political reasons not policy reasons chose not to do they did so mr. speaker following impassioned remarks by the majority leader McCarthy and by speaker Ryan both addressed this house and the American people and claimed to be pushing these tax bills in order to help the working people of our country a worthy objective an important objective and perhaps one could justify this extraordinary escalation in the national debt the largest probably increase in the national debt of any single bill that has been passed they cited struggling families and the need to provide a leg up to those in our middle class those of course are very resonant messages very important messages frankly we ought to be talking about how we create jobs not dead but they're being employed to sell a tax plan that would do exactly the opposite of what they say in his speech on the floor speaker Ryan lamented and I'm quoting 78% of our workers in this country today are living paycheck to paycheck instead of thinking about getting ahead families are struggling just to get by he's right about that and he is right to be concerned about that what he is wrong in is his response those living paycheck to paycheck will be the ones hurt the most by this tax scam let me repeat that the speaker talks about those living paycheck to paycheck that concern is an absolute legitimate concern for every one of us in this house and every member of the Senate unfortunately he has offered a bill however that will hurt the very ones he says that he wants to protect they will see their taxes go up over the next decade in that same period as middle-class families are struggling to get by they will watch the wealthiest get farther and farther ahead and this is not about class warfare this is about a judgment who needs help who needs lifting up well he talked about the people who need lifting up the problem is he didn't lift them up they'll watch the wealthy be lifted up and they're very high right now god bless them why I asked with the Republican tax plan take 1.7 trillion dollars away from our children and grandchildren and give 62% of it to the top 1% mr. speaker the people get it the people think this bill is not going to help them that's what polls show and they're right under the Republicans plan it's wealthy wealthy individuals like Donald Trump who win a regular who win and regular working Americans in our middle class we're trying to get ahead who lose House Republican leaders cajoled their members Kajol is a very polite word they pressured they scared their members they said if you don't pass this bill you're gonna lose the election not because the people are for it but because as one member said from New York their donors demanded it they urged their members to vote for a flawed bill many of them did not want and that none of them believed would become law they did that so they could hand the reins to the Senate to send back a version no one had yet read or contemplated they put their House Majority on the hook to accept whatever the Senate would pass word-for-word we'll see whether they do that that Senate bill that is now being considered would deeply harm middle-class families particularly those in congressional districts across the country where more taxpayers choose to deduct their state and local taxes like my state and other states dozens of House Republicans from such districts voted enthusiastically to move the process along another words they voted against their tax payers and for their party party above people to move it along by supporting the house tax bill with a promise that it would be improved in the Senate these members would be asked to make further concessions against the interest their constituents to vote for the Senate bill were to come to this floor because it is worse for their constituents not better that's not now that Congress is supposed to work mr. speaker that's not regular was an American businesses seeking to grow in our economy have been asking Congress to enact tax reform that is bipartisan and permanent you heard mr. Larson talking about the 1986 bill it was a bill that was worked out between President Reagan speaker Tip O'Neill chairmen down rest done Rostenkowski Dan Rostenkowski a member from the Democratic Party from Illinois and the gentleman from Oregon the chairman of the Finance Committee a Republican the Republican bills in the house in the Senate can be called neither bipartisan nor permanent so what can we call it in his floor remarks before the vote on their house bill speaker Ryan called it quote the single biggest thing we can do to grow the economy to restore opportunity and to help middle income families that are struggling that's not true mr. speaker however it is the single biggest thing we can do to put our children and grandchildren further into debt I have heard so many of my Republican colleagues stand on this floor and say we cannot spend this money because our children will have to pay the bill and they're right you have a pay for a problem mr. speaker we'll be paying for what we buy here we're not paying we're borrowing 1.5 trillion dollars as I said earlier to give to some of our wealthiest citizens for that is what their plan would do raise taxes on the middle class today and on our children and grandchildren tomorrow to pay for the wealthiest few to get tax cuts that they don't need and then won't grow our economy let me stress I think everybody in this room everybody in the country would like to be wealthy this is not talking about penalizing the wealthy it is simply to say god bless you you've done well but we need to make sure that others do well as well the University of Chicago Booth School of Business released a survey mr. speaker on November 21st just a few days ago in which 42 expert economists were asked whether the Republican tax bill would produce the higher economic growth promised by its authors 42 of the most prominent economists only one only one said that it would do so and ironically later admitted he had misread the question none of the 42 not one agreed that the tax cuts for the very wealthy included in the Republican bill would eventually pay for themselves and that is why we say it is one of the greatest debt creating pieces of legislation than any of us have considered former Treasury secretary Robert Rubin who presided over the basis for four years of balanced budgets so he has some real credibility on how to bring balance to our fiscal cluster in America he served at the time of his start budget surpluses pointed out this fallacy and his op-ed in the Washington Post on November 15th he said this the tax cuts he wrote will not increase growth and given their fiscal effects would likely have a significant and increasing negative impact he went on to make several compelling arguments about the dangers of the Republican tax proposals and I ask unanimous consent that a copy of his op-ed piece be included in the record in full without objection Thank You mr. speaker furthermore according to the Joint Committee on taxation a nonpartisan group Speaker Ryan was flat wrong flat-out wrong to say that their plan would ensure that quote the average family at every income level gets a tax cut the Joint Committee says that is not true I presume the speaker was misinformed because taxes would go up on all income groups below $50,000 perhaps the speaker misspoke speaker Ryan said I'm a chart guy well I like charts myself mr. speaker and I want to bring up this first joint I'll bring this a little closer so I can explain it speaker claimed that a family of four making fifty nine thousand would get a 1182 tax cut in the first year alone well now if you hear that that sounds I suppose like a pretty good deal unfortunately for that family their cut would shrink every year this is the shrinkage and then it would drop precipitously by 2024 it would become a tax increase increase increase as you see that increase escalates the four years 24 25 26 and 27 so starting in the seventh year of this program middle America $50,000 you get a tax increase but guess what that's not what happens to the wealthiest in America it's even worse the speaker mentioned the family making fifty nine thousand dollars a year and what he said is they get one thousand one hundred and eighty two dollars a year in the tax cut what he didn't say is what the upper 1% get they get one thousand one hundred and ninety eight dollars per week fifty-two times more than the middle-class families that the speaker spoke about and lamented the fact that they needed more dollars in their pocket he didn't talk about the wealthiest he didn't say what they got I don't blame him because in his bill he decided to give one thousand one hundred ninety eight dollars and fifty two cents a week to the wealthiest and one thousand one hundred eighty two dollars a year to that middle class family he says is struggling and living paycheck to paycheck what kind of fairness is that what kind of rationale is that what kind of real helped in the middle class is that that's about by the way twenty five dollars per week versus 1198 fifty two per week speaker Ryan showed us a chart that highlighted how into the House bill those middle-class families promised a tax increase to get to see an extra 1182 in savings the first year we put it down and then we put fifty two layers above that for the people in the upper 1% under that same plan as their cut shrinks you saw that in the last chart the wealthiest taxpayers would see an average tax cut of 1198 every week and it's even a wider disparity under the Senate bill now that is a gulf of disparity a gulf of unfairness a gulf of not helping the average working person in America but the Senate bill the Senate bill is even worse the Senate GOP tax scam would increase taxes on 82 million remember I say the house built 36 million middle-class taxpayers got to increase well the Senate has doubled that actually more than double that 82 million middle-class households will get a tax increase under the Senate tax bill and with substantial tax reduces on 36 million middle-class households over the next Gaede next decade in the House bill it's hard to imagine a worse plan yet somehow Senate Republicans achieved it Tax Policy Center found that under the another nonpartisan analytic group found that under the sunsetting individual benefits in a few short years even as it offers permanent get this follow this with we talk about speaker Ryan's spoke from that rostrum talked about these struggling Americans living paycheck to paycheck and he offered a bill and the Senate is now doubling down on the proposal of making sure those struggling Americans got over the life of this bill less and less and less and then finally paid more and more and more while the wealthiest had no cut Tax Policy Center said that the sunsetting individual benefits in a few short years even as it offers permanent corporate tax cuts eighty two million middle-class individuals and households will pay more in taxes than they would under the current system Mr Speaker I want to make that point again the Tax Policy Center says people are going to pay more under this tax bill some 82 million them than they would under the current system on tap on top of that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has pointed out that under the Senate bill the the the end undermine the Affordable Care Act so not only would their taxes be increased over the life of this bill but 13 million Americans would lose their health care under this under the Senate bill not the House bill but under the Senate bill and that's what the house is going to be asked to vote on I hope the Senate doesn't pass that mr. Larson talked about sequester and the pay-go Act requiring a 25 billion dollar cut in Medicare as a result of this bill the Senate has added in their legislation to adversely affect the Affordable Care Act which will adversely affect 13 million Americans some of them may be the same people they get the tax increase some may not they would kick thirteen million off health care so the Republican tax plan is not bipartisan and it's not permanent tax reform the way you achieve those as I said at the beginning is through bipartisan cooperation but as mr. Larson pointed out there was no intention to do that no intention to include the public no intention to have markups over a period of time they did have markups but they were very short in duration and no American had the opportunity to weigh in and give their opinion and there were no hearings and there were less than zero witnesses I guess there can't be less than zero there were zero witnesses so the bill is not a tax cut speaker Ryan is also trying trying to describe it as a job creator now again we're talking about correctly the folks in this country who are living paycheck to paycheck and having a hard time and we need to help them we need to work on creating them jobs by the way there's no jobs bill that's been sent down here from the president but they claim this is a jobs bill matter of fact they claim that it explodes the debt cost taxpayers one point nine trillion but it would create they say 870 excuse me 890 new jobs now ladies and gentlemen in order to create what they say are 890 new jobs and by the way going back to secretary Rubin he does not believe that will happen he's the one that led us to balanced budgets in fact every one of those jobs every single job it's gonna cost 1.9 million dollars to create that's what the speaker said just going to create 879 a million we're gonna borrow 1.7 trillion to do it my golly you could yeah you know give everybody a hundred thousand bucks you'd be way ahead of the game but that's not what was done we're creating large large debt and we will not create the jobs the speaker said and if we did they would cost 1.9 million dollars per job according to this conservative Tax Foundation using the most optimistic model projecting economic growth so far presented that may be technically true over ten years now but with a price tag of 1.7 trillion dollars in added debt over the same period that means that each job would cost 1.9 million jobs while 82 million working Americans those struggling Americans of which Paul Ryan spoke would get a tax increase under the Senate bill nearly 2 million of added debt to create a single job so this clearly isn't a jobs bill either this has already been discussed it can't be called bipartisan Republican leader after Republican leader after Republican leader has lamented the fact that we passed the Affordable Care Act without it being bipartisan the difference of course was we had literally thousands of meetings scores well over 60 hearings amendments offered by Republicans and Democrats it took over a year of consideration by the country well vetted controversial but well vetted this bill has been rushed through without hearings without any kind of consideration and input from the public in 1986 30 hearings in 2017 0 hearings witnesses I'm repeating what mr. Larsen said but it's important to understand the dramatic difference between a bipartisan bill with President Ronald Reagan and speaker Tip O'Neill leading the way for bipartisanship and agreement on a bill that by the way was revenue neutral it did not create any new debt as opposed to the 1.7 trillion that's with 80 trillion that will put every child in America deeply in debt for decades to come in 86 450 witnesses in 2017 zero bipartisan support yes bipartisan support no markup I mentioned markup that's when you put the bill together when you give it thoughtful consideration that you offer amendments you try to perfect it 26 days in 1986 four days in 2017 this is a bill of over 600 pages I remember everybody saying how long the Affordable Care Act was and you possibly couldn't do it again over a year and a half of consideration of that bill for days introduced next week markup for days on the floor I was here in 86 mr. speaker the last time we rewrote our tax code that was a truly bipartisan process I hope everybody read the remarks of Senator John McCain when he came back to the Senate and voted to move the process forward on the Affordable Care Act but then voted against the final product he voted and he gave a speech in which he said mr. president I've been here speaking to the president of the Senate mr. president I've been here for some period of time and my experience has essentially been that when we did things in a partisan way then when either lasting nor very good but when we do things in a bipartisan way they're much better and they're much more permanent there's much more confidence in that product that was reached in a bipartisan way Speaker Ryan made a point in his remarks about how long overdue we are for tax overhaul and he said it's been 31 years since we last did this now of course he didn't say I was chairman of the Ways and Means Committee for 11 months and didn't report out a single tax bill I'm not sure why but that was the case we did bipartisan in 1986 we did permanent tax reform we did it together and we did it in a way that was paid for that's not what this is neither the house bill nor the Senate bill achieves those key aims the Republican tax overhaul process is dangerously flawed precisely because it is partisan because it rejects the benefits of compromise in favor of the pitfalls of expediency I called it in my speech in opposition to its adoption reckless and feckless it was reckless because it would heap that 1.7 trillion with the t 1.7 trillion dollars of additional debt on our party on our country on our children on our people Bob Rubin in that column which I referred to said that that debt would undermine expansion because it would Rob the capital markets of money that could be used to build small businesses and to build medium-sized businesses and invest in large businesses to create and keep jobs feckless because the same people who used to call themselves fiscally responsible Senator McConnell speaker Ryan senator hatch others that I could name have all stood on the floor of the house or in a press conference and said we need to have the debt reduced and yet they offer a bill that adds one point seven trillion dollars to the debt feckless because the same people who used to call themselves fiscally responsible are now choosing to ignore fiscal sustainability in favor of a short-lived political win this is not about policy it is about politics it is about appealing to a relatively small group of very very connected people but it's our country that will lose I told people during that speech I've been in office for some time I'm served in the state Senate and now in the house it takes no courage no courage to vote for tax cut what takes courage is to pay for what you buy whether it's national security which I support whether it's education which is we don't invest in our country will not be great it is great in part because we have invested in our education system unless we invest in the health of our people which is the health of our society we will not be great unless we invest in the security of our people domestically in law in order enforcement in protection for our people it will not be great unless we invest in basic biomedical research to make sure that the diseases that exist now and then may exist in the future can be met with medical cures and palliative we will not be great if we sink our country deeply deeply deeply into debt and do not have the courage to say in this generation we will pay for what we need and not simply buy and pass the debt along to our children and to our grandchildren because that's what we're doing in this tax bill it is not only an intellectually bankrupt policy it is an immoral policy that we pursue as the Senate version takes shape mr. speaker Republicans who voted grudgingly for the house bill ought to be deeply concerned and I hope for the sake of their country they're good people they're good people on both sides of this aisle they're conscientious people on both sides of their aisle there are Americans on both sides of this aisle Americans who have sworn to protect and defend the Constitution of our country and have as well sworn to protect the people of this country there ought to be deep concern among people of good conscience concern that it does not meet the very same criteria that speaker Ryan set forth and laying out what tax reform ought to achieve and what he claimed their house bill achieved neither does it adhere to the speaker's clear promise not to package together separate matters into the same legislation make no mistake the Senate bill House Republicans will be asked to vote for isn't just a tax hike for the middle class although that it is it is also a repeal of significant component of the Affordable Care Act which will hurt that same middle class it may have been difficult for Republicans to cast their votes for vague promises on November 16th but I suggest to you mr. speaker it will be even more difficult to do so for a legislative product that puts their constituents those the speaker talked about struggling just to get by people who if they have a $500 debt are not sure they can pay it it will affect those folks and evening and put them in even greater danger should the Senate bill make it back to the house Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues in the Senate to reject this bill I urge my colleagues in the house to look deeply into their souls and not at their polls and reflect upon what they're doing to their country by perpetuating the fiscally irresponsible policies of borrowing a borrowing a borrowing and not having the courage to pay this bill this generations bills now and not pass them along to our children and to our grandchildren every member of this house and of the Senate mr. speaker or look themselves in the mirror and say when I gave those speeches when I referenced that to the press was I being honest am i following a policy today that is consistent with that assertion I think they will come to the inexorable answer no if I vote for this tax bill I am NOT and therefore I hope that all of us will reject this partisan piece of legislation that vastly increases our debt increases the taxes on middle-class workers threatens social security with a twenty five billion dollar cut and threatens our economy let us have the courage to serve our people honestly and take the tough vote and then come together in a bipartisan fashion and do what we showed we could do in 1986 pass a bipartisan bill that yes makes our corporations competitive internationally and yes gives the bulk of the tax cuts to those who the speaker referred to as struggling they're the ones who need relief and we can do that in a bipartisan fashion and we can pay for it David camp showed us the way I didn't agree with all of his bill but he showed the courage a republic from Michigan who was chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and put a bill on tax reform it was paid for and the Republicans were in charge of this house and they dismissed it out of hand too tough mr. speaker let's do the right thing let's reject this bill I yield back the balance of my time the gentleman yields back you

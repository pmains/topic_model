woman maxine waters she is also the chief deputy whip and is going to have a big say in all of this congresswoman those are fighting words are they not they certainly are and you know first of all we've got to work very hard and barbara boxer is leading that effort with other women in the senate saying to senator reid that we cannot have matching stupak language in the senate bill that you know we can all live with the hyde language we have lived with that for years that's that language that simply says you can't spend government money for abortions uh unless uh it's in the case of rape incest uh or um one of one other issue so i we can live with that language but we can't go beyond that okay and you believe that the stupak amendment becomes much more restrictive of women's rights and goes back and really tries to undermine roe v wade oh it certainly does as a matter of fact this amendment not only says that if you receive government subsidies uh in any way that you cannot purchase uh you know abortion services on the exchange it basically says for people who can even afford to pay uh the only way they're going to be able to get it is through a supplemental policy and we just know that these insurance companies are not going to offer two different plans and so it just won't be available congresswoman uh maxine waters with us do you think that bart stupak is bluffing do you think he has the votes and do you think those conservative democrats would actually blow up health care reform over this issue i certainly hope not i'm told that he said he was surprised that he got as far as he did with his amendment in the house after he had gained the support to get it into our house bill so i'm thinking that you know he really does not believe that they're going to kill this health care bill i mean this is too big it's too important to democrats and so i'm just hopeful uh that he certainly will not pursue that but congresswoman why did the stupak amendment stay in i mean why did speaker pelosi allow it to come out of the house and the democratic caucus allowed to come out of the house with that kind of language i mean you're just banking on the senate taking care of things correct well no uh it's not quite that it's um she was working to pass health care reform out of the house they basically um said to her that if you put this bill on the floor without our amendment we're not going to vote for it you can't pass it out of this house and so she allowed it to come up and it got even more votes than she expected it to get do you think this can get done before the first of the year i don't know but i certainly know it's not going to meet the deadlines that have been talked about you know read at one time it said by thanksgiving some are saying by the end of the year it may go much further than that and congresswoman let me ask you this very directly it let's say that the stupak amendment gets some teeth over on the senate side you got orrin hatch there he's going to basically try to put the same language in there it would this be a breaking off point for many democrats maybe to a third party i mean if if this issue is going to stop barack obama's number one domestic agenda after getting a mandate from the people in winning nine bush states what else does it take for the progressives to get their message a point wouldn't this be a breaking off point and set the foundation for a third party what do you think well there are several things going on here one is nancy pelosi has said to a number of the women in the house that that stupak language would never make it out of conference so she's committed to making sure that that language is not in the conference committee now she appoints the conferees so i'm i'm banking on that uh but to be sure there's also a petition circulating by women in the house who are declaring that they will not vote for a bill uh that has a stupak language in it so this is i mean this is a high-stakes game we're playing here there's no doubt about it i mean and so you have stupak uh who's saying that uh this bill they'll kill the bill before they allow it uh to pass without their language and you have women saying uh that they democratic women that they will not vote for a bill with the language in it so we've got a lot to play out here we're all anxious to see what's going to come out on the senate side we understand that reid has already called a democratic caucus to tell them how the bill has been going and congresswoman i got to stop you there we're going to go to harry reid right now coming out of the senate meeting let's take it live right now this is harry reid right out of the senate democratic caucus meeting right thank you just completed a caucus it was really very very good we all acknowledge this legislation is a tremendous step forward why because it saves lives saves money and protects medicare makes medicare stronger we've traveled really a long ways to where we are and tonight begins the last leg of this journey that we've been on now for some time the american people president obama have asked us for health insurance reform it does two things one makes it more affordable for the american people remember this past year 750 000 americans filed bankruptcy over half of those bankruptcies dealt with health care costs more than half the people filed bankruptcy because of health care costs had insurance so not only do we make it more affordable for every american we also certainly do it in a fiscally responsible way we're not going to add a dime to the deficit in fact quite the opposite we'll cut the problems we have with money around here by as much as three quarters of a trillion dollars and this bill is going to do good things over the next 10 years for so many different people in our society 98 percent of the american people those that have medicare will be included in that number will have health insurance and we'll make sure that 30 million more americans who don't have health insurance today will soon have it i want to repeat we not only protect medicare we're making it stronger the numbers i've just gone over are pretty impressive as a and i have no doubt that the american people agree with that although we're proud of these figures these numbers that we've given you we can't afford to really overlook what this is really all about more accurately we can't afford to overlook who this is all about this about a parent for example my friend jeff hill from searchlight nevada 23 years old he goes off his parents health insurance policy within six weeks he's diagnosed testicular cancer his parents who have no money have already expended fifteen thousand dollars having their son operated on he's now chemotherapy all kinds of complications they had to put his he couldn't put the chemo in his veins we're changing this now it's going to be 26 years old years of age that they can people can stand their parents coverage we want to make sure that every american can afford good coverage it's about small businesses in nevada and around the country we have provisions in this building a small business this about women we have great provisions in this bill for women we're going to make them better on the floor we had a real good discussion in the caucus tonight how it's so outrageous the word that we've gotten recently on mammograms women should be able to go get a mammogram and not have to wait until they're 50 years old pre-existing disabilities we want to make sure that everyone who reads this bill and we're going to it'll be online tonight want to make sure that everyone reads this bill reads some of the provisions in this bill that just speak volumes pre-existing disabilities i was in uh texas last week and a man came to me he said i'm a lawyer i make a lot of money he said but i don't know what's going to happen to my daughter she's 23 years old has multiple sclerosis let's go i'm an old man now what's going to happen when my wife and i aren't able to take care of her well we know if we don't change it she won't get any insurance she has a pre-existing disability so this is about families i've talked about one family from searchlight this for our economy is a renewal this is a jobs pill um and the finish line is really inside we're going to hear it tonight from senator dodd senator harkin durbin schumer murray and then we'll take a few questions you're all going to be briefed harry reid 15 tonight that's senate majority leader harry reid at a press conference they just got out of a uh caucus meeting and uh i want to hear what chris dodd has to say he has been the chairman of the help committee here he is acknowledging the remarkable work done by majority leader harry reid and his staff over these last number of weeks emerging the bill from the senate finance committee and i regret that our colleague max abacus is not here this evening you know his mother's been rather ill and couldn't be here tonight but the finance committee has done a remarkable job as all of you know i was asked back a number of months ago to fill in for ted kennedy and i regret deeply he's not here this evening just how proud he would be that at long last after almost a career-long effort on his part to reach a point where we might finally be able to have a national health care strategy in this country that would increase access for all americans provide stability for those who have insurance improve the coverage for those who are underinsured and at long last for millions who have no insurance whatsoever to know they can rest easy that they'll have the protection of some form of safety net insurance that will give them the help they need today and their families if they're afflicted with a problem uh health-wise so i regret he's not here tonight to be a part of this but i want to also acknowledge the tremendous work that's been done by staffs and others to bring us to this point i'm particularly proud of the fact that this legislation includes a very strong public option investments in preventive care added protections for our seniors that the leaders talked about in a program provide long-term services and support for those who are disabled the fact that we have a bill here that comes under the president's mandate that we have a cost less than 900 billion dollars over 10 years the fact that we save 127 billion dollars in the first decade of this bill and 650 billion dollars in savings in the second decade these are real savings for americans while simultaneously increasing that access that is so critically critically important the cbo has confirmed that the bill will extend uh coverage to as the leaders pointed out to somewhere around 98 including the medicare recipients in our country that's a remarkable achievement and a great success as well and today we add this as a fiscally responsible bill that saves money obviously in the short and longer term and is a real victory for reforms this isn't just about an effort that went on over the last number of months senator chris dodd on capitol hill along with senate majority leader harry reid saying that this is a job bill no mention of the possible 60 votes but there was a uh release put out by ben nelson from nebraska who said he wants a few days to read it because he wants to make sure he knows what he's voting on let's go back to maxine waters over on the house side congresswoman are you encouraged by what you're hearing over on the senate side tonight well it sounds very good i'm very pleased to hear from don that we have a very robust or strong public option that's one of the things we were looking for but i find it rather strange there are no women members of the senate uh in that press conference talking about what's happening with reproductive rights and whether or not this tupac amendment is going to hold forth in that bill or what they're going to do about it i think we anxiously await that information also okay congresswoman appreciate your time tonight thanks so much congresswoman maxine waters with us here on the ed show tonight and

for more on this let's bring in louisiana congressman steve scalise here's karl rove a little bit earlier in the show talking about this very race it's a reaction to the body administration in what has historically been republican turf but not by a huge margin in recent years and yet to have that kind of of a gap to have you know 62 percent of the people who turned out voting republican and 36 37 percent voting democrat that says something about the relative enthusiasm of the base congressman as somebody who is working as you are to try to turn the republicans back into power in 2022 is this a sign of things to come do you think yeah dana bill good morning what i see all across the country is dramatic enthusiasm for the republican party and a lot of really really serious concern about the direction that the socialist democrats are taking us whether it's nancy pelosi's agenda now biden has embraced that far left bernie sanders agenda people don't want this to become a socialist nation yet you see how far they're moving and i think you saw saturday that was a reaction to that far left trillions of dollars of spending raising taxes to all under the name of infrastructure that's not where america is you saw susan wright who was endorsed by president trump led the way in what had been a swing district last year today we've got two republicans in that runoff it tells you the country is rejecting socialism and that's why we're going to win the house back next year sir dana and i sit here every morning and during the commercial we have a lot of theories about a lot of things that's going on all over america and all over the world and one thing i bet you do one thing we're trying to guess at is what can pass if you're proposing 2.3 on one hand trillion and 1.8 trillion on another i do you end up merging the bills i mean what in a 50 50-50 congress where i think you'll have what a democrats have a three-seat majority after this texas special election is decided well what does pass well sanity would pass and if they just dropped the word trillions from their lexicon and sat down with republicans and says how can we do something in a responsible way not adding taxes or deficits but actually working with republicans and democrats together to focus on infrastructure and i mean roads bridges broadband not unionized healthcare workers all under the name of infrastructure or higher taxes on middle class families which is by the way what they would do does anybody really believe that if bernie sanders is the budget chairman in the senate that it's only the millionaires and billionaires that are going to pay more it's going to affect every working family in america and make us less competitive as a nation that's not what people want we could get a bipartisan bill but nancy pelosi has shut republicans on the process and unfortunately so has president biden it's time he fulfilled the promise he made as a candidate saying he'd work with everybody he's yet to do that if are they allowed would they be allowed to take the two big bills the american spending plan or the american spending american jobs plan is what they call it sorry and then the american family plan would they be allowed to combine those into one bill and try to muscle it through while they still have the majority well you know you still have a 60-vote requirement for most things in the senate they're trying to shoehorn everything into budget reconciliation but they're very severe limits on what budget reconciliation could be used for and and i think they're recognizing that they're also recognizing that with a three-vote majority currently there are a lot of democrats who don't want to walk the plank who realize they're not going to they're not going to get reelected voting for socialism in fact you already saw just on friday you saw two more democrats announced they're going to re retire from office because they know they can't win again i wanted to ask you about that she was the chair of the d triple c she's in a district that trump won in 2020 she has said that this will be her last term she's going to move on do you think that you'll see more of that oh absolutely you see you know right now in in pennsylvania conor lamb's talking about running for the united states senate because he knows in pittsburgh they don't like the fact that he's voted for all the socialism he's got an f rating with the national right to life he said he was pro-life clearly he's not that's catching up with a lot of these democrats their voting record is not matching their districts and people don't want socialism and they can't stand up to pelosi in the house and so you know they're gonna a lot of them won't be back uh but somehow we're starting to look in the mirror maybe i'll just announce that i'll retire on my own terms as opposed to getting beat next year ron klain said yesterday we're going to work with republicans we're going to find common ground we will find out together whether that happens steve scalise thank you for your time we're waiting for that phone call have a great monday good luck with your theories thanks and good luck with yours too see you soon thank you 20 minutes out before

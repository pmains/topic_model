to get us started i'd like to welcome congresswoman laurie trahan representing the massachusetts third congressional district which includes uh mine i am the third uh house district um congresswoman trihan is a low native served us well in congress since 2019 where she is a champion for the issues facing each of her 37 cities and towns congresswoman has used her seat on the house energy and commerce committee to push legislation that will address the imminent threats posed by climate change and protect the commonwealth's waterways and drinking water supplies of which we are most grateful in addition to her efforts to clean up rivers throughout her district especially the merrimack and assabet we like to name our rivers out here in in uh west of boston they're affected by combined sewage overflows she's also a critical partner in our efforts to address the harmful effects of fast contamination the communities that we both represent have been adversely affected by exposure to these dangerous chemicals and i'm very grateful to role in advancing the pfas action act through the house of representatives in recent weeks this bipartisan legislation will bolster our efforts here in massachusetts and i look forward to hearing from you congresswoman trahan about specific provisions and the path forward to get the federal resources we need to clean up contaminations and prevent future exposure welcome congresswoman trahan thank you for joining us today we're so very grateful good morning uh and thank you for inviting me to testify before the task force today uh i'd like to start by thanking our co-chairs for their work to establish the pfas interagency task force and to all of its members present today for taking the threats posed by these forever chemicals so seriously i'm honored to call chairwoman kate hogan not just a colleague and a partner but also a dear friend for those of us who know her well her relentless commitment to tackling pfas contamination is hardly a surprise in fact it's exactly the kind of leadership that i and the hard-working folks she represents and the third middlesex have come to know well over the years and the same of course can be said for chairman julian sear who has never shied away from doing what's necessary to combat pfas exposures wherever they arise and provide necessary assistance to families facing the devastating effects of pfas contamination so so grateful for the opportunity to testify before each of you and the distinguished members of the task force this morning about the dangers of pfas chemicals and what is being done at the federal level to support critical efforts like yours chemicals are an urgent public health threat they have long been linked with adverse health effects including cancer immune system effects infertility impaired child development high cholesterol and thyroid disease to make matters worse these chemicals are extremely persistent in the environment and are known to bio accumulate in humans and wildlife meaning they don't break down or expire as quickly over time and that is why they're referred to as forever chemicals contaminations have been uncovered in communities across our country and here in the commonwealth in recent years showing the need for us to take swift and comprehensive action to clean up contaminated sites and prevent future contaminations but for a long time and despite the epa knowing the risks the use of pfas chemicals have gone unchecked and unregulated in fact they're still used in some common products like fire fighting foam nonstick cookware cleaning products personal care products and even some cosmetics massachusetts has taken action on this important issue already but as we all know federal action is necessary to both support those efforts while also preventing other states from falling further behind last month i and a majority of members in the u.s house voted for the pfas action act of 2021 this bipartisan legislation that i had the ability to help usher through the house as a member of the energy and commerce committee will clean up contaminations like those here in the commonwealth provide support to families who have been exposed to pfas chemicals and take action to prevent future exposures specifically the legislation requires the reporting of pfas releases along with ongoing monitoring for pfas and drinking water if passed the pfas action act would also mandate the immediate cleanup of sites contaminated with two of the most hazardous types of pfas known as pifoa and pfas while also requiring the development of needed health and safety studies on all other pfas so the legislation sets air emission limits prohibits unsafe incineration and limits the introduction of new forms of pfast into circulation the bill recognizes the need for transparency and requires the epa to develop an accessible website with information on how families can get their water tested for pfas and to keep communities informed and finally and most importantly for the purposes of today's hearing the pfas action act limits exposure to pfest by requiring the epa to establish a drinking water standard for pfas that protects public health including the health of vulnerable populations like pregnant women infants and children while also holding polluters accountable so the pfas action act uh passed the house of representatives with the support of nearly two dozen republicans meaning that it isn't some issue that can be labeled as only a democratic priority by any stretch and we know that there is some interest from some moderate republicans like susan collins in the senate and doing something to stem pfas contamination so it's incumbent on us making the case to them to support this legislation we're also seeing an unprecedented level of engagement from the biden administration on this initiative you know for a long time the epa stayed away from the pfes issue and that inaction is what got us to this point where states have had to act in the absence of and without robust assistance from the federal government president biden came out in strong support of this legislation and it is my hope that as we work to get this done in congress that the administration will use whatever levels levers possible to get resources to communities like those here in massachusetts working to address and prevent contaminations you know one reason we're here today is because massachusetts under the leadership of many of you here this morning has begun to take that action you know since the state implemented new pfest regulations for drinking water supplies we're quickly becoming aware of just how prevalent a problem forever chemicals uh forever chemical contaminations are already dozens of communities have reported elevated levels of contamination that need to be addressed some communities like littleton have also been very proactive in their response to pfas contaminations choosing to take advantage of low interest loans through the state revolving loan fund to finance the construction of a new treatment facility um look no one tuning in this morning is oblivious to the fact that cleaning up these water sources is not cheap towns like ayer have already spent 12 million dollars on pfas mitigation and it's clear that more small towns will have to make similar investments in the months and the years ahead and if we're going to make meaningful headway in addressing contaminations facing their residents they're also going to need investments from the federal government so the pfas action act would actually further support these efforts by providing grants exclusively to impacted water systems looking to clean up their contaminated sites what the recent reporting of contaminated communities has shown is that the district i represent is disproportionately affected by pfest contaminations including in places like air chelmsford littleton acton hudson stowe and beyond whether that's because of the proximity to former department of defense sites which we know have historically led to increased pfest contaminations or along our rivers in our wells or because of a combination of issues it's not something we can let go unaddressed and what we've acknowledged here in massachusetts thanks in large part to the efforts of members on the task force is that it takes a whole of government approach to responding to pfas contamination and the pfas action act is necessary to make sure that the federal government is doing their part in this partnership we also need other states to do the same you know much like sewage overflows pfast contaminations have the ability to cross state lines and affect other communities if if the sewage system in manchester overflows communities downriver like like in lowell and lawrence are affected and the same goes for pfest releases into water supplies we can't have one state treating this threat with urgency while others are failing to do the same so the federal standard required by the pfas action act will require every state and water system to take responsibility for reducing pfas in our drinking water so the need for action at every level of government couldn't be more glaring and we're incredibly fortunate to have leaders here in massachusetts who refuse to wait until it's too late and that's the same approach that we took when we drafted and passed the pfas action act in the house and it's the same one we're going to need the senate to take without delay so that we can get this crisis under control i'm grateful once again to you chairwoman hogan and chairman sayre as well as the distinguished members of this task force for the opportunity to brief you all on this important legislation i certainly look forward to continuing our work together to advance long overdue and common sense proposals that will get this public health threat under control thank you thank you congressman uh really i really appreciate you know your time i know how busy your schedule is and to have this update and to see some real tangible progress at the federal level this is a very uh broad big challenge it's a costly one and so to have the federal government uh and you and your leadership really is is the partnership we've been uh we've been waiting for um other questions for the congresswoman if i might um please chime in my co-chair um congresswoman trahan what are the issues or where do you feel the state can be most effective in either complementing or driving the legislation that you've passed through the house at this point yeah i uh look the state of massachusetts has uh as it often does in so many policy areas uh sort of led um and really um has set a bar you know for us to ensure that other states you know meet and follow um you know i i know that uh certain things that you all have held up as as as examples of what pfest legislation um needs to include um you know we're sort of helping preempt that i think on a federal level if the pfas action act were to become law it would mandate comprehensive health testing for all pfes you know reporting and monitor monitoring of pfas and drinking water expanding the work of you know this task force additionally you know provide grants to those impacted water systems and i i fully expect that many communities in massachusetts could take advantage of those given that they would best understand their unique needs when working to address uh contamination you know as you all know the massachusetts department of environmental protection published a bold pfas you know public drinking water standard called a massachusetts maximum contamination level of 20 nanograms per liter um so similarly the pfas action act which will require the epa to set a national standard after a public notice and comment period in the case of massachusetts levels are more strict they will remain the standard you know but i think what what massachusetts has really done is kind of set the bar on uh you know how we approach this debate from a federal level and the federal law the ultimately that you know federal laws will help set a clear consistent baseline for ways to measure uh and treat uh pfas so really just thank you for everything that you know you're doing certainly shining a spotlight on this issue helps build awareness and education uh around the need for you know us to take action both at the state level but certainly at the federal level as well thank you congresswoman thank you i think we have time just for do you have time for just one or two more questions um i see a question from representative peace kindness woman thank you so much for being here today i really appreciate it and and i'm a i'm a freshman so i'm a newbie so you know take that in account but so i'm just wondering so how is the bill looking in the senate and um and should we be also like like the chairwoman said reaching out to our um our senators marking warren or they have already signed on to it or you know where is it at i guess is my question yeah you bet it's uh it is going to make its way through the senate as you are probably aware you know we're tracking a lot of uh important um initiatives right now uh in the senate and in both chambers you know the the um the pfes is addressed in the bipartisan infrastructure bill so that is a really good sign in terms of us you know moving um on on on something that addresses the mitigation of pfes you know clean drinking water was a priority in the bipartisan infrastructure bill the text currently includes 800 million per year in capitalization grants to address pfas contamination under the safe drinking water act that legislation includes programs specifically aimed to help small and disadvantaged communities uh and funding to help drinking uh water utilities remove pfas from drinking water supplies or to connect well owners to local water systems so my office will certainly be involved as this legislation moves through the house it never hurts to call our our senators um although i know that they're supportive of uh of this uh the pfas action act as well as making sure that the clean water is uh is a priority and it's funded at a level um that we need it to be in the bipartisan infrastructure act as well thank you thank you so much well one last question brief question from kearns thank you thank you congresswoman i think you answered it my question was going to be will the federal infrastructure funding apart from the federal legislation that's already gone through the house will it address pfas and it sounds like it will yes yes and uh and you know right now we're making sure that uh um you know that uh there's there's a number of things right now that uh i think with the bipartisan uh bill also with the budget reconciliation bill and look there's more to do even after those two uh pieces of legislation are are passed um and so you know i know that there's because of the the actions that the house has taken whether that's the clean futures act uh certainly um this you know pfas action act we want to make sure that those are reflected in these two major bills and if not that we continue to make sure that these are taken up you know in the fall

hi my name is pat brady i live in the sixth illinois congressional district in the western suburbs of chicago i've lived here for nearly two decades and it's a great place to live work and raise a family i'm also a lifelong republican a former member of the republican national committee and former chairman of the illinois republican party however in this election for the first time in my life i am voting for the democrat sean caston why the switch pretty simple our republican candidate jimmy ives is the most extreme of the far right of any candidate in the country her extreme worldview and a strict allegiance to the far right just doesn't fit the 6th congressional district and we deserve to be represented by someone who cares about what is good for the district and not what works for a political party or an ideological base jeannie also showed us her true colors in her unsuccessful campaign for governor two years ago when she ran the most sexist racist homophobic and hate-filled ad i've ever seen it was widely condemned by republicans and democrats alike but when called out genie doubled down on the racism and hate defending the ad saying its contents were accurate that anger bigotry and lack of judgment doesn't belong in the united states congress and most importantly it doesn't represent the people of the 6th congressional district sean caston the democrat is a good man a family man and a businessman who cares deeply about the district and all who live in it as a republican i might not agree with him all the time but i know he will always do what he believes is best for us and for the country so please join me in voting sean caston for congress on november 3rd

joining us now from the Capitol congresswoman barbara Lee Democrat from California congresswoman thanks for joining us well you just heard I think they're Philip Klein from the washington examiner say look at there are some areas where this proposal from congressional Republican leaders goes does not do quite what conservatives we're hoping for instance here they say there is still a mandate in this in some form and insurance mandate in some form this thing does not do away with that ban on denying coverage for pre-existing conditions it allows kids to stay on their parents policies through the age of 26 when you look at those concessions that Republican leaders have made here do you as a Democrat see any possible grounds to compromise with them first of all the Affordable Care Act is very popular nearly 30 million people have been covered and for the Republicans to talk about repealing the Affordable Care Act really is very heartless it's wrong and when you look at what they're proposing and we're still reviewing this because they put it out last night and want to have hearings this week but when you look at this what's going to be the poor it's going to be low-income individuals who's going to be the elderly and the disabled who are going to get hurt when you say it's very popular i guess how would you interpret this because I wonder about this sometimes to President Obama and the Democrats enacted it in 2010 and months later Republicans scored historic victories in the midterm elections running against it President Obama got reelected in 2012 but then two years later Republicans promising again to get a what to do away with it posted big gains in the midterm elections and of course Donald Trump was elected last fall what message would you take from that well I'm not looking at this from a political point of view see we have to look at how many people have been covered by the Affordable Care Act for example many people did not know that black lung disease had never been covered it is covered now in the Affordable Care Act and so people in gen you who voted for president Trump to repeal the Affordable Care Act really are at risk now from or losing their health care and so this is a very dangerous moment i believe and people's lives are at stake people are anxious but i'm very pleased that their disarray because the Republicans can't try to figure out what to do but minimally we do not intend to let them repeal the Affordable Care Act if they do not come up with the votes that there's no help from Democrats and Republicans fails to get to 18 for this then what what do you think happens then well I hope that the town meetings and the issues around health care continue to be raised by the resistance that's taking place to the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and so if they're fixers would need to happen well okay we'll tweak it and we'll fix it but we certainly are not going to repeal it too many people will lose their health care it will make America sick again and that there is no way we're going to let this happen and so let them stay confused and let them stay in disarray but I guarantee you Democrats are not going to vote for this because we're not going to allow so many people to lose their health care all right barbara Lee Democratic congressman from California thanks for the time thank you my pleasure okay

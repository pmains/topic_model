I thank our ranking member and madam Speaker I rise today in strong opposition to the Democrats dangerous resolution to undermine our national defense and allow unchecked Iranian aggression against the United States and our allies this resolution intends to our ability to protect American soldiers serving in the Middle East and attempts to forbid the use of force against Iran even if they are attacking Parkins I am shocked and saddened by the partisanship of this chamber I was proud when president former President Obama succeeded in his decision to kill Osama bin Laden in Pakistan I am proud the president Trump ended because I'm Sal emani's brutal reign of terror that killed and maimed countless Americans and coalition forces and threatened many more to come but instead of uniting behind the president's defensive decision to strike one of the world's most powerful terrorists who was organizing against attacks against Americans in Iraq I want entered into the record madam Speaker these pictures from the military times of the assault and the burning of our embassy in Baghdad I would like them entered into the record Duchin instead many Democrats are arguing that the American President himself is guilty of aggression and escalation this madam Speaker is unconscionable I agree with the president that attacking Americans is never acceptable and Iran should be held to account when American lives hang the balance article 2 of the Constitution empowers the President to use force to protect and defend our country I urge my colleagues to oppose this egregious partisan farce and I yield back

tonight we are looking for answers in the disappearance of a beautiful California beauty queen where is my Therese Richardson her 25th birthday has come and gone during the eight months since she vanished straight into thin air our cups any closer to finding this beautiful young woman tonight I will talk to my traces devastated mom as well as powerful California congresswoman Maxine Waters now she says my tree says civil rights were violated and she wants the Justice Department to take over this case my Treece was arrested in September for not paying an $89 tab at a swanky Malibu restaurant police released her from a remote substation in the middle of the night with no car no purse no money and no phone she just disappeared what's worse witnesses say my Treece was clearly showing signs of a serious mental breakdown so did cops drop the ball here is my traces mom back in September I specifically told the deputy this is uncharacteristic of my daughter my daughter does not go places and not pay a chap I continuously reiterate it something is wrong with my daughter she appears to be in a crisis State our panel is back with us and we are honored to have famed congresswoman Maxine Waters joining us tonight but I want to start with latice Sutton my Teresa's mom Latisse thank you for joining us tonight through hell a tell us what goes through your mind in your heart as you wonder every night about your missing daughter Oh Jane first thank you for having me on your show I truly appreciate it every day I wake up with the thoughts of my Treece and where is she I go throughout my day wondering where is she I go to bed at night wondering where is she my thoughts waking me up out of my sleep wondering where is my baby and I find myself constantly looking for different methods to find my baby my trace my trace was acting in a bizarre fashion at this trendy Malibu restaurant that's according to employees and other diners they say my Treece told them she was from Mars she was speaking in a gibberish language she also told them she was there to avenge Michael Jackson's death so why didn't please get her some help possibly an involuntary 5150 hold which you know happens when people are a danger to themselves you can do that here is my Teresa's dad on issues is not up to the deputies to make the 5150 when several witnesses say the same thing expressing behavioral pattern there to take her to the nearest facility for evaluation where a clinician can make that evaluation to see if their danger today self just getting started Latisse does your daughter have a history of mental problems might reese has not been diagnosed however we do know that looking back through her family lines now that we really have to look into it there is a history of mental depression in both sides of the family however even without given that any consideration I knew once they told me that my Treece was okay speaking in a bizarre language that some if my priest Richardson name was spears or Lohan they would never let her walk out fire by herself they would escort her home that was the attorney for my trace Richardson family why did cops let the young duty leave a remote police station by herself in the middle of the night after they'd impounded her car she had no phone no wallet she's been missing since that night eight months ago we are here with representative maxine waters of California congresswoman waters what are you asking for well it's simply this something is wrong here it appears that the Sheriff's Department did not answer all of the questions that have been raised of them it seems to me that the her civil rights may have been violated I've asked the Justice Department the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department to take this case up and to do the kind of investigation that will determine whether or not her civil rights have been violated her civil rights are protected under the a DA for Disabilities Act and so I think that the Civil Rights Division is going to get involved with not God no answer yet and we're gonna find out more about what really took place that so what are you saying her civil rights were violated you're not saying as a person of color based on race your or gender you're saying based on disability based on mental having a mental issue that night yes Americans with Disability Act gives her the same protections that they would give someone of color race one second I'd say what police are saying there's no they're claiming that my tree showed no signs of mental illness or intoxication that night they say had they not released her her civil rights would have been violated and LA Sherriff's Polk's Minh told us quote when they're free to go they're free to go your response congresswoman no as a matter of fact they have a responsibility to make sure that she is released under safe circumstances and so a certain was not safe to release her and 1:00 a.m. or so in the morning as you said with no purse no cell phone no anything that just does not make good sense and I don't think they can hide behind that and we want to find out why they did it were they negligent and we want to find out whether or not anybody from that Sheriff's division that Sheriff's Department walked a distance with her saw her get into a car saw her do anything we need a deeper investigation Cindy Nebraska your question thought man my question is this I'm with the congressman woman on the show because for the simple fact why did they allow this young lady to lead without having her personal possession her cell phone occurred something and I firmly believe the police know more about what happened to this child and they're just not saying well let me let me add to that a local newspaper Malibu surf side News which is not the New York Times of the Washington Post but Malibu surf side News is claiming that there's a video of my trees from inside the police station now the report says the footage clearly shows my trees in distress we have not been able to confirm this report we've called the Sheriff's Department repeatedly and gotten no response Latisse do you know anything about these claims because I know there have been claims of a cover-up and things of that nature with which the Sheriff's Department denies I have seen the videotape personally clearly my Treece is in distress clearly my teresa's not being assisted clearly my treats is trying to make a phone call clearly she but we're not you're saying you've seen this video I've seen this video for a copy of this video do you get how did you get to see it who showed it to you once I learned that it existed that Sheriff Baca instructed lieutenant rosin to allow us to view the video they will not allow us to have a copy I have asked for a copy several agencies have asked for a copy they will not release a copy and it was when I witnessed that video that we learned that a deputy exited the building within two minutes after my treats being released into the cold dark night rod wheeler for bruises a homicide detective what do you think of this you know Janet sounds like it's a case of sloppy very sloppy police working you know typically Jay and I'm gonna support the police night retires at at a time this is that 1% that makes cops all across the country look very bad let's face it number one this woman should not have ever been released into the dark cold night without her personal possessions but I know what they told her they probably told her you can't get your possessions until in the morning that's the you know that's the excuse that they give you that's not a good excuse number two what happened to that woman and here's the other thing Jane Jane what happened to her that caused her to walk out of that restaurant allegedly without paying that bill it sounds to me like she was going through some kind of distress at that time so I applaud congressman Walters for what she's doing because this is a case that definitely needs to be further investigated let me add this to the puzzle okay we know my Treece was released in a remote part of town she walked out of the lost hills substation which is miles away from where she was arrested at that Malibu restaurant now get this at about 6:30 the next morning a homeowner in Malibu Canyon called police to report a woman that was similar in description of my trees resting in her backyard police are almost certain it was my trees but when they got to that house she was gone so drew fin Ling is there a liability do you think what should police had done at that moment when she was gone from the yard where she was resting well at that point they had to open up an investigation and try to determine her whereabouts and they had the obligation to be looking for her you know she had to appreciate being released on her own recognizance what her bond conditions were it sounds like she wasn't able to do that there's a thing called a courtesy phone call to family from law enforcement that's what's happened with every client I've had in similar circumstances you call the family you haven't pick her up Latisse didn't they didn't you have a conversation with them because I think they've said at one point well why didn't the family pick her up earlier yeah you know that that has been so misquoted first of all I did offer to pay the tab but at that time she had been detained and put in the car and was enroute to the sheriff's station at which point I immediately called the Sheriff's Department before she even arrived there and I told them that I would come to pick her up I asked was she going to be booked and released on her own recognizance or was she going to be held until the morning and the officer led me to believe that she would be held until the morning and so when I called in during the four o'clock the hour of the morning that's when I learned that she had been released I had already informed them that she was not from the area and that she did not seem to be in her right state of mind so why they would release her it just baffles me to this day Latisse we are gonna stay on top of the story here on issues we're going to stay on top of this request for a Justice Department investigation we want to have you and the Congress went back soon we're not gonna let your daughter be forgotten thank you search for her on June 5th and six in the Malibu Canyon area okay we need everyone's help because I know that someone out there knows something and if someone would please let us know someone knows what has happened to my baby axel and we'll have you back on before that search thank you so much coming here

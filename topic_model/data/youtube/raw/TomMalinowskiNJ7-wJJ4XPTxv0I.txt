[Music] with me now is democratic congressman tom malinowski of new jersey member of the foreign affairs and homeland security committees congressman thank you for being back on the show good afternoon thank you so much so congressman what are you prepared to push for after getting ready to listen to president zielenski tomorrow what is in the realm of possibility when it comes to more support for ukraine that you anticipate coming down the pipeline well there is more we can do but i think we we should start by acknowledging the power of what we've already done and not discounted with the support that we have given ukraine the arms that we have given these brave ukrainian fighters they have uh they have killed more russian soldiers in less than 20 days than we lost in iraq and afghanistan in 20 years we have sanctioned the russian economy back to the 1930s in just a couple of weeks this is extraordinarily powerful and it's one of the reasons why the ukrainians are having success in the field i expect president zolensky uh to appreciate that but to ask for more as he as he should he has been talking uh understandably about closing the skies over ukraine well there's nothing that can close the skies to all of the missiles the rockets the artillery shells that are raining down on ukrainian cities so we need to be realistic about that but we can and should get the more advanced anti-aircraft systems the s-300 system in particular which a lot of our eastern european allies have i'm forgiven them some of these mig fighters as well although that is not the game changer that a lot of people hope hope it is it's interesting to hear you talk about the mig fighters i know that many members of the problem solvers caucus of which you are a part are backing this call for the u.s to help facilitate this new call to facilitate the transfer of those migs from poland to ukraine do you think zielinski's address could help turn the tide on that particular issue tomorrow i hear you when you say it's not the game changer people think i've heard that from other experts as well but it is still something zelinski's been asking for well yeah so we've we've heard i mean he he asked for it when he spoke to uh many of us in congress about a week ago so we know there's nothing new about that request many of us have encouraged the administration to facilitate it but i just i want people to to be realistic about this the ukrainian air force has made they have these planes they're not flying them very often because the russian air defenses are lethal and because frankly there are other ways and probably more effective ways of taking russian aircraft out of the skies other ways to deal with the artillery and the rocket fire that is the number one cause of the devastation that the ukrainians are suffering right now so again i want i want to give them everything they need even if it's the less important stuff but the most important thing i think right now in the administration is they say they're doing this scour the world for every advanced piece of anti-aircraft system that we can give them the drones the offensive drones that are taking out the russian artillery and tanks and more of the anti-tank weapons that they've used to such a lethal effect you have legislation um on seizing the assets of russian oligarchs there's also now this bipartisan group of senators that has introduced the idea of potentially cash rewards right green lighting that for information that leads to the seizure of arrests from those oligarchs that have been sanctioned is that something you could get behind totally i totally support that and in terms of my legislation which also was introduced in the senate uh today uh you know you've seen those 600 million dollar yachts they could pay for rebuilding a lot of ukraine uh a one billion dollar soccer team owned by a russian oligarch uh in england that could pay for a lot of rebuilding ukraine and i want to give the administration the authority not just to block those assets but also to to seize them and to use that wealth that was stolen in russia to help the people that russia is devastating in ukraine today you are of course on the foreign affairs committee as we mentioned so i want to ask about this um you know ukraine's bid to join nato essentially do you think it would make a difference and what's going on right now if you can't if ukraine did drop that bit as russia has demanded that they do right um and do you think that would be appropriate or the best next step for ukraine i know there there is a little appetite for that i think in the west uh it's totally up to them we shouldn't encourage them or discourage them but my personal view is that it would make absolutely zero difference ukraine in 2010 did drop its demand to join nato they passed a law a resolution of their parliament saying we don't want to join any military alliance and putin invaded them anyway in 2014. this is not about nato this is about putin wanting to extinguish ukraine as a successful independent democratic country so personally i don't think it would make any difference congressman tom malinowski thank you so much for your time this afternoon i am sure you are looking forward to hearing from president zielinski again tomorrow morning as we all are thank you

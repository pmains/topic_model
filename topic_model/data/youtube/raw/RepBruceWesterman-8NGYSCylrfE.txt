serving on the house budget committee gives me unique insight as to how the federal budgeting process works this week president obama sent over his proposed budget this budget is insane it adds over 9 trillion dollars in debt over ten years it increases taxes by over three and a half trillion dollars that's even after putting a tax on fuel at the pump of about 25 cents per gallon and his budget never balances house republicans are working on a common sense budget that addresses the real problems spending our budget balances and it does it without raising taxes

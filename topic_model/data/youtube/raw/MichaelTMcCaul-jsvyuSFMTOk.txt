one group of GOP lawmakers taken a very important tour of our border with Mexico just ahead of an expected vote on a new border security bill in the house with some tough new standards William Lajeunesse live in Los Angeles with more hi William well Greg you know the challenge is to get a border security bill tough enough for Republicans but not so severe that it scares Democrats not to agree then they can tackle the rest of immigration reform it is a step-by-step approach that begins at the fence from a helicopter high above the border to a patrol boat along the Rio Grande I think you have to understand it to know what the problem really is Congressman Mike McCaul recently led a congressional tour of the us-mexico border to help colleagues understand the challenges I was surprised at how close the shores are to each other at certain points how shallow the water is how easy essentially and quickly someone can get across the border but we need to do is look at the border in the national strategy comprehensive way we need to have a plan mccall's plan differs dramatically from the Obama administration's policy which largely prohibits local police from helping enforce the border mccall's bill encourages it it's not just simply erecting a fence and then call it a day unlike the Senate bill mccall focuses on border security and does not provide a pathway to citizenship placing border security before immigration reform is a political tactic it it's a way of saying we're going to present this nearly impossible goal so that we can negotiate and bargain for things that we won many border agents support McCall's bill which requires a ninety percent apprehension success rate though some consider that unrealistic when we talked to the agents that are out there day in and day out patrolling you know that's not what they're seeing they're not seeing things under control so it would be a real slap in the face to them to to grant status to people who have broken the law so the beauty of this built politically is that it sets a goal but does not include a price tag it's co-sponsored by Democrats so it is a good shot Greg providing conservative Republicans believe it will actually work we should find out in early October no I stay tuned to that all right William Lajeunesse William tax Martha yes

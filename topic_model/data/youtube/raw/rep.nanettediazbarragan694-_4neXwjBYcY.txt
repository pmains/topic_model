thank you dr. beers thank you for mentioning the environmental influences often times we oversee those or we don't discuss them don't discuss them and off I happen to represent a district California is 44th it includes the Port of Los Angeles it's surrounded by three freeways and the port and there's high air pollution rates there these factors being surrounded by highways helped to contribute to some of the worst air quality in the country unfortunately because of these factors back home in Los Angeles asthma is an epidemic a stunning one in 11 children in Los Angeles County have asthma in my very own district children walk around with inhalers around their necks and even the doctor's office they stock up on boxes and boxes of these asthma inhalers expecting to see children come in it is so heartbreaking to see and which is one of the reasons why I'm so happy that we are trying to move legislation to address this although there is a lot of steps that need to be taken the rates of asthma in communities of color are even worse that's my very district I have a district that's almost 90% Latino African American some of the statistics say that 25% of African American children and LA County have asthma and Hispanic children are one and a half times more likely to die due to asthma when compared with other non-hispanic children statistics such as these are one of the reason that I am a co-sponsor of the school-based allergies and asthma management program by incentivizing schools to maintain asthma management programs students and parents can be assured that the child will be able to have the health have the care they require in case of an emergency dr. mr. Mendes can you elaborate a little bit on how this bill HR 2468 will help to reduce some of the racial disparities that we see happening with asthma yeah sure sure I mean you know there is gonna be a child with asthma or allergies in just about every school in the United States so to the extent that this program creates incentives to have an asthma or an allergy action plan in the state will be really helpful to all those communities the CDC which provides grants and works with the public health systems in each state will favor whatever schools or whatever states have this kind of program so to the extent that this becomes legislation it creates incentives for schools and states to do this then it'll improve funding in their likelihood for getting funding to prevent asthma allergy attacks and have the right systems in place when I was a kid I remember my father had a home that was right near the freeway and I didn't know any better I said well geez if you live near the freeway that must mean it's gonna be faster to get to where you want so it's a great place and of course now knowing what I know and the allergies that I deal with a connection there besides this bill do you have any ideas on other things that we could be doing to address asthma and it's you know in particular on a congressional level sure I mean I mean you know there's the outdoor environmental issues as well I mean to the extent that there have been roll backs of some legislation that you know have contributed to more dirty air I mean that that's certainly an area you're witnessing it and you in your district and I think in particular they're trying to come up with specific standards for truck and truck emissions and in particular if you're in that window of that area where I think it's the port there's quite a bit of short haul trucking and there's quite a bit of pollution that's generated from that so there's the outdoor environmental issue and then you know there's indoor environmental issues as well having you know indoor air quality and being aware of that in the schools I mean kids spend the majority of their time either that's at school or at home those are areas that we could really be focusing on great thank you and ladies thank you for for being here to talk about the infant mortality rates certainly in a community like mine that's the majority it's heavily impacted in LA County they've received over a million dollars that were able to invest in programs such as the Mott the Mama's neighborhood project which provides tailored home visits during prenatal labor delivery postpartum and enter conception periods up to 18 months following birth these visits help reduce the rates of infant mortality with the last 10 seconds I have do either one of you can maybe you comment on how else the Healthy Start program worked to reduce the racial disparity to second answer which is I think the engagement with the community and the focus on Community Impact and collective impact is a really important so that we're Co designing solutions together with families and communities who are most impacted

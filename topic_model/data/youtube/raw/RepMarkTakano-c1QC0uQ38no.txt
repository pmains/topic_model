a tremendous loss in the San Bernardino shooting losing a beloved husband and father and despite their deep sorrow they decided to accept an invitation from representative takano to be here and witnessed the state of the union address in person so I said today to find out why it was so important for them to be here my husband and I were married 36 years we were highschool sweethearts Trita minds in her daughter Tina and Tanya are living the tragedy so many Americans fear Trina's husband Damien was killed in the San Bernardino terrorist attack he loved to learn about things he was extremely intelligent and and will be missed in the midst of their morning they found a way to muster up the strength to be here for the President's speech we wanted to come here just to talk to as many people as possible try to advocate as much as possible to see that there's some changes so that other families are not affected in the future they don't have to suffer the same way we did they say is controversial as it is they want to speak out about our gun laws they say their tragedy has led to a greater understanding of the problem and a realization that something needs to be done I guess the important thing that we've learned is really about the laws that we have in place right now and that there are loopholes we're just hoping that one by one we can start closing them so this doesn't happen to see a mass shooting a terrorist attack workplace violence combined into one event that took my dad it is horrific but and it certainly made us even more aware this is kind of pushed this to the number one priority for me I felt was important for an America that has been traumatized by this event in San Marino to see an example of a family that is choosing compassion over fear the real time facing their own tragedy is excruciating yet they are here it isn't one day at a time it's one minute at a time with us and and so that's how we go as you can see a tremendous amount of pain that they are still in I mean this shooting happened just a little bit over a month ago now they have been giving it another honor here in Washington DC before the President's speech tonight there are able to meet with the first lady reporting live from Washington DC and David oh no abc7 Eyewitness News

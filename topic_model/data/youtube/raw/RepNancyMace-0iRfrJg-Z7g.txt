welcome back everybody there are growing calls tonight for dr voucher to step down after lying about gain of function funding in the wuhan lab if that's indeed proven correct if that doesn't bother you maybe this will factories nih use hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars to help fund deadly and inhumane experiments on puppies in tunisia in a tunisian lab that is now a bipolar congressional group yes nine democrats team the rest republicans 23 and all investigating dr fauci in this brutal role in this study congresswoman nancy mayes is leading the investigation she joins us now this involves beagles and tunisian lab technicians scientists what could you tell us congresswoman right well what we learned recently is dr fauci is sending puppies to slaughter basically i learned a few weeks ago that a grant worth about 1.68 million dollars was spent to take 44 beagle puppies to take their vocal cords out so the scientists couldn't hear their cries or their barks they were then drugged killed and dissected almost two million dollars to kill 44 beagle puppies i've since learned of other experiments using american taxpayer dollars in other countries because we would never do this here in the us right the uh insects that are literally eating beagles alive from the neck up that was another project frightening monkeys and then another one you're trying to get mice addicted to cocaine why are we wasting this kind of money on these kind of barbaric and gruesome scientific experiments on on these sweet and innocent animals these these dog these poor dogs were killing them with our money it's terrible so you have the fda does not require you test on animals in order for these drugs to clear i have no idea what we gained to see these sand flies eat away at the bodies of dogs another experiment had these dogs in cages in the middle of a desert all night maybe as many as nine days so they can attract sand flies like bait and the dogs would be eaten alive by these flies how does anthony fauci sleep at night it's disgusting and it's it's it's as if you know covet 19 and his lies about coven 19 were not bad enough now there's this and the more i learn about what's going on with taxpayer dollars and these grants that we're sending to other countries overseas literally the worse it gets it's like the reconciliation bill the more we learn the worse it gets and i've been an animal rights activist for a long time i promised to work across the aisle with democrats and republicans when we agreed on an issue and this is one where millions of americans agree this should this should stop and it should stop immediately well i would think so is that how you got nine democrats involved and where do you go from here yeah absolutely the letter is the first thing dr fauci has a few days to respond we'll have to ratchet it up if he does not respond but i expect we'll get a response from the nih and or the niaid where these grants were funded under that program it's really it's devastating but if this is what will bring our country together to work together to do the right thing to save these animals from slaughter in the future then i'm here for it dr fauci has got to be held accountable for everything that he's done to this country in the last few years it's devastating right even even unintentional we just find out now that maybe america needs to know who he's writing checks to who's ever in that position after him too because it's in our name and now in this case uh in some way or shape or form we're all paying the price

now let's bring in congresswoman young kim republican from california congresswoman look what do you make of this historic border surge if anything it's getting worse right first of all as an immigrant and a mother of four hearing the stories of these migrants breaks my heart i visited our border in california and south texas and it's clear what we're seeing continues to be a security humanitarian and public health crisis as you noted june is the fourth straight month of over 180 000 plus apprehensions so this is a public health crisis not only because of the pandemic but because of the drugs crossing our borders and cbp also has seized more fentanyl so far this year than in all of last year i witnessed this myself during my visits to the border and drug cartels are taking advantage of these open border policies and migrants are being exploited

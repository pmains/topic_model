the gentleman from florida mr posey is now recognized for five minutes well thank you very much madam chair uh dr godspeed i feel like i've seen this movie before to paraphrase a classic we appear to be rounding up the usual scapegoats for inflation under the heading primary causes of recent inflation trends the majority hearing memo lists supply chain bottlenecks and shortages lack of housing supply lack of competition there's no mention of the majority's deficit spending and the monetization of those deficits to dramatically increase the money supply last week uh chair powell agreed that inflation is a monetary phenomenon way we ended up with this inflation is that the government dramatically increased the deficit in the rescue act and other legislation and the federal reserve provided the lending to support the deficits at no charge in interest rates the primary cause of inflation is deficit spending financed by the federal reserve buying the debt and increasing the money supply one price increase that stands out from the rest and that is a skyrocketing increase in energy costs it's been mentioned by almost everybody here today especially the price of gasoline even before the ukraine invasion the price of unleaded regular was closing in on four dollars a gallon this is a steep relative price increase and most analysts understand that this increase was a result of supply restrictions that followed on the administration's assault on the domestic energy production please govern your assessment of how reversing the administration's restrictions on domestic oil and gas would reduce gasoline prices and how much would gas prices decline if we reset the clock to january 19th 2021 and erase the administration's impact on the domestic energy sector could we expect to restore energy uh independence as we had before well thank you congressman and i i think as you noted we've heard some of these stories before in fact in the 1960s and 1970s there was a lot of uh there were a lot of allegations that the price pressures that we were observing were the result of of oligopolistic or monopolistic competition and empirically those those claims were subsequently tested and rejected i would expand upon a remark i made in response to questions from from congressman barr namely that if we look at the historical relationship between the price of west texas intermediate crude and oil rig counts in the united states those two series typically track each other very closely meaning the price of oil goes up rig counts go up we get more supply that relationship completely broke down in 2021 and i think that was a result of the regulatory crackdown on domestic energy production and the looming prospect of more now it's hard to say where domestic oil prices and gasoline prices would go in the coming months simply because of so much international geopolitical uncertainty well thank you yeah one of the favorite boogeyman of our friends on the other side of the aisle is the evil price gouging firms they're one of the usual scapegoats for unsound fiscal and monetary policy i believe we can expect that businesses will respond to market forces including inflation like any other economic player but it's more than a little naive to habitually resort to the price gouging monster to explain seven and a half percent inflation is there any solid convincing credible and peer-reviewed evidence that businesses with this portion of market power have been a major cause inflation through price counting i've seen no serious academic study to that effect and i would add that most empirical studies and for that matter theoretical papers on this suggest that in the short run the pass-through from cost to price is actually lower in in less competitive markets than in competitive markets in the long run competitive markets have have lower average inflation rates but in the short run the pass-through is actually uh higher in competitive markets well thank you and while i believe the role of housing supply and inflation is far more subtle than the other side suggests enlisting it as a major cause of inflation i do have serious concerns about the costs of building housing and i believe that the cost of building new housing whether single or multi-family determines the prices of houses and rents at the margin of the market adding demand to a housing market in which the cost of a new housing is continually being pushed up by regulations and restrictions on innovative building techniques really serves mostly to just drive up even further the prices and rents of all housing do you agree that to make significant progress in providing affordable housing we need to focus on bringing down the cost of building new housing well i would say that we should be focused on increasing the the the supply of housing generally and we we have a problem that is very difficult to build construct new housing in the united states and we should ask ourselves why did the price of housing go up so much in in 2021 well let's let's remember that housing and autos are the two most interest rate sensitive sectors in the us economy thank you thank you thank you manager

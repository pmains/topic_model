hello i'm virginia senator mark warner and i want to welcome you all to this video workshop on some of the enormous changes that are and opportunities for the cdfi community across virginia and for that matter across the country i think we all saw during the pandemic that many of the federal programs that were trying to help small businesses particularly in distressed communities oftentimes never fully penetrated because so many of our small businesses particularly from the minority community did not have established financial relationships with traditional banks and that meant programs like ppp weren't able to go out and touch as many in the community as otherwise needed that's why i was so proud in the december bill to get 12 billion dollars for minority depository institutions and cdfis over the last few years i've learned about the critically important role that cdfis play in bridging the gap for financing in many disadvantaged communities i was proud back when i was governor uh over 15 years ago to start one of virginia's first big cdfis as governor virginia community capital i've seen it grow and i've seen other cdfi's across the commonwealth grow this is an extraordinarily important part of the financial ecosystem in our in our commonwealth and in our country that's why by securing twelve billion dollars three billion dollars that have gone out and will go out as grants to cdfis and i know many of you already have applied for those but in addition there'll be nine billion dollars available for tier one capital that can go into your institutions again this money in many ways can be leveraged almost ten to one that would provide an additional 90 billion to 100 billion dollars of lending capacity for cdfis across the country and it's my hope by using this workshop and working with us we'll make sure that every cdfi in virginia that wants to can apply for this tier one equity capital so uh i look forward to working with you i hope the workshop is productive and again please call on my office if we can be of assistance in any other future endeavor thanks so much and look forward to you having a great workshop

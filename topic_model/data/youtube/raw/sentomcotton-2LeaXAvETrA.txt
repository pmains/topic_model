joining me now is Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton author of the upcoming book Only the Strong reversing the left's plot to sabotage American power senator we have just over 400 million barrels left in this strategic petroleum reserve the administration today made it clear they have no plans of stopping their release of more oil explain why this is so dangerous well it's obvious why they're doing that Laura because they've got an election in 34 days and the price of gas has gone up by a quarter in most places around the country once again touching up against four and five dollars a gallon but I think you put it well and as I write in Only the Strong the Democrats plan is decline by Design we don't have five dollar a gallon gas in this country by accident it's not an unintended consequence it's not bad luck or the evil machinations of oil company Executives or OPEC it's because Joe Biden and Progressive Democrats want gas to be that expensive they want you to get out of your gas guzzling SUV or minivan they want Farmers to have to stop using diesel for tractors and other Farm instruments they think that you're going to be able to replace all these things with electric vehicles which by the way really are co-powered or natural gas powered or nuclear-powered Vehicles because the electricity has to come from somewhere and it doesn't come from the sun when it's not shining or the wind when it's not blowing and at root lore what this really is just gets back to the far lips anti-capitalist views I mean energy literally Powers our modern economy you know our founding fathers didn't have much different quality of life than Jesus's disciples did and that's because 1800 years on the sources of energy were the same it's only in the last 200 years with fossil fuels first coal and then oil and gas and then you add nuclear power into that mix that we've achieved true energy right but Senator Joe Biden yeah let me just jump in here because people want to know what next so let's say you guys do manage to you know get that seat and you take the majority maybe you take a couple seats you take the majority in the Senate what can Republicans do to stop this madness if anything once you reclaim the majority well at a minimum we can use our spending power which we've got to do pass every year to force the Biden Administration to take certain actions whether it's permitting new pipelines or other oil and gas developments issuing new permits and having new lease sales we did this in the late Obama era once we won back the Senate and the house in 2015 for instance we lifted the 40 year old ban on oil exports going back to the Jimmy Carter era speaking of democratic presidents who intentionally tried to hobble American Energy these are things that steps that we can take to restore America's oil and gas production that we can encourage more drilling more production not only for our own energy needs but for those of our allies and partners all around the world again by the Biden Administration the Democrats are doing this on purpose they recognize the political danger of it though that's why they're taking such risky steps like this well they know it this is the only reason yeah it's beyond obvious that's what they're doing which brings me to my next question again if the Republicans take the majority can we expect hearings in the Senate that probe whether the motivation for releasing millions and millions of barrels from that spr and potentially endangering the American people in a time of emergency whether that was done for political reasons who was involved in that decision making uh to me that's a really important question I'm not saying it's necessarily an impeachable offense but it's pretty damn important that we find out why that was done yeah Laura I think we need to get to the bottom of it I think we know what we're going to find out in the end I think it's the political czars throughout the administration reporting back to the president and his political allies or political aides in the White House well that can't be allowed the Strategic Patrol strategic petroleum Reserve it's not it's not the political right petroleum reserve and the reason why they're releasing this oil and gas is they recognize even though they want gas to be at five dollars a gallon they recognize that this is a unique pain point for most American families and they got to at least appear to be taking actions 34 days for an election that's why they're also blaming OPEC and blaming evil oil companies for trying to drive up the price of oil in this country but that directly translates back to their own failed energy policies wow I just imagine throughout the hurricane like hurricane Ian yeah right I mean I think about a hurricane like hurricane Ian well they're defrauding the American people that's not their oil to play with that's our oil collectively and they're playing politics would just that one issue I mean that is a Republicans have got to get to I don't think we can assume anything I think it has to be proven that this was a calculated political move which is endangering the future of America and I want to know who is responsible I want to see the emails and I think you guys are perfectly positioned if you get the Senate to take charge of this matter because we we can't let this happen again this is too important Senator I can't wait to read your book thank you so much

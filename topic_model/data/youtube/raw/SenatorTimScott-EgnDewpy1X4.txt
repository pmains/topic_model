so Imani told me I did pronounce her name correctly so I feel good about that um I don't know Peter Paul's for that Imani is going to lead us in a pledge of allegiance as we get started and I'm going to tell you who I am and do a few logistical things and try to not drive the teachers and leaders too crazy and what I'm going to ask you to do here in a minute okay of course yeah you tell us all I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all you rocked it awesome great hey there everybody my name is Luke Messer I'm the president of investment in education and a actually founding co-chair of the Congressional school choice caucus with one of our other sponsors tonight or leaders today Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina who is co-chairing this event with John mullinar from Michigan who is the current Congressional school choice co-chair on the house side it's been nine years that we've been coming here and um I'm gonna ask everybody to do a couple logistical things but I want us to think about those nine years and the opportunity we're here to highlight to leaders today um so the first thing that I'm well the first thing I'm going to do is if possible I want our leaders to know that we're here and I want to kind of fill in our seats and make sure that we're kind of we're together and look like a group so if possible I see that they're starting to fill up even since I got up here but we want to make sure that those seats get filled secondly um you know anytime I'm in Washington DC and I'm living back in Indiana now I try to walk around the capitol if I can I don't know how many of you how many here have had a chance to walk around the capitol a little bit hopefully you live here right and I just to me I think it's really important that we don't lose sight in the awesomeness of this place right it's easy when you're around here every day to kind of think oh man it's just like that every day but the symbols of this city stand for the greatest engine of opportunity in the history of the world and yet we're here today because as great as those opportunities are we all know that as a nation we've fallen short there are too many kids in America that go to a school where they don't have a chance you know when I was in Congress I had an opportunity to go to the basis Academy here in Washington DC really remarkable place it's a math and science based Academy has kids from every zip code in the Washington DC area and the first question I was asked and maybe many in this room have felt the same way is Congressman why don't all of my friends and neighbors have the same kind of opportunity I have anybody ever thought that We Can't Stop as a nation until every kid every family has a chance to go to a great school all right so next thing we're going to do and I'm going to tell you one more thing about our responsibility I want everybody to stand up all right if you've got a scarf right you hold the start like this all right if you don't have a scarf just pretend okay so we're going to get a little energy okay lean to the right [Applause] I go first right here [Applause] all right here's the thing right thank you let's do a little bit around and pause we may do that [Applause] second thing is this all right every once in a while and I'm gonna get back and say precisely why we gotta do it every once I'm gonna go like this [Applause] is the thing I'm really going to ask all of you and I want you to think about this because you know one of the cool things about this room is that like with different ages not everybody's in high school we got some people that are younger we're different in the way we're kind of processing the world and life but what I want these leaders to know because I've talked to so many of you is that we appreciate the opportunity we have now for ourselves right opportunity to go to a great school and have opportunities others don't have and we believe that our friends and neighbors should have those chances too and so as these leaders come up at the beginning I hope for every one of them will applaud when they leave we want to applaud and we just want to tell them how much we appreciate this chance can you do that with me all right let's do it now um some quick thank yous have I gotten this too far no we're not even behind that's awesome um first I want to thank the Scott Mo and our teams their staff here let's give them a quick Applause I mentioned them the co-chairs we've

Movement there's some movement been around for 40 years but you're now starting to have an extraordinary sort of generation of young people who are the products of this system that can tell their own story of how their life was changed when somebody gave them a chance and I want to introduce you start our program with one of those amazing young people Michael White Michael's from Washington DC and a graduate of the DC opportunity scholarship program after graduating college he returned as a teacher at a school choice at a school of choice that he attended Cornerstone School of Washington D.C Michael was a 2020 that's right give him a call 2020 Future Leaders fellow at the American Federation for children let's give them a round of applause thank you good morning ladies and gentlemen boys and girls it is great to be here to celebrate uh school choice week can we give another uh clap for that uh my name is Michael White and I am representing the American Federation for children as a fellow one of the things I think about is why exactly do we celebrate this week every year why is this one of the most important weeks uh in the year why is it so special I think that there are a lot of stories that can exemplify why specifically it is special and I think that my story as well serves as a reason as to why as well when I was young my mom and I we moved a long time ago and because we moved we had to end up going to a new school and unfortunately for us we were living in a time where the place in which you live determine the school in which you went to and for many kids that's still the case and then it was for me as well I ended up going to a school that was failing at the time it was a school that could not serve my educational needs it was one that that wasn't a safe environment and had a culture that was lacking I ended up getting into a very violent altercation with a few students and my mom then determined that I would never return to that school again it was a tough time for me because I didn't know exactly where I was going to go I had to find a new school and at the time there wasn't as many choices for schools to attend at that time though there was also a a bill that was brewing at the time we didn't know if it was going to pass but it eventually did and it turned into a program we now know as the DC opportunity scholarship program [Applause] [Music] [Applause] thank you without the DC opportunity scholarship program I would not have been able to go to a new school the school that I ended up going to was a small private Christian School called Cornerstone School of Washington DC I I see that clapping up for them I see a few of them in the audience and [Applause] it was a great school a school that certainly fit me it was one that took care of my educational needs and was a safe environment it was also a school that had a great Christian environment it was able to serve the values that my mom was trying to instill in me and and instead of going to a school that was taking away from those said values I was a third grader at the time and I ended up going to that school up until the 12th grade where I graduated there at salutatorian now when I think about all thank you thank you I think about the time in which I spent at that school I constantly think about if other students would get the same opportunities as I would in fact a long time ago back in 2010 there was actually a threat to the DC opportunity scholarship program we didn't exactly know if the program was going to exist or not so what we did was we had to fight for it back then a long time ago we we went to a lot of meetings we went to a lot of different events one thing that we did a long time ago was we had a choir and a lot of schools with the DC opportunity scholarship program had choirs and what we did was we would often uh go down here near the Capitol and we would sing and we would talk to politicians and everyone would tell us we sounded great and I know for a fact they were lying to us but at the same time we were able to speak to a lot of people what I didn't realize was the power in my story see it's one thing when your teachers talk about the different students that they have but it's different when there's parents that are involved that can speak on behalf of their children and it's even more special when that story comes from you you guys have the unique ability to speak and talk about the different opportunities and choices that you guys were given and how those things change your lives me telling my story gave me the ability to change the hearts and minds of many politicians and many political leaders throughout this city and throughout the country I know that you guys have the ability to do the same which is what makes this week very important I hope that you guys continue to fight and advocate for choice for choices that you were given and can continue to advocate so that all students all across this country can obtain Choice as well thank you [Applause] [Music] thank you Michael um did I just see Archbishop Carroll High School get here about a shout out right there great to have you here all right for those of you who are already here here we go we're getting ready I said 10 minutes ago we're going to say right now [Applause] I love it I'm about to bring up I think one of the best examples of the American dream I know in public life today Senator Tim Scott from South Carolina you know I grew up in a single parent family my mom actually worked in a factory in a small town in Indiana and part of the story I always say is the remarkable thing about America is that story is not remarkable at all right that almost everybody's it's them or their parents or grandparents that live that same opportunity at the American dream but what Senator Scott also understands is that's only true if everybody has access to a quality education one of the biggest champions for school choice and education opportunity for kids in America today Senator Tim Scott [Music] thank you good morning I'm sorry I didn't mean to confuse anybody let me try it one more time [Applause] I love it how's everybody doing this morning awesome can I make you guys a star by putting you on the social media right here I'm closer come closer any any stars over here [Applause] oh there they are [Applause] that's the loudest five people in the whole room I love it I love school choice because I understand the value of a good education I'll tell you I've said it several times the closest thing to Magic in America is a good education and as a kid growing up in poverty single parent household I went to four different elementary schools by the fourth grade it wasn't going very well for me and as I went from middle school to high school things got worse when you're when you're living in poverty you move a lot sometimes and my mother was working 16 hours a day trying to keep the lights on food on the table and it didn't always work out we didn't always have the lights on come home sometimes and you hit the switch didn't work tough times as a freshman in high school I basically filled out I felt four subjects my freshman year I failed World Geography and Civics Civics is a study of politics and as a U.S senator it is hard to appreciate how good God is when you can fail Civics and still become a U.S senator God is good all the time now I also failed Spanish and English when you feel Spanish and English no one calls you bilingual they all call you by ignet because you can't speak in any language and that's the year my my mother encouraged me how many all love your mamas I love my Mama she's my hero well after I failed my freshman year my mother came home after working a 16-hour shift changing bed pans and rolling patients she looked at my report card she looked at me she looked back at my report card and she'd always told me son if you just shoot for the Moon even if you miss you'll be Among the Stars this time she came home and she said baby I said yes ma'am she says you know I said I know Mama I know if I should I should have shot for the Moon I've been Among the Stars and she said no baby you missed that lesson now I know that y'all are younger than I am my mama took me outside to a treat and she said pick a branch now I know y'all don't know where this goes I can tell y'all are used to time out here she said take the leaves off of it and she introduced me to a new form of encouragement now in the South we call a switch of Southern apparatus of encouragement and she applied it liberally I never failed another subject in my life but I learned two very important lessons one was if you believe all things are truly possible they are and the second thing is if you apply yourself and you have a good education this country opens doors of opportunities that will never be shut I'm excited about your future because you are involved in what I believe is the greatest civil rights issue of our time and it is quality education if we get quality education in every single zip code America will be the bright star the city on the hill and we will live up to our Highest Potential because the future is in your hands God bless you all right foreign okay thank you all we're doing a good job how about another round of applause for Senator Scott um the next gentleman up I want you to have a chance to say hello to is Congressman molinar from Michigan he is the Congressional caucus school choice caucus co-chair and it has a daughter who went to a school of choice made a big difference in her life congressman mullinar thank you well good morning everyone how many of you care about your future all right how many of you believe that every student in this Auditorium is created in the image of God and deserves respect all right I believe that too and one of the reasons I'm involved in school choice week in co-chairing along with Senator Tim Scott who's a great Advocate isn't he it's because I believe in the fundamental importance of families being able to choose their future choose their school and have the opportunities that best fit their needs now I learned that firsthand as a parent when I had a daughter who was in elementary school was pretty much bored in her classroom they really weren't challenging her and exciting her about learning and she heard about a new school nearby that had just opened up a charter school she heard that they got to use microscopes and really uh excited about their learning and most times as a parent you don't kind of Follow Your Elementary School's recommendation your Elementary child's recommendation on their school but in this case we saw it was so important to her it's such a motivation we had her go to that school and she thrived there she did so well in math and science she ended up going to West Point and serving our country and the Armed Forces and I say that because as a parent you have a responsibility to raise these children and do what's best for them and I don't think anyone knows that better than your family and you to know what the best fit is for your education so that's why I'm a strong supporter of school choice I serve on the Appropriations Committee which oversees the Department of Education and we're going to work very hard to make sure they're accountable to the American people and to you as students as parents as teachers to make sure we do the right thing for every student in America so thanks for having me great to be with you and have a great school choice week thank you keep the Applause coming love it thank you guys so much hey I want to introduce you real quick a a great friend of mine from service together a great Champion for the state of South Carolina and somebody that loves and champions freedom for America's kids Joe Wilson it's so good to get the alumni back and but hey ladies and gentlemen it's such uh it's so humbling to look out and see so many bright faces I I just want to wish you well on all of your careers and when I think about school choice I'm thinking about what education has meant to our family and that is my wife is a teacher she taught an alternative school giving young people a second chance so I saw that additionally I'm really grateful due to Educators my second son was received a degree in chemical engineering my fourth son and industrial engineering we were not able to help our children beyond the in math beyond the third grade so we know how important teachers are and different options and then I'm particularly grateful is Congressman molinar pointed out that uh one of my sons my oldest son actually was a needed school choice he was we went for a guidance counseling one time and the persons there were really nice but they said hey Alan is doing really well he has all deeds and he's going to the next class and I and I was so shocked I do not consider all these uh the passport to the next class and so we actually using School of Choice moved him into us where it was a smaller class environment and now last Wednesday he was sworn in for his fourth term as Attorney General of South Carolina so it if he if he hadn't had Choice uh he still may be in high school so I so I I have a real personal interest in this and then uh every child deserves access to Effective Education and we should be encouraging parents to explore and identify the best learning option for their child school choice improves academic outcomes and allows students to seek Innovative methods of instruction in school governance in a way that fits their individual needs I'm grateful to Governor Henry McMaster lieutenant governor Pam Abbott uh South Carolina superintendent of Education uh Ellen Weber for their support of school of choice in South Carolina some of the options available to students in South Carolina include magnet schools public charter schools virtual education and residential school choice over this national school choice week I'm also grateful to be introducing the military child education Freedom Act and invite my colleagues to support this legislation the military child Education Act would allow home schoolers of active duty military personnel the ability to access their Coverdale account regardless of the state in which they reside Coverdale education and savings accounts tax-free Investments and tax-free withdrawn accounts can be used for qualified K-12 educational expenses for public private or religious schools there are a few states that currently classify home schools as private schools therefore allowing the Coverdale education savings accounts to be accessed and so we wish you all the best of continued success and it's just again humbling to be here with you and those of you who are in the capital region you're always invited by 1436 Longworth house office building we have a a office with a window overlooking the U.S Capitol we'll get a picture with you and the Dome on your shoulder you don't have to call it just come somebody said Joe said come by God bless you thank you thanks again Joe hey and Joe means it I'm telling you go by his office you'll have a great View and a great picture uh you know one of the best models of school choice in America is the state of Florida and one of the biggest reasons why is our next speaker today who is a former governor of the state of Florida who fought these fights in the trenches to bring reform to the state and make sure every kid in the State of Florida has an opportunity now he's one of the leaders in Washington in trying to make sure we have federal policy that also helps make sure that every kid in America has a chance to go to a quality school with no further Ado I give you Senator Rick Scott foreign how many of you have been to Florida how's the weather there as compared to here I don't like cold weather I grew up in the Midwest and I was it took me I moved eight states to get to Florida but I got there I do not like cold weather I'm a I'm blessed like each of you the I live in this country I was born to a single mom we lived in public housing in Illinois and my mom told me I could be anything and I believed it the she told me that I had to get a good education and I could be anything I was I was for eight years I was a governor of Florida how many of you are thinking about being the governor okay so let me give you the deal okay how would you like to live in the governor's mansion how would you like to have dinner at the White House how would you like to meet kings and queens okay how would you like to have Secret Service how would you like to have popcorn ice cream whenever you want if you're the governor of Florida you get all those things all right so here's the deal to be the governor what you have to do is you have to get a great education and you have to get a job and work your butt off but it's fun and you get to do good things for other people so I hope all of you move to Florida and run for governor in about what 20 or 25 or 35 years let me tell you the importance of school choice your parents should have the choice of where you go to school how many of you get an allowance or make some money how would you like you know your teacher your principal or somebody say well you know that toy you want to buy with that or that book you want to buy no you can't buy that one you got to buy this one over here you wouldn't like that and who cares about your education more than anybody else your parents and you so I've been a big supporter of school choice it's a big we have unbelievable school choice in Florida so if you move to Florida you'll be able to go to any school you want to go to but in the meantime we got to fight all over the country to make sure we have great school choice so hope you have fun today stay out of the cold and eventually I hope you all move to Florida bye-bye all right gang it's been a little while we're going to work a little bit on our energy all right this time what we're going to do is we're going to stand up today the parents have choice all right so here we go let's do it loud now all right [Applause] here we go now one of the really great things that's happening Across America is as more and more families have started to have opportunities more and more leaders are stepping forward to help fight that cause for the families that need it the next speaker that's going to talk to you day today is I think one of the most exciting new leaders to hit the United States Senate from the great state of North Carolina Senator bud [Applause] [Music] [Applause] how's everybody doing this morning you guys all right do we have any North Carolinians out there all right say it again a little louder there you go all right all right so how many of you all so we how many of you all have ever been in a group or a school and you walked in and you were the new kid or you're the new guy right I think about every hand we need some more hands to go up well I want to let you all know that I am the new guy the new kid in the U.S Senate there's only a handful of us so I know how it feels thank you but I want to let you know that last year all around North Carolina we've got as you all from North Carolina know we have 100 counties I went to each and every one of those 100 counties some of them multiple times and here's what I heard I mean I met people of all types I met every age every race every demographic every background old young every belief and here's one thing that everyone had in common they believed that all of our kids should get a good education do you all believe that absolutely so when I was traveling around our great state and I know Senator Rick Scott a lot of Senator Scott's today right but as you met Senator Rick Scott he said move to Florida well I want you to come to North Carolina but when I was around each and every one of those I promised them that if they voted for me that I would do everything that I could to help them and their parents have a say in their own education do you all believe that right so as a dad of three kids and we chose early on that for us of course I had gone to public high school I had gone to a little private school before that had gone to a Christian School for for Graduate Studies but we decided Amy Kate and I that we would homeschool our kids so that's educational choice right there but I know firsthand that no two kids are alike I mean we've got three kids and they're not all alike and that means that the approach to education should be one that fits each and every student a student shouldn't have to fit a one-size-fits-all approach so putting parents in charge when it comes to their kids education I think that that is one of the Civil Rights issue of our day-to-day so when we're celebrating national school choice week uh it shines a much needed Spotlight on the mission to empower parents and spread educational Freedom across our country so at the end of the day when we serve and these elected roles like Congressman Messer did and is the ones you here today have our role is to make people's lives better and to make sure that you all inherit a country full of opportunity and full of freedom so that's what I told the people back in North Carolina that I would do and that's what I'm going to do for each and every one of you all as long as I have this job so thank you all for having me here today and may God bless each and every one of you appreciate it buddy next up I I may have mentioned to you earlier I'm from the great state of Indiana anybody else here from Indiana we can yell for that hey right they yelled for North Carolina we can yell for Indiana but the next Senator Huff is a friend of mine from the great state of Indiana somebody who uniquely I think for the United States Senate served eight or nine years on the local school board a great champion of freedom and a great Champion for America's kids I give you Senator Braun foreign so how do you like the schools you attend and how many parents do we have in the room you know our country was built upon a few simple principles our Founders loved competition they wanted Freedom that's why they put the great experiment together back when they did and then something so important is education has evolved into a system where it's kind of one size fits all Senator budge said he came from a good public school system many of us did in Indiana as well but when we started doing things there we've led the nation on Choice competition transparency a guy named Mitch Daniels who used to be our governor made that a really important thing you cannot as a consumer of anything expect that you're going to get the best result when you can only shop one place think about it you want to have that freedom to choose and parents wanting to be in that equation of being part of that process I got the interview the Secretary of Education I'm on health education labor and pensions and tried to get from him who that most important stakeholder should be in our own kids education couldn't quite get it out on that first discussion it should be you parents you should have that choice foreign all of you here that have had the benefit of being able to choose Thank your parents for being along on that Journey give them a big round of applause so the good news is I was on a local school board for 10 years right about then is when in Indiana you can move among school districts without paying a transfer fee that was an Alleluia moment for many of us and then over the last 10 years we've done things that's trying to make choice at the ultimate level to where regardless of where you're at you can do it affordably and choose where you want to go so rest assured that you are lucky that you've got that kudos to you as students parents being along on the journey and be confident that there are many of us looking to get that done across the country and we're moving in the right direction thank you all right remember what we said at the beginning we're working here through about an hour and 15 minutes we're about 45 minutes through it I want to keep our energy up so I'm going to ask everybody to stand one more time or probably I'm gonna do this twice more but this will be the everybody's stand all right can you grab your scarf just a second all right now we're going to go back we're gonna do it again when [Applause] yeah we're gonna do it louder than that so here we go [Applause] thank you thank you so much that we're here to remind these leaders why these opportunities are so important the next person up is one of the most important education policy leaders in America you know one of the amazing things about our system of government is no one person's in charge it takes a lot of different leaders to influence things and when it comes to education policy there's nobody that's any more influential than the chairwoman of the house education and Workforce committee a lifetime career educator and a great Champion for America's kids I give you the gentle woman from North Carolina my friend Virginia Fox Y what a great crowd here this morning and I'm I'm glad Congressman Messer gets you up to get your blood stirring and keep you excited but we all should all be excited every day about the issue of Education freedom and school choice you know the author of Ecclesiastes wrote there's nothing new Under the Sun now the author of Ecclesiastes said a lot of other things but that's one thing education Freedom isn't a new idea in fact the belief that parents have a right to choose how their children are educated has been the norm for most of human history and it certainly was the norm for the United States a nation founded on the principles of freedom and self-government yet since state-sponsored education took hold in our country a powerful education bureaucracy has tracked millions of students in failing Public Schools this cannot continue we need a system that cares more about the interests of students than preserving its own power and control I know all of you students here today are grateful that you can choose where you go to school it's time to give more students that same choice [Applause] [Music] and it can't be said enough our country was founded on freedom freedom made the United States of America the greatest nation in the world our free market dramatically increased the quality of Living in America and academic freedom has led to unbelievable technological innovations the fact that these principles are under attack today is a threat to Future Innovation it's time to apply our most fundamental principle freedom to our most fundamental system education I've never been more optimistic about educational freedom than I am today traditional government-run schools have lost over a million students in the past three years school closures brought the classroom into the home and parents finally saw what their students were learning and were rightly horrified since then enrollment at private Christian Schools is up 35 percent Charter School enrollment is up by seven percent and homeschooling enrollment has doubled education Freedom Is On The Rise [Applause] Alexander Hamilton wrote in the first Federalist paper that this great experiment meaning the United States would prove once and for all whether it is possible to establish governments Guided by reflection and choice we've had more than 200 years of demonstrating that freedom and choice are not just possible and preferable they are essential and now it's that's exactly right and now we must reinvigorate our commitment to these founding principles particularly when it comes to education our free market principles are responsible for creating the most prosperous Nation ever to exist giving individuals the freedom and choice to create build and innovate is a winning model and it is one we must apply to education embracing a free market education system instead of a government-run monopoly will make better schools better students and better citizens our children need a solid foundation so let's provide them with the best one we have Freedom thank you very much and God bless you so the students the students in here have you ever heard of Schoolhouse Rock is that something you guys have heard at least your teachers have right teachers you know Schoolhouse Rock You know I have to tell you when I first when I came to Congress I've often thought about that little song I'm Just a Bill I'm only a bill and I'm waiting here on Capitol Hill of the if you students have you seen this little video If you haven't like you can Google it it is really a great kind of like two-minute civics lesson and how a bill becomes law and it you know just a little silly cartoon well our next speaker what makes me think about that little diddy from Schoolhouse Rock is that as we talk about driving policy to create better educational choice for families Across America using freedom to make sure every kid in America has an opportunity to go to a better school it takes policy to do that and it takes legislators who are willing to step forward and help lead those efforts our next speaker is the lead author of legislation called the ecca ecca it's a 10 billion dollar federal school choice tax credit that would make sure two million kids in America had access to better educational opportunities probably more than doubling the number of kids that have access to private school in that way today so he's a big deal we appreciate him being here I hope you will give him a rousing round of applause as he comes on representative Adrian Smith from Nebraska [Applause] [Music] today to you I wish we're a little bit flipped that myself and all my colleagues could listen to what you have to say because last night at the reception I was grateful to hear from just a few students uh it is so important that you are engaged one thing I've learned as I engage with with students across my district and communities it's there are so many people cheering you on they want you to do well your parents obviously those those who look after you want you to do well I've also found that your neighbors down the street or even across the country want you to do well so I am very proud to have introduced the legislation that encourages folks who want you to do well encourages them to invest in students across America and in a way that is efficient and effective so that taxpayer dollars can can be efficiently used because it is an investment in in all of you in students across America so thank you for showing up here today now for engaging in a way and sharing your story your story needs to be heard and and I uh I'm inspired by what you have to say and certainly as as we have debates uh across uh Congress both sides of the aisle the house and the Senate I think there are many great stories that you can share and and we shouldn't be be afraid of disagreement from time to time our country was founded on disagreement and an exchange of ideas and ultimately people coming together because they wanted a brighter future they wanted the freedoms that have been talked about today to be applied uh in as you would see fit and and to empower you uh for a stronger future so we're going to have the debates that we need to have that I think can be constructive and productive of four of the brighter future with that I'll just close uh and quote a very famous Nebraskan and say get her done have a great day thank you all thanks very much you know I mentioned to you earlier with Senator bud you know one of the exciting things you have happening in Washington as this school choice movement has grown as more and more families are able to show the positive example that comes with it you have leaders who are stepping forward here in Washington and making school choice and education opportunity part of the their why part of why they ran and and came to Congress in the first place our next leader is a great example of that Congressman Williams from New York please come on out and say hello thank you [Music] I can't imagine how many politicians they're going to make you listen to today and uh you know when they said that education would be painful this is really what they meant um but I'm new to politics so literally a year ago I had never been involved in politics at all and I quite literally showed up just about a year ago and said I'm Brandon Williams I'm running for the United States Congress and the reason I tell you that story is that I I think it mirrors where perhaps some of you are today that each of you have a story and potential you've shown up here and you'll show up in your communities and you say you know whatever your name is I have a right to a good education you know I have a future I have potential I'm here to contribute and I need you to give me the freedom to do that and to fulfill that and so school choice I'll just tell you that my wife Stephanie and I really my wife Stephanie we homeschooled our two children and uh and they've been very successful as they've gone on to college and to do other things when I ran for office I was asked the question and because I'm not a politician I hadn't prepared they said you know what do you think about education we have some of the poorest neighborhoods the poorest children in America live in my district near Syracuse and my answer was we need school choice we need school choice because parents in every neighborhood love their children just as much as the parents in the suburbs or the parents in other places and you have to give them the chance to advocate for their children no two children learn the same no one system is right for all children and so to release your potential you need to have that choice if it's Charter Schools parochial schools in our case homeschooling and the education system should have to compete for those dollars so that it improves because you and your families are choosing with your feet to allocate government resources that you can direct that you know best and so that's where I come from I've just been named to the education and Workforce committee and I've requested to be on the K-12 committee so that I can advocate for that and I hope that if you have issues or stories that you want to magnify that you will reach out to my office tell us those stories tell us how we can help if Brandon Williams in New York 22 and thank you so much for being here [Applause] real quick while we do this I'm going to kind of tell I'm going to ask you guys to think as we get ready stand up real quick you can lean a little right lean on the left how many of you before you walked in the building today looked up and saw that Dome anybody did you look up and see it and I think it's important that we realize you know Brandon made a kind of a funny joke and and also a reality right we're hearing from a lot of people today but you really think about this you're hearing from these people on behalf of millions of kids in America that need a chance they don't have and every one of these leaders that stands up here and talks to you basically they're making a promise to you they're making a promise that they're going to fight for America's kids and they're going to make sure they have opportunities the same kinds of opportunities everybody in this room is getting a chance to do now you all can sit back down just want to give you a little chance to stretch um one of my favorite people and there's a lot of friends that have talked today but um somebody who is a just a great person a great friend of mine a proud graduate of the of Notre Dame and also a proud Champion for the people of Pennsylvania and a great Champion for America's kids representative Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania come on up Mike thank you so you all got to stand up for a minute right I mean I don't know how you do it I I would never be able to sit this long to listen to politicians talk listen I'm glad you're here the reason I'm really glad you're here is you know the key to your future [Music] you know where your future lies and you know that everything in your future depends on how well educated you are and you should never ever be deprived of reaching whatever goal it is you've set for yourself now Congress and Mr Nice served together uh and we do have an affection for the state of Indiana I did spent four years in South Bend at the University of Notre Dame which I thought was a phenomenal opportunity for me I certainly didn't deserve it I didn't realize it at the time but how special it would be to me and how long it would carry me through my life but I want you to understand something I want you to look at each other and understand this you are 25 of our population you are a hundred percent of our future you are the future of the United States of America you are the future of everything good that could possibly come out of the greatest nation the world has ever known it is our duty to educate you not that you can just participate but that you can dominate there is no reason for any one of you to ever go through life and feel somehow you were deprived of a great education that's just not who America is that's not who she's ever been that's not who she should ever be it just should always come down to this our most precious asset is our youth everything that's going to happen in the future is going to happen because of you listen I have a great short time to speak to you but I do want you to understand this and I mean this when I say that please don't ever think that you just want to participate and you know the famous thing people say all the time they talk about how much they love winning you know what's more important than love and winning you gotta hate losing you gotta hate it with every fiber of your body and you've got to refuse to lose you've got to refuse any opportunity that you have in the future not to participate in and as I said I don't want you to just participate I want you to dominate I want you to control your future I want you to have the brightest future you can possibly have because you've grown up in the greatest country the world has ever known so thanks so much God bless all of you let's just all refuse to lose and let's just keep on winning Luke thanks so much thanks everybody hitting we're hitting the stretch run here you're doing an awesome job our next speaker um you talk about living the American dream I mean Burgess Owens grew up and you know Rose through Sports to be playing in the NFL successful small business owner now a um Champion for freedom and kids in the United States Congress no better leader on the legislation we've talked talked about the ecca then the next gentleman is going to talk to you how about a rousing round of applause for Congressman Burgess Owens of Utah [Music] hello there how you guys doing quick uh quick update first of all I was raised by a remarkable generation of men and women who believe in Freedom who believe in their kids I grew up in a time of 1960s Jim Crow segregation my first exposure to white Americans was until I was 16 years old let me tell you what that Community was so successful though because they believed in investing in their children they believed that their children have a greater future than they did they focused on a few basic tenets that this Congress will be talking about faith family the free market and education free can never be that was Thomas Jefferson one of our Founders we need to be educated we need to be able to think we need to be able to see a great vision know that we can get there let me tell you a little bit about that generation to raise me that you guys don't know about this is why that's why education is so important we could look back on our past and see what our vision could look like through those who succeeded in our past this is what the community group that raised me was all about because they believed in faith family the free market and education was at the very core the black community in the 40s 50s and 60s LED our country in the growth in middle class little country men matriculating for college leaving college and moving on being successful let our country men committed to marriage in percentage of entrepreneurs people are willing to take a risk to go out and build a business to invest in their Community because they had such a vision and they could articulate themselves and they believed that the American way would work for them your future should be Unlimited there's a couple things I raised my kids with and I want you guys to think about this because this is the one country you can do this this is a country where you need to dream big and know that as you dream big your dreams will will come to fruition if you're willing to work for it to achieve to fail to get back up again and dream again it's all about the dream of friends and every one of you guys should have the opportunity to dream as big as you want to by being educated in the schools your parents want you to go to that they know that would fit your personality would fit the way you think and when you leave that Community because you've been educated the biggest grip you can give to your friends to those who follow behind you is this if I can do it you can do it that's the American way a cheese you can look back and tell people give them hope that they can see through the same process just know we have a Congress that believes in you that believes in your potential that knows if you're given the chance no matter what ZIP code you live in what color will create it doesn't matter let's give you the best quality education you could ever receive and you will present and represent our country in a great way and we're so excited about that we believe in you believe in yourself Focus educate educate yourself and be willing to fail okay I want you to understand this success is about failing enough to realize how not to fail the next time but you got to do it and you'll never be ashamed of the fact that you're falling forward because that's what it's all about that's what this coach is all about meritocracy is above everything else meritocracy working hard in the next guy succeed in commanding respect because you work hard the next guy do that you'll succeed and listen we have a team here wouldn't work with you willing to give you those opportunities so take advantage of it be proud of who you are make your family name a proud name and dream big okay all the best we'll see you later all right next up we have another um product of school choice programs miles Slade Bowers I want to let miles tell you his great story of how school choice policies have impacted his life come on Miles uh good morning I promise that I will make you stand up or yell at you you already have been through enough of that so I'm going to try to keep it simple I only came here to share with you one fact um a story and a little bit about who we are so first and foremost congratulations to all of you and to myself we are school choice recipients that's my facts um in in a world where in most cases when this legislation first started and we have met some of the leaders in the first of the Front Runners and movement um they told us it wasn't possible and I'm looking at all of you and I say that that's you know obviously they're wrong and I can still believe that they are um the next thing is that we aren't the last this is the biggest Year we're anticipating movement in school choice there will be rooms just like this full of young people wearing these bright yellow scarves all across the country today tomorrow and next year in years to come we are making impactful movement and we're Shifting the world and it's put primarily because we have so many of you all who who tell your stories who communicate what it really is like to live through these educational and hard times our legislators can only do so much in the frame of arguing but arguing for you all you are are the reason someone came up there up here this morning and said you are our Focus you are our future you are our main priority that's true there's nothing that anyone could ever take away from you than that just a little bit about myself I am from a small town called still in Pennsylvania if you don't know we produce steel not too much anymore but you know that's kind of how we got the name and I went to a private school it was never in my mother's interest to send us to the public school not that she had not experienced it because she had herself attended that school in many of our previous family members but she went to college and found found that she was a little bit unprepared and unsuited in comparison to her counterparts and she didn't want that for her children in about 2018 uh as as things do and as prices rise and the world was in in kind of an upward swing to not fun to really not fun funds ran out there was no more access to money and it was becoming more reality that I was going to be joining my mother's Legacy and attending a school that really didn't set her up for the future that did not prepare her for the day that did not prepare her for tomorrow then I received a life-changing last minute kind of you know two weeks actually two weeks before I was slotted to go back to school I received a scholarship that allowed me to continue my education at Bishop McDevitt High School a premier private institution that not only allowed aligned with my values but was my fit you know they're um one of the questions I got asked last night and a little odd but you know something that really changed me is someone came up to me and asked me what my favorite color was and I pondered it for a little bit and I was like well I read um and they were like is that the best color and I was like well I mean for me yes and certainly in the same way school choice is very similar the school that you and your families decide to choose might not be the perfect option might not be the greatest school in America but it fits you we're empowering you to make the choice somebody that's something that you're owed and it's certainly not something that should be a privilege of money or access or or status you all deserve every opportunity that is granted to every single person and we believe that not only for you all but for Millions Across America and certainly the 2.7 million children sitting in PA right now waiting on those life-changing movements so I thank you all for being courageous enough to stand out here with us today and wearing these regular scarves because it takes a lot to rock this color to be honest with you um but certainly we do appreciate you all and your and your aids to our movement thank you so much my name is Mars thank you thanks y'all I think we got two more speakers so we're almost there right thank you all for being here thanks for all that you're doing I want to we have another story a a leader or somebody who is a product of of a school choice programs and she's going to tell you her story of how those programs have changed her life Angela Williams come on up [Applause] [Music] before I begin I would like to share a quote with you all education is the key to unlocking the world it is the passport to Freedom and that's by Oprah Winfrey I started my journey with the DC opportunity scholarship in 2020. I was on the lookout for middle schools and I didn't know where to go my mom was already on Washington school for girls but she was unsure because of the cost my best friend's parents put her in the DC opportunity scholarship program and my mom was interested we soon found out that wsg offers a scholarship following admission through the OSP program this was revolutionary I had an experienced private school before and I was excited to see what was next my time at wsg has been life-changing I didn't know what to expect from here but I now know that this was the best thing that has probably ever happened to me I've made so many friends and I've broken all from my shy ways I've encountered so many academic opportunities that have prepared me for the next part of my journey High School I would recommend wsg to any girl who is looking for a Sisterhood and a caring environment and those are just a few things that I love about Washington School for Girls the amount of experiences I've been through is unexplainable from museums to even speeches for the national park Trust that's the power of the OSP scholarship if I hadn't received that I don't think I would be who I am today the DC opportunity scholarship offers support to those who need it many people in BC and even around the world cannot afford schools I believe that everyone deserves a right to a quality education no matter who you are if we as a society can understand this we can promote higher quality education and I think that the DC opportunity scholarship is a great start [Applause] pardon oh chair all right couple quick things first I think we're down to our last speaker how about a round of approach for that all right now I'm going to get our energy up well yes so we're going to all stand up we're going to all stand up everybody [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] together toys [Applause] [Music] [Applause] all right look there's there's two things I want y'all to think about and then I'm gonna bring up our next and final speaker okay the first thing everybody take a seat if you want yeah you can stand a little bit if you want we're going to get ready to go two things I want you to think about you heard all these different stories from people all across America leaders but people honestly just like you one of the most important things to take from today every one of these people presidents of universities leaders like our next speaker just people just kids that used to sit in auditoriums and list of people talk maybe a little bit bored thinking about the future but they stuck to it and had a chance you can have that chance too secondly thank you for your service today because I want to tell you something that's going to happen either this year next year sometime in the next few years we're going to pass legislation here in Washington D.C that's a 10 billion dollar tax credit that gives 2 million kids an opportunity we can applaud that and when that happens when you see that on the TV when you read it in the newspaper on your phone I want you to know that you did that you were part of why that happened because you listened to these leaders today and you heard them make promises to you the next speaker is somebody who I think has made the biggest promise in the history of the school Choice Movement you know this is a movement gone off we're very active and bring program which has been great for thousands of kids here including all of you but never in the history of our country had a leader step forward and say you know we can do more than that we can do a lot more than that and this next speaker the Speaker of the House the third highest ranking officer in America put together something called the commitment to America and high ranking in that commitment was a commitment to America's parents and America's kids to make sure that Millions would have opportunities that they don't have today he's also a personal friend of mine I give you the Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy thank you you know you speak here you're gonna go down there yeah of course all right so the Cornerstone kids are going down with you going down you need a mic let's get you a mic they're okay if I come to you see if that works how about this is this better all right how many are on a DC opportunity scholarship thank you for doing that thank you now I know we've had a long day you had to talk to hear from a lot of different people right but did you get to hear from Tim Scott isn't he fabulous he's one of my best friends Tim is an amazing guy and he's passionate he's passionate for you may not even know him but he's passionate for you to give you a better opportunity because the one thing we've always learned is education is the great equalizer but the only way education be a great equalizer is that you have the choice you have the choice of where you want to go and the one thing that Luke was talking about up here is we put out what is called the commitment to America in this we told America what would we do if you lent us the power to be in charge and we said we want to build a nation that's built on freedom and that means where children can dream big where children actually come first so our goal out here is to add a million more opportunity scholarships across this nation I'm gonna tell you a quick story all right I'm not going to keep you long you're tired you've been around I don't know if any of you paid attention to politics I don't know if you paid attention to the speaker race and something happened in the speaker race if you watched I didn't win on the first time and you wonder about that right well has that happened before yeah but it's been like 150 years it took me 15 times all right I just never gave up but I want you to learn something from that all right so I'm born in this town called Bakersfield California it's not a big city and my family didn't have wealth but we didn't have choice either right I couldn't go to any school I wanted to and when I got out of school my folks didn't have wealth to send me to college so I went to Junior College and I had to help pay my way through it so I would flip cars I found out later it was illegal but I was just trying to do what I could right and then when you're junior college you want to go visit your friends who are away at College my best friend he got a scholarship to Stanford he's the running back up their mother friends with at USC and my other friends are in San Diego State so I was going to San Diego State that weekend to go see them and so I go to the grocery store to cash a check so I have some money for the weekend right the day before the lottery started in California so I bought a lottery ticket and you know what I won the lottery now it wasn't the millions and billions you read about but I won five thousand dollars that's the most you go in back then long before you were born so think about that I'm 20 years old it's Friday night I just won five thousand dollars I'm spending the weekend right by Tijuana right didn't do anything crazy but came back but when I come back I take the money and I believe in taking risk not doing what others so I invested in the stock market I did pretty well so the end of the next semester I took a break from school and I went to try to buy a business I tried to buy like a Subway and they wouldn't sell me one because they said you're only 20. you don't know what you're doing one thing I want you to learn if someone tells you you don't know what you're doing you prove to them they're wrong so I went out and I created my own business and I became very successful it was a deli in the end of two years I now had enough money I could pay my whole way through college and I wouldn't have to work so I'm going to college and in the paper they had this article to be a summer intern in Washington DC with my local Congressman I did not know this man but I thought he'd be lucky to have me so I applied you know what he did he turned me down but in the turndown letter he made this really nice little thing so I went back to him you know what happened I'm a now elected to the congressional seat I couldn't get an internship I'm now the 55th Speaker of the House but this is what I want to tell you about that for the first six years of my education I had to go to speech lessons because I couldn't say my alphabet I was not the valedictorian I had to struggle for everything that happened so what's going to happen in your life is not going to come easy but you just made a decision it's going to make your future brighter you had a choice of where you wanted to get your education so I hope you value it I hope you work at it and when you have a struggle do not give up the one thing my father taught me it's not how you start it's how you finish so you may not have started with everything you wanted in life but you know what with the work you're doing you can end up with everything you need in life thank you very much and God bless yes the pause for young people up here from Cornerstone did we get a picture with Kevin with these young guys you're going to get them right here what grade are you all in hey love it so quick picture there with those guys we can applaud that Cornerstone and everybody else that's good and then and then Kevin's second picture if you want did you get that already you already got it and then from the stage we're going to do a picture back this way of everybody here for school choice week so speaker can be here but if they're going to take a picture there yeah just stay here you guys can come here where should we be well I know we'll do what you may be back here I don't know maybe back here would be good up front that's where we should be he says we're supposed to be up there all right so let's go up that way all right is it better if everybody stands or sits everybody stand we like standing anyway don't we that's better yeah are we good foreign [Music] so the speakers [Music] ready here we go everybody smile all right [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] okay now team how about everybody give themselves a round of applause thank you so much thank you so much for being here um I really do sincerely believe we've made a difference today and everybody can be proud as bigger opportunities happen for kids across America I now want to tell you that the rally is over we are done with our speakers and um I I guess I am to dismiss schools by name so that way we'll have a little bit of order as we head on our way out first Our Lady of Victory School you all want to clear we'll let them kind of get going and then once they kind of Hit the corner there I'll call the next one

former naval flight officer who served three tours in Southeast Asia I know how hard it can be to spend months in some cases years away from home I remember how exciting it was for all of us to get mail from our families and now I'm sure that our servicemembers eagerly check facebook an email forward from the loved ones today but nothing means more than receiving a letter saying thanks or a package of gifts around this time of year so let's continue the tradition of sending packages and letters in support of our men and women in uniform this holiday season you know it's hard to feel at home when you're serving in a faraway corner of the globe but it can bring just a little bit of home to them this week I'm participating a unique program that seeks to bring a touch of home to our troops serving overseas it's called holiday mail for Heroes and it's supported by the American Red Cross pitney bowes and Walter Reed Medical Center this is the fifth year that people from all across America kids in holiday greetings expressions of gratitude and well wishes to our service members to veterans and their families by visiting the Red Cross's website and clicking on the holiday mail for Heroes link this expression of gratitude won't take long but you mean a lot to those fighting in harm's way or station away from home this holiday season I'm excited to take part in this effort and to thank our troops for their selfless sacrifice for our country and I hope you'll join us together we could do our part to support our men and women in uniform by giving them that special touch of home this holiday season thanks very much

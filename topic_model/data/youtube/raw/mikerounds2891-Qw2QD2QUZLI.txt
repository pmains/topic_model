Thank You mr. Jared uh gentlemen first of all thanks and I appreciate the work that you have done in your organization's have done in making this whole thing work as well as it has in a very short period of time ago I I would ask first of all to secretary minuchin and discussing with our local lenders they've got a number of questions coming in with regard to PPP and specifically to different sections the portion of number one was the rule in which we ask that these loans be literally divvied out and and accepted within 10 days of the time of approval and second of all how that relates to a June 30th date for the execution or completion of the use of those loans and mr. secretary I don't find where there's actually a June 30th end date where that has to happen in order to to facilitate forgiveness of that loan can you talk a little bit about your options or the flexibility you have with regard to the PPP and the forgiveness of loans and that June 30th date that so many people have concerns about well let me just comment I think the concern that people have that's even bigger that we'd like to get a bipartisan technical fix is you said there's the 10 days to disperse it we've then given banks another 10 days and people having spent sent back the documents and then there's the 8 week period so companies are really having issues with not necessarily being able to use it during that eight weeks they don't want more money but one flexibility that they can use it in longer than an eight week period and as it relates to the June 30th issue we're happy to follow up with your staff and talk about where that fits into the bill I noted with interest a letter from Vice Chair laurels recommending that Congress and give regulators discretion to loosen certain capital requirements prescribed by section 171 of dodd-frank do you share vice-chairs think in what additional measures do you think Congress and the Federal Reserve should consider I do share that so the idea is temporarily during this period unusual unique period in our history the banks have been strong they've been making loans they've taking into and because of the growth in their balance sheet they're constrained by some of these regulations because they're taking on board very low risk assets so we try to provide relief so they can continue to do what they're doing so I do support that and we've done a number of things and then you know we'll we'll let you know as we do as we see the need for other adjustments one thought was regard to in the middle of this call the nineteen pandemic we still have a discussion about and on a regular basis get questions from tax payers here about the amount of money that we borrowed and what we're gonna do about it you're gonna play a key role in how we lay out that that repayment plan and you talked a little bit about the tools available to you specifically with regard to long or ultra long Treasury bonds I know it's been a hot topic and I know that most recently you launched a 20-year bond can you talk about the maturities how you plan on laying that out the strategy that you're using to best accommodate our needs for the immediate liquidity but also recognizing that you've got some tools available and with these ultra-low interest rates that we're at right now and may very well work to our benefit to to feather this out over an extended period of time well thank you I'm glad you asked that question because I think it's it's very important so the first I would just answer prior to this we spent a lot of time looking at 50 and hundred year bonds and determined that there just wasn't enough demand to make it worth it given our borrowing sizes we did get advice on a 20 year so we've added the 20 year that gives us the ability to both extend the duration as well as to raise significant amount of funds so it is my intention as you've described to borrow a lot of money in the short term to have the funding but then to expand our financing in 10 20 and 30-year bonds what I'd like to do is lock in a significant amount at very low interest rates so that the money we're borrowing can be paid back and dealt with over a long period of time Thank You senator Warren

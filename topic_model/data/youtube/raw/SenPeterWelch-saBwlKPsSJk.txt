  GOING TO TAKE THEM DOWN, AND YOU HAVEN'T. AND THEY'RE STILL UP. >> THE GENTLEMAN'S TIME HAS  EXPIRED. CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE GENTLEMAN  FROM VERMONT. >> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. MR. ZUCKERBERG, YOU ACKNOWLEDGED CANDIDLY THAT FACEBOOK MADE A  MISTAKE. YOU DID AN ANALYSIS OF HOW IT  HAPPENED. YOU PROMISED ACTION. WE'RE AT THE POINT WHERE THE  ACTION WILL SPEAK MUCH LOUDER  THAN THE WORDS. BUT MR. CHAIRMAN, THIS CONGRESS  HAS MADE A MISTAKE. THIS WAS FORESEEABLE AND  INEVITABLE, AND WE DID NOTHING  ABOUT IT. CONGRESSWOMAN BLACKBURN AND I  HAD A GROUP, A PRIVACY WORKING  GROUP, SIX MEETINGS WITH MANY OF THE INDUSTRY PLAYERS. THERE WAS AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT ON  BOTH SIDES THAT PRIVACY WAS NOT  BEING PROTECTED. THERE WAS NO REASONABLE  SAFEGUARD FOR AMERICANS'  PRIVACY. BUT THERE WAS AN INABILITY TO  COME TO A CONCLUSION. SO WE ALSO HAVE AN OBLIGATION. IN AN EFFORT TO MOVE FORWARD,  MR. ZUCKERBERG, I'VE FRAMED SOME QUESTIONS THAT HOPEFULLY WILL  ALLOW A REASONABLE YES OR NO  ANSWER TO SEE IF THERE'S SOME  COMMON GROUND TO ACHIEVE THE  GOAL YOU ASSERT YOU HAVE AND WE  CERTAINLY HAVE, THE OBLIGATION  TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF  AMERICAN CONSUMERS. FIRST, DO YOU BELIEVE CONSUMERS  HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW AND CONTROL WHAT PERSONAL DATA COMPANIES  COLLECT FROM THEM? >> YES. >> DO YOU BELIEVE THAT CONSUMERS HAVE A RIGHT TO CONTROL HOW AND  WITH WHOM THEIR PERSONAL  INFORMATION IS SHARED WITH THIRD PARTIES? >> CONGRESSMAN, YES, OF COURSE. >> AND DO YOU BELIEVE THAT  CONSUMERS HAVE A RIGHT TO SECURE AND RESPONSIBLE HANDLING OF  THEIR PERSONAL DATA? >> YES, CONGRESSMAN. >> AND DO YOU BELIEVE THAT  CONSUMERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO  EASILY PLACE LIMITS ON THE  PERSONAL DATA THAT COMPANIES  COLLECT AND RETAIN? >> CONGRESSMAN, THAT SEEMS LIKE  A REASONABLE PRINCIPLE TO ME. >> AND DO YOU BELIEVE THAT  CONSUMERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO  CORRECT OR DELETE INACCURATE  PERSONAL DATA THAT COMPANIES  HAVE OBTAINED? >> CONGRESSMAN, THAT ONE MIGHT  BE MORE INTERESTING TO DEBATE. >> WELL, THEN GET BACK TO US  WITH SPECIFICS ON THAT. I THINK THEY DO HAVE THAT RIGHT. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT CONSUMERS  SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE THEIR  DATA DELETED IMMEDIATELY FROM  FACEBOOK WHEN THEY STOP USING  THE SERVICE? >> YES, CONGRESSMAN, AND THEY  HAVE THAT ABILITY. >> GOOD. AND DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE  FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION OR  ANOTHER PROPERLY RESOURCED  GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY WITH RULE  MAKING AUTHORITY SHOULD BE ABLE  TO DETERMINE ON A REGULAR BASIS  WHAT IS CONSIDERED PERSONAL  INFORMATION TO PROVIDE CERTAINTY FOR CONSUMERS AND COMPANIES WHAT INFORMATION NEEDS TO BE  PROTECTED MOST TIGHTLY? >> CONGRESSMAN, I CERTAINLY  THINK THAT'S AN AREA WHERE WE  SHOULD DISCUSS SOME SORT OF  OVERSIGHT. >> THERE'S NOT A BIG DISCUSSION  HERE. WHO GETS THE FINAL SAY? IS IT THE PRIVATE MARKET,  COMPANIES LIKE YOURS, OR IS  THERE A GOVERNMENTAL FUNCTION  HERE THAT DEFINES WHAT PRIVACY  IS? >> CONGRESSMAN, I THINK THIS IS  AN AREA WHERE SOME REGULATION  MAKES SENSE. YOU PROPOSED A VERY SPECIFIC  THING, AND I THINK THE DETAILS  MATTER. >> ALL RIGHT. LET ME ASK YOU THIS. WILL YOU WORK WITH THIS  COMMITTEE TO HELP THE U.S. PUT  IN PLACE OUR OWN PRIVACY  REGULATION THAT PRIORITIZES  CONSUMERS' RIGHT TO PRIVACY? JUST AS THE EU HAS DONE. >> CONGRESSMAN, YES. I'LL MAKE SURE THAT WE WORK WITH YOU TO FLESH THIS OUT. >> ALL RIGHT. AND YOU HAVE INDICATED FACEBOOK  HAS NOT ALWAYS PROTECTED THE  PRIVACY OF THEIR USERS  THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY'S  HISTORY. IT SEEMS, THOUGH, FROM YOUR  ANSWERS, THAT CONSUMERS -- YOU  AGREE THAT CONSUMERS DO HAVE A  FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY  THAT EMPOWERS THEM TO CONTROL  THE COLLECTION, THE USE, THE  SHARING OF THEIR PERSONAL  INFORMATION ONLINE. AND MR. CHAIRMAN -- AND THANK  YOU. MR. CHAIRMAN, PRIVACY CANNOT BE  BASED JUST ON COMPANY POLICIES,  WHETHER IT'S FACEBOOK OR ANY  OTHER COMPANY. THERE HAS TO BE A WILLINGNESS ON

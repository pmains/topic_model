for more reaction to what is unfolded in the last hour on hill let's speak with congressman Tim Ryan of Ohio Congress are good to have you with us it's good to be with you yet do you think this is what the people of Ohio want no they want stable government and we just can't seem to get it from the Republicans I mean we've got a group of extremists that are really running the shop down here we can't get a bill just a funny Homeland Security we have the Prime Minister of Israel coming next week there's going to be a lot of diplomats here and we're going to shut down the homeland security and we were in this you know rat race here where it's two weeks three weeks three weeks more you can't run an operation like this it's ridiculous how committed were the Democrats not to move on this bill tonight were there some in caucus that said all right let's do the three week was there much of an argument amongst the Democrats to go down this road not a whole lot there were some who obviously represent a lot of the people in homeland security in Northern Virginia or other little pockets throughout the country who voted the other way but for the most part I think we got to stand our ground and say hey we need a functioning government here we can't govern three weeks at a time there are budgets there are people working there are families like get your act together and let's make sure we fund the government there's a bill out there a clean bill till September 30th this is about arithmetic EDD John Boehner does not have the votes in his own caucus there aren't the votes in the Senate to do what the Tea Party people want there's a Democratic president in the White House they're not going to get everything they want this is about arithmetic and figure out you know what you can get done get as much as you can and make a deal that moves the ball down the field so who are these people in the house who are the ringleaders in the house that simply would not budge on this bill there's about 50 members it's your Republican Study Committee it's your most extreme conservative members of caen caucus ideological have said things in their congressional district against the President Obama so therefore they can't agree with anything that he wants even when he said give me a three-week bill it's better than nothing still not yet a rep you but this is still about Obama Debbie did this this right down to these tea partiers in the house these hardline conservatives it's about not giving this president what he needs to protect the country all right it's about Obama it's about immigration it's about the CPAC conference that's going on up the street cranking everybody up to be the most extreme conservative they can possibly be and if they somehow tie this to the Constitution I'm telling you add we're dealing with the tail wagging the dog here we have a small group of extremists that are running the entire United States Congress this is why we can't get the transportation bill this is why we can't invest in education research and development this is why we can't get a tax deal all because of this group of 50 members who if Boehner doesn't do every single thing that they want they threaten to take him out his speaker and that's what we're dealing with right now so it is the survival of the speaker that's that's part of the equation as you see it no doubt about it I think there's probably meetings happening right now in the on Capitol Hill plotting how to take out Speaker Boehner from the Republican caucus there's no question in my mind right now so you think that there are moderate Republicans if there's any left so certainly is that not the Tea Partiers that are thinking you know maybe maybe Boehner is not our guy but where else would they go I mean would they come up with of course they would probably come up with more of a moderate guy than Boehner who wouldn't count out of the to the to the Tea Party that would have brought that Senate bill to the floor is that what you're talking about well yeah I think I think Boehner needs to stand up to him yeah I think Speaker Boehner has the votes of the moderates and the majority of the people in his caucus he can withstand a coup stand strong bring these moderate bills of the floor and maybe we could actually get some legislation maybe 30 40 50 Democrat votes for transportation bill let's move the ball let's invest in the country so quickly tim is boehner a tea partier tonight we're going to find out the clock's ticking all right congressman Tim Ryan with us here on the edge show tonight the drama unfolds on Capitol Hill that's the edge ho aye Mitchell

let me go first of all to the the situation at Red Hill which was our own basically toxic exposure events and I think um secretary Omaha you are familiar with what happened there as as we talk about loss of data Etc and the need to coordinate between DOD and uh VA you know these These are thousands of thousands of people who were exposed to uh jet fuel leaks at Red Hill and it occurs to us that there should be a way for uh some kind of tracking and tracing of the health issues attended to this exposure while they're in currently inactive Service as well as presumably they're going to become veterans so so is this something that you all are already doing something with the dod to make sure that all these people who experience this exposure uh are not lost so I think Miss they're right you also talked about the the need to coordinate records health workers with DOD so um can you just talk a little bit about you know how you expect to keep track of all these people 94 000 people at least who are exposed to the Red Hill situation yes Senator uh first of all I enjoyed visiting Hawaii for the nazda convention and had a chance to spend time with Dr Anderson and his team at the Pacific Islands Healthcare System I am aware of this uh certainly and Dr Hastings can help us summarize the exciting work that the interagency research working group is going to do specifically on investigating jet fuel exposures and conditions that may result from that Dr Hastings absolutely sir Senator Red Hill is one of the the cohorts that we are concerned with we're concerned with many and we do follow them um there is a registry of those people that were exposed that DOD has um we meet monthly with the deployment Health working group and though it says deployment Health we also cover Garrison exposures those exposures at Red Hill would fit into that and this is a cohort that we will follow into the future and this will be Decades of following it but that is what my office does routinely we follow core cohorts we look at the health outcomes we look at how to care for those veterans and their families um you know this is not exactly a Camp Lejeune scenario but we're going to look at it in the same manner that's good because I I think that there will be some long-term health issues and there is a provision in the PAC deck that directs the department to study the impacts of jet fuel exposure so I assume that you are doing that and I welcome um information on how that is going absolutely um our the office of Health um Health outcomes military exposures started looking at fuels and Jet fuel's exposures about two years ago we have already completed some of that preliminary work and thank you very much for the pack deck that expands that and allows us to work with the National Academy we are very excited by this work it is important it is um jet fuels you know what the military runs on and we have to know more about them and we are doing that definitely because I hear from individuals and families who had all kinds of health issues that clearly needs to be attract and so we don't want to end up a situation that resulted in our having to pass the packed act where exposure is going back decades have to be somehow you know we we had to figure out the cause and effects so the what what you're doing right now is very important I also want to mention that that the vacancy rate of Apex which is the VA Health Care system that covers Hawaii and the greater Pacific has been at about 19 and we've made various efforts through this committee uh and most more recently through the pack that to provide a lot more flexibility to the VA to hire people and I'm just wondering whether there are unique circumstances in Hawaii that makes it that much harder to high fire and retain people so have you given some thought to it is not a one-size-fits-all situation that Hawaii poses may be very unique challenges to get this 19 vacancy rate down you look at so you're wanting to say something secretary yes Senator I had this conversation with Dr Anderson and his team who did mention that the healthcare labor market is particularly difficult and as you mentioned that's borne out in the data missed there it summarized all of the exciting new authorities that will allow us to compay to pay people much more competitively but also to retain them with the ability for larger retention bonuses again thanks to you and this committee we now have that I also had a conversation about how we could work better with the tripler army-based staff and allow even more services to be shared with them and had a chance to come back and address that with the health executive committee and DOD and if we have time Mr Kia cow can talk about some of the other exciting work we're doing with DOD well my main question is I think that there are some very unique circumstances that in Hawaii that we have to get creative and how you all are going to take care of all the veterans especially as we are expanding the number of people who will come for VA care including Specialized Care for Women veterans and there are uh whole ranges of different kinds of care and and really we need to get this vacancy rate down thank you Mr chairman Senator Miranda

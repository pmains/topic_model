gentleman from Vermont is recognized for two minutes I thank the gentlelady we do need tax reform we need tax reform that we all described in the beginning is something that would help the middle class that would simplify taxes and would be revenue neutral this bill sometimes described by its authors as doing those things accomplishes none of those things now first of all the middle class wages have been stagnant the jobs people are getting the bills and we know the biggest challenge we face is increasing investment increasing wages and increasing security there is some benefits in this bill for the middle class but let's get real those benefits are tiny in they're temporary your Vermont family if you're lucky we get hit with the salt deduction loss you might make a couple hundred bucks but at what price once these benefits expire 83% of the benefits of the individual tax rate go to the top one percent at what price two trillion dollars added to the deficit and let me tell you this for my family's hard earning families working families they'd like a tax cut but not one that their children and grandchildren are going to have to pay that is unconscionable what about these corporate tax cuts we want simplification so we're competitive there's a 40 percent reduction for multinational corporations but in this bill is there any corresponding requirement that they start reinvesting in America exactly the opposite there is a lower tax rate for companies that invest abroad send jobs abroad rather than invest at home that's outrageous and what happens because of this deficit Medicare is going to be cut directly as a result of this tax bill and the infrastructure plan we all want is evaporating I yield back defeat this rule to feet this bill

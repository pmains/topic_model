well good morning everyone i hope everyone's doing well and staying safe uh thank you for joining us for our latest coffee with chris and today we're really pleased to be joined by dean kristen from new hampshire housing obviously as we have gone through this pandemic we know that individuals have been struggling to pay their rent and their mortgage on time affordable housing continues to be at a crisis point in new hampshire and we thank dean for the work that new hampshire housing does day in and day out for folks who need this assistance dean welcome it's great to be with you well thank you congressman i appreciate you taking the time to talk about housing well thanks and um i know there have been a number of programs and funding that has been authorized through the coveted relief legislation that we've seen from the cares act to the most recent bill the american rescue plan and i wanted to zero in on one program that has recently opened up for renters in new hampshire it's the emergency rental assistance program i'm wondering if you can tell us a little bit about the assistance that's available through this program and how people can go about applying absolutely so as you pointed out there have been a number of initiatives that congresses has passed over the last year to help address critical issues and one of them that that came about as a result of the stimulus bill that was passed at the very end of 2020 was the emergency rental assistance program that targets individuals who are having difficulty paying rent or utilities as a result of 19. and that program was funded at a 25 billion level nationally and there were allocations to states and the state of new hampshire received a 180 million dollar allocation of funds from the department of treasury to focus on this program it is an initiative that is designed to help eligible households who have had difficulty over the last year in terms of unemployment or loss of income or other types of financial stress and are therefore having difficulty paying their rent or paying utilities or paying other housing related expenses by providing them with grants that can help cover those things and frankly in addition to helping those individuals with those really critical issues and help maintain their housing stability it also is designed to address the needs of of the property owners the smaller landlords many of whom are small businesses that often often cases have not been able to get rent payments from their tenants because the tenants just aren't able to do that they've been limited in their ability to do what they traditionally would have done which was evict people unfortunately who can't pay rent by various government orders and they're there for suffering financially so it also helps that industry in a very direct way so it's got that dual kind of positive benefit program went live as you pointed out on the 15th of march it is a partnership between the governor's office for emergency relief and recovery or gopher as it is called and new hampshire housing at the state level if you will and we're working with the state's five community action program agencies cap agencies uh to distribute those funds they're very skilled in managing federal resources and dealing with a range of complicated programs and they have people throughout the state who can interact with clients answer questions or or support with property owners the program is best accessed online so there are two ways you can do that you can go to a website which is capnh.org so capnh.org and that will direct you to the appropriate community action agency for your geographic area and there's an online application that can be filled out documents can be uploaded necessary to support your application it's quickest easiest way to do it um and people that did that on the 15th of march are already getting payments made on their behalf to property owners utilities and others it's a very effective way or you can go to our website which is nhhfa.org we'll give you information about the program and direct you to the appropriate source as well um there are people that don't have access to the internet or comfortable with it in that case they can they can interact with us we'll get them a written printed application where they can request it directly from the cap so printed applications will also be processed it's just that just like a tax return if you file it electronically it's going to go quicker you're going to get your refund quicker in this case if you file electronically you're going to get assistance more quickly program has some income limits attached to it and so you do need to be mindful of those and those are available online um and there also are some other eligibility requirements that people need to make but both the department of treasury at the federal level the statute the way congress put it together and the way we at the state level have worked together to come up with policies have all been focused on being as flexible as possible making sure that as many people as possible are eligible and we're prepared to continue to look at those issues and make sure that this program serves as many people as we possibly can well thanks for for the overview there i think it's great to know those resources are available and i know there are a lot of households that have been struggling to make payments on time maybe they've made it up to this point uh and are not falling behind in terms of their renter utilities but they might need some assistance is someone in that kind of a situation also eligible to seek these funds absolutely the money can be used to pay a rear ages meaning obviously payments that that you owe that you were not able to make um beginning as early as april of 2020 so from then on um both for rent and for utility payments or it can be used for prospective rent payments so to go to your point congressman someone that has really done the right thing and worked hard and used their own resources but now finds themselves at very much at risk still because it's hard for them to keep up with their rent utility payments they can request payments going forward for rent and utilities as well and so we expect to see uh the program serve both people who have arrearages and people who need help on a go forward basis the amount of support that this program can provide can go as long as 15 months between arrearages and prospective rent payments and if someone is in the program do they remain in the program for the duration of it or does that depend on their specific financial situation depends on their circumstances um the again uh the program can pay your rearranges back to april um as far as rent goes or prospective rent payments uh the statute requires that if they're getting paid on a prospective basis that every three months we have to revalidate their eligibility but they can continue to get assistance as long as they remain eligible going forward and the total amount of assistance cannot exceed 15 months in this program structure well i think you make a great point about um you know this program supporting both the renters as well as the landlords um it also supports our local tax base frankly too uh to make absolutely paying their property taxes on time so um it really has a ripple effect i think across our community and across our economy i'm wondering specifically about um who can apply um the renter can apply for the assistance the landlord can also with the renter's consent um put in an application is that correct yes that's absolutely true congress i think was very thoughtful when it said that in the statute that um the programs needed to make provision for for property owners to apply on behalf of their tenants as it were um there is a requirement that they do that together so that the tenant knows that that application is being made and and and participates and signs off on the application but we've reached out to many many property owners made them aware of the program and i know that a lot of them are working with their tenants to put together applications and submit them and again to go to your point the program is designed not only to help the tenants and stabilize their housing but also to address the needs of property owners who may have been at risk over the last year and help pay not just you know their mortgages but their their tax payments as you point out their utility bills um and just the cost of maintaining and operating the housing in which people live and some may have specific circumstances they may be in you know a rent to own uh agreement or maybe they're in a manufactured housing park where they um own the land but rent the building i'm just wondering um you know if there are uh people with special circumstances like this if this program also applies to them it does so for instance if you're living in a manufactured home and you pay what is commonly known as pad rent which is basically rent on the property underneath the unit you are eligible if you meet the other eligibility requirements um rent to own might work as well depending on the circumstances of that and really the community action agencies are prepared to deal with individual circumstances as people present we expect the vast majority of people will be sort of traditional renters but if there are unique circumstances we can look at those and make a determination as to whether the program will apply or not again it's designed both at the federal level and at the state level to be as flexible a program as possible and to help as many people as we can that's terrific and on the utilities end if someone has um they're able to satisfy their rent obligations but maybe they need some help with utilities this can also work for them yes and and the definition of utilities is very broad so it includes your traditional uh regulated utilities like like natural gas or electricity um but it also includes home heating oil costs or if you keep with wood and you you've been purchasing the wood from a source and been unable to to pay for that or are unable going forward we can provide support for that there's even a provision to support internet access for individuals which is not traditionally viewed as a utility but congress i think and then the treasury recognized that internet is so important for people now in this environment that we're all in particularly for maintaining work opportunities for for schooling opportunities and so they allowed resources to be used to help pay for internet as well so there's a broad range of of what we would describe as energy and home heating and related costs that can be covered by the program that's terrific well i'm wondering if you might um help highlight some of the other aspects of the covet relief bills that pertain to housing in new hampshire anything else that folks should be aware of that is out there that might be a tool for them as they seek to navigate a tough financial picture for their families sure the american rescue plan which which as you know you all just passed just a couple of weeks ago has a number of interesting and significant programs in it among them for instance is funding for additional resources to help create more supportive housing opportunities one of the things i think the pandemic has really put a spotlight on is the number of people in our communities for homeless or at risk of homelessness um and and the limited resources that have been available to actually help create housing opportunities for those individuals so there is a significant resource allocation about the state level and it will be available separately to manchester and nashua that will be used to help create more supportive housing housing that targets specifically the needs of homeless people or people with disabilities for instance by providing them not just a place to live but also support services and case management and other resources that will help them succeed so that's a critical uh and important program that we anticipate administering um at new hampshire housing there are resources that are included in the program that could be used to help assist um moderate income homeowners who are at risk of losing their homes that's on on top of the work that the federal government has already done with forbearance and other types of programs for that population there are additional housing choice vouchers which is a long-term rental assistance support that can help certain very low income households again targeted to people who are are homeless and there's additional funding for the emergency rental assistance program beyond the money that i mentioned already that um that could be available to the state so a lot of resources coming forward from the federal government targeted really to housing needs that have become very very evident as a result of covet and and been worse in many cases by unemployment and economic dislocation that that people suffer as a result of the pandemic well i really think the biggest story that hasn't been told over the last few years in new hampshire or been told enough is the story of the affordable housing crisis that exists in our state it's been exacerbated by the pandemic where do we go from here what tools do we need on the table beyond coven um to make sure that we're better addressing the situation to make sure that this state is livable that workers are able to live here and provide for their families that we have more of an affordable housing stock that we have more access to things like vouchers and tax credits that will make it all work what are some of the tools that we need longer term well two things i i'd say in response to that very good question one is there there will be a need for more federal resources because at the end the federal government has access to those resources in a more substantial way than perhaps the state does um in in cases like you're pointing out voucher and and tax credit programs programs that are designed to help produce more affordable uh more workforce housing across our state we also need to look frankly at what the impediments are to creating more housing because that's really what the challenge is all about is that there's a fundamental imbalance between the housing stock we have and the demand which is why we have such low vacancy rates such limited inventory of homes for sale and um that really requires us to take a hard look at regulatory policy at the local level and admittedly that's not something the federal government is going to be able to directly impact and the way we're structured but you could create incentives at the federal level to encourage local governments to think more flexibly about housing development issues about about regulatory policy because i think studies not only in new hampshire but across the country have pointed out that one of the reasons why we are struggling with a housing shortage not just here but in many other parts of the country one of the major reasons is that we're over regulating housing development we're making it too hard for the private sector to build the housing that we clearly need in order to support not just the needs of lower income people but really the needs of of the entire population and support economic growth and development in our communities so thinking about how to connect some federal resources perhaps to incentives that encourage local governments to rethink some of their policies i think would be a really important tool to focus on as we go forward well i think it's an important time to have that conversation um we're we've been focused now on the infrastructure bill uh in congress and getting that moving forward uh this can be a sort of a major package of infrastructure provisions that can help create the framework for success moving forward um and it's essential that we have housing provisions in that bill to provide the kind of federal support that is adequate to increase housing stocks and as as you say provide the right incentives um but it really has to be uh on all levels of government um commitment um we can't do it without the local buy-in without the state support without the federal resources so absolutely you're absolutely right congressman i think there is a wonderful opportunity here with the infrastructure focus to not only provide direct financial support but also to look at this issue of how both the federal and state government can incent local governments to to rethink some of the policies that many have identified as as really limiting housing development over the last several decades well dean i really appreciate your time thanks for sharing your expertise and a little bit about the emergency rental assistance program one more time where folks can online find more information about that program absolutely www.capnh.org capnh is the best place to go or new hampshire housing's website which is nhhfa.org um and that'll direct you to that similar information pretty

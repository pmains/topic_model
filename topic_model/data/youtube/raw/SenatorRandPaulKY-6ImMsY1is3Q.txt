republican senator rand paul senator good afternoon to you let's start with dr fauci he says there's a very low chance of getting the coronavirus when you're fully vaccinated yet the mass mandates were just lifted your take on all of this well this is dr fauci finally being truthful and honest about the science for months and months he has known that once you're vaccinated you're safe that you're not spreading the disease and you don't need to wear a mask he's known this for months so you notice when he finally changes his policy he said i did not want to be seen without a mask so in other words he's been participating in theater for the last several months at least we know that the vaccine works we've known the vaccine works for probably six months now and so once people got vaccinated we should have encouraged them to be without mask but because of this mixed messaging yes you're going to find that in a country when you treat americans like lemmings that unfortunately some people will choose to be lemmings and so now you have you know lemmings international coming forward and saying please please make us still wear the mask for our rest of our life so you're going to find this but that's fine if people want to wear a mask by all means do we're protected from halitosis and all kinds of other things if people keep wearing masks but it has nothing to do with preventing disease prevention or disease transmissibility once you've been vaccinated or if you've gotten the disease naturally and senator as we are in a better place and we're moving forward so many people are reflecting and they're looking back and they're looking at the cdc they're looking at the white house they're looking at dr fauci and saying if there are so many mixed messages you know even now what was going on all along during the pandemic were they giving us accurate information should we have confidence and that's a big question from the very beginning dr fauci has shown himself to be someone that is sometimes honest about his lying he says that he's lying to us because we're not smart enough to understand the truth so in the initial stages he said masks don't work don't buy them but he was really telling you that because he didn't want you to buy the n95 masks which they used in the hospital and he was afraid there wouldn't be enough for doctors and nurses but instead of being honest and saying don't buy the n95 mass or there's going to have to be a priority to selling them to hospitals and doctors instead he said they don't work when in reality the truth is some mass work the n95s work but then he came out with another falsehood he said all masked work and that wasn't true either really only the n95 masks have any chance of working the rest of them are all theater and then he continues and perpetuates this but as a consequence there's uncertainty and now you have people petrified they're going to die even though they've been vaccinated it's completely irrational fear but it's been promoted by dr fauci and the government and this has been a real disservice and it's long past time that dr fauci resigned and and find a place where he can do less damage to the american public honest about his lying i like that and i'm going to have to use that in the future i will say um but president biden's giving signals too right he's still wearing the mask outside sometimes but he's saying if you're vaccinated it's okay to take it off indoors it's almost like they want to continue the political theater they want to continue sending out this messaging of fear senator because it justifies their spending and this is not without harm they're still telling kids that are running in a track meet outside that haven't been vaccinated they have to wear a mask while running in a track meet that is completely and entirely absurd there is no science to back it but dr fauci is responsible for your kid wearing a mask and a track meet so the cdc needs to be clear your kid's at camp he doesn't need to wear a mask your kid's running in a track meet your kid doesn't need to wear a mask there's no scientific evidence to say that that's slowing down any kind of contagion it doesn't work hasn't worked no laboratory testing no experiments that show that it works so it's way past time the cdc you know gives some freedom to our children to let them get back to normal before we switch gears i just want to get your take on the nurses union for example they are saying that the cdc's messaging is wrong that it you know the way it impacts them for example i don't think that's what the cdc is saying i think the cdc is saying as we resume our daily activities we civilians on the street can remove our masks outdoors and indoors if we're vaccinated but i don't think the cdc is saying that the the protocol should be changed in hospitals for example i i almost think they're they're taking this one step too far well the cdc really uh has you know not very good advice on a lot of this most hospitals can make their own decisions surgeons wear masks during surgery in covid patients rooms they wear masks but guess what they don't wear cloth mask every hospital didn't take the cdc to tell them in fact the cdc probably hasn't even issued a guidance on this but at every hospital in america when you go in to treat a covid patient you're given an n95 mask you don't take a cut up piece of of your undershirt and put it on your face and call it a mask they don't use those in the hospital because they frankly don't work and there's no science to say that they actually protect the doctors or nurses so they all wear an n95 mask but i think the hospitals communities states are able to do this the cdc is such a mess they need to get out of the advice business and out of the mandate business look we've got them telling you whether you can have a contract with your renter whether our apartment landlord can have a contract cdc never had any business in that is way overstepped their bounds we have legislation to get them out of the apartment business and so really we need to get the cdc back to normality where they aren't as involved in every one of our economic decisions yeah it sounds like what you're saying is this is all about common sense as we move on and americans should have use their judgment um and you know live their lives wear the mask if you want to and you're if you're in a situation you think you needed and otherwise if you're fully vaccinated let's go let's move on with things i do while i have you want to switch gears for a moment and look at what's happening with the markets today now we've got a little bit of a sell-off underway here and in part it's due to worries about inflation now senator you've been warning about the president's trillion dollar spending and proposed tax hikes um and this is what i worry about because the the infrastructure bill hasn't even been passed the tax hikes haven't even happened and the market is really starting to get spooked you know i think when the fed says this is transitory and mostly supporters of the fed back the fed up and say it's transitory i think that's an excuse for government spending and borrowing it's sort of from the same kind of lexicon of deficits don't matter so we added four five trillion dollars worth of debt last year we're going to do probably the same again this year there are those of us who believe there are repercussions that this isn't a transitory blip that what you've caused is a massive misallocation of resources a massive uh infusion of cash into the stock market and that there is a time in which people wake up and say the emperor has no clothes and that part at that moment in time you would discover that there's a lot of capital that's gone in the wrong direction that demand is exceeding supply and all these supply chain things it's because we've disrupted the normal marketplace but i don't think it's as benign as people say it's going to be i think it's going to have profound repercussions and that we're just getting started yeah it was an excessive amount of spending even the last package signed in march when we knew we were turning a corner in this country with vaccinations senator yet you know it almost seems like there is a blank check on the desk of this president you combined the spending of the debt which is historic never ever happened to this degree greater than world war ii accumulation of debt you combine that with now the threat of punitive taxes in some ways the marketplace i think accepts debt more than they accept debt plus punitive taxes so we're going to have massive debt added we're already doing it but now we're talking about punitive corporate taxes and even worse the punitive corporate taxes is punitive capital gains taxes which i think is probably more than anything got the market skittish senator rand paul thank you so much for your time today good to see you sir thank you

Mr Speaker I rise this morning to share with my constituents what we know about the Republican health care plan and more importantly what we don't know we know that the Republican proposal to replace the Affordable Care Act will cut taxes for the wealthiest people in America we know that it will eventually eliminate the Medicaid expansion which is responsible for ensuring millions of Americans including nearly 80,000 people in my district alone we know that the GOP replacement plan shifts costs to seniors and low-income families while restricting women's access to reproductive health we know that it is a windfall for the healthy and wealthy and a disaster for nearly everyone else now this is what we know about the GOP health care plan but perhaps more alarming is what we don't know my Republican colleagues cannot answer the two most important questions about their proposal how much will it cost and how many people will it cover mr. speaker Congress should not take any further action on this bill without knowing its impact on the budget and its consequences for the American people I'm son stunned that my Republican colleagues are planning to move forward on a plan that is quite literally a matter of life and death for millions of American families without knowing exactly what they are moving forward with mr. speaker in 2009 and 2010 when Democrats held a televised health care summit with Republican leaders when the Senate hell committee marked up the Affordable Care Act over a full month and accepted 160 Republican amendments and when the Senate Finance Committee held 31 meetings over 60 hours even after that process Republicans said that Democrats r and the health care bill through Congress without reading it now the Republican majority is moving forward with their replacement plan without knowing what it costs and what it will mean for American families this level of hypocrisy and recklessness is insulting to the American people and it is dangerous for the future of our health care system there is already plenty to dislike about what we know what that is in this bill who knows what we'll find out when we uncover the rest which is Speaker I yield back

here in florida as we all know over the last decade police brutality has exploded across america not that police brutality has not been an issue throughout the decades and the centuries but because of the fact that we have smartphones now and cameras more often than not very rarely does a month go by that we do not have a new hashtag with a new american who has been killed based upon an unfortunate encounter with law enforcement some of the names that we say over the last 10 years have included sandra bland where that appellation first began but also trayvon martin jordan davis corinne gaines tamir rice philando castile alton sterling more recently just this year brianna taylor ahmad aubry george floyd richard brooks tony mcdade these are names that we all hear we all see and we are all outraged on a week-to-week basis because we recognize that more often than not when these individuals who are unarmed wind up dead based upon an unfortunate encounter with law enforcement those law enforcement officers are very rarely held to an account so what we have this afternoon is representative lawson a man who served in the florida legislature for well over three decades and has been in congress for the better part of this past decade has convened a distinguished panel for you congressman lawson while he was in the florida legislature as well as in congress has been at the vanguard of pushing for social justice i can remember back in 2007 when one of the other panelists you'll hear from tonight attorney ben crump and his partner daryl parks are pushing for justice for martin lee anderson it was representative lawson actually senator lawson at the time in the state legislature who was right at the forefront of making sure that justice was served for the martin lee anderson family and he has not stopped so i'm looking forward to sharing this uh this the day so to speak this virtual day is with him today and as well we have attorney benjamin crump an individual who you see on tv in the newspaper and on the internet all the time as he works indefatigably to make sure that the family members of those who have been killed based upon unfortunate encounters with reckless or murderous law enforcement officers are held to account so with that i will yield the microphone to congressman lawson and then the next voice you will hear will be of attorney crump and then i look forward to introducing and allowing the other distinguished panelists to be able to uh make their opening statements as well congressman lawson thank you very much attorney hobbs it's really a great opportunity and i'm happy to have all of you all joining us here tonight uh simply due to the fact is that america is faced with a tremendous challenge and our talent is where do you go from here as you know w.e divorce stated and he said the biggest challenge that we would have in the 20th century uh would be it racial injustice and now we find out that we are still plagued with this in the 21st century and so one of the main crisis that affected our communities is going to be economic social and health uh and that is very dangerous combination uh that we see throughout america i think what has really brought a lot of this to the forefront is the situation with george floyd uh and we've had the black lives movement throughout this country uh not only has it been a movement here in america i mean it's a movement nationwide you know and everyone has been getting involved and i think one of the things when you go back and look back over the history and our careers is we have seen a lot of things that happen like you know i grew up in a very segregated community many things that would happen with americans during that time a lot of time it would be swept under the road no longer is that going to happen today uh those issues are going to come out you know when you see attorney crop which i've probably introduced to you in a few minutes that is traveling america all over america you know with all the injustice that we see uh that is happening uh we have a symbol on a panel here uh that uh it's not only about criminal justice uh but social justice economic uh insecurity you know uh students environment you know do they get a chance to get an education because they represent uh the future of tomorrow we have seen this movement that incorporates uh not only as it but uh uh women that have been so important to any movement that we've had in america you know as you go back and look at the history you will find that oftentimes uh women from the sixes on took a very active role and that role is to push and to give support and let people know uh that i'm not going to move back to the back of the bucket as rosa parks that once said you know as i am going to stay here and continue to fight for uh justice in america because we have so much injustice uh i can tell you uh it was my privilege to co-sponsor the justice and policing that the legislation bans the use of uh chokeholds and uh no not warrants uh chris took uh the library of georgia floyd and then uh briana taylor and eric gardner the bills also requires uh uniform officers to wear body cameras and to use a dashboard camera i know we have much to cover and i'm not going to continue to talk about everything because this panel is just tremendous a panel that we have and they're going to be people listening all over the place i would like now to bring on my good friend and introduce to you uh i like to call him on a joke and thing uh the junior uh cochran you know in america but i'd like to bring to you a great friend great attorney attorney ken cronk thank you congressman lawson it definitely is a pleasure to be with you as my congressman fighting for us as uh my good friend attorney hobbs said i see you have my colleague mark slackman and professor hunter i look forward to hearing from all of you and these young people because never ever forget what we're fighting for we're fighting for the future of grace and xavier and miss jalisa these are the people who we are saying lives matter we have to make sure that we stop these hashtags chuck i mean they're happening so fast we can barely keep up with them when i think about george floyd and him begging congressman lost and literally begging not just for humanity not just for respect but he was begging for a breath a breath just to be able to sustain his life and so when we argue in courtrooms chuck all across america what we're really arguing is that there are not two justice systems in america one for black america and another for white america what we're fighting for is equal justice for every citizen in the united states of america and so you think about the fact that ahmad aubry who i represent well a great team of lawyers was jogging in brunswick georgia and he was lynched literally for jogging wild black and professor not in 1940 not in 1950 this was in 2020 february 26th 2020 and you see congressman lawson it wasn't that the police saw the video of him being lynched in broad daylight that caused them to be arrested it was when we the people saw the video that this murderous father-son duo of travis mcmichael and george mcmichael was finally arrested and then i think about our sister uh brianna taylor who i know i'll be with her family on wednesday as we try to make sure people don't forget that brianna taylor life matters because far too often sisters who are executed by police are not given the same attention and recognition as brothers who are executed by police and so every interview congressman lawson i would do with ahmad aubry i would always say at the end of the video and we can't forget our sister brianna taylor who was killed in her own apartment because black women's lives matter too and we kept saying that to the point where finally they are sweeping her death under the road but they had every intention of doing so and you don't have to take my word for it congressman lawson and we presented this at the united states house of representatives all you have to do mark is look at the police report from brianna taylor they literally had that there was no signs of forced entry even though they had busted open her front door and they said nobody was injured even though brianna was executed by the police that night and so i guess in trying to make a few more points because i really think everybody wants to hear what you all have to say uh because you young people really inspire some ways that we can't even articulate but the final couple points i will make is never have i seen self defense in black and white so vividly as i have seen it in the case of a mod aubry in the case of briana taylor remember when a mod aubry was lynched in broad daylight and it was captured on video the police saw the video on day one and when they saw the video the father and son travis michaels and greg mcmichaels said self-defense they said self-defense and despite seeing that video the police took their word for it and let them go home and sleep in peace for over 10 weeks and it wasn't until the video was released mark that finally 74 days later finally they arrested them now just to pose that with what happened in brianna taylor's case in louisville kentucky brianna and boy i'm a father of a daughter al and i know you are and so this really breaks your heart when you think about it professor imagine your child your son or in this case your daughter young adult you've gotten them to adulthood and they're not living with you anymore she's in her apartment she's working two jobs she's trying to get her college degree as a nurse and just imagine your child doing everything right in her bed sleep her boyfriend is over they're asleep it's the wee hours of the morning between 12 30 and 1 am and the louisville metropolitan police unbeknownst to them never identifies themselves never announces their presence and they're in plain clothes they take a battering ram and and the commission of executing a dangerous no not warrant i believe mark and constitution no and unnecessary no not one and they bust open her front door with that battle around now her boyfriend kenny walker who's 27 years old no criminal history never ever been arrested working at the post office brianna taylor 26 years old never been arrested no criminal history working two jobs as an emt on the front line battling the corona virus in fact congressman law said the thing her mother worried about most that her daughter might get contracted coronavirus and might get sick never imagining never imagining that the police were gonna kill her and so kenny walker this young black man chuck who does what i think every strong brother would do when they hear somebody who they think are trying to break into their apartment thinking they are burglars he gets his registered gun he tips down the hallway and as they come through the front door playing close he shoots a warning shot and from that point congressman lawson the police just unload they shoot 25 to 30 rounds from the front door of the apartment from outside the side window from the patio i mean they're shooting bullets from everywhere it is so reckless what they're doing they're blindly shooting from outside of an apartment into an apartment and one of the bullets actually goes into the next door neighbor's apartment where a five-year-old little boy is sleeping in the room and he goes into his dresser drawer and tragically brianna taylor's body is mutilated with eight bullets while she is practically naked in her underwear and kenny walker they absolutely congressman lawson believed that they were the subject of a home invasion you don't have to take our word for it listen to the take he calls it if you think it's the police you wouldn't call 9-1-1 but he calls and says somebody broke into our apartment they shot my girlfriend please help us and it's heartbreaking we don't have video on brown but you have that contemporaneous 9-1-1 tape where he is uh shaking brianna and that's what he tells us he was doing and you hear him say don't die brianna stay with me baby don't close your eyes brown or stay with me and it's just heartbreaking then chuck when the police confront him he says self-defense we thought they were burglars the police arrested him took him to jail and charged him with attempted murder where he is facing life in prison if the police union gets they way and those charges hold up so you talk about self-defense when is a white person saying self-defense versus when a black person says self-defense it is vivid and living in color in those two cases that happen within two weeks of each other probably within 250 miles of one another and that is america and that's why we're having this kind of discussion because black lives matter our children lives matter and we none of us can breathe until we get justice for george floyd and i i thank you congressman lawson for being a leader on the george foreign justice and police and accountability act because if we don't use this moment to have systematic reform to change the culture and the behavior of policing in america especially when it how it is when they interact with minorities we would never be able to address the problem which is do america believe in the declaration of independence we know you can quote the preamble but do you really believe it when you say we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equally that they're endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that amongst them are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness do you really believe that for george floyd well if you do we want you to prove it to us we want you to prove it to us for briana taylor we want you to prove it to us for a mild offer because i have no doubt if they came from different zip codes with different pigmentation in their skin we would not have to fight so hard to get an arrest and charges made so this is what we're fighting for thank you congressman lawson thank you to this wonderful panel thank you attorney crump as well as congressman lawson for your opening statements now i'd like to turn attention to our other distinguished panelists and we are going to take each of you in alphabetical order so i

florida uh a board of directors so um congressman truly appreciate your invitation to join and uh really look forward to hearing everyone and the students chuck thank you so much thank you so much and again we want to thank everyone who has tuned in via facebook live and i'd like to dive right in uh one of the first questions i'd like to pose to the panel is why is the black lives matter movement important and the way we can do this is each of you can speak on it or uh only one or two uh whoever wants to hop in hop in what why is black lives matter an important movement in 2020 um so i i'd like to begin um reality is is that often times when we say black lives matter i hear people say well all lives matter reality is all lives can't matter into the most vulnerable within our society lives matter and at this point we know black lives don't matter um we continue to see a variety of disparities when you think about mass incarceration when you think about education when you think about infant mortality rates i don't know how many people know this but african-american children in america the death rate of infant mortality is comparable to third world nations uh when we look at health care if we look at covet 19 the communities that are impacted are those minority communities when we look at unemployment rates we know black lives don't matter because while it may be four or five percent for the predominant group in america if america catches a cold the black community has the flu because ours is going to be double that amount um we just continue to see issues that show us that our lives don't matter i don't know that black lives have ever mattered in america um we seem to be a group that is very much an afterthought disregarded that's why you see the affinity groups that you do um and this this needs to change i am the mother of a 17 year old african-american son and i'm terrified and i should not have to be concerned with my son having an encounter with anyone and being killed just for the beautiful complexion that he has and my last thing to say is that reality is race isn't even biologically real it's a social construct that is very much you know something that has been reinforced in america in a way to uh segregate and and stratify certain groups and that's problematic in itself because race is not real biologically indeed any of the other panelists would you like to i'll say something really fast because unfortunately i apologize yes sir go ahead the injustices keep happening so i gotta deal with that eight-year-old kid who they arrested and put a haircut so if you can imagine that um maybe quality on that one mark uh but chuck the reason i think it's important what the professor said to highlight in just very dramatic terms congressman when you think about the fact that the police killed 12-year-old tamir rice playing on the playground by himself in cleveland ohio they killed laquan mcdonald 17 years old running away from the police in chicago 14 officers on the scene they thought it was appropriate that this officer should be able to shoot him 17 times while he's running away mike brown everybody in the canfield community said he had his hands up when the police officer shot him in broad daylight terence crutcher tulsa oklahoma walking away in broad daylight on video with his hands up when the white policewoman shot i am both of them john in dallas texas cpa doing everything right i mean kind of like these smart sharp young people on his couch in his living room eating ice cream white policewoman allegedly comes into the wrong apartment shoot and kill him because he said he moved a certain way clark had a cell phone shot him in his grandmother's backyard and when you just oppose that well how america not just police but america look at little white children and white young people it's just you have to say black lives matter to try to indoctrinate it into their minds because it is not apparent in their subconscious when you think about what happened where parkland florida little white boy went and shot 34 people killing 17 of them the police fought him for hours and they took him alive the waffle house killer in tennessee shot and killed uh four people in the waffle house the police chased him into the woods child they all came out alive can you imagine if that was a black person who had killed some people the police chase them into the woods with a gun and they all come out alive and worst of all dylan roof this young white supremacist goes into a church in charleston south carolina and kills nine of the most innocent people you could ever find and what does he say during the interview with the police he said i felt bad about killing them because they were so nice to me congressman lawson the police chased him not only for hours but they chased him across state lines from south carolina into north carolina and then when they captured him they took them to burger king to get a burger and fries while they took him to jail but yet they take all these young white men alive but if a black person moves a certain way they shouldn't kill them and so what that tells you first and foremost congressman lawson is that they disregard the fact that race is a fallacy and they put importance on it and they obviously have criminalized the color of our skin to the point where not only do they think they can kill us by putting these trumped up charges on us in courtrooms but they feel this justifiable to kill us in the streets physically and that's the only way you can explain why they don't shoot these young white boys but all those young black people who we name they shoot first and ask questions later and that's why black lives matter 2020 because we have to speak truth to power every time we get a chance because we can't let them think that oh just because they say it's legal that makes it right as dr king said just because it's legal don't make it right everything that hitler did to the jews in germany was legal that didn't make it right slavery was legal so that didn't make it right segregation was legal that didn't make it right legality cannot be our standard for morality and so black lives matter has to be the argument we make and it's not based on any legislation or anything but we do have to change these protests into policy and that's when congressman al lawson and others come into play because young people you all are doing your jobs now we got to make sure the united states congress and the white house do their job so we don't lose this moment and i thank you congressman lawson for the opportunity you're welcome thank you jj i see you trying to get in go ahead go ahead yes i wanted to add i feel like for me as a young leader in my community i feel like the reason why black lives matter movement is very important is because we see so many things that is so familiar it's so similar to every day you wake up it can be my brother it can be me so it becomes too personal it becomes two persons and when it gets like this it's wow enough is enough i feel like the movement is a movement of we are tired i i'm tired of leaving a fear like i don't want to go outside too late i'm scared my mother's in haiti she's afraid that me losing my voice might cause me my life she's afraid of certain things so i feel like this movement is a humanity cry for help black lives matter movement it's a humanity cry out for help and that's why we need conversation like this we need allies we need leaders like this not only we are tired of protesting we are tired of being in the streets but we have to say enough is enough that's why we're walking that's why we're marching that's why we showing our face not because we want to is because we want to be heard we want people to see us and this movement i see it as a revolution it's a call from the youth that say i can't do it no more and i'm going to be in your face by any means necessary because you have to hear me because it can be my brothers it can be my friends and we can't do it anymore so this movement is very very important and i'm glad to see that we taking it as serious as it needs to be and i'm glad that we're having a conversation like this so to empowering the youth not to be afraid to stand up because they are a part of the changing we can't stay quiet we can say silence and moment like this is what make it more worth it to say you know what maybe there is a hope maybe there's a chance because i feel like i'm being heard i feel like all the things that i'm working for somebody's listening i think that's what the youth is asking is somebody is listening and when you listen that's when change started to happen jj makes an interesting point and one thing that i want to point out before we go to the next question is that many of us who have studied the civil rights movement and for some of our panelists who had the benefit of being alive and or participating uh during that era when you look back 40 50 60 some odd years ago uh many of the protesters if not the majority of the protesters were black of course there were some white allies there were a number of jewish allies who participated in the movement uh from the founding of the naacp on through the corps sclc and you and name it but for the most part the movement for civil rights through the 1950s and 1960s was a primarily black inspired and black body field movement now ever since george floyd was murdered right before our eye back in may of this year one of the things that has surprised me even as a 48 year old male is seeing the number of americans and not just americans but people across the world diverse protests whites blacks asians latinos uh it has completely amazed me and i would like to talk to the panelists a little bit about why do you think that is what what what was the catalyst so to speak that the george floyd murder in particular has now created a multi-racial multicultural movement for change anybody want to take a stab at that chuck um i think it's critically important that we um we it's it's absolutely unacceptable to diminish the singular importance of this moment and as i've heard congressman lawson say take steps to ensure that this is a movement and not merely a moment but a hugely important moment but that focus that singular focus does not mean and it loops back to your question that there aren't others that have maybe not similar but but concerns about whether to what extent there are universal human rights that apply to everyone dr hodo in deference to you whether actual or perceived race whether color ethnicity gender sexual orientation gender identity familial status nationality national origin religion belief non-belief age disability uh culture experience thought communities are are coming together and and i think the challenge now is the voices the energy again cannot allow the moment to be diminished and the singular focus defines itself but i think what this does is it opens up the optics to revisit well actually what is the cause of universality of human rights that means those human rights apply to everyone regardless of where they live who they are what they look like what their socioeconomic status is and there may be ways to look back to move forward in terms of trying to capture some ways to operationalize this cause this singular cause that we're convening tonight to discuss but also it doesn't mean that there aren't other causes that are important that can't be advanced at the same time and it goes right to the nature of your question in cooperation together uh with with others of very different backgrounds thank you uh xavier looks like you wanted to weigh in what are your thoughts yeah i think that this device right here has a large part to do with it i think over the past couple of years what makes this movement so much different than the civil rights movement which was super effective um is the fact that people can see it on a daily day-to-day basis the interaction um the civil rights area you may be able to see some things on camera and hear about certain things but the fact that you can see a video of the interaction itself and i i still believe that there's there's humanity in americans in humanity in this world and so when you see a video of something something tragic happening and you start to put yourself or your kids or your family members or your mother in that situation you realize that you just can't stand for anything and you can't continue to be silent so you see a lot of people especially younger folks decide that look even though this doesn't directly affect me um this affects somebody that i know this affects somebody that that could potentially happen to them and you start to see everybody come together and bridge this gap and really start to amplify their voices together that's an interesting point one of the things that i noticed uh judging from the anecdotal evidence that is my facebook and social media feeds is the fact that even a number of people who are typically the ones who will cry blue lives matter uh whenever a black lives matter slogan is chanted or uh support the blue uh and things of that nature even a number of those cynics a family uh were disturbed by george floyd at least initially uh a number of my conservative friends uh they would not necessarily come on a post to make a comment but they would inbox me or text message me saying how disgusting that was and when i would engage back and tell them that yes george floyd's murder was disgusting but there are hundreds more across the country like you pointed out xavier that are not filmed that a lot of victims are not getting the same benefit of the doubt uh because they don't they tend to not believe victims who are saying that these encounters with law enforcement are bad grace what are what are some of your thoughts uh with regards to your generation coalescing in a way that prior generations simply have not when it comes to pushing forward this social justice movement yes i think social media is a really important tool with when it comes to gathering groups of people but i also think it's important to note that social media because it is so easy to post that is so easy to tweet that that is where our work should start and not where it should end and i also think it's important to know that while it's incredibly important that we have a very diverse set of allies coming to support the black lives matter movement that people especially white people know their role within the movement meaning it is that of support and is that of uplifting black voices is that of passing the mic it is that of using their platform and position of privilege to help others who are more marginalized and it's incredibly important to be active allies and advocates but you also know what is their time and what is not their time and to speak on behalf of certain issues and when it is the proper time to pass the mic and to elevate other individuals very good one of the other things that i wanted to point out is and i got a comment here when i'm looking at uh the feed uh from the audience with regards to the militarization of the police and i can tell you that again having uh been a former prosecutor and defense attorney and having handled dozens of cases over the last 20 some odd years the police have become far more militarized even within my career than in my lifetime than they ever were before and i'm quite sure uh congressman lawson would weigh in and say the same thing uh you go to the sheriff's office or the police department and you see tanks you see all sorts of automatic weapons and while one could definitely make the argument that some of that material is necessary particularly particularly in larger cities where uh potentially the gangs and or the drug war so to speak to put law enforcement at a disadvantage i have sometimes been troubled in smaller cities where gang warfare is not that prominent that law enforcement still spend a quite a bit of their budget on the latest high-tech weaponry that would make uh most of the joint chiefs of staff uh with regards to the military proud of what it is that they have with regards to that i'd like to throw out to the panel what are your thoughts with regards to the hyper militarization of law enforcement and what effect that has on the the angst that we see between the blue and unarmed citizens of all races but again most prominently among people of color anybody want to uh hop on i think i think i would start off uh and i was listening with great uh thoughts about when everyone was actually speaking and i want to say this because i think it's important to bring this out first among my colleagues in congress when the white lives movement started uh uh wanted to get their own definition of what i like large amounts really mean uh they were not really asking uh what uh like life value really meant uh they were trying to figure out where they saw so much diversity uh in the black lives movement and so as a result is uh they thought it would be something that you could just sweep under the table and say well because of george floyd you know sweeping on the table but what has happened uh and that's the reason why i always like to get involved with young people young people represent the leadership of tomorrow and many of the young people came up in a different situation in school and everything that i came up in which was segregated schools until i had it in college and so as a result they have interact with each other uh from kindergarten all the way up uh through high school they get to know each other better they get to have different kind of feelings than people maybe that came up in my ear unless you're someone uh like max likeman who has traveled uh all over the world in terms of human rights issues and things that affect people and how you go about changing communities and so forth and determine what is right and what people should have uh either like uh dr uh uh hoda uh who actually specializes in some of those areas a lot of times people don't really understand what what i'm saying uh this uh i wanted to uh as mike said to be more than a moment uh but as a movement uh throughout america and we this is a time when we have the opportunity to change the course of where america is going when they're related to economics and you look at poverty uh what is happening what i've learned in congress uh in the three and a half years i've been there that we have uh the capacity and the resources to really wipe out poverty of america you know and i say really wrap up probably america just like homeless population we have the resources to do it as you can see in the cares bill when we passed out 2.5 trillion dollars you see when we bail out wall street in 2079 and all of the big financial institutions doing well because i served on the financial committee and they come in there and say wow our resources are just tremendous we're doing just great and so as a result uh this is a time when we made it mandatory that you bail out america which is something that we've never seen before and so we send a hero's bill down to the senate uh with uh three trillion dollars in it because people still need resources they're out of work you know the kids got to go back to school we did not even put the amount of money that is necessary to make for schools like maybe 490 per individual to make sure that kids can go back to school safe and so as a result uh times are changing and really uh it's been because of the young people because what made the florida legislature change and people came with parkland when those kids came all the way to washington d.c and said we want you to march with us you know we won't change so young people right now on a change would be best for america but you got to understand there's a lot of people out there who really don't like this this change you know i had a very conservative person uh who is a republican asked me he said can you explain to me why my daughter came home making up signs about black lives matter and going over to tallahassee to march with a group of students you know that's not the way we brought it up and i said well change has come they want to see that people get along they want to stop all the killing and one of the things that you need to know the reason why i was a co-sponsor of the bill because there's no standards uh in uh our police and sheriff's office and they need to be standards that are kept in the training that they require from continuing education is really not very good you know so when you talk about defunding the police what you're saying is when a lot of the dollars that you've given to do social work you know to get miss jones cat out of the tree uh to uh potholes in the street that money needs to be going into areas where you can have better response uh for social work for psychological problems uh for people who need therapy and so forth and so that's what you mean but in terms of uh uh these military weapons and stuff that you see uh that that we're sending down to different agents in the police office it shouldn't be down there's no way that we should be fighting against each other with those kind of weapons so i just wanted to say that uh and let that remind everyone else thank you congressman lawson uh for that response and you touched upon a very critical portion which is that segways perfectly in in the question which is we're talking about the hyper uh militarization of law enforcement but also the training piece that you address and i think that again that's been one of my biggest concerns over the course of the last 15 20 years is that more often than not these unarmed citizens black white or whatever race that wind up killed or beaten are not drug dealers they're not heavily armed gang bangers they are citizens who may have had an improper lane change on their way home from work or may have been speeding or even if it was a misdemeanor like selling loose cigarettes or a counterfeit bill those individuals are they are some type of bonnie and clyde or or al capone type exit enforcement officers who are just blazing away so i see xavier i see dr hodo uh xavier hold the point i'm an old school southern gentleman ladies first dr hodo go ahead and take the microphone thank you um so i have a few things to add um with the militarization piece that's very problematic and i seem to only see the tanks and things used in certain communities um and and that's a problem and i appreciate what grace said is the reality is is that we do have allies and but they have to know their role within the movement you know but we do need our allies because they we've never been able to really accomplish much on our own because oftentimes we're viewed as different inferior and all these ridiculous kind of antiquated ideologies about african americans i think of the george floyd case i think to me what brought that about in regards to all the people kind of coming together is it was the perfect storm we have covet 19 we're locked in place and people saw that video and if you have a heart there's just no way that you could have not noticed you know the the the issue with that you know this man was screaming out asking for his mother who was deceased you know asking just to have a breath and studies continuously show that african-american males are children particularly at age 11 they're perceived to be adults you know we've seen the criminalization of black and brown bodies in america when i look at mass incarceration and know that over 2 million people are incarcerated and a million of them are black and brown men and more than half are there for non-violent drug offenses but we just legalized municipal marijuana that's very problematic to me and it shows you the disparities that we have and all these things i mean no one can live a righteous life until everybody has equity and there's a difference between equality and equity and we don't have equity because we're starting from a whole different frame of reference i mean we've basically had you know somebody's boot on our neck for the last 200 you know or 400 years and we're behind everyone else you know when the congressman spoke about uh bailing out wall street i think about the big housing bust of 2008 and how the disparity when i looked at it based on rates i see that you know minorities continue to get loan subpar loans compared to their counterparts even if they have the same credit score i mean these things are institutional it's systemic and it's intentional and it has to be we we have to do away with this and develop new mechanisms because when all these things were brought about african americans weren't even considered a person you know so i think these are just a lot of i have just a lot going on in my mind about what the issues are and how to address them so i just wanted to add that thanks dr hodo xavier uh go ahead yeah i think dr huddlehead and so many so many points right there um but but i think that as far as the militarization of the police it's unwarranted you you see these these this militarization in these high um high grade uh military weapons being used in one specific community and i think like she mentioned it it doesn't go towards the drug dealers it doesn't go towards these violent criminals it goes towards protests and peaceful protests that are being shown up i watched the video today of a of a young man i think it was in somewhere in california southern california um he was being attacked by a homeless man and two police three police officers showed up and pulled out immediately pulled out weaponry on these young individuals i think they were 14 15 years old um and they were the ones being attacked and they immediately the police officers hopped out with with assault rifles pointing at the kids um and that's not what you need in that situation you need somebody's going to come in and actually police the situation figure out what's going on make an accurate assessment before you start to threaten other people's lives and feel that your life is threatened um and so i think that whenever you think about the role of the police officers and that they're supposed to protect the community keep everybody safe when you when you bring in these high artillery weaponry um it doesn't keep the community safe it really just puts everybody at it at a deeper advantage or disadvantage rather it makes everybody unsafe and feel really anxious about just being in a particular space you can see what's going on in portland and bringing in this heavy artillery doesn't fix the situation at all all it does is spread things on and make it continue in a spiral effect and doesn't make it any worse instead of actually listening to what people are saying and what the problems that they want to talk about and what they want to see change you bring in these these higher artillery referees and these federal agents and now you see a bigger situation a bigger problem than what it originally was if you just top stop for 10 minutes and just listen to what we're asking for mark let me ask you uh what are your thoughts uh when you hear individuals sometimes that are from a law enforcement background or even individuals who like to call themselves law enforcement supporters and which always gives me pause because i don't know many americans who do not support law enforcement i believe that what we support uh are our good law enforcement officers who are out doing their jobs and we want to see the ones who are not doing the jobs in the appropriate ways uh be held accountable but with that in mind uh from the training piece that congressman lawson talked about as well as dr hodo as well as xavier how can we bridge the gap with that solid number of our fellow americans who seem to have a disconnect with regards to how law enforcement interact particularly in communities of color what what are some ways that we can address that divide thank you and and just a quick a couple of quick observations one i think this is the unstated observation we there are a range of different approaches taken by various law enforcement officials at senior levels whether it's sheriffs or police chiefs some are dramatically different um for instance uh in leon county i i happened to over well i listened to sheriff mcneil say one day we cannot afford to continue to fund systems and condone practices that are oppressive and abusive systems where the solution routinely involves use of force so on the on the specific issue of training i'm just sharing a personal reaction with you eight minutes and 46 seconds training wasn't involved in that decision how you do we need to be trained not to employ a a choke hold for eight minutes and 46 seconds that doesn't that training may have it clearly has a role and a place and a priority in my humble personal opinion that that was not about training but to to wind out on your question because i know you want to cover a lot of ground moving beyond that scenario training is is critically important and and so is cultural sensitivity and addressing the the terms that uh were in vogue and now now may be slipping out to implicit bias that people are not necessarily even aware that they have until they react so all of that is is critically important and i think now i'm just uh extrapolating from comments that have been made um largely by our our student activists tonight and dr koto um we have to find it saying it a different way we have to find a means to operationalize this cause and to make it again to repeat specifically to make it you know to recognize the moment but to make it more than a moment and i and i think the the frameworks are there and as an aside um not to interject humor in such a serious matter but congressman lawson has told me um uh he expects a list of options on his desk very soon as to what he can do to try to help move this forward because it involves and your question and i'll pause there i mean it also involves basic concepts of governance how can the federal level coordinate cooperate at the state level at the local level you know tallahassee we we have some uh appears that people with with some you know integrity in different positions we have two different law enforcement agencies so there are a lot of complications but i think the strength of what was already identified the singular importance of this moment and the allies i mean there are frameworks that we can use to try to advance this cause and and i know uh even though congressman lawson isn't involved in the local and state issues now uh he's following them tracking them very very closely thank you mark jj i see that you've uh yes okay yes so to piggyback off what you said i i realized that too training is a small piece of what's happening um when you look at it it's very much when a police officer stops someone there is already an intention like you say the amount of time it doesn't take training for somebody to have common sense to realize what they were doing um my opinion is is the fact that many people from law enforcement they know they will get away with things they have not been held accountable for the action so i feel like the main issue is the people from higher up to come up with a solution if they know their consequences now they will perhaps act better and it's a cultural difference to i know many of my friends the way we brought up the way we talk sometimes we're not yelling but they think we're being defensive they think that we're acting so in the certain way they think that we angry but when in reality that's our normal tone so there is like who are watching us who are there to protect us is it people who understand us so i feel like it's the process of picking who supposed to watch what neighborhood who's supposed to do what what neighborhood if you cannot empathize you cannot connect with me there's no way you can protect me i feel like the conversation is way bigger and when we talk about having those weapons and scattered people you're not there to scare people away how you kids are afraid to go outside to play because if they stay police officers they're going to hide behind a car they don't want to be seen because they don't want to they don't want to get killed so it's the revelation that we're creating with that community fighting that transparency between citizens and law enforcement and people higher up um one thing i would love to make a good point is when things like that happen somebody say something the transparency between higher up supposed to be very open like when we outside protesting we asked to see for the tapes we asked to release the names of the people who do certain things make sure that you're hearing us so the police the bad actor know that they cannot get rid of it and even people in the police officers who think they good but if you're not speaking you know you're no longer good because you dare you support what's happening so it's each one of us holding ourselves accountable it has nothing to do with training it's holding ourselves accountable if you're a law enforcement person you see your partner did something that was it right don't just call it until next time don't do that make sure your voice is being heard it's about holding ourselves accountable and understand who's watching who sometimes if you don't understand me i'm speaking you may think i'm being defensive but in reality i'm not and but i lost my life for what so it's understanding who's watching who is protecting you and what can we do as a society and as a community to create that transparency to create that comfortable for me to be honest for me to be open for me to know that you're there for me so in order to to see those changes that we want to see thank you jj grace i want to ask you uh this next question in segways from the prior ones uh with regards to your generation we're blessed to have uh three panelists this evening uh all of you are young americans committed to positive change grace what are your thoughts with uh the movement as it currently is comprised uh particularly since the death of george floyd do you see among uh individuals your friends in your age group uh that this will be a sustained movement both from a public policy advocacy standpoint as well as a voting standpoint heading into november or even the primaries here in florida in the next couple of weeks but into the november elections are you seeing that this is something that will continue to to galvanize your generation yes i think i've seen masses of youth being mobilized from like the black lives matter movement and these protests and that more than ever voting is important and that everyone is posting about it everyone is talking about it and i'm incredibly optimistic about my generation's role in voting and that we are not apathetic and that we care very deeply about these issues and that we will take our passions to the voting booth when it comes down to the presidential election and something that i would just like to add that relates to kind of policy and how the movement will transform into actionable policy is that when we talk about the militarization of police it also relates to the hyper masculine environment that policing is and the aggressive environment that policing is and it really comes down to the question of whether punitive justice works whether violence enforce and aggression is the answer to address these issues and what would happen if by using our right to vote we directed money that goes to funding the militarization of police and invested that in education in certain communities if we talked about drug use as a public health issue if we started investing in juvenile after-school programs if we invested in public housing and so i really think that my generation is incredibly vocal about investing in areas such as education public health housing public health and i'm incredibly optimistic about the outcomes of what will come out of this and yeah i mean we're not going to be silent until real actual steps are made grace that's an excellent point and and one of the things that i was thinking about as you spoke is the richard brooks uh killing up in atlanta back in june uh the escalation there uh was amazing i think many of us saw it i'm quite sure everybody on the panel saw the the loops of the videos where obviously law enforcement had reason to believe that young mr brooks may have been inebriated uh but when you looked at that video even though they were going through the steps that law enforcement take to determine uh the level of sobriety of an individual mr brooks was very cooperative he he was not speaking in an agitated type of tone as jj was speaking about earlier cooperative and at some point in time it went from a calm interaction there with law enforcement to next thing you know they're grabbing him by the arms he's squirming and trying to get out and within seconds he's shot and he's dying uh in that wendy's parking lot and so with with when we're talking about reforming the police is it your opinion and then i'd also like for xavier and jj to weigh in if they would that even from the training standpoint that congressman lawson spoke about and that mark spoke about not just training but also the humanity to understand that individuals at times and let me just go ahead and put this out here i have seen a number of times in my career where the level of agitation with law enforcement is more heightened depending on the color and or the gender of the individual who they are interacting with i cannot tell you how many times i have seen instances where young students who are not black or latino have cursed out law enforcement fought with law enforcement spat at law enforcement and live to tell and we see that nationally and yet a black person can even grunt wrong and next thing you know they're shot and heading to the morgue do you think that training and or what or is it a personnel standpoint do you think that law enforcement is attracting the wrong type of uh hyper-aggressive males so to speak and or women who are trying to fit into that hyper-aggressive male uh hierarchy what and i know i just said a lot but i just i guess i'm basically boiling it down to is it possible at all to get law enforcement to dial back on their own or do you think it will take legislation and or uh stronger local level uh public policy to make those changes so that again an improper lane change doesn't end with a a trip to the morgue right i definitely support reforms when they're made but i think that there is a certain extent in which reforms can impact a historically very racist occupation and i believe that then then that comes down to holding our government accountable and saying whether we can redirect the funds whether we can take an active role and defunding when we talk about defunding the police so whether we can take that funding and we can dedicate that to other things in the communities that could probably be way more beneficial such as education and such as drug use and using that as a public health issue and when it comes to addressing poverty when it comes to addressing economic inequalities in public housing and so i do think ultimately it boils down to whether the government is going to intervene and actively redirect some of those funds that come from the policing organizations and redirect them into more beneficial things for the community anyone else want to talk about that xavier i see you yeah i think that that's a really good point um and just to back up for a second i'm originally from brunswick georgia um so the mod aubrey case was one that really hit home for me um my i think that for me that was one that that really i mean when you see something happen in your backyard and to somebody that you've seen and that you had close friends with that knew somebody um growing up that's that's something that you ponder on for a long time and you think about how that could have been you growing up but i think going back to the part about training my dad had the opportunity to sit on the clint county police department's um review committee um after the incident and so we we have we've had plenty of conversations about what's next how do you improve from this how do you go from here and one of the big things that he always talked about was the culture of the police department and how a lot of times it's uh parents who start off in the police department they bring their sons on and then their sons sons come on and their their uncles or their their their their grandparents or their nieces and nephews come to the police department and they're teaching the same kind of in doctrine principles or interaction philosophies with people and so you think about how segregation uh may have taken place in the past right and so you have a father who was policing in the community um during segregation jim crow laws and so the way that he interacts with somebody he was taught how to interact with somebody during those time periods he's going to pass the same philosophy down to his his kids and his grandkids and his nephews and nieces who come into the police force after that and so i think that it just regurgitates and reiterates the fact that there needs to be a whole culture change in the police department itself and that you can only go so far like gray said with reform as far as policy and with reform as far as training is concerned it all takes it takes a whole holistic kind of interaction or interaction with diversity with understanding of inclusion and understanding the community that you're policing and understanding how you interact with people and how that's perceived from one culture to the next culture and just understand it's a humanity thing and you can't just take a singlistic or a one-sided approach to it it's going to take levels and into different levels of the approach to really fix the situation thank you xavier jj yes um i agree i agree with xavier because i really believe that it's a humanity thing and it's a cultural thing that needs to to be happened um the process of hiring a police officer is so easy and you know like the and the way that they're dealing with them their job is very hard it's it's creating that space before training who you're hiring first like before you're training you need to know what type of background this person have what type of person all this cultural aspect is very important and it comes it comes together at the end so it's about changing the culture understanding who you're hiring and what that person because a lot of police officers had a lot of internal things that they need to work on you don't know when you can change so much so um i really believe it's the background checks the the uh going do so much more than just hiring and trying to train somebody you cannot train somebody internal opinion you cannot change somebody um racist ways um that's something training cannot change but we need to like xavier said have some sort of breaking through different culture channel not like you said if you have somebody with somebody they're gonna continue keeping that same culture so creating a new culture so it doesn't repeat itself we don't want what's happening to be something whenever we hear the next black lives taken away we walk we don't want this this is we that's why this movement is very important because we are tired we're tired of seeing the same story just at this point i have i have like a a sign i just say say their name where i i leave the the hashtag blank because you don't know who's gonna be next and that shouldn't be something a 21 year old person have to worry about who's next it shouldn't have to and we shouldn't have to be dealing with this with certain situation that that is happening in our community and it's happening right here in our community so changing that culture is very very important in understanding the next generation cannot take us so this one right here we need to work in correlation with each other the older generation people in office and student leaders needs to come up and keep that movement alive to make sure this doesn't continue to happen anymore mark and dr hodo mark go ahead yeah uh thank you and i i'd actually like to just briefly comment uh in just very summery fashion with all three comments that were just made um because it it absolutely is a corporate cultural issue within law enforcement community just as it is a real world cultural issue to better understand who we are who we're not uh to disabuse the the myths there's there's opportunity and challenge in that because there are different approaches taken uh by whether it's a police department or a sheriff's office and i think to to promote the most effective advocacy and to promote accountability it's it's both the opportunity and the and almost a responsibility of the advocate to discern where those corporate cultures are in other words to better understand within abc law enforcement entity is that the same as uh def and and should the approaches be different because again i think if uh implied within your comments and you're all right on point from my perspective it's just now how do we calibrate that because there are some there are some people there leaders in in law enforcement that get it to oversimplify and there are some staying with simplification that don't so so how do we identify and then just very quickly i know we're bumping into time grace your comment about voting had has many different dimensions so just to you know state one aspect of this florida's notorious history for felony disenfranchisement long after a sentence uh has been completed for all intents and purposes that's an ongoing battle as as you know subject to federal litigation now there's another aspect though in terms of encouraging people to vote and i knew i know you're not just talking about the criminal justice system but it this is part of it in in county detention facilities in florida alone there are 45 000 people and as of july 20 um 928 in leon county people in local detention facilities county detention facilities by and large have not lost their civil rights they're always exceptions but these are people who are a pre-trial awaiting trial at that sometimes called a jail or they're serving out a misdemeanor sentence so it's an access to voting issue 45 000 people in florida alone nearly three-quarters of a million people in the united states so there's so many aspects of how to operationalize a an effort a strategy that moves the these issues forward um you know you're all speaking to some hugely important issues uh dr hodo i defer to you thank you i have a couple things to say so jj i know what you were saying and i love the uh quote by fannie lou hammer when she says i'm sick and tired of being sick and tired and that's what i think our youth are and i'm sick and tired i'm not a youth but i'm sick and tired of being sick and tired too um when it comes to policing um i i think the reality is is that we live in a hyper-segregated society that is based on social economic status which has a direct relationship to race and ethnicity and too often we see police officers who are not familiar with the people that they're policing and they don't understand the differences so again to what jj said then all of a sudden you're an angry black woman that's another label that's been placed on the black and brown bodies right particularly females in the hypersexualization of the black and brown body um the males the hyper criminalization of them is just amazing um but i think with the hyper segregation that's a major issue because we have police who have never interacted with people who look like me um and they come in and they can make assumptions through the units of socialization right and implicit bias we all have that and the units of socialization are the media the school our peers and things of that nature and they kind of reinforce that i mean if i looked at the media and that's all i knew about the black and brown communities in america i would be afraid too you know the way that they're often depicted um as mark said i've worked on amendment four to restore uh the voting rights of the convicted felons in florida i mean because that that they are disenfranchised they're not afforded that opportunity to vote i mean there are exceptions anyone who's done a murder or actually um violent type crime obviously won't get that uh right back and my last point is i think about right now so since it's 2020 right we know how many black and brown bodies we just spoke about are incarcerated they're incarcerated typically in rural areas and guess what when the census is taken that's where they're counted even though that's not where they live at that moment they live there but that's not the community that they're going to return to so we're going to see funds and and legislation and you know it make it appear that there's a larger demographic or a larger population in these rural areas which oftentimes lack diversity you know but they're going to get more funding and more opportunities because it appears that they have more representation so all these things need to be looked at but again this is all systemic and it's not by accident and we have to be very intentional when we redevelop a correct system that is equitable to all i think too many people are afraid that they're going to lose their privilege if other people gain equity and and there's enough pie for everybody it's not like cake or pie you know everybody's going to get a slice so it that that's not at all the case it uh 30 seconds to weigh in human rights is not a zero-sum game and that's exactly dr hoda what you just said universality of human rights means that we all have them again wherever we are whatever we do whatever we look like wherever we're from and and that i i think working toward that realization is a necessary part of whatever the success of this this movement will be and again it's certainly focused upon the the singular topic that we are now exploring tonight but it applies across the board to to everyone so dr hodo i i think contributions are really prescient and with that mark i will give you the last word i want to on behalf of uh congressman al lawson in the al lonson for congress campaign thank grace jj xavier dr hodo as well as mark uh for appearing on this panel and i hope that we can continue this dialogue both on social media as well as potentially uh in fora similar to this uh in the future with regards to uh time we are coming close to the time and i would like to yield to congressman lawson at this time uh to allow him to give some closing remarks uh this evening okay thank you very much and i would like to uh thank attorney house uh for moderating uh doing an outstanding job and i know attorney crump has to get off because it never stopped for him but sometimes need to be in shoes i see him in one city one day and another city another day because of all of the things that are gone and i want to thank you all the panel uh yeah one of the things that um uh i think attorney heart said uh just not gonna be the only time uh this is the first step similar to the first step of course that we pass in congress in reference to the criminal justice system uh we passed the first step to stop the problem that we have with so many people being incarcerated uh for so uh minor crimes and so forth and we learned a long time ago that we cannot build our way out of uh the criminal justice system so it has to change and so we've had them we've been working on it ever since i've been and this is the first time that we've been able to attract some bipartisan support so that we can start to move through the criminal justice state system and make changes which is so important to all our communities you know one great president said that people with little notice not long remember what we say here uh but they would they would never forget uh what we did here and for you all serving here tonight here's a step forward uh to make sure that we create uh a movement and not a moment uh and this would not be the last time because you see what is happening america my job uh that i'm hired to do by my constituents is go to washington and make a difference in your lives make sure that we accomplish some of the things that are so very important to you so with the issue the black lives matter yes black lives matter and i want to thank all of you for the opportunity uh to remember uh that's the most important issue comes up next tuesday uh when it's time to vote in the primary and i hope that all you all will tell your friends all over this different from uh the chattahoochee river to the saint john's river in jacksonville where you tell your friends to cash your vote vote for the person uh that you think that will work hard for you uh in washington and to make sure that we uh take advantage uh of the as mark talk about the the uh i think maybe uh attorney hobbs talked about uh is the opportunity that is given to us the opportunity to vote uh for those we are voting for those who are not able to vote but we're going to make a way for them uh to vote you know and i tell people who are not able to vote so you can make a difference by getting involved and we're going to continue to work and i know how much uh we have seen past and how people try to keep people still from voting uh because they're afraid that they're not going to vote for them so this has been great and i'll turn it back forward to you attorney hopps thank you so much congressman lawson and i want to again thank each analyst i want to thank you congressman lawson definitely want to thank our brother benjamin crump uh for his participation this evening and i want to make sure that i thank each of you that has paid attention this evening on facebook you know often people ask what can we do what you can do is what we are doing which is number one educate yourself on all of the issues that are crucial uh in this era talk about the issues talk about it on social media talk about it at the dinner table and make sure that your thoughts with regards to black lives matter as well as ending excessive uses of police force are heard so that your voices can then go into action in regards to voting and yes i am proud to say that i have already endorsed and continue to support congressman al lawson and hope to send him back to washington dc uh to continue to represent the citizens in the fifth congressional district we need proven leadership we need people who have been out here fighting these fights long before many of us drew our first breaths and congressman lawson you are one of those individuals and we stand behind you and continue to support you as you go into the primary next week and then hopefully head on back to washington dc to continue to bring it home to north florida thank you all this evening thank you thank you sir and we look forward to uh the next time we have an opportunity to convene and discuss the issues of critical importance have a good evening

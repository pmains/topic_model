  FIRED FROM LONG DISTANCES AWAY. THIS FAR INTO THE WAR AND RUSSIA DOESN'T HAVE FULL AIR  SUPERIORITY OVER THE BATTLE  FIELD ACCORDING TO WESTERN  OFFICIALS. OUR NEXT GUEST WANTS TO TAKE  STEPS TO MAKE SURE THEY NEVER  DO. ADAM KINZINGER JOINS US NOW. YOU'VE BEEN CALLING FOR BACKING  THE IDEA OF A NO FLY ZONE, WHICH IS SOMETHING THE UKRAINIAN AND  PRESIDENT AND UKRAINIAN  OFFICIALS ARE REALLY PUSHING  FOR. I TALKED TO THE FORMER U.S.  AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE STEVEN  PFEIFFER AND HE SAID THE ONE  MAJOR DRAW BACK OF A NO FLY ZONE BESIDES THE OBVIOUS, IT PROVOKES POTENTIALLY DIRECT CONFLICT, YOU KNOW, OF AN AMERICAN PLANE  SHOOTING DOWN A RUSSIAN PLANE. THE AMBASSADOR SAID THEY WOULD  HAVE TO BOMB ANTI WAR WEAPONS IN BELARUS IN ADDITION TO RUSSIAN  ANTI WAR ASSETS IN UKRAINE. TALK TO ME ABOUT YOUR SUPPORT  FOR THE NO FLY ZONE AND THOSE  ARGUMENTS AGAINST IT.  >> LOOK, ANDERSON THERE IS RISK. I'M NOT GOING TO DENY THAT AND  WE SHOULD OBVIOUSLY LOOK AT THAT WITH EYES WIDE OPEN. YOU KNOW, I THINK THERE IS RISK  IN AN ACTION, TOO, AT THE  MOMENT. WHAT I FEAR IN THE LONG TERM IS  THAT IF RUSSIA ULTIMATELY DOES  TAKE CONTROL OF KYIV OR ALL OF  UKRAINE OR MOST OF UKRAINE AND  WE WAKE UP EVERY MORNING AND  CONTINUE TO SEE THOUSANDS UPON  THOUSANDS OF CIVILIANS KILLED  AND ALL THESE TRAGIC STORIES,  THERE WILL BE A MOMENT WHERE WE  DECIDE WE HAVE TO AND BY THAT  TIME, I THINK YOU'RE  SIGNIFICANTLY IN A MUCH MORE  RISKY SPOT BECAUSE MUCH MORE  RUSSIAN EQUIPMENT WILL BE MOVED  IN. I WANT TO BE CLEAR. THERE IS OPTIONS. THERE IS A NO FLY ZONE OVER  UKRAINE AND WESTERN UKRAINE AND  A HUMANITARIAN NO FLY ZONE. I THINK WE'VE DONE A LOT AS THE  U.S. AND ALLIES SO THIS ISN'T AN ATTACK ON THE RESPONSE SO FAR. I FEAR WE'RE GOING TO GET TO THE MOMENT WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE  COMPELLED TO AND WE SHOULD NOT  FEAR RUSSIA IN THAT CONTEXT.  >> YOU'VE REACHED TWO  INTERESTING IDEAS, WHICH A LOT  OF PEOPLE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT. I WANT TO ASK ABOUT THEM  FURTHER. ONE OF THEM IS BASICALLY KIND OF AN AIR CORRIDOR, HUMANITARIAN  AIR CORRIDOR THAT I GUESS WOULD  BE PROTECTED BY U.S. PLANES OR  NATO PLANES OR ALLIED COUNTRY  PLANES OR COUNTRIES WHO ARE  WILLING TO IF NOT NATO PER SE  AND THAT WOULD, WHAT, ALLOW THE  FLIGHT OF SUPPLIES IN? >> YEAH, SO IF YOU THINK OF IT  SIMILAR TO A BERLIN AIRLIFT IF  YOU CAN PROTECT A CORRIDOR, YOU  CAN ALLOW PLANES TO FLY IN AND  DROP SUPPLIES OR ARMAMENTS. IF IT'S AN AGREED UPON ONE, THE  RUSSIANS VIOLATED EVERY ATTEMPT  TO HAVE HUMANITARIAN CORRIDORS  SO FAR, YOU WOULD LIMIT IT TO  SUPPLIES AND MEDICAL. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT VARIATIONS OF WHAT WE CAN DO ON  A NO FLY ZONE. THE IMPORTANT THING IS THIS. THE OLD SOVIET UNION USED TO  THREATEN THE USE OF NUCLEAR  WEAPONS ALL THE TIME. IF UKRAINE ENDS UP DEFEATING  RUSSIA, WHICH WE PRAY FOR, IF  YOU THINK VLADIMIR PUTIN IS  CRAZY ENOUGH TO USE NUKES  AGAINST NATO AND THE WEST FOR  DEFENDING THE SKIES OF A  SOVEREIGN COUNTRY THAT INVITED  THEM TO DO IT, I THINK WE HAVE  TO BE REALISTIC THAT HE MAY VERY WELL JUST USE THEM ON UKRAINE IF HE LOSES. HE'S A CRAZY MAN. WE'VE DONE A GREAT JOB STANDING  UP TO HIM. THERE IS A FEW MORE THINGS I'D  DO. THIS IS A MOMENT HE WON'T GO  QUIETLY.  >> YOU'VE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE  IDEA OF -- WHICH YOU MENTIONED  PREVIOUSLY ABOUT A NO FLY ZONE  IN THE WEST OF UKRAINE. I'M IN LVIV, WHICH IS MUCH  CLOSER TO THE POLISH BORDER. IT'S THE TRANSIT POINT FOR  HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE  WHO ARE FLEEING, THEY COME TO  THE LVIV TRAIN STATION TRYING TO GET FURTHER WEST OF POLAND,  ROMANIA AND THE LIKE. THERE IS EVEN TALK OF IF KYIV  FELL THAT PERHAPS THERE WOULD BE UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT IN CHARGE  IN LVIV AND THAT WOULD BE THE  SITE, THE SEED OF POWER. WHAT WOULD A NO FLY ZONE IN  WESTERN UKRAINE ACCOMPLISH? >> YEAH, IT WOULD BE BASICALLY  THAT. IT WOULD BE PROTECTING AN AREA  FOR -- IF CIVILIANS NEED TO  FLEE, TO FLEE, THEY CAN BE  PROTECTED. IT ALLEVIATES PRESSURE OBVIOUSLY ON EUROPE WHO WILL TAKE -- YOU  KNOW, WE'VE HAD A MILLION REF   -- REFUGEES. IT ALLOWS A PLACE IF GOD FORBID  KYIV DOES FALL TO HAVE THAT  GOVERNMENT AND EXILE YOU  MENTIONED TO CONTINUE TO TRAIN,  EQUIP AND SUPPORT THE UKRAINIAN  ARMY AS THEY TRY TO TAKE BACK  THE REST OF UKRAINE. KEEP IN MIND, I THINK IF WE GET  TO A POINT AND THIS IS WHERE WE  HAVE TO REMEMBER AS WE MAKE  DECISIONS TODAY WHERE WE SEE  KYIV FALL OR SEE SIGNIFICANT  PART OF UKRAINE FALL OR GOD  FORBID A DEFEAT OF THE UKRAINIAN ARMY, TAKING BACK UKRAINE WILL  BE FAR BLOODIER THAN ANYTHING  WE'VE SEEN TODAY.  >> YOU SIT ON THE COMMITTEE FOR  ENERGY AND COMMERCE. WE HEARD A NUMBER OF PEOPLE  TALKING FOR A BAN ON RUSSIAN OIL AND GAS AT THE U.S., DO YOU  AGREE WITH THAT IDEA OF A BAN  AND DO YOU THINK IT SOMETHING  THAT ACTUALLY MIGHT HAPPEN? >> I THINK IT'S CERTAINLY  GAINING STEAM. I THINK IT SHOULD HAPPEN,  ABSOLUTELY. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE TO BE  READY FOR EVEN HIGHER ENERGY  PRICES. I THINK THERE IS AN  UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS IN  ESSENCE A SMALL PRICE TO PAY  PARTICULARLY IF YOU LOOK WHAT IS GOING ON IN UKRAINE AND PUT  YOURSELF IN THEIR SHOES, THAT'S  A COST OF DEFENDING FREEDOM AND  WE HAVE OVER MAYBE AS OF TODAY,  YOU KNOW, 700 MILLION SOME  BARRELS IN THE PETROLEUM  RESERVE. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS FOR. FOR THESE MOMENTS. I THINK WE HAVE TO DO IT. THIS IS THE ONE THING RUSSIA  ACTUALLY MAKES MONEY ON IS THEIR ENERGY AND SO IT MAY BE PAIN

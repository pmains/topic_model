thank you very much mr chairman thank you mr secretary mr secretary for far too long certain not all certain retirement advisors have put their own financial interests above their clients workers across this country are demanding a higher standard of care they deserve peace of mind when planning for their retirement the department of labor owes it to the workers of america to fully implement current rules and regulations put in place to ensure that they receive unbiased and fair uh advice what is your plan to protect these workers um congresswoman um thank you for the question um first let me say you are correct like like all industries the um investment industry has has some bad actors and individuals need to be protected um as you're aware the fiduciary rule was was struck down by a court it was held to to exceed the statutory i don't know what you're going to do sir i'm i'm getting to that congresswoman i'm i'm trying i have five minutes so if you could just move it i i understand so it was struck down by the court and so the department is working with the the sec the sec um was asked by congress um to look at and modernizing the protections in these i'm asking what are you going to do what is your department of labor going to do congressman if you'll let me finish my my sentences or i need to reclaim my time i have more questions to ask so so the department of labor is working with the sec the sec was asked by congress to come up with appropriate responses to protect these individuals we are communicating with them and and based on our collaborative work we will be issuing new rules in this area when would that be well the sec is in the process of producing those rules the sec is just a time would be great congresswoman we're working with an independent agent okay so you don't have a time let me just move to my next question um you know it's rare that i actually agree with our ranking member but today i do the ranking member talked about the need to prepare workers she talked about workforce development but as i look at the president's budget and what you all have proposed you are cutting discretionary funding by 1.2 billion dollars for the department of labor which includes 700 million to job corps 15 million to re-entry employment opportunities and 5 million to youth bill so it doesn't like you look like you're preparing to do more with workforce development you want now to cut workforce development so i'm confused because i actually do agree with her that we should tell me what what is the role of job corps so congresswoman job corps role is to provide skills and education to to younger americans ages 16 to 24. it has about 120 centers around the country um it's um it's operated for in much the same way for decades and um and i think those are important skills and in fact we're working with governors around the nation too i just want to know what the role of job corps is sir so if the role is to prepare young people for the workforce why are we cutting the budget so congresswoman um as as you are as you're aware the budget that is submitted uh is submitted within certain constraints i would note that just yesterday a different committee of the house proposed a different budget just want to know why you're cutting it congresswoman there there are budget constraints that that are that inform the budget the budget is a process as you're well aware because the budget is an indication of what you believe is important so if you're cutting workforce development you don't think workforce development is important congresswoman the amount of time and energy and effort that this administration is spending on workforce development could you tell me what that is tell me what they're spending so so certainly um we are for example uh expanding apprenticeships we've got a record number of registered apprenticeships and we're expending them to industry recognized apprenticeships um and that is one area how much are they spending you said that they're spending all this money how much are we spending i i believe i said the amount of time and effort that this administration is spending because we shouldn't judge success merely by dollars but also by time and by you can't judge it by dollars but if you're going to cut uh 40 from job corps 16 percent from other develop employment opportunities then time and effort is nothing it is talk it is not action we need young people to have an opportunity especially children who are homeless children who are in difficult situations you want to protect kids then help them don't cut their budgets i yield bad mr chairman

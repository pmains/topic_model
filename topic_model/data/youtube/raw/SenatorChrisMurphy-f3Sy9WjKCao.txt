yeah thank you just a few more additional questions you testified earlier that it is not without precedent for the president to use individuals outside of the state department to conduct conduct conversations with foreign governments and that is true there's a long history of presidents seeking advice outside of the State Department and occasionally using channels outside of the State Department I would argue that there is really no precedent for what Rudy Giuliani was doing which was using his access to the President as a means to try to score political points on the president's behalf with foreign nations but for the purposes of this hearing Rudy Giuliani does not actually say that he was acting simply at the direction of the president he says he was acting at the direction of the State Department in fact he says you know who I did it at the request of speaking about his conversations with Ukraine the State Department I never talked to Ukrainian official until the State Department called me and asked me to do it so did the State Department call Rudy Giuliani and asked him to have these conversations with Ukrainian officials my recollection is that that's a reference to his communications with kurt volker who is a state department who's a special representative for ukraine and perhaps even gordon sunland as well but i I think in particular my recollection is that quote is in reference to communications he's had with with Kurt Volker you nor the secretary asked Julie Ani to carry out any diplomatic efforts I did not and I'm not aware that the secretary did either and so to the extent that he's reporting back to individuals you believe he referring to the others we've discussed kurt volker in particular the second question is I'm just having a little bit I want to support your nomination you know that I believe in you as a public servant I'm having a little hard time understanding your reluctance to make a conclusion as to what the policy of the United States was over the course of the summer because you've seen the July 25th transcript you've read the testimony you've seen the text and I hope that you've conducted your own investigation so let me just sort of ask the question I asked earlier again easy your understanding that it was the policy of the United States to press the Ukrainian government to conduct investigations into burries m'a and alternative theories about the 2016 election interference I understand that you may not have been part of these efforts but is it now your opinion that that was the policy of the United States having read the transcript of a call with the president and seeing all this other evidence so the president has been clear in his subsequent statements about there not being what the phrase that's been used as a quid pro quo we're talking about the foreign assistance not what I'm asked I understand you're talking about the policy was it the was it our policy to request these specific investigations related to burry Zuma and related to relitigated or at least looking into alternative theories about the 2016 election area so I my understanding is that there was as part of our general anti-corruption policy concurring in a corruption reform in Ukraine from reading the transcript of or the the summary of the July 25th call that looking at as the chairman mentioned that gas company and board member and us person involvement was certainly mentioned by the president and therefore part of US policy what the president has denied was that there was any quid pro quo do you have knowledge that the president has ever raised any other specific corruption investigations that he wishes Ukraine to undertake other than the investigation related to Joe Biden and the investigation related to the 2016 election interference not specific investigations but he has been emphatically any corruption reform generally in Ukraine I think again I think this is as we sort of move forward on how to proceed as a Senate I just don't buy this idea of that there was this general interest in corruption given the fact that the president has only raised two of these issues in the phone call but I have no doubt that you care about the issue of corruption in Russia Ukraine and the region and I hope you pursue it vigorously as you have testified to before this committee

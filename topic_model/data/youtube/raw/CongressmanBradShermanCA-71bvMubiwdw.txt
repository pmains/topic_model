thank you a lot of focus on the FHA program the prior administration was in the process of implementing a 25 basis point reduction in the premium that would have saved the average borrower $500 in the first year and more in high-cost areas like mine a million homeowners would have benefited and they would have saved over 27 billion dollars in your confirmation of course the before you were uh nominated the administration has halted that plan to reduce the premium by 25 basis points during your confirmation you agreed to look at that policy with the possibility of can reinstate that 25 basis points of decline we also see that back in until 2013 you stopped making premiums when you reached a loan-to-value ratio of 78 percent yet 22 percent equity in the property and at that point it was thought you did not need insurance and to make insurance premium payments that was reversed in in 2013 are you moving toward perhaps reducing the insurance premium by 25 basis points and are you examining going back to the policy of saying once you have 22 percent equity you don't have to make premium payments certainly both of those things are under study being looked at very carefully I personally don't want to make the commitment in terms of either one of them right now because we're so close to having an FHA commissioner but do bear in mind that we want the prices of home ownership to be as low as possible while still protecting and how will the recent reverse mortgage changes impact the mutual mortgage insurance fund the FHA insurance fund and do you expect additional changes to the reverse mortgage program when the reverse mortgage program was initiated I think it was done with very good intentions but without really looking down the pike and people were taking out much larger amounts of their equity in the beginning then was sustainable and this was leading to a lot more problems than it was helping it's also resolved in a much higher default rate and that's been a big drain on the mm AF so the changes that we've made will sort of stop the bleeding in terms of new mortgages or reverse mortgages and the for mortgage program is doing extremely well so we're doing some draining from the reverse mortgage but we're doing a lot of putting into the fund for the other so we're very close to the 2% right now and we obviously need to watch further before we I want to get it

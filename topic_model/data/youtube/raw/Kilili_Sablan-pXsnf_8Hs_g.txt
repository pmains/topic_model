mommy and good evening commonwealth today is friday may 22nd 2015. congressman greg hillis blonde says while he is against live fire training on pog and northern marianas as a congressional representative in washington d.c he also understands national security trumps all other interests i don't like wire but obviously we also have enemies out there that want to harm us and maim us and hurt us and do i see i don't think china wants to go to war with us but china is being very aggressive around with its neighbors the congressman says the growing issues in the south china sea and the surrounding region could even impact tourism to the northern marianas if tensions flare up but he also sees north korea as a threat just a few weeks ago marine forces pacific executive director craig weldon confirmed to kspn president barack obama made clear to the armed forces a need to shift to the pacific to maintain a forward presence in the region and to promote national security if there's one thing in congress that passes every year for the past 52 or 53 years since the national defense authorization act last week national media reported the u.s house of representatives passed the national defense authorization act military spending legislation by a vote of 269 to 151 sablon says an added provision requiring the secretary of defense to consult with the head of the state or commonwealth was actually not meant for the northern marianas in fact the congressman encourages governor iloinos to invoke 902 talks between a u.s federal presidential appointee and island representative who the president appoints as his representative is very important here too in the past we've always had interior reps a point someone from interior appointed as representative i have been in a 702 consultation with a deputy secretary before uh because if we're going to be talk discussing about the military and it's an interior appointee uh every time that person speaks they have to consult with dod so we have to be very careful here but i've told the governor whatever his decision i will support him

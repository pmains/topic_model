yes good morning congressman Neal congressman Brady and members of the Ways and Means Committee i'm rob robertson chief administrator for Nebraska farm bureau we are pleased today to share with you some challenges we see in the individual health insurance markets and also some steps that Nebraska Farm Bureau took to protect those Americans with pre-existing conditions I have dedicated my entire life to help farmers and ranchers and I just honestly couldn't believe what I saw during the summer of 2018 we held listening sessions with our farmers and ranchers members and literally they got up in tears talking about their challenges of how they're coping with the health insurance markets in the individual market and the emotional stories were many I mean farmers and ranchers and spouses got up and said you know I am forced to work off the farm because of the high cost of health insurance farm and ranch families not taking out any health insurance and then having major medical bills during the year highest living expense for the farm is health insurance those stories were all over the board we heard common reports of annual premiums being $30,000 to $35,000 to $36,000 a year that's $3,000 a month and I'm sure congressman Adrian Smith for similar stories throughout his travels in Nebraska as well but what makes matters worse is farmers and ranchers more than any other sector or occupation in the country are more affected by the the high cost of the individual health insurance markets than any other sector because that lion's share of farmers and ranchers are self-employed and if you're self-employed you generally buy on the individual market where the costs are high and you're not able to be a part of a large group this is not a partisan issue this is not a political issue this is an issue of hardship and we need to fix these individual markets and try to find some ways to protect pre-existing conditions at the same time because of these issues with our members Nebraska Farm Bureau took matters into our own hands in 2017 we begin to establish Association health plan with our organization by the fall 2018 we implement it and started enrollment never wouldn't have happened without the wonderful partnership we had with insurance carrier medica based out of Minneapolis Minnesota they partnered with us in the plan offered a more affordable health insurance product which on average was 25% less than the individual marketplace for members of our large group in our association health plan it covers pre-existing conditions and let me repeat that it covers all members regardless of their health status in our association health plan and it was ACA compliant the plan is what our members wanted and is what we deliver in creating the association health plan we deeply believed it was imperative cover pre-existing conditions and that's what we did let me be clear that's not a tact on the ACA that's a companion to the ACI ACA by providing our members with another insurance option and our results coming out of the first year we had almost 700 members signed up for the association health plan saved millions of dollars in premium cost and then we continue to hear a lot of interest this coming year for sign up for the next enrollment period starting in 2019 for the 2020 year from a policy standpoint one of the best ways we can do to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions is to enhance the ability of individuals to band together pull their risk and form large groups that are fully insured insured that is what the AHP our association health plan did in our case many of our members are self-employed the only way we're going to be able to form this association health plan was because of the new association health plan regulations issued by the Department of Labor last summer if it wasn't for those new regulations we would not have an association health plan for our members let me share a quick example with you on the impact this association health plan had with members our first enrollee out of the gate husband and wife who farms together near fair Barre Nebraska 2018 their annual cost on the individual market was 25 thousand they're told that in 2019 it was going to be 26 thousand dollars a year under our plan in which they signed up it was 19 thousand they saved $7,000 and that's real money how do we get this discount rate you know farmers and ranchers are now part of a large group rated as a large group and when you rate as a large group you can spread the risk out you can lower a minister cos and you can do a little bit more with pricing in terms of the risk adjustment factors my testimony provides a lot of eligibility criteria on how to be a part of our association health plan in general you have to be a similar line of business to be a part of that so be designated and target farmers and ranchers and agribusinesses and and it is aca-compliant on what it covers our organization represents farmers and ranchers with an average age approaching 60 we strongly support the continuation of health plans that cover pre-existing conditions the key is to provide innovative policy solutions to allow for those types of things like the Association health plans to be a part of how we cover pre-existing conditions hopefully our plan works and appreciate the time from the committee today and I'll be happy to answer any questions

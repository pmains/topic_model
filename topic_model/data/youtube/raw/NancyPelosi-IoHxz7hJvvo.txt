hi I'm Congressman Jim Himes I represent southwestern Connecticut and have the privilege of chairing the New Democrat coalition a group of 61 forward-thinking Pro Opportunity Democrats walking around my district in southwestern Connecticut you can't miss the sharp economic challenge that we face today in places weeds and windblown concrete have replaced factories that used to make everything from clothing to the weapons that won two world wars my grandpa Andrew spent his life working for Eastman Kodak a company that brought magic into homes around the world at its peak Kodak employed almost 150,000 people five years ago Eastman Kodak went bankrupt fortunately my district is also home to iconic innovators like Pitney Bowes and NBC Sports and to growing newcomers like dato synchrony and indeed calm which didn't even exist fifteen years ago restaurants and thriving retailers now occupy former barren Lots in Bridgeport Connecticut because you cannot keep American innovation down change happens today faster than ever before new technology and global competition opened new markets and offer life-changing advances but without planning and support too many people get left behind when factories closed good people lose more than their paychecks dignity Worth and a sense of belonging also seep away pride and community turned to fear and division president Trump trades in that decline he nurtures fear paints a dark picture of the future and blames immigrants Muslims Democrats in the media he promises walls and promotes division and he delivers nothing not jobs not opportunity not unity we Americans are decent neighborly self-reliant people we're not looking for saviors or for handouts we're looking for opportunity and we know exactly where it comes from in a changing world Americans need to be better educated and skilled than people anywhere else certainly my story whatever successes I've had tie straight back to strong public schools and to teachers who cared the Democrats a better deal demands no less for every single American child it's time to make sure that our businesses offer apprenticeship programs to teach valuable skills we must have invest in lifelong learning training and education so that every worker young or old can be vital and relevant to the industries of tomorrow that's why Democrats are offering the American people a better deal better jobs better wages and a better future a better deal recognizes that the core of our economic success has always been hardworking Americans growing businesses and the sturdy playing field on which they compete the highways airports and railways that undergird American prosperity since George Washington's investment in the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal businesses have always depended on a reliable foundation of communications transportation and power we are descendants of people who spanned a continent with rails of Steel took to the skies and crossed the black void of space to land men on the moon we owe it to those generations to be better stewards of their legacy when did it become okay for our America to have second-class roads airports harbors and rails we know there's hard work and tough choices ahead but we also know from experience that investments in education and training and transportation communication and power will pay for themselves many times over so why aren't we coming together to make it happen today we're distracted by a tweeter in chief who deepens our division sow seeds of discord and fans the flames of violence our country needs and deserves leaders who will encourage us to be our better selves and who will champion the ideas that we know are good for our nation these are the ideas that animate a better deal for families across America dem Kratts are all about opportunity growth innovation and the good jobs that follow we will not be distracted we will not be deterred because we understand something that President Trump never will that our world can be a far far better place and that together we can make it so

I think for the viewers in the audience right now they're at risk of losing the forest through the trees because the truth is health care in America should be a right when I was a young mother and had Theo as an infant he had an allergic reaction to eggs and his whole body turned red and puffy I had to rush him to the emergency room my heart is palpitating because I'm worried that his throat will close I am not worried about not having an insurance card or a credit card in my wallet I know whatever they're gonna prescribe whether it's an EpiPen or an inhaler I can afford it the truth about health care in America today is people can't afford it they cannot afford and the insurance companies for these plans that rely on insurance companies I'm sorry they're for-profit companies they have an obligation to their shareholders they pay their CEO millions of dollars they have to have quarterly profits they have fat in the system that's real and it should be going to health care so let's not lose the forest for the trees and last let's not forget what the Republicans are doing because the truth is the Republicans and Trump their whole goal is to take away your health care and to make it harder for you to afford it thank you [Applause]

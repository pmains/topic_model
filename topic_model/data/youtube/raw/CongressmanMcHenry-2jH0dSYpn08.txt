Vice Chair quarrels thank you for being here so I just want to tick through a couple of these questions about your speech in particular so removing the leverage ratio from the stress test capital requirements is that more or less regulation or just different regulation I so I would not view that as in any way as a weakening of regulation I think that's an appropriate alignment of regulation in in light of the fact that we're so far distant from the financial crisis you have economic data to indicate you can make that change yeah I think that I think that conceptually there is a difference between the the stress test is a very is a firm specific risk based test the leverage ratio is intended to be not all risk sensitive and to serve as a backstop and so when you put that into the stress test you're really confusing the two things which basically admits that you're not at that your stress test isn't as good as you think it is a minute respects it's not it's not doing what it was designed to do if you have a post dresser so two more things just very simply quickly greater transparency for the stress test process is that more or less regulation that is that's just more transparent okay more transparency and the endgame of the public shaming for those that pass or fail stress tests in sort of this public ingredient is that more or less or just different regulation I think that's refinement it's not relaxation so I we I appreciate your speech and and I think outlining the updates that you're seeking to make post-crisis and now with dodd-frank is is fully implemented is it's going to be and having this economic data so you can actually shift and make sure that the Fed is doing the right and appropriate thing given the current market but one thing in particular I noticed in your in the in your inaugural report on supervision regulation a great deal of discussion about Bank Secrecy Act and anti money laundering and the compliance and in data and information technology pieces of that which I find really interesting can you walk through us the basic challenges banks are facing regarding technology and particularly partnering with technology companies well I think there are both challenges and opportunities particularly in this area of Bank Secrecy Act and anti money laundering compliance there there are a lot of opportunities for banks to use machine learning and and big data management that did not exist at the time that our current regulatory framework was put into place that would be of benefit to us as the government to law enforcement would be more efficient use of bank resources so I'm very supportive of efforts to help the banks do that which I think they're quite willing to do so you know in in the admission that banks are struggling with to manage data and IT risk as well as as bsa/aml compliance why not encourage banks to actually partner with technology companies to get ahead of the curve why not why not the Fed lean in on encouraging that so that we can have banks keep pace with the rest of the technology sector well I would say I mean that's an it's an interesting thought we certainly are trying not to be a disincentive to business decisions that banks might make in that respect we do want to be sure that where there are those partnerships that you know that we as regulators and and all those responsible for the system understand understand what risks there might be in those partnerships but I don't think there's any reason for us to stand in the way of those partnerships interesting question whether we should encourage them [Music] you know as to how we ought to affect those business decisions of the firm's I think but it's certainly at the very least we should not discourage them right but there's a mixed message here so you've got governor Brainard discouraging banks and partnering with innovation companies and the admission that with AI and the technology sector moving dramatically forward and sort of this dissonant piece of information or dissonant voices in the Fed around technology it seems like for banks it's damned if you do damned if you don't right that the Fed will take a harsh look at new technology but their consumers my constituents their customers are desirous of the best technology and that technology ensuring there's these institutions are safe and sound so I think you've got to do better in encouraging the use of technology or we're gonna have a riskier banking sector I yield back Thank You gentleman yields back the chair now recognizes gentlelady from New York

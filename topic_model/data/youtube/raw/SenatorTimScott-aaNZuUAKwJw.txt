senator your thoughts about day one i know you were traveling a little bit but it made they want to make it clear the republicans they're not going to get into the to get down and dirty like what happened with kavanaugh were they right to say it well there's no doubt that the big media wants to make this into an issue of race and gender and the stench of the hypocrisy from the left is undeniable what we're going to focus on are the concerns we have about her philosophy as a judge we're going to focus on how does she rule in the past and why were some of those rulings over overturned by a higher court we're going to focus on making sure that america supreme court gets the justice they deserve this is not biden's supreme court this is not the progressive supreme court this is america's supreme court and so i can tell you that republicans will dig into her record but we're interested in who she is as a judge not what she looks like and so that's good news i think ted did a good job of making sure that we laid out the parameters for this conversation unlike the democrats who literally want to assassinate the character including of our supreme court justice coney barrett you know i did love her biography i thought it was well done well delivered i love a legitimate background story let's see if she can answer the questions i'm kind of disappointed when asked if she was thinks court packing is okay she didn't want to answer how could she be forced something that would diminish the impact she has on the court that she wants to be on that's a great that's the kind of question we need to have answered though brian you're hitting the nail on the head what we have to do is make sure that she answers legitimate questions and every single question we ask about her philosophy is important every question she gets on her cases those questions are important we should never deny the american people the information they need to see to know who's coming to the court or why we are going to deny her a seat on the court if both sides need to be heard out senator you you're moving on some legislation now you have at least 20 republicans supporting you in the senate to try to protect workers gig workers people that want to do their own thing because you see since the pandemic a big push to unionize in what respect what is the what does this legislation read like well the most important part of this legislation is to realize that we are going to focus on the future while the democrats are focusing on the past we literally understand that workers want the flexibility in their schedules and they want to build a workplace around themselves we can help them get that accomplished through my legislation so i'm really excited to see the progress that we're making on making sure that legitimately today employees decide when they work how much they work for and the benefits they get whether you're independent contractor or an employee we want a workplace that is conducive for your priorities what did you see is it someone for example with uber these people who want to do the gig economy the uber eats and the uber drivers uh the left all of a sudden they're being attacked by legislators in what like in what respect and what would you would you do to block it well let me just say a great question brian the pro act which failed in california the most liberal state in the country fell by a 20-point margin they're trying to bring that failed legislation to the national scene where they literally require every employee to join a union or pay dues to union whether they're a member of it or not they want to be able to take those union dues and use them for political purposes 90 of the money goes to democrats while 40 percent of the union members vote for republicans we have to break that stronghold that they currently have they want to through the pro act eliminate 27 states right-to-work laws in other words ushering in a new wave of unions that is wrong for our economy wrong for our workers and wrong for our country senator tim scott man of action get on board when you get the majority if you get the majority up to the midterms you'll probably have more momentum if you can't pass it originally senator thanks for joining us tonight yes sir

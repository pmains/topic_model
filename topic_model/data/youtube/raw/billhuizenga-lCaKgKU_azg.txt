today and want to thank my friend and colleague New Jersey nobody has fought Lara longer or harder for the cause of life the man and I'm pleased to be up here because I know we both believe that we represent and rise on behalf of the hundreds of thousands of Americans who are going to come to Washington DC in March here this coming Friday because we believe that giving even one more life one more person the right to change the world is worth it well for the last six years have come to the well of the house with my friend from New Jersey and my colleagues on the bipartisan pro-life caucus to celebrate life and fight for the unborn on the 7th occasion I rise with a renewed sense of hope and optimism for our children's future I commend president Trump for making one of his very first actions protecting unborn children around the world by preventing US taxpayer dollars being used for foreign aid from being used to fund groups that promote abortion under the guise of family planning we can't stop here however that's just one step now is the time for action when President Bush restored these protections in 2001 he wrote quote it is my conviction that taxpayer funds should not be used to pay for abortions or advocate or actively promote abortion either here or abroad end quote while we took step 2 earlier today when a bipartisan majority of us here in the House voted to extend the Hyde Amendment across all government programs and to ensure that no tax dollars from hardworking Americans are used to fund abortions here in the United States let's take additional steps to fight for the ones who don't have a voice this Congress should protect unborn children from the violence of late-term abortion protect medical professionals from being coerced to participate in abortions and protect women from an industry that has put its financial interests first above women's health mr. speaker the government does not give us our rights no in fact and exists to protect our god-given rights that were given to us by our Creator and to protect the next generation just all you have to do is look at those original founding documents and it's easy to see well we're here tonight for the same reason that hundreds of thousands will march on Washington this friday and to fight for the rights of that next generation and i'm pleased and proud to be able to be a part of that and i thank my friend from New Jersey for leading this and I yield back I thank my friend for Michigan for his eloquence for his commitment passion and for that steadfastness that will one day real yield the result when the unborn are protected in our laws against the violence of abortion so thank you so very much for participating but most importantly for your years of service on behalf of your

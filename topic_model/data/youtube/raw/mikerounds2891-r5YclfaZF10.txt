republican south dakota senator mike rounds joins us now senator rounds uh you know i'm really impressed uh how this is really growing despite all of the negativity despite the fact that maybe some folks thought this was not going to work the package that you're backing described that for us first of all it's a it's a framework for a package and what we're trying to do is to focus on real infrastructure republicans and democrats all agree we do need to do an infrastructure package but we've got to be able to define what infrastructure is and right now that's been a little bit challenging by itself roads bridges ports airports and now we're talking uh the telecommunications as well water projects and so forth as we build that we're also looking at ways to pay for it over a period of between five and eight years but with that comes a disagreement with with democrats democrats would like to raise taxes we're simply saying look this is not the time to raise taxes the tax reductions that we put in effect actually help to build the economy before the pandemic hit and what we'd like to focus on is finding the dollars that have already been appropriated but not yet committed and not yet sent out for coveted relief including the ppp program and including some other funds that may very well have been in for unemployment benefits that a number of our states have rejected but it's a framework only there's a lot of work to do yet what do you make of the the the fact that as the news was uh getting better on this at the framework more folks are joining in on the framework particularly on the republican side all of a sudden out of left field you get a six trillion dollar proposal uh that uh of course bernie it's no surprise bernie sanders is behind it but a lot of democrats are saying hey why why go small this is a once-in-a-lifetime crisis let's go for six trillion dollars what do you make of that elections have consequences and right now they do have enough votes if everybody votes for a tax increase and if they vote if they decide that they want to go big on it uh they've got 50 votes to the united states senate if they can talk all of their members into it we're offering a reasonable alternative that could stand the test of time our goal focus on infrastructure let's get an infrastructure package done we've proven that if you work side by side and you're reasonable you can do bipartisan deals in the senate which is exactly what the founding fathers wanted we did pandemic relief we did a multiple series of bills and we did it on a bipartisan basis well over 90 votes out of 100 in each one of the first five it's a doable deal if the democrats decide they want to go it alone i don't know that they're going to have the support of all of their democrat colleagues at this point sure some of those folks have got to go back and and talk to the taxpayers between now and election day taxpayers are not going to be happy with a huge huge tax bill coming due absolutely and it's not just by the way senator manchin uh who's always the elephant in the room when he had these conversations uh one thing and before i let you go it seems like no matter what the crisis is the solutions always go beyond economic uh reality uh and you know i had the the honor of interviewing uh representative yarmouth yesterday and essentially it comes down to this idea that the federal government can print unlimited amounts of money why hold back who what's holding the government back from solving all of our solutions is that an ideological uh thesis or is there some economic truth to that look you you can't simply continue to just print money when you do that you end up monetizing debt and what happens is is the assets that are out there are devalued cash is devalued inflation rises and the american taxpayer have a hidden tax it means your gas prices are going to go up it means your food prices are going to go up basic commodities will go up in price so anytime you start to make it an artificial issue where the government is issuing cash that really isn't well represented by a growing business economy you're going to have consequences and the consequences unfortunately are inflation which hits some of the lowest income individuals in our country the worst senator that that invisible tax is not so invisible anymore thank you so much appreciate your time this saturday morning thank you

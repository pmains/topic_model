mr speaker lastly i rise to pay tribute to marcus goeller a cornerstone of the brighton community who sadly passed away late last month marcus owned and operated the brighton coffee house theater alongside his wife amy and their two kids spencer and macy the spot is a mainstay of downtown brighton a place to pop in for a quick coffee or pastry or to take in a show in its 70-seat black box theater but before it was a reality it was just a dream between a couple and their kids marcus had had a long career in the coffee business running a chain of coffee shops in college towns all across the midwest amy had acted professionally and directed productions at brighton high school one day while sitting in the children's reading room at a small bookstore on main street they had the idea of opening their own coffee house what started that day as a dream became a reality in 2018 when brighton coffeehouse and theater opened its doors and quickly became a cornerstone of downtown it's the perfect place to gather i still remember hosting a town hall conversation there in 2019 and the incredible sense of community that you felt as soon as you walk in the door it's the reason that student organizations and performers constantly use the space because you immediately feel at home and as anyone will tell you that's because of marcus he was the soul of brighton coffeehouse a quiet kind presence he treated visitors like neighbors and neighbors like family always making sure that they were well served and had everything they needed it was here his idea to start the brighton yacht club a fleet of dozens of little motorized remote controlled sailboats that people could rent and sail on the mill pond just outside he loved his business and the people loved his business back he'd be the first to tell you that it wasn't easy that the road from a conversation to construction was filled with twists and turns and setbacks but marcus never met an obstacle he couldn't overcome his passing is our loss to amy spencer and macy to all of those who knew marcus and loved him may they hold on to the dark roasts the baked goods the theater productions that brought them close together i speak these words today so that his legacy is for forever remembered in the permanent record of the people's house letting all who read no marcus made a difference thank you mr speaker and i yield back

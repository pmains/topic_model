plans for a bipartisan committee to investigate the january 6 insurrection at the capitol fell apart this week when house speaker nancy pelosi rejected two of the republicans who were named to that panel prompting house minority leader kevin mccarthy to pull all of his gop picks and threatened to launch his own investigation joining us now indiana congressman jim banks who was one of those he would have been the top republican on that panel congressman welcome back to fox news sunday good to have you with us this morning hey martha thanks for having me so tell me you know i know that you had had conversations with uh representative benny thompson about what we're gonna what was gonna be the matters at hand what would be discussed what do you think blew up this commission last week what was the motivation well it's more clear than ever that nancy pelosi is not interested in investigation she's only interested in a narrative she claimed that the reason that she booted me from the committee was because of antics on the part of jim jordan and i in hindsight what i realize what she means by that now is that we were prepared to ask questions that no one else has asked and demand answers as to why the capital was vulnerable to an attack on january 6. why was there a systemic breakdown of security at the capitol on january six if you're going to investigate january 6 why not ask those questions and that that's all that uh that's all that this comes down to she has she's already predetermined a narrative about donald trump about republicans she doesn't want to talk about what happened at the capitol today that day to make sure that something like that never happens again so you don't think that she has concerns about those issues and how that security breakdown happened do you think that she feels it will reflect poorly on her i i really do and here's why on on wednesday before i found out that i was banned from the committee i found out by the way on twitter i was meeting with the head of the u.s capitol police union who re represents the rank and file heroes that make up the capitol police who protect me my family my staff every single day and here's what he told me the head of the capitol police union told me that on january 6 the capitol police officers weren't prepared for what was going to happen even though the head of the capitol police had intelligence reports dating back to three weeks before january 6 that something potentially very dangerous could happen that day they weren't prepared for it they weren't trained for it and maybe most important of all they weren't equipped for it they lacked they lacked equipment basic equipment to take care of something like what should at that point should have been expected would occur and here's the here's the bottom line once you go up the to the top of the the flagpole of who is in charge of the capitol police who the capital police union chief they blame the leadership of the capitol police but but due to the rules of the united states capital the power structure of the capital nancy pelosi the speaker of the house has more control and authority and responsibility over the leadership of the capitol police than anyone else in the united states capital so she doesn't want us to ask these questions because at the end of the day she is ultimately responsible for the breakdown of security at the capitol that happened on january 6. so your colleague and i think you used to have a pretty good relationship liz cheney came out swinging against you calling the things that you had said about the commission disgraceful here she is i am absolutely confident that we will have a non-partisan investigation that it will look at the facts that it will go wherever the facts may lead there are three members that the minority leader proposed that the speaker did not object to she is objected to two members and the rhetoric around this from the minority leader and from those two members has been disgraceful this must be an investigation that is focused on facts and the idea that any of this has become politicized uh is really um unworthy of the office that we all hold and unworthy of our republic so she she called some of the things that you said disgraceful with regard to this investigation what do you say to liz cheney well as i saw as i've already said speaker pelosi didn't just ban me and jim jordan from serving on this committee she also banned the very basic questions that we're asking why why was the capital vulnerable on that day when three weeks before january 6 there were intelligence reports that the leadership of the capitol police were aware of so whether it's speaker pelosi or liz cheney or anyone who sits on this committee it's clear that those are questions that we should be demanding answers to nancy pelosi doesn't want me on that committee but she doesn't also also doesn't want us to ask those questions because it leads to a series of answers that don't fit her narrative so i guess there are a lot of questions this morning about what this investigation is actually going to look like because minority leader mccarthy said you guys are all out everybody is not going to participate and yet we're hearing that speaker pelosi intends to go through with this on tuesday here's what she said about the makeup of what this committee might look like just a short time ago watch this will you be appointing more republicans to the committee like congressman adam kinzinger that would be my plan so when will that be announced perhaps after i speak to adam kinsenger but i'm not about to announce it right this minute she's pretty tight-lipped about that what's your understanding of who they're going to add to the committee and are you planning to do your own investigation on the republican side well again it's clear that pelosi only wants members on this committee who will stick to her talking points and stick to her narrative that's why she's picked the group that she's already picked and anyone that she asked to be on this committee from this point moving forward will be stuck to her her narrative to her point of view there won't be an another side and that's in the history of the congress something like this has never happened before in the history of our country you've never had the speaker of the house deny the representatives that the minority party submitted for a select committee it's never happened before it's a break in precedent and as everyone in america knows you have a majority view a minority view that's the whole point of our committee structure in the congress so why does nancy pelosi not want to hear the other side why does she not want to answer the tough questions that jim jordan and i were prepared to ask and demand answers to it's pretty clear why because the further you go up that chain of command the the closer you get to speaker pelosi we also know that the senate by the way recently completed a an investigation of their own the homeland security and the rules committee jointly published a report that came out in june and it talked about the systemic failure of leadership and the and the a breakdown of security on january 6. we we know that a number of documents from the speaker's office were submitted for that report that but there are also a number of documents that they refuse to release that the speaker's office refused to release for that investigation that still still sit on the computers in the speakers speakers office that we should be demanding to take a look at as well and the reason i can only speculate as to why they don't want those documents to be released because it it at the end of the day it uh it shows that that the speaker was involved in the lack of leadership and the breakdown of security that occurred on january 6. congressman banks thank you very much good to have you with us today we'll be watching that as it plays out this week and coming up

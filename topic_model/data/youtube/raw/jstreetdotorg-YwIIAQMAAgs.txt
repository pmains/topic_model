good evening thank you very much the really chairman of J Street mr. Jeremy ben-ami president of the organization the Honourable Bovina deputy ambassador of the State of Israel in Washington and the official representative of the Israeli government in this event I think that the presence of an official representative of the government of the State of Israel in this event is an historic landmark in the life of the Jewish community in this country and I think that I presume maybe I'm wrong I don't know I presume that some of you may have not agreed with everything that mr. Boehner said that is not important you are entitled to your opinion he is entitled to represent the government opinion everything is in the family the fact that the government decided to send him is the most important thing and this is very significant I also was want to recognize the presence of the former mayor of Haifa and chairman of the Labour Party and the acting mayor of your harm a voluntary acting mayor of Johan and a good personal friend of mine imran Meixner and a former minister of the government and a member of the Knesset and the former president of ben-gurion University professor of isha ba Thurman distinguished guests representing so many different communities in so many parts of this great country ladies and gentlemen first of all I want to thank you for inviting me to this event I'm honored I think what somewhat aggravated me about this invitation wait you don't tell yet what I'm going to say what aggravated me about was they response or the reaction well obviously there were those who didn't like it they mailed me they mail the email my wife they said I mean why does he have to be there you know what does he have to do with Jerry that is natural you know you have to accept it it's part of life there are divisions in Israel that divisions here it's natural I was somewhat aggravated by the fact that there were those who congratulated me for accepting the invitation what is there to be congratulated for J Street is a legitimate organization which cares for the State of Israel which is dedicated to the well-being of the State of Israel and this is the most important thing about J Street we can we can agree with everything that he said here we may also sometimes disagree with certain things I'll tell you a secret but just between us okay we disagree a lot in Israel amongst us about what should be done how it should be done who should do it how we should do it and so on and so forth so if we're entitled to have disagreements why are you not entitled to have this again in Islam in as long as you really care and genuinely care as you are for the State of Israel for its future existence as a Jewish state democratic and Jewish state and there is no one who deserves more to be recognized and honored than my dear friend the village evil you know when I was asked by some by the way well wishers not my enemies not people who are hostile to me IV don't care wrongly but you know it happens what do you have to do with this organization I said any organization the Davidi gillo is the chairman of is an organization proud to have association it was mentioned before you know that it is easier for people that live away from us to criticize to suggest to have an opinion and so on and so forth the really gillo grew up in the battlefield of Israel's effort to protect itself there he grew up there he developed fighting risking his life exposing himself to the hatred and misunderstanding of others and yet at the same time not losing a sense of balance as to what we have to do in order to live in peace in the Middle East alongside our neighbors and to protect the existence of the State of Israel that's why he deserves to be honored by you as he was and I appreciate the fact that you had manifested this respect for this great man the Vidigal Oh I know that and I stopped here and had to step down who would have said you only came to say what you think about the v-league illo the choice is that this is a good reason but since I'm here anyway I want to share with you my thoughts about a couple of things which are on your agenda and which are very much on my agenda which I think on the agenda the State of Israel maybe also on the international community and let me start somewhat different order than you have proposed in some of the statements that you made one of the main issues which presently preoccupy the international community and also the international narrative and discussions between my country and the United States is the situation in Iran I want to be very explicit and very straight forward I entirely agree with those who believe that Israel can't tolerate a nuclear Iran this is not a normal situation we are not talking about a country which possesses nuclear weapons because of regional problems or potential confrontations with neighbors as for instance the case with Pakistan or others we are talking about a nation which openly formally and officially talks about writing Israel of the map no country other country which possesses nuclear weapon talks about the liquidation of the State of Israel as a primary objective except for Iran so there is no question in my mind there was not when I was Prime Minister in charge of the security and well-being of the State of Israel that Israel will not be able to tolerate nuclear device we have to accept it from then on we have to ask ourselves how to deal with it and my first suggestion as I try to do with all the challenges that I had to face at a time when I was Prime Minister is to be cool okay to examine it to analyze it and to deal with it in a very balanced and determined but balanced manner it has been said many times and entirely agree that Iran is not just a challenge to Israel it's a challenge to the Democratic world it a challenge to Europe it's a challenge to America and therefore all of us have to act together and in well doesn't have to be the leader of all the world when there are countries like America in Europe that can lead the way ensure the direction and use the necessary means which are essential in order to stop Iran from being nuclear Israel will definitely be a part of this effort we are a part of this effort it's been say time and again that the less we talk about it the better it is it's true so why do we talk about it all the time we don't have to talk about it all the time Israel can do did and will do within the context of the international effort what needs to be done but the leader should be the lead of the superpowers which have the capacities which have the influence and which have the means in order to bring the result the outcome which is essential for them and for us for a peaceful future and they know how to do it and I think that in the recent actions taken by the United States or under the leadership of President Obama in order to stop or to disengage Iran from the banking system of the world is one major step forward in the direction which would be adopted by the international community and I trusted other measures will be taken that will ultimately bring the outcome that we are longing for no no options should be ruled out and Israel also has to build the capacities to deal with this situation in the event that we will have to in order to secure the very existence of the State of Israel as a last resort not in the first one I don't think that I have to say more I want also relate the world has been known over the last year as the Arab Spring I wish that I was confident that I could say that there will be an hour of summer I'm not certain about it on one hand the fact that many people innocent people couldn't continue to tolerate the lack of democracy the suppression of human rights in those extremist Arab regimes and they express their discontent and eventually brought down the government in itself is a very positive development yet at the same time no one can ignore the fact that there is a high probability that the next phase will be the emergence of radical forces they may take over maybe in a democratic way but ultimately in a fashion that will bring back those countries into dark days of non democracy suppression of human rights extremism fundamentalism and aggression of the worst possible kind we have witnessed it in Iran there was a revolution in Iran the revolution was inspired primarily by the lack of democracy that so many people felt the outcome is not very positive question is what will happen in Egypt in Yemen in Libya already we have some negative signs in Tunisia where the fundamentalist party took over I understand what people say when they don't want military confrontations and violence in the streets of those countries but I also understand those who are afraid that the radical movements will take over some of these countries and will eventually impose restrictions that will upset the basic fundamental values of democracy and equality and freedom of speech and civil rights which we all cherish so much so it's a process we have to follow it with great care and concern and hope very much that it will develop in the direction that will strengthen the democratic forces in those countries particularly in those countries who are neighbouring Israel and who made peace with Israel and first and foremost is Egypt Egypt is an important country for the security and the future of the State of Israel we pray we up will do everything that we can to build up friendly and peaceful relations with Egypt and we hope that at the end of the day the forces that will take over democratically in Egypt will look at the same direction with the same attitude and with the same spirit and inspiration that will continue to build these relations with the State of Israel one of the main contributions to this development in our relations with Egypt also in our relations with Jordan there is a big difference by the way which I'm sure you have noticed between the countries which were dominated by secular leaders in countries that were dominated by royalties strangely enough the legitimacy that was projected by the countries which are dominated by Kings preserved and protected the government's in countries regardless of whether they are symbols of democracy or not in countries which were dominated by governments of regular human beings the situation was different it's interesting I don't know what conclusions we can draw why we can't escape design which is very steady and very consistent there was not one rebellion in a country which is dominated by a king there are rebellions in almost all the others interesting now what can we do in order to affect and to influence the development that we are interested in there is one other than the building of greater cooperation with some of those countries particularly with Jordan and with Egypt which we try to do over the years we made many agreements with Egypt and Jordan we created the qualified industrial zones which were very helpful in creating many thousands of jobs for people in those countries we built up the economic operations we try to create a better understanding and cooperation on security matters which was very helpful but the one thing which will change the atmosphere in the Middle East fundamentally is peace between us and the Palestinians this is the primary responsibility of the State of Israel now I want before I go slightly deeper into this I want to share with you if I may you will forgive me one thought which I think is of some significance I think it will be fair to say that the responsibility and a prospect of making peace is not exclusively on the side of the State of Israel naturally when I argue within the State of Israel with my partners and my adversaries I talk about our responsibility but when we try to look at the entire picture no one should and can relieve the Palestinians of their responsibilities and they have responsibilities and they don't always meet their responsibilities and this has to be mentioned if we want to be fair to the issue and to ourselves into our future I know that I could maybe maybe I'm not certain don't blame me I just wonder maybe I could even received a standing ovation from you and I say that this is our fault that we are guilty that we didn't do enough that they're all right that we are wrong you will excuse me I have dealt with it I spent more time and more efforts that I can say than any other prime minister in the history of the State of Israel meeting with Palestinian leaders in order to establish a two-state solution I met with Abu Mazen 36 times for hours each time in four eyes I don't know if any prime minister in the history of the State of Israel we met with our leaders consistently for three years so many times for so many hours to discuss one thing a two-state solution that will bring an end to the conflict between us and the Palestinians and will create peace that will secure more than anything else the future and the security of the State of Israel I proposed the following to the Palestinians I think I thought then and I think now that there is no alternative to what I proposed and one day and I pray as all of you do one day when we will celebrate peace with the Palestinians this peace will be identical to what I proposed to Abu Mazen finally formally and officially on the 16th of September 2008 a the borders of the State of Israel and the Palestinian state will be based on the 67 lines they will not be identical they will not be identical because there will be swaps between us and them but they will be based on the 67 lines by the way can I say in brackets when I was arguing with president obamas and by the way I want to say it and without an argument I don't want to argue with anyone not with you not with the Israeli government you know I respect the government of Israel I seldom argue is there Israel Israeli government when I am in Israel I certainly don't want to argue with the Israeli government while I'm here that doesn't mean that I agree with what the government says or does but you know I if I want I have the opportunity to argue with them there but one thing I want to say there is a partner don't tell me that there is no partner there is a partner Abu Mazen Abu Mazen President Mahmoud Abbas never say that he supports terror he was against terror while Arafat was in charge he was against terror afterwards he was in favor of peace and peace negotiations while I was and while Eric Sharon was Prime Minister while I was Prime Minister and to this day is in favour of peace perhaps not the same peace that the majority of us want maybe somewhat different tragedy mate that's why we negotiate when we negotiate we may come to terms but no one can say to me after hundreds of hours of discussing this with Abu Mazen the he is not a partner because he doesn't want peace he wants peace with Israel and he accepts the existence of Israel as Israel declare it have to be and I don't need AB imagine to make declarations about the nature of the State of Israel if there will be peace between Israel and the Palestinians then there will be a Palestinian state and will be Israel as a Jewish Democratic state whether they declare it or whether they don't declare it it will be our state as a Jewish state and that will be as I said number one based on the 67 borders number two here I want to say in a very careful manner it's been published it's not new but still every time I speak about it I must admit you know my heart beats faster I'm talking about Jerusalem I've been the mayor for ten years by the way the VD I was deputy only one time in my life I was deputy prime minister or vice prime minister I never was deputy mayor of Jerusalem but I was mayor for 10 long years not an easy job may be more difficult than being Prime Minister because when you are mayor of Jerusalem you still depend on the government and in most cases you know do you know one mayor who likes the government I don't so it's not easy I learned one thing if we talk about the lifelong dreams of the Jewish people if you talk about the prayers of 2,000 years of the Jewish people if you talk about the history of our people we always dreamt of coming back to Jerusalem when we joined the FIR of coming back design it was to Jerusalem it wasn't to Raanana let's be honest let's be honest let's not fool ourselves only because it may fit in now with the present political circumstances we dreamt about one thing returning back to Jerusalem and there was no one who expressed it in a more powerful manner than David ben-gurion on the 5th of December 2014 ein when the United Nation was about to receive to adopt a resolution of internationalizing Jerusalem that ben-gurion said there was not an in the history of mankind which kept royalty to its capital city more than the Jewish people to Jerusalem there is not this is not something that can be waved and ignored and be forgotten no but I also found out over the period that I was the mayor of this city did a gap between the dream and the reality of life on a day to day basis is unacceptable it is impossible to live in the same city with five hundred thousand people who are privileged to have all the benefits and advantages of what the city can offer and three hundred thousand two hundred fifty thousand who are not in the same level to put it mildly now if that couldn't be accomplished in Jerusalem which is the most important city in the State of Israel how could we seriously think that we can have all the territories and keep them in democracy and provide equal rights to the people that live there if we can do it even in Jerusalem which is the capital of the State of Israel and that has led me to the inevitable conclusion that we have to keep the Jewish neighborhoods and to allow the Palestinians to have the capital in the other parts of Jerusalem which is the our neighborhood said not easy at all easier to talk about it easier to discuss it in conventions in conferences but my friends when you are the Prime Minister of the Jewish people of the State of Israel and you are talking on behalf of Jewish history a new seat with the representative of the Palestinians and you talk about the holy places you should have a sense of humbleness and humility and modesty and I don't have to tell you that for an Israeli to adopt modesty is not the easiest task it wasn't easy it was heart breaking and I said it to Abu Mazen it breaks my heart it really was one of the most difficult moments of my life to sit in front of the President of the Palestinians and to say to him okay on behalf of the State of Israel I suggest that there will be no sovereignty over the holidays and the Temple Mount not yours and not ours don't take it lightly and do me a favor don't applaud cry with me but understand that for a Jew to offer this is possible only if you reach the inevitable conclusion that if you want to live in peace and to secure the future of the Jewish people in the State of Israel as an independent democratic Jewish state this is an inevitable conclusion that you have to make and I proposed it wholly Basin and the Temple Mount will be administered by five nations Saudi Arabia Jordan Palestinians Israel in America and also proposed to resolve the issue of the refugees within the framework of the Arab Peace Initiative I don't want to go into details now because it will take us too much longer than planned in advance and I don't want to make use of your tolerance but those who say that Israel did not recognize or did not address itself to the Arab Peace Initiative are not saying the truth in November of 2007 in Annapolis I declared on behalf of the State of Israel and a government of Israel that enjoyed an overwhelming majority in parliament that Israel is prepared to negotiate the issue of the refugees within the context and within the framework of the Arab Peace Initiative and then of course where security issues the nature of the Palestinian state Palestinians agreed that it will not be militarized that they will only have law enforcement for and so on and so forth we don't I don't want to go into details this package was offered officially by me as the Prime Minister of Israel to the Palestinians I think that this is the basis for peace I think that it will be the peace that ultimately will be signed between us and the Palestinians I pray to God that it will be sooner than later I pray that the Palestinians who never said no to this plan but unfortunately never said yes to this plane will have the courage the creativity and the inspiration to come forward in order to accept this and I definitely pray to God that the leadership of the Jewish people in the State of Israel will have the courage and the flexibility needed in order to depart from the dogmas of the past into the challenges of the future and propose this and accept it and move forward now I want to say one thing at the end you're Americans I'm not in a position to tell you what to do towards your government this is something that you have to decide amongst yourself as an Israeli I will not ask you to go to your government and tell your government go to the Israeli government and tell them what to do for two reasons number one I don't think that this is my duty to tell you how to deal with your government and number two which is more important is this the challenge of the American government this is my interest this is the interests of the State of Israel this is the interests of the Jewish people that we will be the ones that move forward in order to make peace because time is running out for us not for them we need this peace more than anyone else we want to make sure that we will not be faced sooner than later with a situation that will threaten the foundations of the State of Israel when we will be forced to recognize a one state for two people with equal rights and then when we will lose the majority in the State of Israel it will cease to be what it was destined to be on the first place and therefore time is running for us I don't need no one from America or from anyone else to tell me what I need to do for my own my own my self my people my children my grandchildren and the future people of the state of israel i have to do i want to thank you as i said at the beginning for inviting me the most important for the fact that you are ready to invest your time your resources your energies your emotions you love you concern for our future our future at the end of the day is your future we are together we may disagree and occasionally when i hear sometimes statements made by j street people not necessarily by the movement or necessarily by the official representatives by by people you know i disagree as i disagree with some statements made by my own party people in this state of israel and i'm a proud member of Kadima and I am certain that Kadima will be the alternative to the government in Israel because this is the largest part and it will be supported regardless of who is in power there and it will take over sooner than later from the government of Israel this is my belief I was one of the founders of this party and I brought it in to victory in 2006 and I helped it in 2009 but what we do we will do in Israel what you do in America we bless you and we thank you for what you do we will continue to listen to you you will continue to listen to us and forever we will remain united thank you very much

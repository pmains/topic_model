I have to tell you this is still My Brightest spot of the day to be able to speak to you all and hopefully have interaction with some questions and we can go back and forth on let me just say to all the teachers principals and administrators and the school service Personnel who does so much to support all of you thank you thank you thank you thank you for your tireless efforts trying to make our children have the opportunities and skill sets of giving them that opportunity it means more than anything you know last year members of the West Virginia Board of Education told my staff that there's never been a larger Gathering of West Virginia schools to discuss UF service academies this year even more schools have joined our discussion which is unbelievable and I'm happy to be speaking to you all because I applaud you're interested in join the military it was always something I thought about was that was Out Of Reach because no one ever explained to me that I have an opportunity it could have had an opportunity I didn't know how to process it or proceed if I had an interest there's such a great opportunity to attend college for free and serve your country and get the best education in the world whether you want to attend a service Academy you want to go to ROTC or join the guard there's a way to do it you don't have to be struck with a lot of debt you can have a good education and serve your country and become truly an outstanding citizen but you have to apply soon my service Academy deadline is October the 1st 2022 not not very far a couple weeks so my service Academy board will conduct interview is from October the 17th 21st and so the 17th and 21st of the month in 2021 is that 2021 or 2022 huh 2022 I'm sorry we have it so 2022 this year October 17th through the 21st we're going to be conducting interviews um as all of you know we're living in troubled times in a troubled world but in all the classified briefings I've ever had that's in a secret secured briefings I've never heard that our country has a problem with people wanting to leave I have all the problems about people wanting to come here for the wrong reasons but I haven't been I haven't been advised that we have people wanting to leave because it's not where they want to be our country's still the beacon of freedom for the world no matter what you may have seen no matter how bad it seems on the news and how tough you think it is we are still the best and all of you the Zoom Day have an important Mission I'm telling you that right now you have to do better than what you see from some adults on TV and news we're basically the social media that you all are exposed to is unbelievable I have never seen this much coming at a society as yours young people getting thrown into with major networks on TV you've got uh cable to cable news and then on top of that you have five social platforms I don't know what I don't know what you would decide on who you believe or what you believe is a factual or true or not so you're going to have to work harder to make sure you're able to get the correct information and just use your good old common sense and don't let people push you into a corner and make decisions they're gonna that will alienate you to your family or to your friends or whatever because you're supposed to believe something and if you don't believe something that's not right or if you do believe something else you must be wrong that's not who we are Americans have always been able to rationalize and think things out and I've always said about West Virginia we can shake your hand look in your eyes and see your soul we've been able to tell if you're BS in this or not if you're telling us the truth or not and if you're really sincere about wanting to make things better and work with me not against me we've always been good at that that's that's intuitively inside of you so you're going to have to do better than what you're going to see on TV and what you're going to hear on social media and and basically decipher this yourself you have incredible pressures all of you do on people that from my generation didn't face I gave the last after right after cover I gave a speech to one of our colleges in in the state of West Virginia I didn't know what I was going to say because they had all been cloistered up you all missed a whole year or more we've never seen this in my lifetime to where how are you going to be able to conduct your life when it's been so disruptive for that year of the covet and then get back to normality that's going to take a lot of work and I had to apologize to them because I said My Generation has not done a good job we're not doing a good job of deciphering all this information coming at us you all can because that's all you've ever known you've been having a smartphone you've got computer you got access to more information than I ever could dream that would ever be possible or your parents or grandparents so give us a little bit of lead way there and help us through this to basically navigate the informational bombardment that you're getting every day the pressures that you have social media drugs incivility government being nasty thinking it's cold to be tough on people making their life miserable bullying people saying things as you shouldn't be saying these are things The Compassion that we have in our state has always been something and we've been able to help those who have had a hard time but uh now that making you believe it's okay to do what you want to do say what you want to say and make people's lives miserable that's not acceptable never has been never will be so let's make sure we stand up and fight for the right reason we're going to be better and we're going to stand up and we're going to fight for our country this is our country this is the United States of America not the divided States of America you can only bring it together if you want we've always faced terrible times before this country was born out of strife it has been bored if you've read your history books you know that when the Constitution was signed them they came out of the Constitutional Hall and they asked the Abra they asked um at that time Benjamin Franklin Mr Franklin what kind of a government do we have he says you have a republic a young man if you all can keep it and we're still in that experimental stage so you're going to have to fight hard a republic means this a republic means that basically the people on the government the type of form of government we have is a representative form which makes us a democracy so our democracy works on people representing who you desire and who you choose and who you vote for to represent your best interest and the Republic means you're all responsible so if you think of someone else responsible to take care of your government when you won't take care of it yourself it's no different in taking care of your home taking care of a car taking care of anything you might own no one's going to do it for you and if you want to create value you want to take care of it if you could care less about and you think someone else is going to do it then you're going to get what we're getting it's time for us to get back so we're working like the Dickens right now and by joining it and just having having the desire to know that there's an opportunity within Public Service in the military which we'll talk about today or going into public service our country needs you John Kennedy said in his 1960 inauguration speech to become president United States he says ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country I'm asking all of you what you can do for your country and by being there today listening and basically paying attention to what is going to be offered to you then you're doing and willing to do something for your country but you're really making yourself an absolutely unbelievable citizen for our country and a model for others to follow

this is about a pandemic where we are trying to compensate the states for the money that they spent on the pandemic and the revenue that they lost that's one thing that the president what they they've all just ignored the president said i'm not paying blue states all that stuff they haven't taken this seriously and what's sad about it is we could come to an agreement we need to come to an agreement but the you know this because you've been there they had in the cares act something they made everybody swallow a big 150 billion dollar tax giveaway to the wealthiest people in america and yet when we want to make good on a expanded benefit for those who are unemployed they say we can't afford that so coming into this negotiation from cares to heroes we said well let's get rid let's get rid of that net operating cost that 150 billion dollar at least it's probably it could be more a tax break for the rich and let's put an earned income tax credit for the poorest families in america for our poor children they're losing their jobs for no fault of their own their parents and we had an earned income tax credit which just until a few days ago we thought that they would respect but no they insist on having their net operating loss tax break for the wealthiest while they give zero to an earned income tax

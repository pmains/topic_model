thank you mr chairman um secretary buda judge thank you for your time today um on february 11 a federal court issued a preliminary injunction that prohibits 11 agencies including the department of transportation from using a metric known as the social cost of greenhouse gases that injunction also prohibits dmt staff from participating in the interagency working group established by president biden his administration is using figures to help justify its sweeping environmental agenda um has d.o.t fully stopped using this figure as required by the court so we are uh making sure to comply with with all court decisions and relevant laws we're still reviewing this injunction it certainly has the potential to impact a number of rule makings grant programs and other projects and so we're trying to work through that in a way that minimizes the disruption to our ability to get uh rules done and to get dollars out the door uh but uh but meets our uh our ability to uh of course uh respond in every legally appropriate way to to the meaning of the injunction um i'll be interested in receiving documentation demonstrating dot's compliance uh with uh portions of the injunction can i rely on you to help me get that information i would be happy to follow up with you on anything you need relative to our compliance great thank you so much now i want to switch to the issue of truck parking [Music] mr secretary one of the issues that i focused on during my time serving on this committee has been the lack of available truck parking it came up even as recently as last week i was in wyoming got right to from cheyenne to laramie on interstate 80 they closed the interstate right in front of me due to weather issues and here was a ribbon of highway with trucks lining both sides and very difficult for anybody not driving a truck to get off so you've got trucks idling for miles while during the hours that it took to reopen interstate 80. states have the ability to create truck parking capacity uh within the current formula programs but there's still a lack of capacity um how concerned is d.o.t over this issue very concerned and and i appreciate your raising this this is a very important issue and if you talk with any truck driver it is not only an issue of uh convenience it is an issue of safety and uh and i might add as you pointed out with the idling that goes on it's it's even an issue of of emissions uh let me mention absolutely right uh so i i share your enthusiasm for for addressing this i was just with a number of folks in the trucking industry the other day let me mention a few programs we think could be useful here the surface transportation block grant program national highway freight program the highway safety improvement program as we talked about this being a safety issue the national highway performance program and the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program but let me also mention that that i don't think it's unreasonable to look into whether the carbon reduction program and in some ways perhaps in certain locations uh a program a discretionary program that's for reducing truck idling at port facilities might be relevant here as well we're hearing this everywhere we go with truck drivers and i'd welcome an opportunity to work with you to make sure that the funding and the authorities available in the law are actually being used to alleviate that problem fabulous thank you i i would be delighted to work with you on that it's a big issue in my state especially on interstate 80 which crosses the entirety of southern wyoming now it's my understanding that the most recent jason's law report has been completed but not released to the public and can you explain uh what the delay is there jason's law was dealt with truck parking and a couple of highway bills ago and the report is apparently delayed let me run that down and try to get more up-to-date information for you on that that'll be great hey thank you so much and i'll reach out to you subsequently so i can make sure that wyoming's dot is accessing every possible program available to alleviate our truck parking issues on interstate 80. really appreciate your time today mr secretary thank you very much i yield back

so Madam President I rise today at a and deep frustration with the administration's treatment of federal workers during this government shutdown them the one thing I come back to this again but I wish I wish there was some indication that whether the president the vice president or any of his top advisors would actually go out and do a listening session with federal workers that doesn't seem to too much to ask I want them to look those Coast Guard spouses well this TSA employees or those air traffic controllers in the eye and say why are they being held hostage on an issue that frankly has nothing to do with their their work as public servants we're now on day 29 I call the president's shutdown the longest shutdown in US history in many ways we are creating the legacy of this administration a legacy that the president claimed in mid-december that he was proud to have initiated the shutdown that's plunging so many from Americans lives into chaos and more than 800,000 federal workers have missed a paycheck and that number I think Sen from Alaska alluded to and the senator from Virginia's alluded to is actually a fraction of the folks who are actually being affected that doesn't count that's just the 800 1000 federal workers it doesn't count the countless contractors I'm going to come back to that in a moment or the host of businesses the brewery and Kodiak they're not federal workers they're absolutely being effective and let's recognize even when we are ryokan those Coast Guard workers are paid back that brewery is never going to make back its lost revenue now the president has found time for oval office address he's found time for a trip to the border he's found time for a tit-for-tat with speaker Pelosi but what he's not found time for for that matter anybody else need in the White House to sit down with the federal workers who are being affected and I believe that as a national disgrace again I appreciate Madam President you and your colleagues listening you I know you have made you listen and we are continuing to work with other colleagues on both sides of the aisle to try to hopefully find some sense in this disaster but truth is people's time is running out over the last couple weeks Center Kane and I have heard from so many Virginia families who are suffering the burden from this shutdown and I wanted to share share some of those stories said it from Alaska me told about the story of 13 year old who couldn't cash of Christmas cheque at least for me I can't speak for Senator Kaine but the the most compelling story heartbreaking story and I'm going to tell a number but the one that I've kept coming back to is that said O'Kane and I had him with the press a series of federal workers tell their stories one of the federal workers didn't want to come and do it on camera but he came up and talked to senator Kaine and I afterwards he was a relatively young guy about 35 he was a veteran he was also an air traffic controller and a now gone four plus weeks without a paycheck his wife had served in the Air Force and an Intel capacity and suffering from pretty significant PTSD because he hadn't had a paycheck he couldn't pay the $90 co-payment for his wife to continue to see her psychiatrist and continue to pay for her drug treatment and not unlike the story the senator from Alaska told he said he has his wife taking care of their two kids four and five year olds and the four and five year old kids came to their parents and brought their piggy banks and said can we give you mom and dad what we got in our piggy banks to help our family this is the United States of America these are two veterans we say we honor their service this is somebody who is still going to work and working overtime without pay to keep our air safe they shouldn't be this shouldn't be the same time a few days earlier we've met with other workers a young father we met who works for the Department of Justice was unable to get his seven week daughter he brought his daughter to this session as when his daughter was born we want to make sure he could get his daughter on his federal insurance plan that's his right but the person who was consumed it the form to the insurance company had been furloughed went to the doctor and his infant daughter had an illness and had to get prescription he didn't have the money to pay for the prescription and his daughter wasn't registered on his insurance company not because of any fault he had made and he wasn't able to pay for the insurance now in this case thank God the insurance company actually worked with him and they brought extra proof and went through other help hoops and he was able to get the the medicine how many other young families are going through that same stress right now Eric a federal law enforcement agent and father of three wrote me an email this week and he said missing a paycheck had caused quote a tremendous amount of strain on his family this is a law enforcement officer now Eric said he had some money saved up in a rainy day fund but he went on to continue to tell me quote it 6th it's raining extremely hard right now in terms of that rainy day fund at some point I'm gonna have to make some tough decisions to ensure that our family has a roof over its head and a food on the table unfortunately a lot of the employees we've been talking to so canaanite don't have that rainy day fund one of the things I think we all knew maybe intellectually it all scenes the statistics that half of Americans couldn't afford an unexpected four hundred dollar bill without going into financial ruin we're seeing that play out right now again not because somebody has been miss managing their funds but because they expected if they worked for the United States of America and if they were willing to continue to do that work that they get paid we're into this crisis now 29 days and if we think we've seen the stuff hit the fan so far wait until this coming Thursday when families go through that second pay period we're adding insult to injury they get a paycheck that says zero or in one case of an air traffic controller a penny and at the end of this month as you get into the new month when all their bills come - yesterday I volunteered at a Food Bank in Arlington where federal contractors and furloughed workers were coming because their families were running out of money these were folks couple of them came up to me and said listen I'm kind of viewed myself always his middle-class I've been working for the federal government for you know double-digit years they felt an enormous amount of kind of almost shame to come to the food bank now shouldn't feel shame to come to a food bank but but their appeal was get the government reopened now the president who's never worked for a paycheck in his life says he can relate he says he's sure that quote the federal workers will make adjustments very same president who has not had the common decency to sit down with any federal workers and listen to their stories here's what some of those adjustments look like Lisa and Arlington wrote me an email says quote on forced to look for multiple part-time jobs to make ends meet and my savings will soon run out creditors and landlords have only so much patience with us another worker Center Kane and I met on Thursday broke down and crying when she said how hard it was for her to send her infant child away up to week to ten days because her mom who'd been taking care of that child had to go up and deal with him her own personal business and she couldn't afford day care how disparity and disheartening and the shares already pointed out in terms of recruitment and retention to say to those who are actually trying to serve others too now suddenly see their livelihoods and jeopardy through no fault of their own the truth is the shutdown is having a devastating effect not only on the short-term morale but the long-term morale of all our federal workforce the fact is since we've already agreed to pay them when we reopen why shouldn't we at least go ahead and even if we are shutdown pay these federal workers come Thursday so they don't have to incur additional pain and suffering because the truth is and I come in so many of us and particularly my friend the center of Virginia along with Senator Cardin led the effort that we're giving federal workers back pay when we reopen but back pay alone doesn't make up for the hurt if you've had to draw down from your IRA and have a tax penalty it doesn't make you whole if you've taken it advance against your credit card and you've got to pay those fees on paying those those dollars back it doesn't make you whole as again the presiding officer indicated if you get dinged on your credit rating or if you're in the process and trying to get a security clearance and that security clearance is withheld because it appears you've got bad credit not because you did anything wrong but because the Congress and the president can't agree on how to pay you when you're still asked to do your job now the number of federal employees current federal employees who are eligible for retirement supposed to be about 30 percent over the next few years how many of those federal employees who we've trained and work with who bring enormous expertise are not going to wait until they have to retire but actually say I'm gonna get out of this job now and the last thing we need to do is further undermine the competitiveness of our federal workforce now heard the other day and this is again you've made this point Senator McCain has made this point it's not just the federal employees federal contractors heard from one federal contractor from Ashburn who says the shutdown quote has wrought the financial stability of my family seeing in the galley we've probably got a few more tourists and we might normally have on a Saturday because the Smithsonian shut down I heard from someone who's in the leadership so nyan who was begging me saying those folks who work at the Smithsonian one level they make it reimbursed but all the folks who pick up the trash clean the bathrooms serve the cafeteria food are all contractors they're not direct employees of the federal workforce so even when we reopen even when the federal workforce gets reimbursed they are out so one of the things I would hope next I can and I have been working on this and I'm gonna hope that the chair will look at this and I hope some of our other colleagues who want to work towards the solution will work this in all the previous shutdowns we've never it's complicated we've never found a way to reimburse contractors we have a piece of legislation may not be perfect but it says for those workers who make less than 50 grand we ought to find a way to make sure they get reimbursed and then for those above some small percentage in if not these folks will never be made whole you can't think about some of the tourists normally there's a whole lot of food trucks surrounding the Smithsonian and elsewhere around downtown you've heard from a number of those folks as well they can't continue because if the Smithsonian is open aren't open the tourists aren't coming and if you've taken out a loan to buy a food truck to try to employ a few folks once that business is shut down once your loan is pulled once you lose that truck even when we come to a solution set they can't reopen so I do hope that we will take a look again I know it's unprecedented we've not looked at federal contractors in the past but at least for the folks in low and moderate-income who cannot make back the 29 days of pay and Lord knows we listen to the president says he doesn't mind if it's weeks months or even years that we find a way to somehow make them whole we've also seen small businesses we have disproportionately in Virginia a lot of small contractor business small business owner contractor in Arlington wrote me and said again quote my disabled veteran-owned small business will have to shut its door after serving the federal government for the last two decades I'm gonna have to put seventy two families seventy two families out of work because our reserves aren't big enough to support the payroll expenses of 35,000 to 40,000 per day during this political impasse doesn't take a lot of math to figure out that if you're at roughly 30 days you're talking about over a million dollars in payroll that this small business veteran owned small business can't meet they reopen no guarantee this business comes back and it's not just the small businesses who actually serve the government it is the brewery and Kodiak it's the restaurant around the battlefields around Richmond around Center Cain's home some of the campgrounds its surrounding the Shenandoah National Park in our Commonwealth I mean I think there may be a number of our colleagues who maybe don't have the same concentration that Alaska or Virginia or Maine has but if this they think this problem hasn't gotten isn't spreading like a plague it will come to their still states as well and why do we have to put all these families in our economy through this kind of turmoil so Kane and I have worked really hard recently and again those of us who live in the capital Capital Area you know Metro it's an important way that we commute metros had its share of problems the last couple years and actually in a good news story Virginia DC and Maryland came together turn it up some more resources can so Metro could make some of the improvements and safety improvements and operating improvements to try to improve quality service for the federal workforce for tourists in our nation's capital every day every weekday the federal government is shut down Metro loses four hundred thousand dollars in lost fares per day natural can't get a break and where's that money going to re material I swear I'm not sure we're going to appropriate millions of additional dollars now at one point oh and amongst this debate we've had two baits before but if there's ever been one that that the American public's got a right to be frustrated with in terms of a shutdown the historically longest shutdown it president says he wants money for a border well a border wall that he promised the American people was going to be paid for by Mexico border wall that says before he'll reopen government give him five billion I think it's up to almost five point nine billions there's some rent arguments now it's up to seven or eight billion and the truth is let me be clear the president is White House allies are listening this senator is willing to look at any reasonable investment in additional border security but it ought to be done in a way where we're not holding these hundreds of thousands of families and literally indirectly millions of Americans hostage rule number 101 of hostage taking is you don't not negotiate with a hostage taker you don't reward a bully and as I think some of my colleagues on the other side of at least acknowledge privately if we allow this tactic to work today it will be back and be reused in April when we've got the government the debt ceiling it will be reused at the end of the fiscal year when the next year's appropriations are due one of the things again I hope people a goodwill will also try to see if we can commit to is that we put enough of a poison pill in place that this tactic can never ever be used again by any Congress or any president without inflicting some damage frankly on the legislative branch in the office of the White House that's part of the remarkable thing our offices and I say to the good folks who work for us in Congress they're not feeling any of the pain the White House staff they're not feeling any of the pain I do wonder as the president starts to select all of these aside based upon who can lobby in the mouth about who's going to come back and which gets reopened and frankly I'm more than a little disappointed that while it's important that mortgages get processed that he's decided to bring back certain folks to process mortgages certain folks in the Agriculture Department to process farmers loans they suddenly mysteriously found some money in the State Department to reopen part of the State Department love to see that same priority for the folks who processed food stamps I wonder what kind of federal buildings are going to go into where the toilets aren't cleaned and trash isn't up isn't taken out and the food services aren't provided but I say to the White House we will negotiate we will work through this process we even said those of us and I know the chairs been part of this effort we'll put it through regular order we'll consider his proposal in a reasonable way but let's do it with the government open people getting paid now in conclusion I want to thank my when Center came from Virginia because I know it's a knowledge also as somebody that actually lives only 20 minutes away in Virginia do a little bit easier for me than being a senator from Alaska or senator from host of other places around the country but I think it is proper and right that we are here today hi Megan is proper and right and I will be back this coming week to try to continue to raise this for us when we heard when you heard from some federal workers that Congress was taking a break from another ten days when they are supposed to be receiving another pay period and they may get goose eggs and they've got the beginning of February looming with their month where their rents and mortgages and tuition bills are due I think it is appropriate I thank him for forcing us to be back here and continue to raise these reasons last one I want to make is that I think we owe a huge debt to our federal workers federal workers TSA air traffic controllers or the Coast Guard for that matter that folks have processed food stamps or lady we saw who supposed to investigate chemical spills whose desperate to get to Houston where there's been a spill 10 days ago that they still haven't been able to investigate because without pay whether you're furloughed or in many cases being asked to work overtime without pay they're still showing up where they're being asked to commute to work some from a distance and has been mentioned by the presiding officer put a bill on a credit card that's got your name on it in your credit credit rating at risk whether you're a prison guard and you've got a commuter an hour and a half in your car and you may not have money for gas but you're still finding a way to show up for work because I ain't wonder if somebody worked longer in the private sector than I have it in the public sector how many folks who work in the private sector you work for Facebook or Google if you worked for Ford Northrop Grumman will continue to show up week after week after week without pay how many folks in the private sector would show up and work overtime without pay and still perform you know in a moment kind of straight at the the press pool that was with me yesterday at the Arlington Food Bank ask all the press folks and the cameras were off how many of them would show up tomorrow if they'd gone for four or five weeks with no end in sight without any payment the press was supposed to cover this there wasn't a single reporter or camera person it didn't at least acknowledged me I wish we'd had it all on tape that note they wouldn't be showing up in their jobs so I hope whether it's those of us as policymakers or candidly visitors and the gallery sometimes easy to and there's been politicians who make it making made a career out of trash and federal employees I think it's wrong and it gets disgraceful I think now more than ever we owe them a debt of gratitude and I know that there are at least reports of people that airports and others saying thank you or trying to slip somebody you know food or something else the remarkable thing is because of our rules that in conventional times are appropriate we can't even in many cases give additional compensation to these federal workers but we can owe my personal thanks and my hope would be a commitment from folks on both sides the aisle that will think twice before we come down to just the floor of this Senate and berate and degrade federal worker going forward I would hope on a going-forward basis when we get the government reopened we can find a bipartisan way to actually make sure what this Senate passed in terms of a relatively meager 1.9 percent federal pay raise increase for this year that we would override this administration's spiteful executive order trying to take away that pay raise because if not if not maybe not next week but the next time this happens you know I don't know if those TSA workers will show up I don't know if those air traffic controllers will keep working I don't know if those Coast Guard employees will still sign up for service there's places remote as kodiak alaska but we have within our power to end this if the president united states will not end this we have a bill that is at the desk that 96 of us agreed upon in mid-december when there wasn't this crisis now when we hear these stories when we hear this pain if the president won't act then the Senate must act and put that legislation on the President's desk and let him choose to not simply postulate but then make a decision worthy he'd sign or veto it I thank the presiding officer I know that she and others will be back a part of the burden of the majority is showing up in that presiding space and we as the Virginia senators disproportionately had that opportunity during these kind of circumstances but I hope your stories from the senator from Virginia stories I know the senator from Maine stories as well there are other colleagues that the White House are listening and that we can find that common agreement to get this government reopened and demonstrate to the workers the contractors and the folks who dependent on this that we value their service and never ever again will they have to be put through this kind of tragedy but that Madam President

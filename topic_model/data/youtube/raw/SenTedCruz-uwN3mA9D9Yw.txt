Thank You senator Cruz Thank You mr. chairman gentlemen thank you for your testimony earlier this year I raised concerns about huawei's infiltration of the five eyes intelligence networks and I raised them with secretary Pompeo who replied warning that the network of the five eye partners could be vulnerable and could affect joint mobilization efforts if Huawei hardware and Technology was present as you know in 2012 the house permanent Select Committee on Intelligence warned that mitigating risk from Huawei ZTE is quote virtually impossible unfortunately last month Britain announced that it would allow Huawei to access non core parts of its 5g network ambassador Strayer can you assess how Britain's decision impacts five eyes we're we're quite concerned that Britain would make that decision in the end they say they have not made a final decision but as what is leaked out there and in other parts of the world is there's some ability to just have Huawei present in the radio access network which is the part that's closest to the consumer if you were able to disrupt that or to conduct espionage there you have a significant number of other concerns so you could stop the ability for critical infrastructure to operate or to interfere with the ability for people to be called up for their troop mobilization so it's just as dangerous in the remote parts of network as in the core and is at least possible that huawei's presence and in non core 5g networks could enable it to directly or indirectly access more sensitive nodes and their telecom network absolutely that's the difference between 4G and 5g is that 5g is going to more seamlessly integrate the core in the edge so if you have a privilege at the edge you're probably going to be able to access the core functions as well and what are we doing to ensure that our other intelligence partners don't follow Britain's decision I hope you're right that that decision is not final and they reverse it but what are we doing to ensure that that others don't don't follow that so we've got this ongoing diplomatic campaign around the world very active in particularly with the 5i so we've got our we got Australia last August that said that they will not allow a vendor that is under the potential extrajudicial control of a foreign power so that would prevent Huawei because of the system in China we've had a positive decision out of New Zealand and we're continuing to monitor and talk very closely with Canada and the United Kingdom about the future of their and their decisions about the 5g network we've also had a great deal of success in Japan recently as well on this point mr. Krebs another concern that we hear quite a bit about is China and Chinese companies seeking to exert pressure within standard-setting organizations so that those organizations promulgate standards favorable to Chinese national interests can you tell us to what extent is this taking place and what what risk does it pose so I'm not sure I'm the right person to answer this authority really but you know I think based on my understanding the way the standards process works they are flooding the zone so to speak they're putting a significant amount of resources in they're not just you know Chinese companies coming out of China but other companies out of other countries but essentially what they're trying to do is set the playing field to continue this horrible analogy trying to set the playing field to their advantage so that their technology their standard they're already deploying within China they have a standard develop they want the global standard to follow their standard so that's what they are trying to set up for and what can we do to prevent that from happening I it's engage work with our partners we talked about that a little bit earlier continue to invest in the standards process again I have my own personnel that participate in 3gpp we just need to continue it as NIST does a fantastic job a lot of our American come companies between AT&T Qualcomm and others they have engaged we are holding I think we're holding the line but we can't let up we have to continue pushing forward another concern Huawei has research partnerships with with several US universities and and the Communist Party of China uses research ventures and talent programs and exchange programs to steal and a transfer sensitive information since your testimony last year have you seen a deeper awareness among American universities about about this threat of espionage yes sir part of chairman burrow and ranking member Warner have hosted a number of meetings under the the sissie authorities brought together a range of stakeholders both technology but also academia we briefed two different groups of presidents and chancellors and boards of Regents and others of America's universities I've had following conversations with a number of universities on some of their issues as a result I think you've seen particularly from DOJ and FBI is engagement particularly with Confucius Institutes and other tactics that the Chinese state is using there has been a shift you know we're taught I've talked about how industry is shifting the our colleges and universities of shifting I have shifted as well so I'll just the general risk awareness of network security and one final question should the consider that should the granting of student visas consider the threat that that undergrads or graduate student or postdoc students particularly from Communist China should it could consider the threat of espionage north wars theft of intellectual property it should in to a certain extent it does but you have to keep in mind that on an eighteen-year-old coming out of mainland China doesn't necessarily have a file in the intelligence community all that clearly in the second pieces they're not necessarily operationalized at that point what happens is down the road the phone call comes and you know here I'm sitting with your your family they say hello by the way when you come home next week why don't you bring home a thumbdrive or two with some of your research it's that's how the process works thank you

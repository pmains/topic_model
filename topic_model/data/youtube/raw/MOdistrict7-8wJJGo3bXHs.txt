Thank You mr. chairman and ranking member of Royal roybal-allard has that how you pronounce it and members of the subcommittee thank you for allowing me to come before you today to speak on the importance of h-2b seasonal worker visa program many of us in this room represent districts with various small and seasonal businesses that are struggling to find local workers to fill seasonal temporary jobs many of these businesses depend on seasonal workers through the h-2b visa program relief for these seasonal businesses is urgently needed and cannot wait I'm here today to ask for your support to include key h-2b visa program provisions in the Department of Homeland Security appropriations fiscal year 2019 proposal h-2b visas the h-2b excuse me the h-2b program is essential to employers who cannot find workers to fill temporary jobs and seafood processing horse training hospitality amusement parks forestry landscaping circuses carnivals and many other seasonal industries it's important to point out that these workers are not immigrants they provide an opportunity for businesses to operate at a greater capacity retain their full-time workers and contribute to the local economies h-2b program sustains American jobs in fact h-2b visas issued support 4.6 American jobs on average unfortunately the program's annual 66,000 visa cap 33 for each half of the fiscal year is not adequate to meet the demands of the growing economy in fact the cap for seasonal half of fiscal year 2018 was reached February 27 2018 leaving many seasonal employers excluded from the program with no access to legal seasonal Labor's leading to potential reductions in operating hours and closures without action it is inevitable inevitable that the h-2b visa cap will be reached early in fiscal year 2019 an increase in the h-2b visa allotment from the existing 66,000 visas would certainly be a big step in the right direction often the cap has reached literally within days of when work petition applications are accepted the program has essentially become a lottery is man for visas is far greater than what is issued I understand firsthand the importance of this program is there a seventh congressional district which I represent is a tourism hotspot I am proud to represent such entertainment centers as Branson Missouri a small town of just over 11,000 people taking an eight and a half million visitors every year I'd like to point out that a lot of those residents are retirees and you've seen the ad on TV I'm 85 and I want to go home people that have to work until they're 85 and there's not a lot of people retired in Branson that could take these jobs that need to be filled the deficiency in finding available employees in Branson affects everything from hotels to restaurants to theme parks to landscaping businesses these are employee employers that have tried for years to fill the need for employees with locals and have been unable to do it the HDTV program provides Branson Community and many other destinations destination cities across the country the ability to find employees so they can provide their services to the public these seasonal destinations are very much there the excuse me these seasonal destinations are very much dependent on such a program for the Commerce in the area to effectively function simply put there are just two not enough able individuals to fill these job openings it doesn't take a PhD from MIT to figure out that in a town like Jackson Wyoming at ten thousand people are Branson Missouri of eleven thousand people these tourist areas that bring in millions of tourists every year that you're not going to have the local population if everyone there wanted to work three shifts three times you wouldn't have the number so I plead with you to please look at increasing this 66,000 cap again I appreciate the committee's continued willingness to listen to the views of members like myself I know the Appropriations Committee will face tough decisions on priorities for fiscal year 2019 for this reason I should respect fully ask for you to support for your support to include key h-2b visa program provisions in the Department of Homeland Security appropriations fiscal year 2019 proposed

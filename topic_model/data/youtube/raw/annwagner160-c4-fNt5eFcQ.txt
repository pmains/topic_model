thank you uh mr. chairman over here two weeks ago President Trump ended some Salome knees brutal reign of terror that killed and maimed countless Americans and coalition forces and threatened many many more to come I urge all Americans to unite behind the president's defensive decision to strike one of the world's most powerful terrorists who was organizing against organizing attacks against Americans in Iraq in defiance I might add of UN Security Council resolution 2231 Genevan been in Iraq should've been in Beirut should have been in Damascus for far too long Tehran has been permitted to act with impunity against US allies interests and its personnel I applaud the president for making our red lines clear clear to the Iranian regime that attacking Americans is never acceptable and when American lives hang in the balance Iran will be held to account for its actions the Middle East is a safer place when the United States is clear and consistent in its intentions mr. Hadley to what degree are Iran's proxies dependent on Tehran for financial material and technical assistance and how successful has the United States been in preventing Iran from providing significant support to these proxy groups I'm not privy to intelligence anymore and haven't been for a long time on these subjects my understanding is that the economic pressure that Iran is now under has resulted in some diminishment of the resources that available to these group I think fairly for example Nezzer Allah who's helped head of Hezbollah has actually complained that he doesn't have enough resources for his activity so I think it is having effect based on what I've read in public sources but I I don't have the kind of intelligence sources available to me that would allow me to give you a better answer to that question well I thank you they've clearly gone through the hundred and fifty billion plus dollars that were sent over by the Obama administration strapped to pallets to be used for these proxies to kill people around the globe including our American allies and assets after the Iranian regime admitted that it shot down Ukrainian International Airlines flight 752 tragically killing 176 passengers and I know it's been discussed here at length protests did erupted across the country mr. Hadley how are these protests connected do you think to the pro-democracy pro reform demonstrations of the last few years and do you think that this public outrage will constrain Iran's foreign policy can it be constrained it's been interesting to see how many demonstrations there have been in the last two years of people demanding accountability for their from their governments ending of corruption less sectarianism governments that actually perform you've seen it in Algeria you've seen it in Sudan you've seen in Lebanon seen in Iraq you've seen in Iran a lot of other places the Middle East this is a positive thing and I think it is one of the sources of leverage on the Iranian regime that may make them willing to come to the table and negotiate an outcome because they put down the demonstrations in October in November only by a fairly brutal use of force and I think they are worried that the additional sanctions will Kindle a return to those kinds of demonstrations that could threaten the regime and is a threat to the regime as Richard Oz said that might bring them to the table I absolutely agree and that's why I also share your bullishness on the opportunity that we have at this moment of time to bring Iran to the table for further negotiations more now than ever and these protests and the public outrage I think could really have an effect as we go forward in foreign policy and in and such so there are reports that indicate that Iran has worked to reduce Internet connectivity near universities hotspots limiting the impact of these protests how vulnerable is a regime to information operations and how should the u.s. be using information to target the regime's weaknesses and empower this change mr. hatten well they have cut off the internet to keep demonstrators from organizing as a part of their suppression of public demonstrations clearly you know our best information operation has always been truth and trying to get it to the people in these closed societies because it what is really the the toxic element for them is actually truth about what's happening in the world and I think we have not done as good a job as we should in in getting truth available to people in these totalitarian or authoritarian societies I agree my time has expired I shall yield back but here is to truth and the Iranian people

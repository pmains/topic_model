joining us now to continue that conversation Texas Democratic congressman mark BZ congressman thank you so much for being with us I want to start with what Ilyn omar said when she returned back home to Minnesota last night let's play a clip of that Rick I know there are a lot of people that are trying to distract us now but I want you all to know that we are not going to let them I'm going to continue to do the work on behalf of the fifth because you all send me to Washington to do the important work of progressing our country so congressman she started to focus on the important work that was necessary on health care on minimum wage what should your fellow Democrats be doing should they stay on this messaging and defend her or should they take her lead and move on and focus on the topics obviously any time the president says something racist we're going to defend whomever he attacks as we should but representative Omar is absolutely correct I mean we need to remain focused we passed the minimum wage bill yesterday very proud about that it had been a long time since the bill had been increased I mean it's amazing for me to think about when I was sacking groceries in Fort Worth Texas that and at 3:35 an hour and that the minimum wage is only at like it's seven something an hour now that's just absolutely unacceptable it's ridiculous we have passed ten pieces of legislation in the house since the Democrats have been in the majority that would help consumers lower health care costs help consumers lower prescription drug costs in this country Mitch McConnell and Republicans are absolutely doing nothing they're sitting on their hands they need to pass that stuff they'd rather defend the president making racist comments than to actually do something to help the American people with prescription drug prices and if this court in Texas this appeals court decides that they're going to take insurance away from people with pre-existing conditions that would be an absolute catastrophe we need to get to work we need to stay focused and I really want to think about my colleague representative Omar for really putting it back on the focus that it needs to be and while the American people are certainly impacted by the things that you mentioned this is still under the cloud of these comments this working on social media people are reacting because they feel strongly about what the president said one way or another take a listen to what the constituents said back in Minnesota when congresswoman Olano Maher returned take a listen what do you think about despicable and horrifying and yeah it's it's at how commonplace things like that are now with this administration I think it's really sad that we have somebody like Trump in the White House as a racist it's clear to me and to a lot of people and a lot of voters that he is a racist and he's just got a message of hate and we're not about that here it's hard to be surprised it's easy to be disgusted it's it's really easy to be disgusted at the it consistent like Islamophobic racist sexist attacks from this president against I get strong powerful women of color in general but against Ohio in particular so these voters are saying they are disgusted and as we heard from NBC's Jonathan Allen the president is making race whether it's spoken or unspoken or central his strategy does that mean that you all as Democrats are now going to have to make it a central part of yours and combating that type of rhetoric let me tell you something I want to be a hundred percent clear particularly to some of the listeners some of the viewers out there that may not understand why this hits home I can remember when I was from in fourth grade going to fifth grade and my aunt moved out of the neighborhood that we had lived in which was all-black neighborhood moved across the boulevard and in an apartment complex and we were at the park in this very affluent white neighborhood single-family houses over there very affluent and we were playing and the car pulls up and tried to scare me and my cousin out of the park in word go home go back this is a park for white people and these were people that were old enough to drive that was scaring kids that were in elementary school and that is something that I will never forget and outside of being called the n-word the worst thing that someone could say to you was something like you know go back and the president needs to talk to people at rallies and explain that to them that they shouldn't use language like that instead of encouraging them to do that and so my position is that whenever something like that comes up we have to that the Democratic Party has to be the leader and showing the rest the country that this is not the way that we communicate with one another we can have disagreements about race we can have disagreements about a lot of things that are that that tend to be divisive in this country but using things like that that are clearly racist just has no place in the discourse and he needs to stand up and be a leader he has failed in his leadership and his presidency like there have been some historians saying that he's going to be considered the most racist president since President Johnson he needs to take that seriously and he needs to stand up well it's important to know that the President does say that he disavowed that chant when he was at the rally of course he stood there for about 13 seconds and allowed the chanters to continue but when a sad day later he said this is not something or but even though that echoed echoed one of his tweets what do you make of the general silence on the other side of the aisle from a lot of senior Republican officials I'm not surprised I mean they're mimicking you know the constituents that they represent in many ways and whenever something on race comes up they just want to pretend like it's not that big of a deal or it's not racist you're turning it into something racist and I think that their that they are scared that they do not have the intestinal fortitude to say this is the wrong thing especially when it comes to matters of race and it's like that back at home it's always been that way back in Texas when I was growing up still is that way today and I'm not surprised that they do not want to step out and say hey guys this is not the right thing and I don't think that they're going to do it anytime soon they just simply they don't they don't have the courage to do so which is interesting because the story that you share is a story that's familiar to a lot of people of color a lot of people even who aren't of color but who have felt other dinh some capacity of cynical entry and it's the impact right and sometimes it's the word the sting of those words but it's also the feeling it leaves you with and this conversation this tweeting storm and the attacks we've seen this week has also created an interesting question about what it means to be an ally what should those Republican leaders be saying when they're looking at the the leader of their own party what should they be modeling when it comes to speaking out I think that those Republican leaders should look at Lyndon Baines Johnson for instance you know go back into history he knew that making sure that people could sit in classrooms together regardless of race he knew that was not going to be popular particularly in the south they knew that that opening up fountains at drugstores and and people being able to eat next to one another share the same restrooms that that absolutely was not going to be popular and he even predicted that there were going to be political consequences to pay but he still stepped up and did the right thing and show true leadership to move the country forward I think that now look ins that really want to move their party forward which would be the best thing for the country now is the time to step up and say hey enough is enough while the world is why

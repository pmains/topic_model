president Trump signed the u.s. MCA into law yesterday however Speaker Pelosi wants to take some of the credit for the deal roll tape but the president will be signing is quite different from what the president sent us at because of the work of our chairman of our Ways and Means Committee and the work of organized labor the afl-cio and Richard Trumka we will to make vast improvements if we weren't we would not have been able to pass the bill okay so she said she made her team and made vast improvements to the deal calls from Lance Gooden Republican from Texas joins us now how much credit does Speaker Pelosi deserve a u.s. MCA you she deserves all the credit for holding this thing up for 14 months after the president negotiated this she and Democrats held this up for 14 months and that's what she gets credit for and you know it's it's so ridiculous to see them now whine that they weren't invited to the White House for a signing party these are their priorities if they'd have been invited they wouldn't have gone there there's always something with the Democrats that are running this house but Nancy Pelosi has held this agreement up and waited until the last possible minute when vulnerable Democrats in swing districts said we've got to get this passed we have to deliver something all we've done is impeachment so I know you're in Congress are you in the House of Representatives but I won't comment on impeachment which of course is now going through the Senate it looks to me like some of the wavering senators wavering on whether they should produce witnesses or not more witnesses some of them are now something to say well no we don't need witnesses and I actually see a couple of Democrats saying the same thing we don't need witnesses what I'm trying to wrap this up and say look this thing could be over with a final vote tomorrow you know it's stunning outside of this building that I'm standing in right now people are talking about impeachment but in this building no one's talking about it because it's a foregone conclusion everyone now knows how it's going to end you've got a few senators that are enjoying the spotlight Mitt Romney is enjoying a little bit of the press he's getting about whether he's gonna vote for this or vote for that but we're seeing things happen like yesterday Susan Collins said if there was ribery why didn't you all charge him on it in the house and Adam Schiff didn't answer the question and she said you didn't answer my question and these are things that senators are realizing Dianne Feinstein I believe came out earlier this week saying she might even vote to acquit the president because they realized this is not a winner the only people that are even paying attention to this are folks out of Washington when you walk through the halls of the Capitol people have already written this whole process off real fast in in Texas your state to other people care more about getting rid of the President and impeachment or us MCA the u.s. MCA and moving past this people that I represent care more about getting the president re-elected I think there's a lot of anger that calm about this impeachment process we're angry here on the Republican side in the US House but behind closed doors I'll tell you a secret we're rejoicing because we know that this is a winner for us politically we know we're going to take back the majority because Democrats have mismanaged this and the American people are sick of it and we know that that will result in wins next November for Republicans I would expect the President to harp on that very theme anger at people trying to throw him out when he appears ranked today today in Michigan which is going to be heavily favored because of us MCA and I don't work where the farmers are going to do very well from us MCA I think the president is going to talk about that tonight he you think he is winning for the American people and Democrats hate it and when he wins and it's something like us MCA where they have had to acquiesce and just finally give in after 14 months they finally said fine we'll let you have your agreement they've got to think of ridiculous things to try to dilute his win like saying well it wouldn't have passed without us well let's just assume for a second that everything Nancy Pelosi said is true why did it take 14 months this is just ridiculousness the people across America I believe are seeing through this and I think the president is on great terms with the American people and he's going to cruise to re-election because of all this mess in Washington only time will tell Collison lamps Gooden thanks for being with you was appreciate it

losing my papers and now to turn to some questions I think we can all agree the news from the Middle East whether positive negative whatever you view it has been relatively endless we've probably all seen what happened in Syria this weekend among over the past few years if you follow the news about the Middle East in the United States at all it was hard to miss the Saudi crown prince's two-plus week visit to the United States and now in Europe we're seeing relations between Israel and Jordan and Israel and Egypt closer than ever before but in the meantime a lack of nearly any progress between Israelis and Palestinians within Israel and Palestinian territories so it's asked the first question what to our panelists and I'd like to start with in the dove and then anyone else is welcome to chime in what is the outlook from within Israel in your opinion and in particular visa Vee relations with Israel's neighbors and what's changed are there any reasons from optimist for optimism thank you it's very I'm very happy to be here both J Street and me team are two organizations that are very dear to my heart and both of them represent a new fresh voice that is so needed so I'm happy to be part of this I'm a little nervous because the Celtics are going to play at one o'clock and it's the first playoff game but I'll try to keep my mind here of course as someone who worked for Shimon Peres everything for me is an opportunity but I actually think that if even if you put that aside the strategic change in the Arab world you know outlook towards Israel is a huge opportunity that is kind of missed sometimes from the Israeli perspective if you think where the Arab world was after the 67 war with the three knows of the sort of Tomb summit no to Israel no to negotiation no to recognition and now we have an Arab Peace Initiative on the table for so long which actually says you know just solve this problem with the Palestinians and we will normalize relations because we have other issues to deal with unfortunately in Israel you know the common wisdom is to look at every development from the worst-case scenario so the people thought okay what was the trap what was the you know little language that nobody that is going to put Israel on the defensive the challenge with this opportunity is that that those who see the israeli-palestinian conflict on not in terms of win-win but in terms of zero-sum think that they could use this you know better relations and alliance of interests between Israel and the Arab world as a way to bypass the Palestinian issue and this is not gonna happen not only because you know the streets definitely after the Arab Spring the street is not going to let any Arab leaders put the Palestinian issue aside but I think it's also goes against the Israeli interest because we with all the issues around us the most existential issue is the Palestinian one because that is the only issue that actually is a threat to the identity of Israel as a home and for the Jewish people and the democracy and that is why we have to do whatever we can to use this new outlook in the Arab world and I think that I'm hoping that the whatever the Trump ultimate proposal that we're all waiting to will do that I have some concerns that maybe certain people are trying to actually create a rift between the Palestinians and the more pro-american I don't want to say moderate but pro-american Sunni countries in order to say again the Palestinians never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity here the Egyptian the Saudis are for the the the deal and the Palestinians are not I hope that it will be a proposal that that the Palestinians and their Arabic countries could support and and when you see the language of the Arab Peace Initiative you see that it's very much in line with the interest of everybody who wants to support the two-state solution and I hope that the Trump bill will respect those parameters that are very much a consensus for everybody who wants to achieve peace in the Middle East thank you EEMA rod would you like to anything I will relate to to the change of the easily discourse regarding the regional issues because we see how the Israeli society is moving in its perception of regional affairs when the Arab Spring began the dominant discourse in Israel was an a very negative framing of regional events presenting the for democracy forces in the Middle East as ones who will be leading eventually to major security threats for isn't taking shape and over the last few years we see the Israeli disco changing for very threat focused one to one it is giving more and more space to opportunities like Nadav mentioned but the problem is that the opportunities that are being viewed are not necessarily the ones that are actually there and the path towards their fulfillment or sometimes different the world public perceives and I will elaborate very shortly on that because Israelis are now less looking into the hopes for normal ties with the Arab world and civilian issues like we saw in the 90s and then settling for quite much less than that and I'm quite happy if there are security coordination behind the scenes with some major Arab countries against Iran that's it and by doing that they are missing the the big potential that lies in relations between Israel and the Arab world when economic issues in civilian issues in diplomatic issues and mostly on the israeli-palestinian issue because these are in Saudi Arabia should not cooperate against Iran as the first priority they should cooperate about bringing peace between Israelis and Palestinians I ask you to elaborate on one piece of that do you have have you seen what is the reason for that among Israeli public opinion so first of all our prime minister is doing from his point of view a very effective a job since 2014 in advocating this flip of sequence there are a Peace Initiative it has been in place for on now more than 15 years says very clearly normal ties between either in the Arab world is possible but for that to happen the conflict should be resolved first and the Prime Minister and his ministers are talking about changing the sequence meaning ezel can first have good relations with the Arab world and then maybe later move forward with the Palestinians this say doesn't resonate with most of the leadership and I think that that White's flawed although it gains more and more traction within the Israeli public opinion even within left-wing voters thank you I think to further this conversation a question that Daniel if you can start out with so given that this is where the Israeli public discourse is we also hear a lot about Israel from from international is from policy makers from in the media that Israel and the Sunni Arab Gulf stage should be looking to cooperate visa vie Iran and if anytime there's an opportunity this is one I'd be interested in your views on that and if not Iran what what other opportunities or lack thereof do you see in the region right now for further cooperation yeah I think that Nadav and they would have made if I can extract from both your comments a core point that I think is important and absolutely against the grain of where Israel's leadership is as you've both noted which is that the premise was you get the Arab states on board that creates added incentives for Israel to make a peace deal with the Palestinians it helps market that deal they're more reliable than the unreliable Palestinians and it helps give backing to whatever concessions the Palestinians might need to make the Arab Peace Initiative as has been mentioned 15 years old Israel didn't take yes for an answer it got yes for an answer and was not interested which means the entire premise of that is irrelevant under a Netanyahu government who has no intention of going towards peace not annyeong who has made an attempt at an end run around that on the premise that you just mentioned Rachael peace without the Palestinians with the Arab world or I think more accurately I would describe it as peace with as many Arab states as possible against the Palestinians and my expectation is whatever the Trump administration comes up with if it comes up with anything will be an attempt to impose a diktat on the Palestinians trying to leverage certain Gulf states and perhaps one of Israel's immediate neighbors with whom it has peace in pushing the Palestinians to accept something that won't meet the minimum threshold the premise is you can get on board with this because we Israel and use some of the Gulf states some of the out States especially in the Gulf share this bigger challenge which is Iran now I think that is a misreading of the biggest most existential most consequential issue that Israel has to deal with which is what Nadab said fascinatingly it's what in an interview in the Israeli press a couple of weeks ago during the hug in the former heads of the Mossad kind of came together on which is Israel stands or fails on what happens between the State of Israel and the six plus million Palestinians who are either second-class citizens of Israel directly occupied by Israel in the West Bank part of a reconfigured occupation in Gaza in the twilight zone of Jerusalem or in the Palestinian diaspora and neighboring countries so the attempt is to say no that's not the priority the priority is somewhere else and on that basis we can work together I think we're still in the moment where the Israeli government is testing how far it can go with that how far can it push the envelope and I think from the perspective of a government that wants to have better relations without doing anything constructive on the Palestinian front the signs so are are somewhat encouraging especially when you have a trump administration buy-in to this notion and so I think for Netanyahu the question is how far can we test this how far can we go with Saudi Arabia with the UAE with others what matters most to me and I think they will be able to get a certain distance I no longer am fully convinced by something that Nadav said which is they won't be able to put the Palestinian issue on the backburner because I I do think that you also have a young Saudi Crown Prince who is testing the proposition that he's cohort of twenty and thirty something young Saudis the majority of the Saudi population don't particularly care about the Palestinian issue I'm not I'm not sure where I place my bet in terms of who's right on that what I would bet is that it's a misplaced strategy for Israel to think that there's a lot of advantage for Israel in involving itself across the region in an axis that will be weak with allies who aren't doing spectacularly well but we're actually trying to align ourselves with the losing side in the region and I would take a step back and say this is an entirely misplaced concept when it comes to how Israel should approach Iran and whether we should be interested in an escalation and a zero-sum approach also on the Iran question all whether we should be interested in diplomacy de-escalation and yes Israel and Iran are gonna have very fundamental differences but can they be managed more effectively and less kinetically without Israel aligning itself in a broader regional struggle which will only increase sectarian violence radicalization all of which blow back and do not serve Israel's interest Thank You Lucy yeah I think that much has already been said that I would agree with in this issue I just add a little bit of texture on a few of these points so I agree with Daniel I think this mutual testing going on I think particular you're seeing that with the Saudi leadership and with the Netanyahu government testing of how far you can push this proposition of it's not even so much going around the Palestinians or about the past in you but in the issue but how far you can push absent doing anything on that on strengthening relations and as I think Daniels said there's been some success so far I mean there's those there's definitely increased cooperation happening at many levels between Israel and number of countries the question becomes again as I think Daniel raised how true is this this belief I think people have for a while that there's altom utley a glass ceiling to where that cooperation goes until the peace process is resolved in the dress I still tend to believe that is the case I think the challenge is do the respective leaders need that is it enough for these leaders to be enjoying the cooperation on these shared strategic interests as they have it without having as particularly for the case of the Arab leaders to test that proposition further of what the street will do so to you know when you look at polling on this and as we know polling is notoriously more difficult to get a credible handle on when it comes to public opinion polling in the Arab world than say among the Israeli and even Palestinian publics but if you look at the Zogby poll for example and he's been doing polling in the Arab world and he does the Arab countries in Turkey he usually polls on these questions and his most recent poll I think it was at the end of 2017 looked at Arab world and Turkish attitudes to this particular issue is what do we think about what do you what do you think about the proposition of strengthening ties with Israel in order to address these common shared threats extremism Iran specifically and I think the numbers were instructive I think your highest numbers you got you got 59% of Egyptians 48% of Saudis 45% of Emirati ISM 51% of Iraqis said yes to strengthening relations but if and only if after you've addressed the issue of occupation of the Palestinians and addressed a peace agreement along with the parameters of the Arab Peace Initiative to look at this another way if you wanted to look at those countries that said we should do it anyway regardless of that the highest numbers you got enough support for that were 16% in Lebanon and 25% in Turkey so again to the extent we place meaning in these polls what you are seeing is this Palestinian issue doesn't need to be addressed first before we're willing to talk openly or think open again this is public opinion polling now I'm looking at actually been on the front row here he and I had a conversation relatively recently about this issue and he reminded me of a concept I think in social psychology called pluralistic ignorance where is there some phenomenon going on here where everybody thinks everybody else thinks that way right that people on the arab street think well i it's probably not popular to think it's okay to normalize with israel and therefore who knows we just don't know and i think that's where the testing is happening but all to say i think i feel fairly sadly that the arab leadership isn't willing with all its concerns domestically and around it to take that risk right now and it doesn't necessarily feel like it has to as long as it's probably getting some of the cooperation that it is getting around the issues that are happening thank you one follow-on question from that do you we saw before and after the December 6th announcement that the president Trump made about recognizing Jerusalem before quite an expectation of major protests across the Arab world if not violence during and after there were protests there were a lot of statements but not nearly to the extent that was predicted should we read into that at all is sort of a test of some of the polling numbers I certainly think the leadership soul around we're probably looking at that as a test my own view and this is it's it's too soon to tell so certainly and thankfully there was less violence than was feared actually violent incidents did go up at you in the West Bank if you look at the statistics since December six specific in the West Bank but if you're looking more broadly in the Arab world yes the reaction was relatively muted so I think that the leadership is seeing that is a test of the Israeli leadership some of the Arab leaders may be the Trump administration I think I would be wary of us all being too complacent about that there's a long way to go on this issue there's you know we'll see what happens when the embassy have open opens there's things that could happen to test the patience all around of all sides up on the Temple Mount and again this issue does tend to still have symbolic resonance and has a long history of being able to be exploited by actors who are feeling pushed to do that and so again I think that I think on some level you were seeing with that muted reaction the fact that I think has also been acknowledged up here that the leadership and people around the Middle East around the world to have a lot of other concerns on their mind and this isn't first and foremost that issue right now but again I do think it's too soon to to write this office look it was nothing and Jerusalem really doesn't resonate anymore I think we have to play this out a bit more now that's odd like to to put it in the context thoughts of the July 2017 tensions in in Jerusalem around they lack the mosque and the metal detectors because there's where when he looked at the reaction of the Arab leaders in with the neighborhood countries despite the sensitivity of the mosque and what it means in what was happening around it and despite a very clear position that they were taking against Israeli policy they were always very concerned about what happens domestically within their own countries how to restrain people from going to displace in a way that can jeopardize that so I think part of the reaction to American move is not only about what is the perception about trance policy but also looking inwards and in that regard I think it's worth noting is a relation with Jordan because when we look about and we talk about improvements in relation between Israel and this is not the case with all of the Arab countries there are quite a number of important Arabic countries with which the relationship is not going forward we talk about the Saudis the Saudis will always even be behind the Gulf states in their cooperation and interaction with Israel but even had about six months of a major crisis with Jordan a long time without an Israeli ambassador in Jordan and all of them major cooperation project whether economical civilian with Jordan and almost been put on freeze so the Saudis are one aspect but other countries for which now ignoring the Palestinian issue is much more difficult or even putting polluting Turkey yeah I was gonna bring us a little bit closer to Israel's borders I know you had I mean just just on this point I mean did reflect existing lines of polarization in the Arab world of course the response and what was allowed to happen in the public domain in the response on the Jerusalem embassy but I also wouldn't underestimate the significance that when President Erdogan convened in Istanbul the organization of the Islamic Conference the despite significant pressures being exerted on Jordanian King Abdullah and on President Abbas they attended that meeting at the highest level a meeting with the President of Iran the Emir of Qatar the significance of that at this moment for have for them to stand alongside him a number of other leaders from the Arab world there was I mean see this is you're damned if you do you're damned if you don't if it turns violence then up you see they're violent if it's not violent but there are relatively large manifestations of popular protest they're ignored of course so there were something and the other thing which which I found interesting is in many respects you saw more of a popular mobilization in Indonesia not an insignificant country and in other places beyond the Arab world thank you so bringing us a little bit closer to Israel's borders I was gonna ask about Syria and what I've been hearing Israel talk about for at least the past years becoming northern war what you've been able to find both opportunities and challenges and sort of many other openings across the region so looking north from Israel what is how does that change the calculus or does it does it present opportunities in terms of building relations with other Arab states to include Jordan and Egypt there's sort of other shared concerns for some of the countries closer to Israel and what challenges does it present for looking beyond there I think that the major factor that we should have to look at talking about Syria is the fact that America is moving away from the region and I love a lot of what we see in Syria is is that putting aside the last attack I think the last attack is not representing America who still wants to be very involved you know in Israel many people blamed it on Obama that it doesn't want to show leadership there is weak but I believe that it's much more structural that America is losing interest in the Middle East because of many good reasons unfortunately one is energy independence the other is all the attempts to intervene in the Middle East were a big failure so the American public the American decision-makers don't see any advantage of being very involved in the Middle East and this is one of the things we see in Syria that the countries that are making meeting to decide what's gonna happen in in Syria their new sykes-picot after defeating Isis or Turkey Iran and Russia now I think for Israel America moving out of the Middle East is very worrying because the the the vacuum is gonna be filled by countries that are not necessarily always negative I don't think Russia is negative towards Israel it's just that for Russia Israel is not a significant interest and for America it is so Israel should do whatever we can to keep America engaged in a constructive way unfortunately in the last especially during the Obama administration we did everything possible to make the middle is less attractive whenever America tried to use diplomacy to solve Iran or to bring peace about Israel was not a team player on the contrary and I think there are things that we could do to keep America involved one of them and I know it doesn't sound very popular in this audience is a contractual defense alliance and I will say few words why I think it's good for peace are not bad for peace it's good for peace for several reasons one of them is that a I think that the IDF was now the most progressive arm of the Israeli government and understand better than the politicians the limit of hard power we'll have more reasons to resist any populist attempt by politicians to involve the military in in actions and it will actually have restraining power over over Israel getting involved in adventures and the second one is that to have an alliance you need borders you can't really have an alliance without clear borders because then how do you define where is the place that you protect and I think it will force Israel and make America force Israel to have borders the other way to keep America involved I thought was to accept the General Allen Plan which was you know General Allen was nominated by secretary Kerry to find a solution to the Israeli concerns about security in a peace process a the IDF professionals were pretty supportive but the politicians were against I think the General Allen is a great way to both help bring peace about and also keep America more involved I would say that even though I'm usually critical over many things my government is doing I think on the Syria front we behave pretty rationally I think Israel couldn't be really involved in a constructive way even though what Assad is doing is horrific especially for Jews but nothing that we could have done would make things better and and the policy to kind of act only when it's kind of you know moving weapons that are problematic to Israel on the one hand and doing humanitarian work in accepting Syrian you know people to Israeli hospitals was the right policy but as I said because of the fact that America is no longer there I'll think that we're going to face some bigger challenges in the future Lucy I just want to address this question of the the impact by the top opportunities or challenges of what's going on on that northern border and I think that in the immediate term this is when the gravest security concerns and the real security concern as Nadav was indicating for Israel I think when we look at how that impacts the other question we're talking about here on the level of psychology frankly for Israelis and what that might mean for any for moving the peace process this presents a real challenge I remember listening to a couple of years ago to an Israeli general who drew the distinction between security and defense capability and talking about how the former is a psychological as a state of mind so Israel is incredibly strong when it comes to defense capability but in terms of its feelings of security we know that for for Israel this is a genuinely health concern and when Israel looks around right now and it sees its northern border with Lebanon and it sees what's happening in the Northeast with Syria and then if you compound that with what you've been seeing in Gaza recently I think the idea that this will increase in appetite among the Israeli public's to want to take the risk they see moving towards peace of the Palestinians I think this only complicates that matter so I think that's something for us also to throw into the mix here in terms of the bigger picture thanks yeah I think we see Daniel and Nimrod raising their microphones but after this question I will turn these comments I will turn to the audience so if you do have questions and you want to start lining up we'll get to you in a couple moments the what what what Lucy said is important that Syria Israel played the role that Nadav outlined but as it the trajectory of the overall conflict in Syria has become increasingly clear and who has the upper hand Israel is facing a genuine dilemma which is deterrence is normally about deterring someone from doing something in your territorial space Israel is trying to extend that to preventing someone from doing something in Syria in terms of the kind build-up the kind of deployment and that's going to be a very hard choice to make israelis used to a certain freedom of maneuver in lebanon for instance that it would like to apply in syria and i don't think that's going to be doable other than enough huge cost and a cost that isn't worth achieving that what that translates into for me is well partly why one needs to question whether the reliance on an america deployment strategy and are trying to build this new axis in the region that doubles down on everything is adversarial with iran and one cannot reach even quiet understandings whether that is a smart strategy and clearly i'm suggesting it's not and to go back to what we were discussing and what Nadav just said about american the ending of that american role in the region i think by the way Friday night's strike was indicative because the strike was a big nothing burger now I'm glad I actually am against you know if you want to change the dynamics of the Syria conflict you have to own that conflict you have to deploy as massively as you deployed in Iraq and I don't think the outcome will be any better but I think where Israel and Saudi and others I think much of what's really behind it isn't so much what they can do jointly together but both pushing to try and keep America militarily deployed and as the security guarantor in the region and I'm not sure they're going to be successful on that basic front so so there's one other aspect in which this plays out that's worth referencing with Egypt it doesn't really play into the relationship Syria because Egypt has played a taking a different role on the Syria conflict with Jordan what you're seeing is the Jordanians basically saying hey we have all these interests in our shared border with Syria you know how important the work we're doing is America you know how important the work we're doing is why do you keep squeezing us and making our political domestic position so untenable these are the Jerusalem visa V the behavior on the Palestinian issue visa V the way Prime Minister Netanyahu embraced the returning Israeli security guard who had just shot a couple of Jordanian citizens so the Jordanians are feeling very very nervous and squeezed right now because of the way both the Israelis and the Americans are operating in a relationship that is really important and of course unlike the other players for Jordan the Palestinian issue is existential Nomura did you have come in the audience so a word about Jordan also the defector to more and more right-wing politicians in Israel is saying that the peace treaty between Israel and Jordan is enough no benefit of visitor visa because the Jordanians should be thankful for Israel to keep the Jordanian ajeeb in place and you hear that fully could MKS and this gets top headlines in the Jordanian media in creates real damage now a decision issue first of all is another example how the Nataniel security narrative doesn't deliver know if Netanyahu had his operations visibly deal done deal which is in place a has this story about Israel's relations with Russia and how Israel manages to kind of operate Russia towards Israel interest and this isn't the case as we see recently so when we talk about put the denial position on security issues I think this could be a tool for this any progressive came to challenge that now there is another argument that we hear more and more that they a conflict in the north is inevitable I think this is a very dangerous narrative to get accustomed to but in order to challenge that it's not only about security it's also about diplomacy and that's where the weakness of these early foreign service is definitely creating damage Israel should reach out or two should be able to cooperate both with its additional allies in Western Europe which is adopting a very confrontational language towards because of the Palestinian issue but also to other regional actors and that you mentioned briefly Turkey and Daniel you mentioned Iran Israel II tend to see turkeys an ally of Iran regarding Syria but that's not the case you know turkey in Iran has lots of rivalry on Syria and if Israel would have managed to create a dialogue with policy dala with the Turks or limiting Iranian influence in Syria and not militarily but politically and economically I think it will find good partners in in Ankara thank you first question from the audience I am Andy when a guy teach in LA I have a question I had an interaction with William burns recently and we were talking about something about the following you now have and you haven't mentioned it a the Trump administration with Bolton and Pompeyo all three of whom would just love to have a war with Iran you have a Saudi prince who sees himself in a major competition in terms of the Sunni Shia thing and the the Crescent from Iran you have Netanyahu's facing going to GL and various corruption charges who desperately needs a distraction and a war with Iran would be just fine a lot of us are very concerned that that triumphant of people could really get us into a war in the relatively near future and I'm wondering what your senses of that one more question as well i my name yep hi my name is Elliott Davis and I'm a student studying at Duke University you had spoken about the role that um as rail should play and trying new we won't piece the Palestinians in the steps that they should take but I'm curious to hear of what steps you think that the Arab government should take in regards to getting Palestinians to come to the table and helping them whether it being helping them economically or trying to get another set of leadership in Gaza instead of Hamas and other ways that the Arab governments can help Palestinians aside from what Israel should do thank you thank you so two questions first to summarize how concerned should we be about war with Iran in particular given various political dynamics here and in Israel and in the Gulf and second what steps should Arab governments take visa via the Palestinians to help move toward a peace process would anyone like to begin in terms of Iran I would separate between the rhetoric of Netanyahu and the actual actions because the the defense establishment in Israel you know think that tearing down the Iran the jcpoa it would be a big mistake and will actually let Iran go directly into a bomb because there will be no coalition anymore and the thought that you know that it's just for America to decide when we're talking about p5 plus one is ridiculous so I think that some of it is rhetoric because of political reasons because of other things but I don't think that that Israel they will you know has any interest to go into conflict or so I would try to look behind the headlines in terms of what the Arab world could do there was a an attempt by Egypt to create reconciliation between Fatah and Hamas that failed and they're still kind of going through the motions but it seems that both sides are not interested the Palestinian Authority you know they they hate Hamas maybe more than Israel especially after the last assassination attempt they also don't want to be in a situation like in Lebanon where they have the responsibility of the civilian stuff while Hamas still control the weapons and and do what they want so they can't really anything but but but I think that even if we cannot get full reconciliation it is within Israel's interest that there will be a joint government maybe a technocratic government because I think that will help Hamas find a ladder you know to move a little out of the ideological rhetoric because Hamas are failing in controlling Gaza and there is a lot of resentment within Gaza and this is one of the reasons also for the demonstration because they are looking for a way to let people ventilate in a way that will be towards Israel are not towards them I definitely think that the Arab world could do much better job in supporting State Building for the for the Palestinians and and also in in in in affecting the the Trump plan in a way that will be constructive and will not marginalize the Palestinian moderates yeah I would like to relate to the second question are they or data bald instead of present for almost the Arab countries should be part of a formal international mechanism that is dealing with the Israeli policy in peace poses you know the only mechanism now is the quartet the quartet hasn't been as effective in the past under the term it may be even less effective Americans are not giving much space to other countries to be involved but there were debates about expanding quartet or creating some sort of another international mechanism that must include the Arab countries within it because the Upstate has much to contribute the Peace Initiative is one example there are attempts at mediating between Fatah and Hamas is another example they should have a sit on the table and their support doesn't only go directly to the Palestinian side it also goes to the Israeli side and by that impact the landscape of negotiation for example the fact that they are about continuously reaffirms the Arab Peace Initiative year after year under different a climate between Israelis and Palestinians and it has been also willing to adopt the language a bit when John Kerry was just about to embark on his talks they show that the Arab world really wants to contribute to peacemaking and it should push back on F by the American administration to kind of use them as a dividing tool between the Palestinians and their Upstate as was mentioned by previous speakers I disagree with something so I'm gonna seize the opportunity in addressing that second point I mean first of all there's no Arab world obviously they're they're deeply divided amongst within themselves but I would say that this is not about helping with state building it's not about creating another mechanism that can be a quartet plus 1/4 plus another quartet we've been we've tried it let's not fool ourselves this is about if we want it ending an occupation and how do you leverage a different incentive and disincentive structure for Israel Israel has been offered peace with the Arab world it's not interested I was in Tel Aviv last week where I am frequently why would anyone want to do anything differently it is all going swimmingly unless you begin to impact and this is where the Arab world could have real leverage yes continue to hold out the Arab Peace Initiative but say in the absence of the acceptance of a 15 16 year old 15 year old plan and with the ever more egregious egregious steps being taken by Israel actually we have to show the other end of the equation we have to show that we are serious about taking steps to get your attention to create a disincentive for you to carry on and the Arab world is powerful enough to be able to do that that is not going to happen let me be clear but if you were to ask me what would be the most effective thing they could do that would be it that requires a very different Palestinian leadership a very different assertion of Palestinian agency and strategy and ability to embarrass and cajole Arab actors which we don't have today but that unfortunately is probably going to be the direction it would have to go in let me say one thing on Iran I don't talk about John Bolton too much because I like to at least hold out the prospect of sleeping at night but I am deeply concerned and I would just draw a contrast between what we see in the Middle East when it comes to how do you manage this dangerous and unpredictable administration and what we're seeing on the Korean Peninsula with the occur ear expert but I am taken by what looks to me extremely smart pragmatic leadership by the South Korean president who's basically saying we're going to have to live with whatever lunacy comes out of this administration we better take the initiative try to control the dynamics of this they made the outreach to the North Koreans they're trying to drive a process forward we see the opposite unfortunately amongst the closest players to the Trump administration in the Middle East including Netanyahu and his government which is to continue to walk these lunatics higher up a ladder and that is very dangerous questions let's take at least two possibly three questions but go ahead sir good morning my name is Bruce Waxman and my credentials are that I'm a supporter of J Street and listening to all of these experts one thing jumped out at me that maybe just my lack of depth of understanding but you made multiple references to the arab street in various ways as being a factor in the year relationship potentially between israel and some of these countries and i don't really grasp that I looked at the Arab Spring which is to me kind of like spring in Siberia and I look at what happened with regard to Mubarak and general Sisi these country you look at Saudi Arabia all these countries don't seem to me to have any semblance of democracy they're basically as far as I can tell again that is an expert tightly controlled whether it's my secret police or other mechanism certainly the king of Jordan is not a Palestinian as my understanding would be large portion and that the majority the population of Jordan is so how does the Arab Street become really a player when there really is to me as far as I can see not much of a voice for this Arab Street in these conditions of these countries thank you thank you next question hi my name is Josh Schwartz Nadav you said that Russia is kind of agnostic towards Israel that it's not against not for but if if Russia seems to be aligning with an axis that is antagonist it towards Israel at what point do you think the daylight between Israel and Russia will really heat up and recently we've been seeing back and forth between Netanyahu and Putin that you know Putin is not happy with the strike that just happened in Syria so what firstly what are the where do you see that relationship developing and also what leverage does Israel have as Russia becomes more of a major player both militarily and economically in the region for exerting pressure on Russia thanks.thanks and in the interest of getting to all the questions let's take another one at Haverford College I'm wondering what you make of recent overtures in the Gulf towards Jewish organizations in a particular science organizations in far right side organizations like the COA and Mort Klein how that fits into their strategy it I will summarize the questions there are three very different questions you can each choose which you'd like to answer the first was the Arab Street how can it be productive or constructive in the context of a peace process given what we've seen of the Arab Street over the last few years the second question was Russia and Russia Israel relations and to summarize in my own words where is it going and do you view it as more ideological or pragmatic and then the third was what to make of Gulf overtures to a number of Israeli Jewish organizations including some like the Zionist Organization of America and Mort Cline that tend to be more conservative start certainly so I take taking that first question about how significant really is the Arbor Street and does its leadership the way I understood your question really have to worry about where it is I think yes certainly these countries are not democracies but I actually take a different conclusion dror def inclusion you do from the Arab Spring which is I think if nothing else the Arab Spring cemented for lots of leaders in the region that gone are the days if they were there at all where you you could just ignore whatever the Arab Street thought because however authoritarian non democratic your regime may be of various levels depending on what country we're talking about I think these leaders are still keenly aware that particularly in an age of social media globalization etc that where that your streets opinions does have implications and could ultimately have implications for you so I do think there is concern even in these countries where you don't have a democratic system the way we think of the public opinion mattering the second question I think was directed specifically towards Nadav so I'll let him take that one first on that on the third question about what do we make of this outreach I think I think there's some of this all falls again into the category of testing the waters I think for some leaders as well it's it's it's sending a signal one of the things you've heard many Israelis say I've heard many Israelis say for a while is you know the Arab Peace Initiative was put down as a take-it-or-leave-it there needs to be some kind of signs that how do we trust how do we trust at the end of the day that's what we'd get and so in some cases it's possibly some signaling that look we were serious that that we would be willing to push even further if you solve this problem and I think for some leaders they are very keen to make the point the meetings have been a lot with American Jewish organizations and some of these leaders I think are keen to make the point that they are drawing a distinction that their problem is not with the religion with Judaism but it's specifically with Israeli policy so I think there are a number of different dynamics at play factoring into that question okay so first of all I agree with Lucy that there is a change in the Arab world even if it's not Jeffersonian democracy is if you would have come to France few years after the French Revolution you wouldn't see liberty fraternity Goleta you would see cutting heads and Jacobean terrorism so I think the movement is that there is much more respect for public opinion and even CC he is much more tuned to the public than Mubarak ever was so it will take time but but there is a change and there are and the people and the street is much more concerned about the Palestinian issue not because they love the Palestinians because they feel it as an open wound for Muslims and Arabs in general in terms of Russia we don't have a lot of levers with Russia because as I said for Russia even though the bilateral relations are good for Russia Israeli is not a big issue and they have other issues that are much more important for them I think you know it would be good if we find ways to get Russia it to be more constructive for example on the peace process the position of Russia on the embassy issue I think was pretty good they said West Jerusalem is definitely the Israeli capital but East Jerusalem should should have a Palestinian capital in it so as an immoral said I think we need those players to be much more a part of a quartet or p5 plus one plus Arab we we need those players and maybe if Israel give Russia a role there which I'm not sure I can expect from the current government we could also have more leverage with them on the on the front in terms of the of the last question I think that we actually see another way of you know maybe positive anti-semitism you know many people many people really believe in the power of the Jewish community and American politics which I don't think they're wrong about of course the the you know now in the past when when the relations were more bipartisan so it was easier maybe to to two more but now it's kind when Israel became a political football then I think they're there looking for parts of the Jewish community that are ideologically on the side of who cares about human rights who cares about democracy let's just think real politic and that why they're trying to get influence in Washington through Jewish organizations thank you just on that last question because I think it's it's it's important in terms of what's been going on with the Gulf and certain Jewish visitors and different parts of the Gulf etc there are three things going on here one is not new at all there have been delegations of American Jewish organizations traveling to different countries in the Gulf for many many many years preceded the Arab Peace Initiative after the Arab Peace Initiative recently so part of this is pretty standard outreach there's a second part of this which is very specific to the shakedown moment we are in which is this dispute within the Gulf within the GCC the Gulf Cooperation Council where you have the Qatar ease being an attempt to isolate Qatar led by Saudi and the UAE and Bahrain is part of that and the other Gulf states of sad on the sidelines in that context the big winner in that fight is the American lobbyists is k-street who are milking all these very wealthy Gulf states and having a blast and they're literally yeah they say Oh today we'll attack this one you attack that one and then we can charge them more because they've got and in that context in the context of what Nadav said they're trying to bring over American Jewish delegations because you have influence you have power and that's the major context the third is this other context which is somewhat new what we've been discussing throughout this panel of this attempt to test the water on closer relations between Israel and some of the Gulf states in that respect and we never just add two points on that and obviously the American Jewish organizations play in that space I just want to put out the thought here that the Israeli side and the sound the Emirati side part of the testing of the water is who's going to do the heavy lifting and I think each may have unrealistic expectations of öbut you're you're you're taking care of that I wonder how far we can drag the Israelis into this I wonder how far on the other side we can drag the Gulf ease into that for me it was a very instructive moment when the prime minister of Lebanon Saad Hariri apparently involuntarily extended his stay in Saudi Arabia and people were saying wow is this going to be the moment where Israel takes the opportunity to this northern conflict is this the moment whether you're going to see Israeli action in Lebanon and know Israel was not going to take action in Lebanon at a time and in a way of Saudi choosing so you saw the limitations of this and one last comment on it there's another component to this which is just worth mentioning for Prime Minister Netanyahu the perception of ever close relations with the Gulf which is part accurate but also still rather limited but that perception is an important part of his domestic political sales pitch Knutson Yahoo's sales pitch is number one the nasty traitors on the Left are trying to kick me out in a vast media conspiracy yadda yadda yadda number two not only have we not witnessed what those same nasty traitors kept telling you would happen which is Israel being isolated marginalized pariah status but actually our relations with the world are better than ever and for him to be able to say that includes Arab states and to not be contradicted that's very helpful and occasionally he can point to a visiting Saudi or a visiting Bahraini or an office opening in the UAE for the Energy renewables Association a quick comment from new Murad and then we'll take the last three questions they what is happening when the Arab Street especially after that of spring did not perhaps bring the democracy that some of us at least hope to see in the countries but it did change the perception in Israel about the Arab countries seeing them in a much more nuanced way notice a monolithic block given much more respect to the other publics they are willing to step up and confront the earth or Tony the James and call for daylight it also opened up the public sphere in some Arab countries in a way that led to the establishment of new civil society organization you see more and more think tanks in the Arab world and for us it's an Israeli think tank that's a new channel of organization we can communicate with and this is going on quite nicely it's surprisingly under the year of Muslim Brotherhood control in Egypt we saw Egyptian egyptian commentators young Egyptian students out of female with HUDs head scarves speaking Hebrew commentating live on Israeli TV about what's happening in Egypt so giving is that is a very different view than what used to here form generals only so those dynamics did reflect somehow on how Israelis view the Middle East and how channels of engagement can can happen and a word on the meeting with the delegation that you attend occasion one anecdote is in the same week that the Israeli embassy here in Washington Katie sighs the Jewish orbs for meeting about meeting the Qataris it was our Minister for visual cooperation so he nagged me was reportedly meeting with the Qatari envoi to Gaza in either so it was kind of contradicting what you expect from the Jewish community and what we do on ourselves and please note that why are only right-wing conservative Jews taking part in these delegations no where is the leadership of the progressive porkies priests a camp in the Jewish community why doesn't those are a bleeder all of them now have stopped in DC with the Jewish organization leadership why aren't they omitting you guys thank you hello my name is Alexandra Frampton I am a student at Duke University my question is in regards to the Casa protests that are ongoing will this one does it indicate is indicative of changing the discourse within Palestine or at least within Gaza in terms of what wants to happen we regards to Israel in the Palestinian territories and will this be a catalyst for change within the region as well as in terms of external pressure from other muslim-majority nations I am Sam from the national high school it seems that Israel has in recent years been pushing for relations outside of Arab countries for example Cyprus so how does different conflicts in for example Cyprus with northern with Northern Cyprus affect is relation with other potential allies for example Turkey regarding Northern Cyprus or other potential allies for example Morocco or the African Union regarding the Western Sahara my name is Steven pearl I'm a former fellow at the International Rescue Committee and my question is you guys spoke about how important it is to keep the US presence in the Middle East for Israel but with the boz with the Palestinian Authority discounting the u.s. as a mediator in peace process right now with the recent announcement of Jerusalem as the capital 'm do you think that we're gonna have to wait until the next administration comes in to have a peace process really resumed peace process and ago she ations resumed or are we gonna find a new mediator to really take charge of that or is it gonna come from within thank you so i think we could have another our conversation on those three questions alone but we have three minutes i think we can start to five I'm gonna try so I will try to be very quick and pick up on a couple of the things I heard I'm not sure I got all of them but I think starting from the end a new mediator I think one of the challenges on finding a new mediator right now is for many reasons they've already been discussed we've discussed certainly how the Arab world is distracted with many other issues right now which has made maybe the Palestinian issue lower priority for it and I think the same could be said for the European countries and I think for as long as the US administration is saying which it continues to say there is a peace plan forthcoming and we're trying to do this the other countries the Europeans who might be the more immediate example or thoughts as to who might step up are able to say you know there's no void to be filled here the Americans are still in the game they still have a plan let's wait to see what they put out and we'll be happy there to be helpful but I don't see and to be sort of stepping up in place of not to mention the fact that it's unclear who both parties and I mean both parties would be able to accept as an alternate mediator so I don't see that being a prospect - any time soon the first question was about the current Gaza protests are we seeing a change of discourse I think there's a whole conversation to be had about what civil non-violence of mobilisation could look like in the Palestinian case and what that would mean eventually for the outcome or for changing the trajectory of the peace process that's not what quite what we're looking at right now again this was a movement that started grassroots Hamas sort of stepped in and and tried to kind of take over the movement and now you have this sort of muddled message and it's unclear who the discourse is coming from and so in terms of does this speak to a change of discourse there might be in their pockets of potential we could look that for other avenues but I'm not sure that this itself is necessarily signifying a new course I would like to say on the third question and to use it also as maybe a constructive criticism out of love to J Street and I hope they are not closing the stream view I think that we have to you know even though with all the problem within the Palestinians and Trump you don't see anyone else stepping up the Europeans are waiting for for the Americans everybody's waiting for the Americans Europe is divided they can't really get a consensus on anything so I guess even if we would like to think that you know that we need other players America is still very important and I think it would be a mistake to completely give up the possibility that the Trump will do the right thing for the two-state solution both because we have amazing leverage that Obama never had he was accepted as a messiah by the Israeli right and it will be very hard for Netanyahu to say no to trump and Annie and until midterm elections it doesn't have any other party to go to because Trump has both houses so I would encourage J Street and to be in touch with the administration and not to be partisan on the other side because I think it is important that you guys will have more Republicans connections and I and not to give up on this administration even if we're skeptic because I think they could still do the right thing and everybody should try to to affect that so first it's important to look at the alliances the teaser is forging with different countries also to understand the constraint for regional issues and peace pauses and what is happening with Europe is not by chance that Europe is divided it's because either was proactively develop relations with countries in Central and Eastern Europe some of those are not very committed to democratic values as we all see them and these countries are blocking now initiatives or israel-palestine with in Brussels but these are is also developing alliances in the eastern Mediterranean and you mentioned Cyprus gas is also an example it manages to create some sort of a win-win relationship in religion in that region has tied with Egypt has tied with Cyprus has ties with gays has ties with Turkey and that may be a new frame which to look at part of the Palestinian issue at least on Gaza which is also part of this eastern Mediterranean in the area in which natural resources that may be another kind of constructive driving force for cooperation so eastern Mediterranean issues I think should we we should keep an eye on not only form economy and Europe in relation but also Middle Eastern and peace poses related issues two very brief comments one I think what's going on in Gaza is potentially very interesting and goes well beyond the immediate pressures on the Hamas leadership inside Gaza this is what happens when you have an Israeli political elite and an Israeli political dynamic that moves so far away from the prospect of two States it generates a counter-reaction and the fact that this is marches of return by the way most Gazans come from the Negev the naka the area that Gaza hinterland is so the fact that this is front and center is very significant secondly I don't want to wait for the Trump administration to put forward a plan thank you very much I don't wanna wait for new mediators I don't wait for the next US administration I would like America to be a less negative and destructive destructive actor but what we need to focus on is to change the power dynamics change the incentive and disincentive structure for Israel on the Palestine issue so that Israel finally has to make a choice which it has avoided for far too long at its peril thank you thank you to all of our panelists I think we've heard a lot thank you

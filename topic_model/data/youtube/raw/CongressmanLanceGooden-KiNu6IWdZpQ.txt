[Music] and now a Fox News Alert the House overwhelmingly voting overnight to approve an economic relief package to curb the impact of the coronavirus our next guest is one of just 40 Republicans who opposed the bill Texas congressman Lance good and joins us now congressman thank you very much for being here this morning it was a vote late last night you were one of the 40 no votes explain what the bill does and why you didn't support it well first of all there's a lot of good in this bill I'm told we're now speaking live on camera just five hours after the vote happened the bill was put out about 45 minutes to an hour before that and there's not one member of that chamber that voted yes or no last night that saw what they were voting on and actually had time to study at perhaps Nancy Pelosi did because she was the only one that has been working on it for two days there is increased funding there's increased testing these are all wonderful things this wasn't a very comfortable no vote for me but I can't in good conscience vote for something I haven't read that has not been debated we talked about it I believe for 15 minutes it required a two-thirds vote to go around the normal debating process but the Senate's already left town and yes this is a priority yes this is an emergency yes this is something we should have done however the Senate's not taking this up for several more days so why did we need to do it at one o'clock in the morning if this is absolutely such a great bill you're asking me to comment on a bill that I'll be honest with you I haven't been able to read all of it I've slept for about three hours before I came on this show and members didn't know what they were voting on and there were there was a lot of frustration and disappointment in the process so congressman there is certainly a sense of urgency the concern amongst conservatives is that Democrats might use it as an opportunity to push spending bills they've long wanted that aren't related to coronavirus is that part of your concern also that is and you know I'm hearing things from my colleagues they're saying things yeah but these are especially horrific times the process is something that perhaps we should overlook that may be all well and good but for the last 48 hours Nancy Pelosi and Steve minuchin have been the only ones working on this bill I can't in good faith vote for something just because Nancy says it's okay and the president has agreed with her I respect both people I am a big supporter of President Trump but I made a promise to my constituents that I would make a decision based on the facts and I was voting yes or no based on what Nancy Pelosi was telling me and it's just it's not acceptable to me well thank you congressman and we really do appreciate you explaining to people why someone might potentially vote no for such an important bill but it's not something I feel good about it was a difficult no a lot of times there are bad bills it's easy to vote no it's easy to explain you know this is a bad bill because of X Y Z there are measures in this bill that Republicans are uncomfortable with but it's very difficult for me to sleep well after voting one way or another on a bill that I haven't read no absolutely and we do understand that but I do want to get to one more thing while we have you something that I've seen on your social media and that's near and dear to me that you're saying over a hundred thousand college students have being sent home this semester because of fears of the corona virus my son actually is flying home from school today and what are you calling on the universities to do I'm calling on the universities to do a pro-rata refund of this room onboard not a total refund but for the remaining portion of the semester and there's a good chunk of time left between now and the end of the semester students that have paid up on the room award they should be getting that money back there are a lot of students not like your son who don't have parents who could probably pay for a plane ticket home or travel home and they need that money now it's much more important that these students get that money back than it is for universities to say well we can't afford to or it's already baked into the budget Congress are very briefing what are you hearing from schools it's gonna happen it's I think we may get there they don't like it and I think they'll probably say well we're in a crisis time we'll get there woman can or try to work out a deal but it's an it's the right thing to do it should be done represents good and thank you very much for your time appreciate it

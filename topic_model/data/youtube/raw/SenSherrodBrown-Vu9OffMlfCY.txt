thank you thanks to all five of you for joining us a it's not exactly breaking news that Ohioans don't trust pharmacy benefit managers between repeated reports and the egregious use of spread pricing alleged alleged breaches of contract accusations of anti-competitive behavior a misuse of taxpayer dollars a general lack of transparency I can't say that I blame them several you I understand are making a conscious effort to rebuild trust with Ohio pharmacies and consumers and taxpayers I appreciate that but I need you to do that better and we need you to do that faster part of that means changing the way you think about your business and it means considering models that benefit the Ohio and at the pharmacy counter as much as it benefits your direct client or the other half of your business it is past time to put patients ahead of profits in Ohio taxpayers before shareholders so I ask you to do that I want to ask a few yes/no questions starting with you mr. Koller and if you really would answer yes no just right to left is your company play a role in setting list prices of many drugs no we do not no no no thank you if the administration's rebate rule were finalized as proposed would you in some way be required to change the way you do business yes senator we would yes yes yes yes thank you the administration's rebate roll were finalized as proposed you believe any pharma company would be required to change the way it does business no senator no no no no okay blast blast yesterday know this question is a short answer if you can what and thank you for your cooperation well a percentage of prescriptions that you fill across Part D actually receive or rebate roughly what percentage so senator approximately 8% of the prescriptions that we cover in Part D are associated with a rebate okay mr. pre senator I don't know the exact number I know it overall business about 7% okay thank you about seven to eight percent okay senator I do not know the exact number but we passed through 100 percent of all rebates and discounts 90 percent of the prescriptions will be generic of the 10% that are branded about two-thirds have rebates so it's about seven seven or eight percent like the others okay to recap PBMs do not set drug prices forcing you to change the way you do business as the administration's rule would will not change that fact and while the rule might impact a small percentage of drugs in Part D that receive a rebate it does nothing to lower costs as your answer suggests for the other 90% of prescriptions you fill most importantly absolutely nothing in the proposed rule would require secretary czars former employer or any other pharma company to lower the price of insulin or any other drug it's important to establish that so thank you for that in fact no pharma company is willing to commit to lowering the price of their drugs if this rule goes into effect instead of relying on the administration's claims that the proposed rebate rule will solve the drug pricing problem we should be focusing on solutions that are sure to result in lower drug prices like my legislation to allow Medicare to negotiate on behalf of all Part D drugs and to prohibit manufacturing manufacturers from price gouging in the last couple of minutes many of you acknowledged your testimony of the fact that biosimilars have enormous potential to help lower drug prices for all Americans as you know biosimilars are approved by the FDA based on safety and efficacy and in every circumstance and I'm aware of they have a lower list price than their innovator product not surprising I understand that many of your plans sometimes require the use of higher list price innovator or brand-name products over the use of a cheaper therapeutically equivalent fda-approved biosimilar or generic this is short-sighted it's already having a chilling effect on the for the potential on the potential for a robust biosimilar market in the US my time is about to expire but I'd like to ask each of you to answer for the record what more your company can and will do and what more Congress should do to ensure the u.s. develops a robust biosimilar product when we start with you dr. Miller if you would yes so one of the biggest problems facing the industry is their lack of biosimilars they have come to the marketplace the FDA has approved many biosimilars that still are not in the marketplace they're caught up in law in the legal actions and so shortening the period of exclusivity could make a huge difference in bringing these biosimilars to the marketplace and so we are strongly supportive and have been for over a decade to get biosimilars out there and when they are there we often take great advantage of them to lower the cost for our place thank you and mr. rice if you answer the same question I include in it any pushback ideas on manufacturing tax or tactics like bundling rebates and rebate blocking so go ahead Thank You mr. Issa yes senator as you've heard previously from my counterpart here that we absolutely are supportive of bringing more competition into the marketplace we've seen even in the space of insulins when we've been able to have that competition a biosimilar introduction we were actually able to reduce for the members out of pockets they're burdened by 9% and so having more competition like that on the market would be extremely beneficial and we know today that the u.s. still lags Europe and the availability of biosimilars Thank You mr. Fleming sir could you just had one question no it's one for all of them everybody answer is question and then we'll go to Senator hazard yes senator we need more competition we love biosimilars when they do come out we try to put them in parody position with the originator drug to allow the biosimilar to compete but the big problem we have today is we need more more competition allows prices to come down for the same therapeutic area in a shorter a shorter window as Miss dr. miller suggested was ERK okay mr. French senator is a lot needs to be done to increase competition the BIOS illness market we're a very strong supporter so there's over 50 biosimilars that are actually used in Europe less than six are on them around six or seven are in the market in the United States and so the main reform areas could be in the FDA so there's a series of things if you follow up we would love to provide solutions that you could work on thank you so senator we we are very supportive of biosimilars we generally treat them on parity or preferred over brand we assess them on the low net cost basis we don't engage your SML bundling one is not a practice for us that creates a meaningful barrier to biosimilar uptake we think one of the biggest barriers to uptake of biosimilars is the lack of final FDA guidance on interchangeability senator hannon its chairman one one more thing I'm sorry I apologize I think their answers really do show the importance of a shorter window and biosimilar exclusive one on exclusivity so Thank You mr. chairman

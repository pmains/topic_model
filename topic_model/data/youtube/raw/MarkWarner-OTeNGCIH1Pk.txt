welcome back last Monday the House Intelligence Committee held its first open hearing on Russia since president Trump's inauguration the result that bombshell confirmation that the FBI is indeed investigating the Trump campaigns potential ties to Russia and a chaotic back and forth between the committee's top two members after the chairmen briefed the president whose campaign his committee is supposed to be investigating all of this calling into question of whether the house can conduct a credible investigation and it appears now that investigation could be falling apart before I so this week the Senate Intelligence Committee will get its turn to prove that someone in Congress can credibly investigate this in a bipartisan way Senator Mark Warner of Virginia is the top Democrat on the Senate Intel committee and he joins me now senator welcome look I want to get right to getting your reaction to what FBI director James Comey said when he testified that they are indeed investigating ties between the the Trump campaign and Russia well Chuck I want to talk about Russia as well but we just follow that first half of this show talk about the failure of Trump care to take place the reason was nobody talked about the details of the bill it would have cost 24 million Americans their health care it would have raised prices for seniors it was a major tax cut for the wealthy it was an 800 billion dollar cost shift to the states to pick up the cost of Medicaid it was an awful bill and I think people across the country revolted against it sometimes the substance actually matters now in terms of Russia you know this is I've said before this is the most important thing that I've ever done in my public life and what I know now as I get more and more into this I'm going to double down on that statement because it's extraordinary we have the FBI director admitting that there is investigations going on we know that the Russians massively interfered in our elections with both hacking they had a thousand paid internet trolls that managed to takeover and flood the zone with fake news and we have a series of people that are very closely affiliated with the president who had extensive ties with Russia including the fact 60 days into the administration we've got both the NSA director or national security adviser led resign and the Attorney General had to recuse himself because of those ties let me ask you this though how much does an active investigation in the FBI actually hamper the Senate intelligence committees ability to to do investigation I mean it isn't it plausible the FBI says can't turn over some of these materials because we're not done well there have been prior examples think back to Watergate there was a DOJ investigation going on along with an aggression investigations you think you're gonna vote we're gonna have to be able to do both I you know I've talked regularly with director Comey there will be times when though we'll have some unsure brush ups we start our process in terms of open hearing this week but we already have terms of reference we have incredible access to information at the CIA we're gonna have to get more information we've already started interviewing witnesses we've got a long way to go to get this done we're gonna get it done in a bipartisan way now as you saw on the house side you had the House Intelligence Chairman Devin unas claimed that he has now seen some raw intelligence reports that perhaps confirm that that there was at least some inadvertent surveillance of folks connected to the Trump I mean have you seen any of this material what is he referring to I am totally mystified by what mr. noonas has said and I've talked to my chairman Richard burr he doesn't know I've talked to Democrats Republicans on the committee I think it's fairly mystifying if not outrageous that he make these claims thence goes down and briefs the White House and I you know I know Adam Schiff the lead Democrat still wants to keep the investigation bipartisan I don't think mr. Schiff even knows today what those documents are we have to a couple of times and you have hesitated on endorsing the idea of an independent commission John McCain has been the biggest champion of this thing you know at this point maybe it can't be done inside of Congress what do you say that well listen if we could get an event commission I'm open to that that means you got to pass a bill the president's got to sign it so let's move it on you were not there a week ago and you then you better have a big debate about who's gonna be on it I think we've got a committee and we've got I've got Tom cotton on the committee and Ron Wyden would cross all of the political divides and frankly we've had bipartisan support serious Republicans Roy blonde Marco Rubio Susan Collins James Lankford we are all saying we're gonna go where the Intel leads well I would have to use that process I want to ask you about Richard Burr and your trust and faith in him the White House used asked both Devin unas at one time and Richard burr to essentially help push back against one of these New York Times stories and they both did in some form or another does that call into question senator burrows ability to be bipartisan in this and do you trust him we've had some bumps but I am working very closely with him right now you trust we have I trust him that we will get this done and we have a list of witnesses that I think you will see that is comprehensive and we're gonna talk to everybody involved all right and it's Paul Manafort apparently made a statement that he's willing to testify before the House and the Senate Intelligence investigations Wynwood we see somebody like Paul my firts is you've got to get your information you've got to get all the wrong televisions you've got to build your case you only bring in those kind of witnesses at the appropriate time and we will bring in move that like it's rement six-month wait outline the timeline here what we've got to do is when I have the public hearing we're going to continue to do as much as we can in public but we've got a lot more raw intelligence that we've got to go through because when we bring in people like mr. manna for drivers we want to know not some spectacle we want to be able to ask the right questions and you as you know you brought up Adam Schiff he's the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee he said to me earlier this week he said there is more than just circumstantial evidence and that there is some some evidence of collusion that's going to come out is that you say what I said the outset weeks ago when I was first meeting started this I said this the most important thing I've ever worked on with what I know now I doubly believe that this is no serious effort it has to be done bipartisan we have to get the facts out to American people you keep saying there's a lot more smoke there's a lot more to think the fires there listen well time will tell but what we do know is the Russians massively intervened and they're doing the same thing right now in France and Germany before I let you go Neil Gorsuch is it worth filibustering his confirmation vote or do you believe he should have a vote on the floor of the I'd say when I'm believed in terms of mr. Rochester right guy but I was very disappointed with his answers he was not even willing to acknowledge the bedrock cases like Brown versus Board of Education are part of our existing you know for there's voting no and there's preventing a vote where are you listen time will tell I want to reviews more of these cases before I just you haven't made a decision in filibuster have not made a decision yet but I was not pleased with his answers both I got personally or at the Kuti level all right Senator Mark Warner we will the public will be seeing a lot of you later this week with that first intelligence hearing thank you

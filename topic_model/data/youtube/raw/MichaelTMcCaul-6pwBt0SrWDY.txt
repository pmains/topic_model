now is Texas congressman Michael McCaul the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee congressman McCaul thanks so much for being in Studio City this just feels like deja vu all over again in the most sickening way you of course are the chair of the House Homeland Security Committee and of course you've been focused on terrorism and we know the reports that you've been issuing about that but does it feel this morning as though maybe you're focused on the wrong thing and gun violence is what we should be talking about with Homeland Security well you know a lot of terrorist events that happen involve weapons there are warning signs usually along the way that we miss this obviously looks like a case of mental illness we've seen this story way too many times in the past I think we have a mental illness crisis in this country I'm not sure what law could have possibly stop this from happening but it shows that we need to deal with mental illness I think a little more effectively so you see this is an issue of mental illness you don't see this as an issue of too many guns in the hands of the wrong people but we have I was a federal prosecutor prosecuted gang cases if you're mentally defective under the law you can't purchase a weapon so i don't know if it's not necessarily that we need more laws if we need to treat mental illness and if someone is mentally ill that those signs should come up with family friends and the gun dealer but how can the gun dealer know that you're mentally ill there's no national database of people who are becoming unhinged how can the gun dealer ever know that well if somebody you know look is a little bit off and maybe they're changing or radicalizing as a terrorist those signs are sometimes hard to spot you're talking about a Second Amendment right and the Constitution as well and so to deny that right just on a hunch raises all sorts of legal questions as well I think part of the problem is addressing mental illness having people identify people in the family or friends who seem to be off a little bought base just like in terrorism about radicalization the warning signs of radicalization spotty knows early getting them in the off ramp so we can treat them so we can stop this kind of vile from happening you and I have had many conversations about terrorism and what to do about it and how much it scares Americans that cNN has put together overnight the numbers of Americans killed by terrorism since 2004 versus by gun violence and look at the numbers there are 313 us deaths from terrorism and by the way CNN took a broad abroad approach to what they call tourism of course they counted the fort hood shooting they counted the plane crash into the Austin IRS building they counted the Sikh temple shooting so this was that that's a very comprehensive look versus us deaths by far our firearms it's a thousand times more well one number i don't see on this charter or the three thousand who died in 911 in this city yes and this was since 2004 so they we weren't counting 911 but the truth throw in the three thousand from 9-11 firearms are so much more I mean is there nothing Congress can do well again I mean Congress will look at this issue I think it's most of these cases or mental health mental illness case so what can you do it so what more could you do about keeping if it's just mental illness keeping guns out of the hands of the mentally ill what law well there's a law in the book already if you've been adjudicated mentally ill you can up for just a fighter on and so the question is at what point is someone denied a second Amendment right in the Constitution who and who determines that currently under the log it's a judge that does it not just an arbitrary yes so I mean the problem is is that a lot of these people get their hands on firearms before they were adjudicated mentally ill sometimes they're not in the system as in Judah cated mentally ill they haven't committed necessarily a crime that has gotten them into jail before or the system but they are unhinged I mean listen it sounds like you're saying there's not much more we can do no I think the obligation of the citizens in the country to identify friends or family who are going down this path and in every case you'll see in this case as well I'm sure people will come out of the woodwork saying yeah yeah he was saying these crazy things and yet it was never reported to Thor a lot of this can be stopped if that was brought to the attention okay let's talk about that so if somebody had raised a red flag and said this person appears to be becoming more violent or more unhinged then would you be comfortable with police going in and and taking away their firearms I think you would have to have a psychiatric evaluation to determine whether that person is qualified to own a firearm in under the law you have to be mentally adjudicated mentally defective so yeah I think we have a mental illness crisis in this country we have veterans returning as well with PTSD we have a lot of mental health issues out there that need to be addressed and dealt with I don't think passing another again lon the book no gun lock probably could have stopped this case tell me what law have been passed to stop this case maybe if there were more background checks of wherever he was and we don't know yet the history we don't we don't know we don't have all the others the president came out without knowing all the facts I don't know all the facts in this case I don't know how he purchased his firearm and I and I don't know what the the signs were of mental illness prior to his purchase here's what the President had to say in terms of a challenge to Congress about this listen we spent over a trillion dollars and past countless laws and devote entire agencies to preventing terrorist attacks on our soil and rightfully so and yet we have a Congress that explicitly blocks us from even collecting data on how we could pretend to send us how can that be how about that congressman how about more collection of data how about more of a database that flags people how about anything well you're getting into privacy issues as well someone has goes to a psychiatrist do you want the government taking those health records and putting it into a database eight right but this is what you're talking about it's mental health is what what needs to be flagged that's exactly what's your answer what I think treating it here's what I say about terrorism we spend billions of dollars trying to eliminate the threat militarily and keeping the threat out of the United States we do very little to towards prevention of combating violent extremists in the United States those who radicalize we're doing very little that's to stop that piece and I think the same argument applies here I mean he's right we're applying all this money to counterterrorism as we should but but looking very little at prevention and I think I think this is where the health community needs to step up I think people average citizens in the country you see family members who see friends who are becoming mentally ill the warning signs these need to be identified and treated but but to take someone's private medical records there's a law of the hippity hippity I'll a shin federal law under HIPAA to take those mental health records and put them in a federal database I don't think you see a lot of Americans wanting that either you would be discouraging a person to for going to a psychiatrist in the first place I mean it obviously it's complicated or we would have solved it already it's very tough awesome like McCall thanks so much for coming on

mr. speaker once again I stand before you today to ask for your support to pass fiscal year 2018 defense appropriations bill it's past time at this essential must pass funding bill for our military be enacted into law Congress must act responsibly and do its job to quickly get these dollars out the door and where they're needed as soon as possible the legislation before you provides 659 billion dollars for defense more than sixty billion dollars for last year's levels above last year's levels when combined with almost five billion dollars already enacted into law in December this bill matches the top-line funding level in the final National Defense Authorization Act enacted into law all federal dollars are not the same we need to provide and prioritize national security after years of neglect and an increasingly dangerous international situation nor can we continue to hold our troops hostage as leverage for unrelated issues we're almost four months into fiscal year 2018 and our troops still don't have their funding it's time that the Congress fulfill its responsibility to fund our troops at the levels needed it's time to lift the budget caps and enact a full-year defense appropriation Act so that our military can begin to rebuild this build us that by lifting the budget caps on defense and fully funding the department at the top line already approved by the Congress in the Defense Authorization Act it takes care of our troops by providing additional manpower and fully funding a 2.4 percent pay raise and it provides additional funding for key readiness programs and robust funds robustly funds maintenance of equipment and facilities the bill includes specific investments in several areas such as air superiority a 4.3 billion dollars above requests shipbuilding 1.6 billion dollars above request research and development 10 billion above 2017 defense health additional 640 for me and for medical research and grants forces fully equipped the bill also provides additional resources in a national defense restoration fund in the amount of twenty eight point six billion dollars to allow secretary mattis to begin investing in the new defense strategy now instead of waiting a full year this bill gives our military leaders a sufficient sustainable and stable funding they have told us over and over again that they need the house has done its job more than once to fund our troops at the levels they need only to have the Senate fail to act Congress must step up and fulfill its most fundamental constitutional responsibility which is to ensure our troops if they have what they need to defend our nation I reserve the balance of my time

I thank the Chairman and I thank the members for the debate that has gone on this bill I noticed that members on the other side of the aisle continually refer to some of the policy provisions that are in this bill as policy writers special interest legislation fact they were called earmark legislation in this bill but they are special interest let me tell you the only special interest that I care about right now are the unemployed people in this country looking for a job and if you talk to any business in this country the one thing they will tell you is the uncertainty created by the potential regulation and proposed regulation by the EPA is stopping them from expanding their businesses because they have no idea no idea what is going to cost to hire a new employee they are the biggest wet blanket on our economy that we have today so we need to do something about it we need to rein them back in because they are totally out of control and that's what this bill does this is under an open rule that means members will have the opportunity if they have a different idea if they can get a majority of the votes to remove some of these things they can remove them but I suspect more going to be added rather than moved as this bill moves through its full consideration I thank the chairman and I yield back the balance of my time jenna from idaho yields

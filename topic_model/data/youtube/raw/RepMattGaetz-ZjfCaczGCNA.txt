joining us now is a gentleman who has been trying to get to the bottom of all of this and then one of rod Rhodes and Stein's fiercest critics Florida congressman Matt gates congressman welcome to the show thanks for having me Sean okay can I let me first stop just play you a little clip of what Rosenstein had to say would you just Cherie Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham asked him about this scope memo which is what authorized this whole mulher probe where did the information in the document come from did come from the Muller team I believe it came from the Moller team but it came to me through the team that I had set up to interface with the Miller team was it from struck and page are those two the people preparing all these documents I don't know who was prepared they in charge he doesn't seem to know congressman does that concern you that this memo that he signed off on that started the entire Muller probe he doesn't know where it came from and who started it yeah rod Rosen's time seems to be either a useful idiot or a corrupt and complicit actor in all of the predication of the Russian investigation he wrote the scope memo which allowed us to be able to go off on this venture that d legitimized the presidency and similarly rod Rosenstein signed the FISA warrants that gave the ability to renew spying on the Trump campaign and he didn't even admit to having having read those I also think it's interesting congressman that the response that he gave to Senator Durbin seemed to kind of have it both ways first he says that it was a legitimate inquiry and then he says well I'm glad that it proved that Trump did nothing wrong yeah and then even later in his testimony he said that he regrets having signed the FISA warrants that allowed the continued spying on Americans and so you know rod Rosenstein has repeatedly tried to weasel out of accountability even when he's been caught you know I think Shawn to the time when Rosen Stein was busted saying that he wanted to wear a wire on the president he wanted to invoke the 25th amendment to remove the president and then when we asked him about those things he said well I was just kind of joking and so I think that time and again rod Rosen Stein has proven to be very complicit in the corrupt origins of this investigation the scope memo that you mentioned at the beginning of our interview is evidence of that because we now know that that was predicated on information that our own FBI knew was being targeted by Russian intelligence to try to reduce our confidence in the election where we legitimately selected Donald Trump to serve as our president I'm glad senator Graham is having these hearings though because it does provide the necessary foundation for the durum report that's upcoming that I think will create criminal consequences rather than just a wagon the finger in the face of some of these deep state operatives congressman I want to switch gears just a little bit to one of your recent tweets that Twitter a warning label on saying that you are inciting violence we even had senator Murphy say that it should be taken down because it incites violence saying that antifa should be chased down because they're just like terrorists do you think you crossed the line at all by what you said no antiva are terrorists our own government our own Justice Department the Attorney General has designated Tifa as a terrorist organization and in the United States of America if you can't favor the hunting down of terrorists it's certainly a tragedy and so I would suggest that it's entirely appropriate now we don't support vigilantism in the Middle East where we're hunting down terrorists we don't have like individual American citizens roaming around the sand dunes with guns trying to find terrorists it is a whole-of-government response here's how we ought to hunt down the antifa terrorists we ought to freeze their money we ought to track their movements and then we ought to stop them by whatever means necessary from harming Americans my point is that if we can spend trillions of dollars and the blood of our bravest patriots defending the veterans and sand dunes of the Middle East we should provide at least that amount of protection for our own people for our own businesses it sure would be nice if Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut cared as much about the Americans who are suffering at the hands of these riots as he does his woke virtue signaling on Twitter you know congressman you've been very outspoken about the bias that exists on social media platforms and I think it's absolutely right are you concerned about as what they are doing to silence President Trump and his supporters heading into this election of course in 2016 as you all know Shawn because you were part of the great winning operation we caught him by surprise a lot of folks didn't think Donald Trump could win now we've lost that element of surprise and we see some major technology platforms trying to put their thumb on the scale and reshape the nature of debate in our country it's one of the reasons I'm working with Senator Josh Holley on legislation that will alter certain immunities and protections that online platforms like Twitter and Facebook and joy that allow them to engage in this type of bias without any liability or consequence the national discussion that we're having around all these issues is too important to allow Silicon Valley to tell us you know what the thought police are are seeking to enforce that day yeah I appreciate we've been talking about this all week I appreciate your leadership on this issue and thank you for joining us thank you Shawn

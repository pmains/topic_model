McCarron is now North Carolina congressman Patrick McHenry he also serves as chief deputy whip I didn't recognize you congressman I was saying some that's fairly standard by the way yeah is that okay how'd you like our conversation off-camera that do you think we should do outtakes that was we like I think you should and I think that's the most impactful conversation that the viewers didn't get to hear was we're discussing I'm gonna find out because there was the lollipop it's a union thing they were the lollipop guild and there was one other anyway history it's important stuff are you uh are you in terms of the repeal and replace there are certain parts of the Republican Party that that repeal damn the torpedoes let's repeal it in the same bill let's not do Obamacare alight let's not just expand the entitlement state by calling a subsidy a tax credit in your view does that have to be done to avoid a an absolute no sir no the the legislation marked up in the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Ways and Means Committee this week will pass on the House floor it takes a very long time to work through the legislative process it's basically a three week long process to use reconciliation the budget tool to get it through the house and then go to the Senate the Senate has a very abbreviated schedule more abbreviated than then in fact the house and that package as introduced will pass in almost the exact same form the way I would describe it is this it's a it's where I grew up in the in the south it's all over except for the cussing and fighting right we know what's gonna happen we've pledged to do it for seven years but that doesn't mean we can't give the media a little drum in the meantime we're Republicans we're independent minded people and everybody has an opinion about what should be or should not be in the package but when given an up or down vote they're gonna vote to repeal Obamacare all of this theory around it the furor around it is not for anything because there are no changes that are gonna happen to this it is what it is we know the details and it's up or down and that's yes Wow well no we have a minute process through the the committees they'll be they'll what comes out of committee will be what we pass and act into law when can tax reform come with that in mind we have to burn the first budget reconciliation process and were to get to the second one which gives that option for fifty one votes in the Senate to pass tax reform tax reform is for us in the house began four years ago so we've done the most work of any branch of government on this Paul Ryan is former chairman the Ways and Means Committee has the most fixed world view on be the architecture of tax reform and is briefly in the house I'm sorry briefing the Senate and the White House on what that should be now certainly the White House has to weigh in on their plan they're still debating it they're still putting form to it that we've got a long way to go though the president has said that you can expect something the beginning to the middle of March problem we're there right now so sometime in the next week or so we may be seeing what the White House really thinks about that the most important thing is you get the first pledge which is repealing Obamacare done check before you you know immerse yourself into what will be a even more dramatic set of votes but if there's this much drama around repealing Obamacare so we pledged you for seven years there'll be even more around health care I'm sorry around tax reform tax reform is going to die at least a dozen times this year it will be dead at least a dozen times and we'll have either the House and the Senate saying it's dead in the White House saying it's still alive or some iteration of of one or two of the three saying it's dead which means for senior can we get to I mean when we spoke with the Treasury Secretary Stephen venusian he says that he would like to see something put together by August for tax reform is that a likely timetable if you're talking about all these dead on arrival before we get to that point yes that's that's the speaker the speaker would like to see it done before the end of July before we leave for the August recess and if somebody who counts votes I spend my time counting votes you want it you want to have the package done and said done signed into law before you leave for five weeks you don't leave that package out there - I know I know you count votes on the house side but it's probably the Senate where there are the most questionable votes and and have you done tallies where you can try and figure out if you get the senators behind it particularly when it comes to the border adjustment tax I mean that has had a lot of senators Republican senators come out and say that they will not support it at this point well until you get very close to the vote you're not going to know what your votes look like the architecture of tax reform is still being hotly hotly debated and the border adjustment tax is just one large functionality of it but we have for instance financial service products section it is highly complicated very complex and and could cause enormous market dislocation we could drive liquidity there's a that has to be done with very sharp pencil when you merge into that that piece of it you're also vice-chair of course at the Financial Services Committee what areas of deregulation do you think are going to be the focus and what areas can come relatively simply without needing similar kind of hurdles as tax reform will require nothing in the world financial services will come simply based off the nature of the Senate if they get 60 votes to move this policy absent a few large pieces of dodd-frank that you can repeal through reconciliation the budget process and so what we're doing in the house is packaging up everything we want to do and we can pass that I mean we could pass one piece of legislation that rewrites dodd-frank and it moves in a very aggressively different direction and that's jeb Hensarling x' view is to move that policy out as a bill now what the senate then does is is take pieces of that and see if they can cobble together bipartisan group to pass it that's gonna be highly complex and I think a very long effort it's gonna be put in order to have small dodd-frank changes one of the things I had spoken about a lot is not so much removing the Volcker Rule in total but changing the definition of what proper trading is within that is that something that you can see happening as a priority sure we can do that in the house the the question is whether or not you can touch Volcker in the Senate can you get eight Democrats to go along with 52 Republicans there's an open question very quickly congressman all of the Twittersphere talk everything that happened this weekend around Russia and the situation there what does that do to the to the process the policy process does it have any impact well we have a a really ambitious legislative agenda so to do health care and tax reform just this one health package that's before you get to the rest of market reforms for for health insurance to do tax reform in that plus infrastructure that that is really to Congress is worth of work so we're we want the White House to stay focused on delivering results for the American people if we deliver results we'll get the economic results we get the economic results you can keep a Republican House and Senate and this this president could be re-elected in four years no absent that it's gonna be very hard to say we we kept our promises so all this sidelines show and all the folks that are common all these commentators that are my colleagues in the House and the Senate that that that are not on the House Intelligence Committee don't have the full briefing on what's happening with Russia international meddling in our elections which is obviously troublesome and then the president says it says something that I think we should take seriously it's a serious accusation we should take seriously but I'm not read in to say whether or not that's true or false and most of the people talking have no briefing and no basis of note and things are getting some with their say things are getting done I mean the sideshow is solvent for cable it's like great and you know it for mainstream media they love it and then the Democrats get all you know up in arms about but they're not gonna cooperate anyway so they're you know they're you know you're not gonna get any cooperative to do reconciliation anyway so I'm not sure what it means it's the lullaby League in the lollipop Kelly Pop guild yeah lollipop guild and this is nothing to do with with will being like six eleven and you're like five ten exactly right thank Patrick Henry is like the coolest name I mean are you do you like more ADA whose courage Patrick Makau are you the son of you had me talk are you the son of Patrick Henry yeah doesn't mean Thunder I think it's a cool name it's it sounds like Patrick did you know that when your parents did that when I conducted my first poll when I ran for office the first time it came back and I had 3% named awareness and my pollster told me ignore that don't worry about it after the full briefing I went back and said you got to explain me 3% I should be worried about it goes no no no it's not 3% they think they've heard of you right you make some really good speech works you're a great American

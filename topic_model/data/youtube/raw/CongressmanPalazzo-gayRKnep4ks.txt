us for three minutes well thank you mr. speaker and I want to thank my colleague from Georgia for engaged in this debate I know it sometimes seems to be a lonely job especially when you're right and you're correct and you're putting the best interest of the American people ahead of partisan politics so I applaud you and I applaud all my colleagues who are going to support this underlying rule and then move on to support the final bill you know I heard a comment while I was following the debate and someone said that speaker Ryan has reneged on his promises well if anybody's reneged on their promises I believe it's the president united states of america you met as commander-in-chief he has an ultimate responsibility to lead our troops but also his number one constitutional responsibilities common defense of this nation against all enemies both domestic and foreign but he's made America weaker he's made our military weaker the international community our friends no longer trust us and our enemies no longer fear us so if anybody's reneged on their responsibilities the president united states just now we started to basically really try to cut off the flow of money to Isis into the Islamic radicals for over two years we've been telling go after the old revenues that's that's where they're making their money they're making it because they're smuggling all out of the country and selling it on the black market they're making billions of dollars a year and just now we decide what we're going to go after the oil tankers that carry the oil so they can make the money so they can buy weapons and they can basically export terrorism all around the world well 25 years ago I remember pretty much this month I was activated for the Persian go for and what I one thing I do remember is we bomb the hell out of our enemies before we sent our men and women in uniform with boots on the ground in there and pretty much as we all know within a week we've pretty much the Iraq war was over with so it baffles the mind while we're waiting to the last moment to actually cut off the revenues is funding this global jihad in this radical Islam but like my colleagues my colleague from Georgia and those who are going to support this rule support the bill we understand our constitutional responsibilities are cotton umber one responsibilities the common defense of this nation at home and abroad that means taking care of people in our congressional districts taking care of people in our state taking care of the American people and so you're either with us or against us on this and I just want to urge my colleagues to support the underlying rule support the bill and let's put let's start taking care of Americans and the rest will take care of itself so with that I yield back the gym

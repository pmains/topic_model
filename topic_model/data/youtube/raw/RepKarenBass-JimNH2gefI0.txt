we begin with congresswoman karen bass she serves on the judiciary committee thank you for being here what is tonight's vote mean uh to you into this congress well i think it's a sad day it's another sad day in u.s history that we would actually need to take a vote to remove someone off of a committee you would think if she had any kind of remorse any kind of dignity that she would have actually pulled herself out of off the committee and if not that then you certainly would have expected house leadership house republican leadership to remove her and so i think it's just another sad day that continues from january 6. when you see what she has been moved to retract and adjust today what does that mean if anything to you it doesn't mean anything to me at all number one because her statements were so extreme that it's hard for me to accept that she extracted them but meanwhile she's also fundraising off of them too so the tweets that she has sent or her fundraising appeals i mean she was saying with pride she's raised a heck of a lot of money because her profile has been raised now so i don't believe that there's an ounce of remorse or regret in in what she has said i think she's just passing lip service to cover herself around this vote but i don't believe that there's anything that has changed there at all as a member of congress uh what do you say to a little bit of what we showed earlier uh and what i think if folks have watched some of this on the floor throughout the day heard which was the counter argument whether offered in good faith or not the counter argument in theory that if you go down the road of stripping committee powers from someone who just joined um for things said or done before they joined the congress um that that is as one republican put it a quote slippery slope well i mean i don't think that it is a slippery slope we have had members that have said lots of things when it's happened on our side they have apologized publicly i do not believe that that's what she has done you can't apologize or put it this way explain yourself and say that that's an apology while you leave the room and send out a fundraising note and so i think that it's very disingenuous and again i think if she was genuine she would have pulled herself off the committee of all committees in the house to be on the committee of education when children have been mowed down in our country and you think that that is perfectly okay and that you're literally going to harass a survivor just thinking of the young man who i know will be on in a few minutes but to follow him down the street and harass him knowing that i'm sure he still is going through the trauma of what he experienced when he lost his friends and classmates yeah and that was one of the extreme examples also an important i think example for if people want to take the due process um issues seriously here right there are tougher questions if something is confined strictly uh to speech the example you give and we're going to speak to mr hogue later is not conventionally strictly speech when you are pursuing someone when you are um potentially allegedly menacing them um there's an element of that that's not just words anymore and that's one of the many things that i think has come to light uh you mentioned the political side of it all of this of course has become quite infused in politics democrats are tying republicans increasingly to cue anon there's an ad here um that's a bit of an attack ad take a [Music] a look theory born online took over the republican party sent followers to congress and with donald trump incited a mob that attacked the capitol now i understand democrats would say unlike the congresswoman who's dealing with falsehoods they find that that ad is about something that is that is real and a case they want to make um but what do you say to people who look at that and say well okay this vote uh is conveniently aligned with a political tactic or or attack um on trying to say all of the republican party is queueing on well you know what i mean i think that the republican party needs to tell us that they're not because how is it that you can't denounce that you were talking about the people that led an insta insurrection that put people's lives in jeopardy that said i mean and she has said the only way to deal with speaker pelosi is a bullet in her head you know the picture that majority leader uh hoyer was showing the poster that showed the uh congresswoman before she was a congresswoman holding an ar-15 and the faces of three members of congress how do you not take that as a threat and the problem that we saw on january 6 is that there are a lot of folks out there that take cues it provides a license for actual physical harm and so the idea that she would sit in the floor of congress and continue to fight to be on that committee just shows that there's no change whatsoever and i think the republican party has to decide is it the q a party or not yeah and that brings me the final question i want to ask you because we've all been dealing with this and i know as a member of the judiciary committee and you and i have spoken about due process and civil rights and many issues which sometimes have unpopular positions right if you're advocating for for example the due process rights of someone not to have the police illegally search them and people say some people say well if i don't like that person or i think they're bad or they did something bad i don't care about their fourth amendment rights and the answer is the constitution does care even if uh they may have done something illegal um that's why we have rights and so i i got i want to end on that question for you in the seriousness of tonight as we track this which is do you ultimately view this vote if she is as potentially expected if the democrats and others hold hold the majority here stripped of these powers do you see this as a line in the sand for against her speech or a line in the sand against more specifically her advocacy of political violence absolutely it's the advocacy of political violence and we have not seen her make a major departure on that to me it's not just about free speech i mean free speech you know an example that's always you you can't scream in the middle of a theater fire well in our opinion that's what she has done because it can lead to violence and uh it can lead to actual violence the three congresswomen that are in that picture are constantly under violent threat ilhan omar for example there's a couple of people that have been arrested for threatening to kill her and for a member of congress to do that it just agitates and whips up that sentiment it's completely irresponsible i am sorry that we had to do it this way like i said she should have done it herself if not the republican leadership if there's if they abandon that then it is left to us to be responsible what happened january 6 was a profound movement in our country and there are elements there out there that are trying to rewrite history and say well what's the difference between that and what happened in minneapolis a riot windows were broken this was an attack on our democracy an embarrassment in front of the entire world we never thought that our democracy had that fragile side we've learned now and we have to take this very seriously uh congresswoman karen bass thank you as always for joining us especially at a busy time in a news night here on the hill i appreciate it

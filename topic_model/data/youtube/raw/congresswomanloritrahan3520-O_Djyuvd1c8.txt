good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our fourth teletown hall on covid19 i'm congresswoman lori trahan and whether this is your first time joining us or you're returning for a second third or fourth welcome my office and i began working from home exactly one month ago on march 16th and since then we've been closely abiding by cdc guidelines on how to protect ourselves and others during this pandemic although our office is physically closed we're working around the clock to assist constituents in any way we can my team has been dutifully responding to your questions about small business relief unemployment benefits travel information and more we've partnered with local manufacturers to ramp up production of personal protective equipment and we've helped health care providers in our community get the equipment and medical equipment necessary to keep their workers and patients safe we've also been in constant communication with our state and local partners our community hospitals and community health centers our senior living facilities councils on aging school superintendents college presidents regional chambers of commerce and hundreds of small businesses to ensure that people are getting the resources they need during this difficult time we've been successful in helping set up the newly announced regional field hospital at the umass lowell recreation center that will provide additional support to our community hospitals in this region and we've been providing support for the creation of homeless facilities in our cities and towns just yesterday i toured the new cvs drive-through rapid testing site in lowell where you can safely drive up and take a test and get results in under 30 minutes after completing a simple online registration form while my team and i continue to work each day to expand access to testing in our community so much more needs to be done at the federal level to make sure that each person has the ability to be tested that's why as congress works to craft additional relief packages i will aggressively advocate for increased funding to ramp up the production and distribution of tests it's been nearly three months since the first confirmed case of covid19 was discovered in the united states since then the numbers have continued to grow at a dangerous rate today the number of cases in our country surpassed 640 thousand and tragically more than 31 000 people have died this pandemic's effect on workers and small businesses has been devastating as of this morning the total number of people applying for unemployment since mid-march climbed to nearly 22 million nationwide including over 570 000 folks here in massachusetts alone behind each one of these numbers is a moving story of hardship and struggle and a story of workers and small businesses doing their part to slow the spread of this virus and keep our communities safe all of the adjustments we've made in recent week weeks are working but we cannot let up our health care workers and first responders are fighting so hard to save lives and we must continue to do our part to mitigate the spread and save lives for most of us that means continuing to follow cdc guidelines practicing social distancing staying home and washing your hands regularly if you do have to go out in public be sure to wear a mask or cover your face together i know we will get through this now before i introduce our two incredible panelists i'd like to briefly provide you with important updates on the relief available to small business owners workers and their families in recent weeks congress has passed three bipartisan emergency funding packages to respond to the crises created by this pandemic in early march we we passed the first emergency supplemental providing an immediate investment of 8.3 billion dollars in federal funding and research for a vaccine as well as support for health care providers and state and local health boards fighting on the front lines soon after we passed the family first coronavirus response act our second relief package which provided paid leave to workers food assistance for children who rely on school meals funding for meals on wheels and our food banks and free coronavirus testing for anyone who needs it if you've joined us on previous teletown halls you may already know that a few weeks ago i jumped in my car and i drove to washington overnight to vote on the third emergency relief package known as the cares ax which became law on march 27th this historic 2.2 trillion dollar legislative package is the largest funding package ever passed by congress and contains a number of important provisions that will provide much needed relief to folks across massachusetts including direct cash payments of up to twelve hundred dollars per person and five hundred dollars per dependent child to more than 150 million households enhanced unemployment benefits to ensure that workers laid off or furloughed because of this pandemic have access to four months of full pay on average i'm also proud that the cares act makes self-employed and gig economy workers eligible for unemployment for the first time under a new federally funded program for small businesses the cares act created a brand new 350 billion dollar paycheck protection program that provides loans for up to 10 million dollars for small businesses and nonprofits to keep their workers on payroll and it included another 10 billion dollars for small business administration grants of up to ten thousand dollars to provide immediate relief to small businesses trying to cover their operating costs i'm glad that as of this week many of these benefits have been available to folks across the street the state but there's no question these funds need to be replenished the irs began distributing the first 60 billion dollars in direct cash payments to folks over the weekend and they're working quickly to get everyone the payments they're eligible for i also want to clear up any confusion around what social security and social security beneficiaries have to do to receive their payments despite what you may have heard these social security recipients who qualify do not need to file a simple tax return to get a rebate a rebate they will receive their payment just as they would their social security benefits earlier this week i received an update that more than 27 000 small businesses in the state of massachusetts have been approved for over seven billion dollars in paycheck protection program loans to continue paying their workers funding from these release packages are continuing to flow into our state on a daily basis and as new information on these benefits available to you and your families we rest assured that we will keep you updated now i'd like to introduce our star panelists who are going to help answer your health and economic questions our first guest is massachusetts executive office of labor and workforce development secretary rosalind acosta who has been doing incredible work day and night to get many of these newly created federal programs off the ground in her role as secretary of labor and workforce development she leverages her passion to make the world a better place for the next generation and to ensure that workers employers and the unemployed have the tools and training needed to succeed in the massachusetts economy prior to joining the governor's office secretary acosta spent over 30 years in the banking industry and is known for her ability to drive positive performance outcomes aligned with the company's mission i'm so glad that she could join us this afternoon to help walk us through how folks can best access the relief they need and i'll turn it over to her now for a brief introduction secretary acosta thank you congresswoman trahan i am very happy to be here and honored that i was invited to be on this call uh and i really hope that we can answer lots of the questions um i'll have today and we know that these are really uncertain times and our office obviously has been very very busy um making sure that we're keeping up with the volume as the congresswoman said uh just in these last four weeks uh we have had over 500 000 uh claims uh initial claims just to put that in perspective in a normal month uh we normally have about 17 000 and the reason i want to give you that contrast is to how we really have needed to scale our workforce before the covet 19 we had about 50 folks in a call center physically sitting together a couple feet away from each other obviously in this new world that was not going to be possible to continue so we have uh staffed up to about 700 folks and all of them are working remotely to make sure that everyone stays safe so all of these folks have been visibly working on calling folks back we've made over 100 000 callbacks over the past couple of weeks and again that number continues to increase as we bring and train more staff so for all of you that are on the phone that have applied for unemployment and perhaps have not received a call back i really uh thank you for your patience we obviously were not ready for this kind of volume and just also wanted to to let you all know that the best way to file for ui for an unemployment application obviously is online and then also if you run into problems there are two ways to contact us one is through the phone you can call us at 877-626-6800 or you can go to our website and fill out a contact form and we will call you back we are constantly constantly updating our website and our twitter to make sure that you know there's so many things that are changing so quickly we want to make sure you have the latest information so please continue to check back on our website for the latest information and it's math.gov backslash unemployment backslash covid-19 so with that i'm going to turn it back to congresswoman trahan so we can introduce our next speaker great thank you so much secretary and i'm i'm also pleased to welcome back our next guest dr ashish who is the director of the harvard global health institute and kate lee professor of global health at harvard university dr ja has been one of the leading voices on this public health crisis from the beginning he has a practice practicing general internist and professor of medicine at harvard medical school uh here is he received his md from harvard before training in internal medicine at uc san francisco lately he has been educating the nation on what lies ahead uh through news publications and tv networks and i can't thank them enough for taking the time to join us again this afternoon to answer your questions about covid19 uh but you know without further delay i i i you know with this star panel i want to get to as many questions as we possibly can um so dr jah i will i'm going to go right to questions and then in the in the beginning of your first question you can uh expound on um you know your impressive bio if you would uh like but you know we uh we received so many questions through our submission portal as we always do and i'm so grateful for all the engagement we did our best to select questions that were representative of your concerns and we will answer as many as possible so this first one is for secretary acosta kenneth c from marlborough asks when and how are self-employed individual individuals going to be able to receive unemployment thank you kenneth for that question so that um that particular benefit is under the cares act that i believe congresswoman spoke about when she gave her introduction and that benefit will be available to um folks here in massachusetts by april 30th if not sooner so we're working very hard on making sure that we give you those benefits as soon as possible uh so if you are a gig worker or self-employed uh to receive a 1099 you will be eligible for this benefit in addition to uh your the unemployment monetary unemployment eligibility that you'll receive you will also receive six hundred dollars per week uh and that six hundred dollars per week uh will expire at the end of july 27th uh but the unemployment of the pua as it's called the benefits for self-employed uh and uh and 1099s that uh will go until the end of december so you'll have until the end of december to collect if you are still unemployed by that time terrific uh dr zhao this next question is clearly for you it is a health question robin k from tyngsborough writes uh what is the status of a treatment medication and or a vaccine for kovid19 right uh and again congresswoman thank you for having me on and and a pleasure to be on with uh secretary acosta so let me just take out just 30 seconds to kind of orient all of us on where we are with this pandemic with this global pandemic as you said congresswoman um we have more than 2 million cases around the world about 650 000 in the united states and the good news as we kind of look across the nation is i think we are at the peak as a country we are probably about 30 000 new cases a day across the nation and my sense is we're hitting a peak we're going to have a plateau for a while and then we will come down and part of the reason we're going to have a plateau for a while is that different parts of the country are going to be peaking at different times and massachusetts i want to just take a minute to talk about and then i will turn to robin's really important question on the issue of where we are with massachusetts unfortunately i think we're probably about a week away from peaking in terms of number of new cases and maybe a couple of weeks away from a peak on the number of of deaths and that means to me that the next two to three weeks uh maybe even four weeks but certainly two to three weeks are going to be very hard once here in the commonwealth and so we have to keep on doing what we've been doing the social distancing is working and it will continue to work but we will have to continue doing that for a while uh until we get through this and so far as much as that is you know it's bad news and we've got some tough weeks ahead it's it's hard for me to overstate the impressive job that the healthcare workers in the state have been doing the doctors and nurses on the front lines who have been really extraordinary and they have done an amazing job in the context of not having any treatments or vaccines so i want to segue into um the really important question that robin from kingsborough asked and you know the the status of treatments let's talk about treatments first and then vaccines um is that we don't yet have any therapies that have been shown to be effective there was a lot of enthusiasm for hydroxychloroquine early the president was very enthusiastic about it all of the data that i'm seeing coming out now about hydroxychloroquine is unfortunately disappointing we're not seeing much evidence that it does much good again the jury's not all in yet and i'm there's always a possibility but there are a lot of other drugs that are in development and and there are um drugs like rem deservier is a anti-viral drug that shows some promise uh one of the things i'm more enthusiastic about than many others is this idea of convalescent plasma which is taking plasma from people who have recovered and giving it to people who are critically ill but the bottom line is that there are lots of things in the works a lot of clinical trials ongoing and in most things in medicine we have to wait years to find out here we're going to know i think in the upcoming weeks and months just because everybody in the medical community is moving so incredibly quickly to try to identify therapies so nothing definitive yet but i think a lot of places where there are promising opportunities on the vaccine front again a ton of work happening these things usually take many many years what takes years to do we're seeing done in days and weeks we now have several vaccines early in phase one and what i i am optimistic there are some of my colleagues who are a little bit less so about whether we're going to have a vaccine soon i'm on the more optimistic side of this but even in my most optimistic days i think it worked 12 months away from having a vaccine that's effective and widely available and it might be more like 18. so what i want most of people to think about is we have about a 12 to 18 month time period we're going to be dealing with this pandemic unless some miracle happens and we get a vaccine earlier or we it really goes badly and we end up not getting a vaccine in that time frame but i am optimistic we will get a vaccine in that timeframe so a lot happening and i hope that at one of these uh town halls in the upcoming weeks and months i can actually give you something a bit more definitive but there is a lot of good work happening and going on terrific thank you and just as a follow-up doctor you know during the past two months uh many of us uh have experienced symptoms similar to those of covid19 what is the progress on having an antibody test readily available that's a great question um and the answer is there's been a lot of progress so we now have a couple of tests that have gotten fda approval and couple more that are under fda approval consideration and they'll be approved i think very soon um and what that means uh functionally is that if i wanted to go out and get an antibody test today i probably couldn't uh but it's hard to know how quickly it'll get rolled out uh do i think it'll be available in two to four weeks i do i think i do i think in two to four weeks in large parts of the country it doesn't mean every american will be able to go get it but if you call your doctor in two weeks or three weeks i'm hopeful that if you had symptoms you are above covid and you want to know whether you were infected and are now have immunity i'm hopeful that in that two to four week time period many people will be able to get tested and that will be helpful and i think it'll be a really good thing great thank you so much i know we'll talk a lot more about uh testing and vaccine development as the call goes on but this next one is for me it's from jane b and hudson she writes that her concern is what is being done to protect the grocery workers they are on the front lines of the public every day not just the cashiers but those that who work within the store stocking shelves they have not been provided with masks gloves or sanitizer of any kind think about what would happen should entire stores or chains have to close so i i i agree with you jane our emergency workers are at the forefront of our of our minds as they keep our country open um as with health care workers and first responders our essential workers are on the front lines of this pandemic and they are the ones they're staffing our grocery stores they're operating gas stations cleaning and maintaining facilities they're producing our household goods at factories and they're delivering our mail and our packages without them our country would absolutely come to a screeching halt and they are quite literally the backbone of our economy and our response to this pandemic and yet many of these essential workers report working longer hours often without adequate protective gear as they scramble to meet heightened demand during a pandemic that has claimed too many american lives in the absence of the administration's leadership to protect essential workers we've worked closely with massachusetts health and human services secretary setters and governor baker's emergency manufacturing response team and actively solicited information from manufacturers in our district with excess capacity uh that want to repurpose their facilities for ppe production for instance companies like new balance 99 degrees and holagic have all stepped up to meet the demand for critical items like masks and gowns and testing kits on my committee on education labor we've been sounding the alarms for the front line fighting to expand the definition of who will be protected under the occupational safety and health administration also known as osha and their emerge emergency temporary standards and as we consider the next phase of federal funding lawmakers have a responsibility to design a package that puts workers first and that will include health and safety protections adequate protective gear robust premium wages also known as hazard pay it makes no sense for our workers to be risking their lives daily for a little more than minimum wage certainly universal paid and sick leave support for accessible high quality child care and protections for collective bargaining agreements and for whistleblowers who who witness unsafe working conditions and seek to address them for essential workers working from home and social distancing are not options they are our everyday heroes and we owe them this much um okay the next question is for secretary acosta back to you this one is from joseph g from acton he asks will unemployment benefits be extended an additional 13 weeks in massachusetts as a result of the recent financial aid package approved by congress and if so when will this take effect thank you congresswoman and thank you joseph these are all great questions that were that we're all getting um and so the uh the extension of benefits is also part of the cares act there are basically three parts of that cares act um the six hundred dollars per week the uh the benefits for unemploy from self-employed and 1099 workers and the 13-week extension is the third part of that cares act so that program provides up to 13 weeks of unemployment insurance benefits to anyone who has exhausted their previous unemployment benefits and the first week that someone can be compensated for this benefit is the week beginning march 29 2020 and the last payable week is the week ending december 26 2020. so right now we just have just received guidance from the from the federal government from department of labor on how they'd like us to implement this program so we are looking at that um uh quickly to make sure that we can get that up as soon as possible right now and there's no action necessary on any uh anyone's part um i would only ask that you continue looking at our website and continue looking at our twitter the website again was mass.gov backslash unemployment backslash covet-19 and there we will continue to update when you can apply for uh for this benefit but remember that it is retroactive so so you won't be losing anything so for anyone that has recently exhausted their benefits or about to exhaust their benefits um this benefit will be uh you will be eligible for this benefit uh very very soon terrific um dr jean we're hearing reports that the medical manufacturing supply chain is opening up and on that topic jane w from hudson would like to know how are we situated in massachusetts on ppe and ventilators great great question jane and and we talked um when i mentioned earlier the incredible work that the health care workers uh are doing on the front lines of course as a community and as our as a state and as a country we're obligated to protect them and uh on on the front of ppe's i think uh the good news here is i think we're going to end up avoiding the worst case scenario where you had uh health care workers really not having the protection they needed it has not been totally straightforward first of all we've had a lot of uh stepping up by companies across the commonwealth and across the country but really a lot across the commonwealth in making personal protective equipment uh that that's not their normal business but that's what they're doing i think that's helping um i'm still hearing from my colleagues on the front lines that they're having to reuse respirators and and masks and gowns in a way that is really not ideal but i think from a personal protective equipment we're going to get through this wave and also depends a little bit on how things go next week and the week after in terms of the number of critical patients uh and i know a couple of the hospitals mgh for instance has been really stretched but there's still some capacity in some of the other hospitals in eastern massachusetts as well as in other parts of the state so all of that is my way of saying fingers crossed i think we get through this with adequate supplies really because of all this incredible work everybody has done and trying to make sure that we don't get caught shorthanded so that happens for this wave this won't be the only wave and so we've got to make sure that if we get through this we don't relax too much and are ready for future uh waves of covet 19 which are likely to come great thank you i know no one could even imagine the scenario uh that would play out if we had a shortage of ventilators um uh specifically uh so christine b similar question christine b from littleton observes that president trump has tweeted that he will not use the defense production act now how can we pressure the executive branch to actually use the tools that congress has provided uh and christine each and every day brave and dedicated doctors nurses physician assistants emps they show up to work on the front lines and i think one thing that we've all found most infuriating is that in the midst of this health care crisis our front line in the wealthiest country on earth had not received the protection that they needed to protect us uh we've we have seen an unconscionable shortage in ppe like n95 masks and gloves and gowns that our care workers need when testing and treating sick patients and the cares act provided one billion dollars for coven 19 related production needs under the defense production act a law from 1950 designed to secure our defense supply chain an effective response to this pandemic requires a wartime footing and we must use the dpa to help inoculate our nation against any ppe supply shock you may have seen my op-ed in the lowell sun and the sentinel enterprise last thursday about the need to treat essential medical equipment as a matter of urgent national interest not only will domestic production stop our reliance on a foreign supply chain and protect us from the next pandemic but it will also help create good manufacturing jobs we need to keep our economy strong in good times and then bad currently my legislative team and i are working to launch a pandemic production act for the 21st century that would allow the government to partner with industry like we do with our national defense and create jobs at home and help to combat future pandemic outbreaks so thank you for the question christine we've rung out a lot of lessons this last month okay secretary acosta annie c from andover works for a small food manufacturing company which is considered essential if she chose not to work because she is 66 and frankly afraid of the risk of catching covid19 can she qualify for unemployment annie asks has asked if she can work from home but the answer has been no so a great question annie um and uh the last thing that we want um is for you to uh to work under those uh work under those conditions um so the answer is yes you can qualify for unemployment very early in this crisis governor baker issued some emergency regulations for unemployment and part of those emergency regulations covered uh coveted related uh circumstances like the one you're describing annie for anyone that has applied for unemployment in the past and are familiar with unemployment you also know that part of the requirement to qualify week after week is you must certify that you are looking for work actively looking for work and that you're actively available to work part of the emergency regulations that were put in place gave us a lot of flexibility in the department during this time to not make people look for work because in most cases there's not a lot of work out there in the industry that people were in um and we do understand the fact other folks that have either themselves or or family members at home that might have compromised health and we certainly don't want you to uh to be uh to be exposed uh and be at risk so those emergency regulations are are here um and uh if you're if you fall under the situation that annie describes yes you will qualify for unemployment and our application right now also reflects those questions so we did change our application uh to reflect the fact that we're in this cove um coveted special uh circumstance um so uh so the answer is danny yes yes you would qualify uh and if i could just add one thing because there is one um uh one new uh functionality that we added to our online service that i want to make sure that your listeners are aware of um this week we launched a spanish online application uh one of the barriers we've had in the past is that our um online applications only in english but now you can apply in spanish completely spanish application and you can also do it right on your phone you do not have to have a computer to do that um so write on your phone you can access the application in spanish and fill that application out in spanish now we have a completely um a complete spanish website also where all of the instructions handbooks uh and all of the matters relating to the cares act etc have all been translated into spanish we also will have a portuguese application hopefully by the end of this week and we're continuing to roll out applications in different languages throughout the next couple of weeks so please look out for that great that's so important thank you so much secretary uh dr glenn r from concord wants to know uh and part of this you've answered so i'm going to add a little bit to it but your best estimate of the timing of the virus when it will peak when it will end and given the precautions we are taking how many people in massachusetts will ultimately be affected and if i could just add to that if you could explain the importance of testing and tracking and developing the capability to trace the virus as a precursor to our reopening the economy and preparing us for the fall and beyond that would be helpful for our listeners uh absolutely absolutely congresswoman and so let me start off by the issues around timing which i did allude to a little bit earlier and then uh i'm happy to talk about testing because i think that is the critical issue that we despite all of the efforts that i think we're still not quite paying enough attention to or that i think there's not been enough federal leadership on let's say um so as i mentioned uh you know massachusetts so well country i think we're sort of at peak case now but we're going to have peaks across the nation at different times and so on a national level we're really going to see a plateau for the next couple of weeks before we start seeing the number of new cases really starting to diminish and my hope is that by mid-may we will be well down the path of dropping number of new cases every day and by june 1 really down to very few new cases every day that's the hope and that of course all depends on ongoing really effective social distancing in terms of massachusetts we're a little bit behind a week or two behind new york of course nothing crazy in terms of his number of cases as new york um we but we are number three in in terms of number of uh in terms of number of cases across all states in the u.s behind new york and new jersey um and as i suggested i think we're a week away from peak cases and then uh probably two weeks away from peak hospitalization and unfortunately peak death so i don't really see much in the way of ability to open up our state until probably mid-may at the earliest if not a little bit later than that but we'll see how the the data go and the data are have been pretty good on predicting but they're not perfect and of course as we continue to do social distancing we are helping uh flatten that curve and and make sure that the peak number of of cases and deaths is really minimized so that remains very very important on the issue of testing uh the way to think about this uh is right and this is kind of a basic public health 101 right is that the problem is we have people with infections and then we have a large susceptible population of people who have never been infected and therefore they are at risk of getting infected and the key to stopping an outbreak is to make sure that infected people don't come in contact with uninfected people right that makes total sense and when you don't know who's infected and who's not the only policy option you have is social distancing essentially locking everybody away because then people are not interacting with with each other and infected people can't infect uninfected people once we open our economy back up by definition people will start interacting infected people will get close to uninfected people and number of infections are going to start rising so how do we control it there's only one way that we know how which is to take infected people and separate them from the uninfected or i actually say what testing lets you do is do shelter in place for infected people right basically what you do is you test a lot of folks you find out who's infected and you ask those folks to shelter in place or quarantine and then you let everybody who's uninfected go about their about their daily lives go to school go to work etc so the only way this works the only way we can keep our economy open is if we have a you know a fabulous testing infrastructure ubiquitous testing lots and lots and lots of testing tied to tracing isolation and by the way i think we should all feel very proud that massachusetts is really leading the nation on developing a testing tracing isolation strategy governor baker announced this i want to say about 10 days ago and is really building up a great public health workforce to try to do this but it is all contingent on having adequate number of tests because if you can't test people you can't figure out who's infected and who's not and therefore you can't keep infected people away from uninfected people and therefore the outbreak is going to explode so i think we're making progress on testing in massachusetts but there are large parts of the country where we are not making as much progress the barriers to getting more ubiquitous testing are multiple but ultimately i believe this is an issue of federal leadership this is an issue of the federal government uh realizing that this has got to be our number one priority and really putting time and effort and energy and resources uh into it i don't believe that the executive branch has done enough on this and i have been very heartened to see congress step up and really push the executive branch to take this issue more seriously every day we hear from the president oh we have enough tests we have enough tests we don't have nearly enough tests we probably should be doing about three times as many tests across the country as we are today so we have some ways to go but i am feeling optimistic that with leadership we can get there great thank you well i have my marching orders uh dr zha um so this is uh message received so susan uh suzanne s from ashby wants to know what is being done for the homeless population uh they represent a potential reservoir for the virus uh probably quite compromised due to living conditions and most likely have poor or spotty access to the necessary information um great question suzanne you know as communities across the country are grappling with the spread of covid19 people experiencing homelessness whether in shelter or unsheltered are at a very high risk of contracting the virus homeless services are often provided in gathered settings which could facilitate the spread of infection those experiencing homelessness also have higher rates of acute primary health care needs including respiratory disease therefore they can be at a greater risk of infection and complications from infection furthermore people experiencing homelessness usually lack access to basic things like soap and water for hand washing that can help prevent the spread of the illness now according to boston officials roughly one in three people of the city's homeless community have tested positive for covet 19 and to address this problem school dormitory beds along with beds at the boston convention center have been converted or created to isolate and treat patients the cares act did include four billion dollars for hud grants to specifically help individuals and families who are homeless or at risk of homelessness massachusetts is estimated to receive about 33 million dollars with cities like lawrence and lowell each receiving a million dollars or more so in this unprecedented time vulnerable populations like those experiencing homelessness must be protected we also must make sure to mitigate any increase in new homelessness that means protecting families living paycheck to paycheck and facing the threat of eviction and foreclosure as a result of this downturn cares also provided housing protection and assistance by placing a moratorium on foreclosures and gave property owners the right to request forbearance so during a forbearance period a property owner may not evict or initiate the eviction of a tenant for rent non-payment or charge fees or penalties for non-payment of rent there is a common adage among housing advocates that housing is healthcare and the coronavirus pandemic is proving that this is true today as it always has been so thank you for that important question suzanne okay i think we have uh time for one more round of questions uh dr zhao we would benefit so much from your perspective on this next question from gail b in dunstable she asks what is the plan moving forward to better address a situation like this in the future yeah that is the that is the big question and gail thank you for uh posing it so we obviously have to focus on getting through this pandemic but i can assure people that this will not be the last hopefully we won't have a global pandemic like this anytime soon another one but we might and the bottom line is that we knew a pandemic like this was coming anybody who's been in the in the public health space has known and we've been talking about it and it's not just the public health people we had a federal government agency that was uh or a group of you know a whole plan that was developed on pandemic preparedness there was an office created within the national security council to deal with with pandemic preparedness and for a variety of reasons much of which has been laid out that did not work out and so what we need to do as we continue to work on this pandemic and bring bring it to a close and bring our society back to normal is really think about all the investments we need to make to prevent the next one and that means i believe that it cannot be america alone pandemics by definition are global and that means deep engagement of the u.s globally including with organizations like who i believe it means big investments in our scientific enterprise so we can work quickly to develop vaccines and therapies uh it means big investments in our healthcare capacity to manage these kinds of things we were really caught flat-footed on this one the unfortunate news is we had a plan we knew what that something like this was coming and we had a plan we didn't execute on that plan and i'm hoping that after we get this one behind us the incredible pain that this one has cost economic costs human costs we really have learned our lesson and and implement those things to make sure that when the next big outbreak comes we are far far better prepared than we have been this time thank you dr uh secretary acosta you are certainly best suited to answer this next question david from lowell asked do i have to certify my benefits weekly once i apply david yes please that is a very very very common mistake that we hear about all the time we also have been having daily town halls since march 22nd and if anyone is interested uh you can sign up on our website um at math.gov backslash unemployment backslash town hall i apologize for constantly giving you these web these web directions but we have so much information in there uh so we get uh this uh question quite a bit in the town halls we've had uh we've had uh over 190 000 folks over the last 25 days attend these town halls and that is a common question so what happens is when you fill out a claim an initial claim that's great that you've got yourself in the system but you have to come back every week and certify because as i said previously one of the uh one of the requirements to receive unemployment and remember this is a federal program this is not a state program this is paid by um by federal dollars and employers uh in the state um so the the uh qualification for getting unemployment every week is you have to tell us you're still unemployed and you have to also let us know that in normal circumstances that you're actually looking for work and that you're available for work obviously in this cove related time those requirements are waived but you still have to certify every single week and then the other common question that we get a lot that um that bounces people out of the of filing a successful claim is when we ask you for your employer and who you work for many people will say for example if you work for dunkin donuts let's just say dunkin donuts and that claim would be rejected because there are so many dunkin donuts throughout the state and that's not necessarily the name of the company in the name of the owner so please always like if you're a w-2 worker always look at your w-2 stub to see exactly what the employer name says that's going to be really important to make sure that we're able to match your wages against what the employer says that you're making and what you tell us you're making so those are two very very common uh questions and common ways to get sidelined on your ui claim that then we have to go back and fix after we've uh we've spoken to you so that's so that's the answer to his question terrific thank you so much secretary acosta we have an important question from david w from north chelmsford uh rep trahan i'm worried about the november election and the threat the virus would have on turnout can you discuss what actions if any congress is considering to assure those who want to vote will be able to without potentially risking their health and this is a great question look americans should never have to choose between their health and well-being and participating in our democracy week despite governor evers efforts wisconsin's supreme court rolled the dice on public health and safety by holding a traditional election amidst a global pandemic voters in wisconsin were forced against the advice of everyone in the medical community to risk their health and that of their families to make their voices heard at the ballot box you know some poll workers even brought their own personal protective equipment with them to protect themselves as they try to get voters through the polls as quickly as possible you know this is this is dangerous and it's completely unnecessary we owe it to our constituents here in massachusetts and across our country to ensure that what happened in wisconsin does not happen again you know i'm proud that the cares act included 400 billion dollars in funding to help state and local governments prepare for this year's election and it's great that massachusetts massachusetts is expected to receive about 8.2 million dollars of this allocation but it's not nearly enough and it certainly didn't come near the 4 billion that that we had requested we've all heard about the possibility that covid 19th will be back in the fall and it's clear that this funding is is not going to be enough so we must be better prepared and one of uh one of the many common sense things we can do is immediately ramp up vote by mail efforts nationwide here in massachusetts we should immediately expand access to absentee ballots and early voting and implement full by mail efforts through the general election this november and in congress you know we have to provide additional financial assistance to states uh and implement voting rights standards to ensure our elections are being conducted safely and without burdensome restrictions that could include that's going to include increased access to online voter registration and extended registration deadlines uh requirement that states halt mass purges of their voting roles and robust and immediate investments in the united states postal service who will have to handle a massive surge in mail-in ballots certainly expanded in-person early voting and additional assistance to the most vulnerable people in our communities who may need more help in the fall simply put until and unless we can fully guarantee the safety of of both election workers and the public we need to expand votes by mail options you know our democracy succeeds when people participate and vote by mail will allow more people to practice their rights to vote as voters who should be choosing their elected leaders not the not the other way around okay sadly that's all the time we have for today uh i'd like to once again uh thank secretary acosta and dr zha for answering your terrific questions and sharing so much important information with us both of them are leading us through this pandemic and for that we are so grateful and thank you again to everyone for dialing in

madam speaker i rise in support of the pfas action act of 2021 because this overdue legislation will save lives we know that pfas chemicals otherwise known as forever chemicals have been linked to harmful health effects including increased rates of cancer yet for far too long they've been unchecked and unregulated now these same chemicals are being discovered at toxic levels in drinking water supplies and communities that i represent and across our country in fact as many as 200 million americans are currently drinking pfas contaminated water often without even knowing it while my home state of massachusetts has led the way in responding to pfas contaminations in recent years including the groundbreaking of a new 10 000 square foot treatment plant in my district in littleton most states are falling further and further behind leaving their residents at risk madam speaker we have the ability to change that today passage of the pfas action act will bolster state and local initiatives like those already underway in massachusetts this legislation will provide the resources and policies necessary to clean up contaminated drinking water sites support families who have been exposed to pfas chemicals and take critical steps to prevent future exposures i'm grateful to representatives dingle and upton as well as our chairman of the energy and commerce committee mr pallone for their bipartisan work on this issue and i urge my colleagues to support this legislation not because it will hurt corporations who want to continue the unregulated use of these dangerous chemicals but because the health and well-being of the hard-working families they represent are at stake if they don't thank you i yield back

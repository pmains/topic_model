joining us now to talk about South Dakota Senator John thune Senate Republican whip member of the finance committee Senator thune I just want to know uh are you going to be in that uh dark smoke-filled room with this terrible Omnibus deal that is going to be uh crazy wild uh lame duck spending or can you stop it sir well I'm I'm not in the room uh at least not in the dark smoke field room anymore but um I'm hopeful that we can stop a lot of this extraneous non-defense related spending I mean there are things we need to do for the military we all know that but the Democrats always want you to pay a ransom you want to get a little bit more in military spending then you got to give us a whole bunch more domestic spending the problem is they've got four and a half trillion dollars in these last two years since Biden took office in spending outside of the regular appropriation process they should have funded their entire agenda there is no reason why we ought to be able we ought to be have to give them additional increases plus UPS in non-defense related spending in order to get an increase that we that we need in our military well so you know they're going to scratch every liberal left-wing itch there's no question about that we know that I guess my first question to you Senator thune is wouldn't it be better to go with a CR continuing resolution and wait until next year to give a full-fledged 23 budget 2023 budget regular order appropriation hearings which you haven't had in the Senate you know liberals and conservatives can argue about levels of spending and the merits of these programs they had one in the house but not in the Senate wouldn't it be better to go with a CR and then a full-fledged uh regular order budget exercise next year and that could happen and we will be much better off with the Republican house for sure writing a budget the question is would they when would they be able to get to it you know this is we're into 2023 the fiscal year started October October 1. but here's the thing the the challenge we have and this is why I'm a I am a passionate advocate of budget reform um we don't do Appropriations bills right I mean this is the the Democrats use this to their advantage they back us up to Christmas and then it's either okay you vote for this increase in domestic spending or we shut the government down and and that's that is the the problem that we have is the 12 appropriation bills none of which was acted upon earlier this year now gets all balled up we're heading into the Christmas holiday and the Democrats try to use that as leverage to get a huge plus up in in spending and and that's where again how this gets resolved remains to be seen But there is to your point uh some logic certainly in you know doing a continuing resolution funding to last year's level and then having this having this litigated next year with a republican house the question I think is will the Democrats you know are they are they desperate enough to get a deal this year that they are willing to keep from increasing dramatically increasing the domestic spending in exchange for getting some additional defense spending which Republicans in the Senate desperately want to see happen well look at I mean I don't know I've gone both ways as Senator theme but you know if I had to wait if I had to close the government down for a couple weeks in order to get real reforms or Cuts God forbid Cuts in domestic spending if I had to wait a couple weeks to pay the interest on 10-year bonds because we all know it's going to get paid I think I would all right that's I'm A desperate man for budgetary restraint and inflation restraint because the two go together as you well know I may why not call their Bluff take them to the edge I and and it's very pop and I mean I'm I'm just I think there anything right now is on the table I don't know how this is going to play out a lot of it's going to depend on how willing the Democrats are like I said before uh if they want to get a deal to not you know blow it up with all kinds of new non-defense related spending and you know to your to your point I think this all impacts you look at inflation just the the massive flood of spending in the last couple of years is is there's no doubt no question that that has contributed to and been largely responsible for the run-up that we've seen in inflation this has implications you know well beyond this year we're 30 trillion dollars in debt uh 122 percent of GDP uh we need desperately need spending reforms we need budget reforms for this country and uh and we're gonna have to deal with those issues because the Day of Reckoning is coming and you know the sooner we deal with that the better I'm hopeful that next year when we get Republican control the house will be in a better position at least to use that leverage to try and get some of these things that we we need to to get done but at the end of the day we have to have an orderly process that allows this work to get done earlier in the year we can't get up against the Christmas holiday and just then have them say you know take this or leave it or we're going to shut the government down well I'm just thinking I don't know that you need budget reforms I think you just need to use the budget rules that are there and are never used I mean I call it regular order I mean we've had this conversation with Kevin Kramer and other Senators that's all we don't use it anymore we don't have a budget resolution from the Senate we don't have the 12 appropriation subcommittee hearings in the Senate we don't have any of that stuff the public doesn't know and I'm sorry you can't make the dark-filled uh you know smoke-filled room but that's not a good way to do it I mean I think you would agree with me that's not a good way to do it there's no taxpayer transparency there nobody no you know it's a coin of phrase nobody's going to know what's in that bill until we actually write it and even then you know know what's in that bill last word well so here but here's here's my my point to you is the problem with the current budget law and with the Appropriations process for that matter too is there's no consequence of not doing it and that's why we've got to reform the budget process so that there is actually some cost Associated you missed the deadlines you blow by the deadlines we don't do a budget resolution we never do budget resolutions then we don't do appropriation bills and then here we are at the end of the year with the Democrats holding the good cards because they you know they use the year-end as leverage this is the way Schumer and the Democrats and Pelosi in the house like to run things because it puts you in a crisis mode and the only way we're going to fix that is to start dealing with these issues in the front end earlier in the year and I think in order to do that if you're gonna you've got to have some some enforcement mechanisms in there and they just don't exist today sequestration look I yeah yes yes when I was a child during the Reagan years we had Graham Rudman Hollings and we we had budget caps and we had you violated sequestration across the board and it worked it worked it actually turned the current Services Baseline down I'm running out of time but I think it's got to be something around that uh I don't know the I mean anyway that would be my there is in in that and that is you're right I mean and you got but you have to have something across the board constraints spending across the board and that that worked then and it worked in 2011 with a budget Control Act for a couple years yes you got it you got to put something there's got to be a consequence mean nasty and brutish budget cuts me nasty and Bruno Senator John thune thank you sir as always thank

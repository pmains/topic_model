and John how Eisner Fox 11 News okay how thank you very much congressman brad Sherman lives a mile and a half from that leak he also represents that area as well you heard some of the concerns of your constituents your neighbors there lots of them still fearful of going back lots of mistrust there is it safe to go back to that area for residents to go back probably safe there's one more test that should be done model where they start before they start the seven-day clock they ought to do testing of indoor air in a sample of homes they've agreed to do that but they started the seven-day clock before they completed it and I want to see whether benzene volatile organic compounds have somehow found their way into couches into carpets that would be the last thing to test for a ride they're confident that they can go ahead with this they're probably right but they ought to do this one other element of testing just a month ago though you were out there saying I don't know if this will ever be safe the area did you mean for fur well I didn't know when they would be able to seal this well it's they had this relief well there was supposed seal it in February I wasn't absolutely confident that they could do it they thought they could do it they had to hit from a mile and a half an eight inch pipe right so I that's why I supported them doing the second relief well which now they won't be they won't need so what needs to be done from here on out you're calling for regulations or more regulation on that SoCal gas facility what exactly do you mean nationwide we ought to have much tougher standards you know fisma the relevant federal agency has the authority to have standards they don't have any the dogger standards which is the state agency were so weak that this is a 65 year old well it used to have a subsurface safety valve on it in 1979 they took the water dive off and and threw it away that's those are really bad standards that we got 114 other Wells up there on that hill at the end of the day though which agency is it because there's a whole bunch here I mean ones coming up with the standards one supposed to inspect to make sure that those standards are followed someone drop the ball here dogger had very weak standards the federal government left it to the state agency to have stained when the state agency had very weak standards but mostly SoCal gas they're the ones running the facility they're the ones that threw away the subsurface safety valve many of your neighbors and consistent just say just shut it down can you just shut this facility down and would you stand behind them and calling for it to be completely just shut down well right now it is in effect shut down they're not putting any more gas and I shut down for good I one could imagine being able to that a few years from now but right now all ninety percent of our natural gas storage for the whole LA area is Aliso Canyon the facility is little really too big to fail so if we're going to we're going to have to balance natural gas reliability on the one hand with safety but I don't think they should put more gas in that facility until they take the steps to make sure it's safe you live a mile and a half away did you suffer any effects do you believe from as far as I know my family and I have not suffered any effects we've smelled it on occasion we rely on the big filters that were provided by the gas company our next door neighbor has asthma he's been out for months well that's good news we want to ask you the latest on the terror investigation as you know there was a lot of controversy over the federal government asking Apple for help to hack the iphone of Syed Farook which Apple is fighting what you say about this I think apples and the wrong in this case it's not like they're being asked to put a backdoor in every Apple phone they're being asked to hack this one phone they think they create a backdoor it will be able to don't have to show that they can take the phone and give the government the data they don't have to show the government how they were in but they see this is what they're saying the master key exists and now they have the master key is in the safe at Apple than Apple has nothing to complain about but then what happens when you know the federal government asks for Apple to hack into a phone of a you know a drug dealer or a street criminal or does the federal government have the right to hack into if you get along with you get a won't look with a warrant they can come into your house if they can come into your house they can come into your home you can come into your house but they can't break into your safe you can't be they can't they come up with something that you Britain get in warrants are used to break into safes all the time and they can get the safe company to tell them how to break in the safer they can just drill into the safe what the they got a balanced law enforcement and privacy and the balancer is the court system when the court issues a warrant that weren't ought to be carried out one of our viewers asked this yesterday why does the federal government not have with its vast resources the ability to do this or why do they have to ask Apple why not ask another third-party this is very difficult to the technology favors those who are doing the encryption and I think it takes apple skills to do this obviously they'd be the best at doing it I don't know what the other alternatives are what happens if China and Russia will also have access to this backdoor cave I mean that's apples argument here that it wouldn't just be for this one phone in this one case it doesn't matter in that China a Chinese government order could come down no matter how the American order is and the Chinese government can go to apple and say we need this or that or you will not be able to do business in our country and Apple will have to make a decision then the difference is here we have an independent court system here we have a democracy these are court orders that I think are legitimate I don't have the same thing to say about the Chinese court system

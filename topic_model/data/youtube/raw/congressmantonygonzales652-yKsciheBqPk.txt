um we've heard reports that haitian migrants are being dropped off at a gas station in del rio what's the reaction of the community can you tell us sure haitians being haitians being smuggled through del rio is not a new topic is not a new issue for many of us that live and operate along the border this has been happening for months now the scale in which it happened this past week was unprecedented but haitians coming through is not is not a new issue unfortunately when border patrol has limited resources and they're completely overwhelmed they're forced to use catch and release this is the last thing any of us want is is somebody that is is apprehended and then just released into the community a small community like del rio cannot handle it and it's a reason why so many people have had enough it's it's time for joe biden to show up at the border declare this a national emergency and help those those americans that are just trying to get through this crisis

rise in support of the amendment to require the secretary of the interior to conduct supplemental onshore oil and gas lease sales by the end of 2022 the byte administration went 18 months without holding quarterly lease sales as required by the mineral leasing act that failure to hold lease sales has contributed to high gasoline and natural gas prices record inflation and it's increased our dependence on foreign adversaries when the secretary finally was forced to hold sales in june she reduced the available acreage by 80 percent senate be in order mr president this amendment would require the secretary to hold supplemental resales this year offering the previously deferred acreage which has gone through multiple rounds already of environmental review instead of pleading with dictators in other countries to increase oil and gas production we should expand american production my amendment will do just that for people who care about the pain at the pump i would ask other senators to join in support ms

it's been james Clyburn of South Carolina mr. whip thank you so much for this what it I guess as a logic question how do you keep protections against people or people with pre-existing conditions and protections up to kids who are 26 year olds children of them how do you do a lot if you have no plan it doesn't make sense no plan no adjustment thank you so much for having me present and the fact remains this president has once again mislead the American people he said time and time again that he would protect people with pre-existing conditions and we are told that 52 million Americans are under 65 have pre-existing conditions that would make them ineligible for the affordable care act so it would seem to me that the first thing you ought to be doing is improving what we have already done he says there will be the Republican Party is going to be the party of health care he has not shown us what that means he says repeal and replace he talks repeal all day every day I have never heard him offer one suggestion as team replacement on yesterday Democrats had the press promised around 2:30 in the afternoon and we lay it out for the American people what we're going to do to improve the Affordable Care Act and this president has now been pushing these junk policies we are going to get rid of junk policies we are going to get rid of attempt not to cover people with pre-existing conditions we are gonna say to those people in these communities whose children are born with diabetes that you will be able to bring those children onto your insurance policy and children who are still in college they can stay on your insurance policy until they're 26 years old if you're doing anything it seems to me you ought to be lifting the 26 to around 30 if it goes the way the economy's going at this president if I have trouble finding jobs well it's hard to ask you a question like this but what's the politics in this for him I I mean one thing that unites all communities in this country is health care certainly the whole issue of Medicare Medicaid is very popular in the country for people of limited means people have all of Alzheimer's and their family they need help with Medicaid all kinds of middle-class people not just working poor people those programs are very essential to the livelihood of most American families except for the very rich yes that's quite true in fact we know for a fact that the largest form of bankruptcy in the country is over health care people the cost of it and so what we ought to be doing is working together to show up the affordable care act naked at the time the program that it should be to protect American families that's what we've always done in this country we said that the day we passed the bill that it was a first step there mentally will get to where we need to be but all of a sudden now this president want to go back to where we were when insurance companies could deny coverage to people with pre-existing condition and also kick people off the policies once they got sick we they've gotten rid of all of that and I believe that American people should remember that old adage fool me once shame on me on you kinda next twice shame on me it's so well it's well said next time we have you on I want you to explain to me South Carolina what is he got both a knee down there you got Lindsey Graham you got a what a collection well I'm still learning the state Chris I've already been there for 70 plus years thank you learning thank you the best band down there thank you so much

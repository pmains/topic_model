Thank You mr. chairman this amendment addresses Dhaka amendment 24 31 will exempt those in the deferred action for childhood arrivals program also known as daca recipients from the harsh criminal provision provisions included in Section three one for my colleagues have clearly explained the devastation this legislation would cause for millions of our neighbors by cruelly criminalizing nearly all undocumented people I would like to emphasize one specific group that would be unjustly affected daca recipients these young men and women people who came to this country as children who grew up in our communities who aspire to be a part of the very fabric of our great nation who ensure are literally pursuing the American dream these people receive no exemption under this bill rather with this bill their presence in the country becomes a misdemeanor or even felony offense putting them at very real risk of criminal prosecution and possible imprisonment this bill is not just a threat to daca recipients it will have real profoundly negative consequences for all the communities we represent the concerns are not theoretical each of us have daca recipients living working and building lives in the districts we represent they are our neighbors our co-workers our children's teachers physicians and role models they're not just working in our communities many are starting new businesses and creating new jobs instead of looking to deport these dreamers we should be seeking ways to empower them to pursue their dreams and improve our nation last week I shared the story of one of these dreamers I'd like to take this opportunity to highlight another several years ago at a roundtable discussion on immigration reform I met a young dreamer named estefania her story is just one of many that underscore what is at stake in this debate and how cruel and self-defeating this legislation is a dreamer Stephanie R was brought to this country when she was just four years old she has lived in the United States virtually her whole life she grew up here went to school here graduated from college here and is now building her career helping others here the United States is unquestionably her home her green and aspirations are American Dreams her success is America's success and strengthens our community and advances our nation a stefania's story is moving but it is not unique more than 700,000 young people have received daca a national survey conducted last September to assess the impact of daca concluded that the program has benefited both the recipients as individuals and the American economy as a whole daca recipients reported substantial increases in income and wages which not only improved their lives and the lives of their family but also means they're able to purchase homes by cars and in these activities pay taxes that bolster these communities and grow our economy without daca these people would lose their jobs their homes their health insurance essentially they would lose their futures the data is clear we know these dreamers are tremendous assets to our community but this bill would label them criminals no one like a Stephanie AX who came here as a child and has lived her nearly lived here nearly her entire life should have to live in constant fear of deportation but helping daca recipients isn't just the right thing to do it's also wise economic policy it's worth repeating figures I've previously shared with this committee a recent estimate by the Cato Institute found deporting doctorate recipients could deprive the United States of over two hundred and eighty billion dollars in economic growth over the next ten years a 2016 survey found six percent of daca recipients more than forty thousand young people have started their own small business in the United States that's a rate of entrepreneurship twice as high as average Americans it's estimated that after gaining daca status more than 50 percent purchased their first car and 12 percent purchased their first home these are significant the decisions that positively contribute to our local and national economies in other words this bill without this amendment will hurt daca recipients and American workers alike we all agree our immigration system is broken but this draconian cruel bill is the absolute wrong way to fix it what we need is comprehensive gratefully formed not this mass deportation approach true bipartisan reform including increased border security long side a path to citizenship citizenship for those like estefania will grow our economy reduce our debt and strengthen our communities docu daca recipients are not criminals they are the products of our schools part of our communities and important to the future success and growth of our country I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment to make sure that we do not label these young people pursuing the American dream as criminals and I yield back the gentleman returns his time for what purpose does a gentleman from Pennsylvania seek the floor we strictly will not support the amendment in third ranking at five minutes very briefly and simply the Obama administration did not consider daca recipients to be an unlawful status therefore criminal provisions of provisions of section 314 do not apply to them and nothing yet out of this administration or Obachan Congress has done anything to change daca without I yield back the gentleman returns his time with the a germinal the gentleman from the gentlelady from California chairman I am think that mr. Schneider's amendment is not only important but necessary this bill as it's written would make the DREAM Act kids deportable it would make him a criminal every one of them a criminal as well and to believe otherwise is just incorrect and I would be happy to yield to the author of the amendment should he wish to expound upon them thank you I just wanted to clarify as my colleague indicated recipients of daca are granted deferred action not a question of status status its deferred action and I'd like to emphasize that distinction I yield back thank you I would be happy to yield to mr. Cicilline attached thank the gentlelady for yielding and I would like to rise in strong support of the gentleman's amendment I think it's important to know that this bill and the criminalization that is outlined in this bill and the reduction in procedural due process and all those things do apply to daca recipients they are not considered it is not considered a lawful status it's merely deferral of removal action based on their circumstances and as a consequence this would criminalize the daca students I think it's really important to recognize as mr. Schneider has so eloquently described these are young people who live in communities all across this country who have made enormous contributions and who did nothing wrong they were brought here or traveled here with their families as minors clearly not committing any wrongdoing have made their lives here this is the only country they know for many of these young people and the idea of deporting them to a country that they were born in after having grown up here there are as American as everyone on this committee it's also important to recognize in daca you have to in order to be in dock you have to have passed a background check you have been born after June 16th of 1981 if it had come to the United States before your 16th birthday not have lawful immigration status and be at least 15 years old have continuously lived in the United States since June of 2007 have been present here have graduated high school or obtained a GED or honorably discharged as a veteran or the coast cutter Armed Services or currently attend school on the date that the application is committed you have can't be convicted of felony offense or a significant misdemeanor and and not pose a threat to national security or public safety so these are exactly the kind of people we want in America these are law-abiding citizens that are productive that have served our country that are employed and I would like to put for the record in two record a report for the Center for American Progress how Daka has improved the lives of undocumented young people also a report called ending daca will cost states billions of dollars which outlines what the economic impact would be if we criminalize the daca children and also another report a new study of document officier shows positive economic and educational outcomes these young people have added so much to the communities we serve I think even to the President of the United States at least during his campaign said and I quote you have people in this country for 20 years they've done a great job they've done wonderfully they've gone to school they've gotten good marks they're productive now we're supposed to sell out of the country I don't believe in that that was Donald Trump in 2012 so he apparently has changed his mind or at least some members of his party have as has been indicated there are a number of estimates that deporting daca students in addition to having a obviously a devastating impact on those young people and their families which is hard to quantify but it would be devastating but in the aggregate one estimate found that deporting daca recipients could deprive the United States of over two hundred and eighty billion dollars in economic growth over the next ten years these are young people who are buying cars buying their first house contributing significantly to the economy of our country this makes no sense it's not in the best interest of the American people and I urge my colleagues to support mr. Schneider's amendment and I would with the gentleman yield I'd be happy to yield to mr. Snyder thank you I'm listening to my colleagues remarks some from the other side he indicated that doctor recipients would not be criminalized under section 314 if that is the case and we're trying to avoid confusion I want to ask if you consider supporting this amendment to put it in writing without objection the gentleman from Rhode Island's documents will be introduced into the record Thank You mr. chairman and mr. Chairman I would ask unanimous consent to put into the record a letter from the global Jewish Jewish advocacy in opposition to this bill a statement by the sisters of the Good Shepherd National Advocacy Center in opposition to this bill and report from the American immigration Council on the criminalization of immigration in the United States without objection so ordered and I yield back the ventilator returns her time and the chair recognizes himself to speak on the amendment for five minutes the subject before us the Sneijder amendment deals with daca and DAPA I didn't hear dhaba addressed very thoroughly in this discussion but I think it's important that this committee speak to the other side of this argument and recognize the contradiction that's been created this is a contradiction that didn't exist until Barack Obama gave his analysis of the limitations of the Constitution when 22 times he said he didn't have the constitutional authority to grant what I will describe as amnesty to the daca or the doppio recipients 22 times on videotape who knows how many times not on videotape and he uttered it with specific clarity before high school here in town shortly before he issued this this daca order and those were the words to a high school class they said I don't have the constitutional authority to do this I am the president that means I had the executive branch of government and we have three branches of government he also complimented the intelligence of the students at the time and he said Congress writes the laws and he said my job is to enforce the laws and the courts is to interpret the laws and it was a very compact and concise analysis of the constitutional authority vested in the three branches of government Barack Obama being a Genet constitutional professor he articulated that very well I think we may have one in this room as well and maybe not an edge-on but I would bring back to this that Congress has to pass these laws the President of the United States cannot manufacture laws at his will yet he's gotten away with this because of the difficulty in lineage meeting these executive edicts that granted a I will say a pseudo legal status to people that were unlawfully present in America and the merits that we constantly hear for daca recipients are the very finest cases that they can come up with and it's not the average in no society takes on the characteristics of it except as its exceptions and so I would point people to some of those other characteristics that we see there and and that is that there are many young people that came into this country unlawfully that crossed our border that committed that crime each one of many of these documents came across the border unlawfully that is a crime unlawful entry is a crime those that overstayed their visa not a crime but it's a violation of civil not criminal law and many of them knew what they were doing they're supposed to come in before their 16th birthday many of them will say well yes I came in before my 16th birthday but I'm now 34 35 years old and they would be covered also under this dock a language that we're discussing here today but the central point is this that we can't have both the rule of law and amnesty we can't have both respect for the rule of law and at the same time reward people for breaking it this is a contradiction on the part of the people on the other side of the aisle and a few of the people in my side of the aisle we've been trying to reconcile this for a long time but the equation that I have delivered here is precisely the way we should be obligated to think about this if your reward lawbreakers you get more lawbreakers and we can't in our job needs to be restore the respect for the rule of law that's been at the core of the immigration argument ever since Ronald Reagan let me down in 1986 and sign the amnesty act and this is the administration that promised to end daca and end appa and they should have done that on the first day of the administration should have been a January 20th function it would have been less painful that day than any day thereafter I urge the administration to do that I urge also my colleagues to vote no on a Snider amendment and I yield back the balance each other I would yield to the gentlelady from California I just like to observe that we don't agree on this point obviously but we write the law and so to argue against President Obama's use of executive authority in opposition to writing the law I think is inept and I remember i'ma gentlelady going to call me an F she can do it on our own time and I would apt that's not a word I'm comfortable with either and I would point out that the president created this scenario that we're in he created the created the conundrum that we have today did so unconstitutionally and he knew it was unconstitutional and so I returned the balance of my time when else seek the floor it is a gentleman from New York mr. Nadler I I seek the plaza I seek the floor for two purposes one to express wonderment that anybody being upset by the word inapt which is a perfectly legitimate English word and second to yield to the gentlelady from California yes mr. Chairman I am this to me is a little bit of a morality play here we have and I think most of the American people agree that if you've got someone who's been brought to this country as a child that child really doesn't have a decision I ought to tell you about someone who I know personally who was brought to the United States from the Philippines when he was under 1 year old he didn't have a decision on whether to come here he spent his whole life in the United States does not speak Tagalog and in fact thought he was an American citizen until he went to apply for a license and found out much to his chagrin that he was not actually born in the United States multiply that experience hundreds of thousands of times and you have a very compelling case for mr. Schneider's amendment should be approved I would just like to once again talk about the role of executive action which by the way the current president has done more than any other president since the Great Depression in such a short timeframe but to argue that President Obama should not have created daca has nothing to do with mr. Snyder's amendment because we are writing the law here and we have the capacity to make a moral decision that young people who had no decision to make were brought to this country who were raised in this country who are American in every respect except their paperwork should not be arrested and deported and that's simply what mr. Schneider's Amendment does now some people may think that you know the people who were brought here as babies and thought they were Americans totally applied for a license should be deported that there's something morally wrong with them but to say that there's something incorrect or somehow impermissible about this exercise is simply incorrect and I it's mr. an average time but I'm sure that he would go through the gentleman from Illinois thank you again I just want to raise the question for my colleague from Pennsylvania but if it is true that nothing here would criminalize the status in section 31 four I'm hoping we would get bipartisan support for this amendment that would make it clear that they would not be included by anything covered here and I'm hoping I could get an answer mr. Chen I'll yield to the gentleman from Illinois the other gentleman from Illinois one of the many other gentlemen in Illinois so much first of all just for I thought inapt was a pretty good word not suitable kind of incorrect all it really means I know English is my second language but I thought I'd look it up for everybody here it's really a pretty nice word we said liar hypocrite silly here inept seems pretty normal not very very very good biting yeah wasn't but inept for those learning English languages just means not suitable I don't think anybody's words going to be taken down with the gym bag he'll sure Oh yield to the gentleman from I thank the gentleman from New York and Illinois it was an entirely suitable argument if the president hadn't created daca and DAPA we wouldn't have the subject before us here today that is my point it was apt not inept to bring up that argument I returned my time Oh video to the gentleman from Illinois yes on Mars I thank the gentleman from New York so look they had the majority had an opportunity to go to federal court and yet they decided not to they challenged every other one of President Obama's executive orders every last one of them this one they did when President Obama tried to expand on daca and DAPA they went to court they left the 750,000 recipients of daca alone I think that speaks volumes of course now what they figured they couldn't win in court either judicially or in the court of public opinion they want to win here today mr. chairman come to the gentleman from Illinois seek recognition I do I move to strike the last word I'm going to recognize for five minutes you so much so this has been a long process I want to thank mr. Snyder I want to thank the congresswoman from California um zoloft ah from making the argument I think it's an important one now what I really think is so upsetting about this is that 750,000 people who came here as children that is this is the Judiciary Committee we probably would not put responsibility for children for coming with their parents to the United States as children since they didn't have any choice in the matter came to this country now they pledge allegiance to the same flag my children pledge allegiance to the only country that they know and for the most part the only language that they speak is English the same language that my children speak they're American in everything in terms of their loyalty in terms of who they are and everything but a simple piece of paper and one day hopefully sooner than later will get them that piece of paper the point being is they did exactly what most people think they should do they registered with the government now in order to register with the government what did they have to do they had to provide their fingerprints so that they could go through an exhaustive background check and will did the background check what's going to be a lot more thorough than the background checks that the ice officers are going to have to go through because they went through a background check by the law enforcement security officers of the United States of America the FBI and they found their records to be cleaned and in cecal so they were given what a Pell Grant no the right to any public services no what they're giving is the opportunity to get a work permit so they get a social security card so they could work go to school and pay taxes and yet not be able to derive any of the benefits that those tax dollars go to none and here's what we have and this is why I'm happy congressman Schneider brought it up in Chicago we got young people who right now this month are graduating you know what they're graduating from medical school they're getting ready to be doctors others are doctors and I assure you they take excellent care of those of us that were born in the United States of America thousands of them are school teachers across the United States of America helping to educate and having a true vocation for inspiring our young people to knowledge I think school teachers nurses doctors engineers and they're all paying taxes I think the real problem here is when you strip everything away and you allow people to come forward you see that most Americans don't see them as something demonic don't see them as people who have what is it watermelons on their legs crossing the borders you know see them as human beings see them as their neighbors I'm happy that they've come forward because in coming forward what they have done is they truly instructed the rest of us and who they are now the President of the United States does have the discretion I'm happy he used the discretion and I would just like to add the following the only reason this isn't in law is because the actual Republican sponsors of the DREAM Act when it came up for a vote refused to vote for cloture let's be clear the Republican sponsors of the DREAM Act refused to vote for cloture because they were pressured by their extreme right-wing I think that's unfortunate but we have seen that happen time and time again when I joined the Judiciary Committee just for those who weren't here I remember coming here what eight years ago and there was one hearing after another hearing about how it was we were going to reform the immigration system both sides of the aisle both sides of the argument wherever when I introduced immigration reform in 2004 Paul Ryan the current Speaker of the House yes was a co-sponsor of comprehensive immigration reform and he joined me in Chicago I think it's unfortunate that were at this place today one just recently we were at a play give us a vote any day of the week any week of the month any month of the year on immigration reform of the DREAM Act give us a boat and it will pass the House of Representatives with a Republican majority give us the vote they will not give us the boat because they don't want to resolve the problem they wanted as a polemic to use for electoral advantage mr. chairman I'm the gentleman has expired purposes gentleman from Washington seek recognition to strike the last word almost recognized for five minutes Thank You mr. chairman I want to first thank my colleague from Illinois mr. Schneider for introducing this amendment it is an incredibly important amendment I think if the argument from the other side is that none of these folks are going to be caught up in this bill they're not going to be criminalized and all the more reason to pass it it seems like the smart thing to do to make sure that we provide some assurances to the daca students around this country who frankly are living in fear because there have been people who have been picked up and it is extremely unclear to many of our daca students whether or not they are in limbo whether or not their status is going to be honored and so I would hope that that's a reason to actually have this amendment the second thing I want to say is you know there are many things in immigration reform and immigration law and policies that are seen as controversial the status of 11 million undocumented immigrants how we deal with detention deportation there are things that are controversial but the dreamers are not controversial the vast majority of Americans across this country from both parties actually believe that we should allow these young people to integrate into our economies to be here and to stay here because most people understand that many of them didn't even know that they were undocumented until they were teenagers or until they applied to go on a field trip with their schools and we're told by their parents that they actually couldn't go so this is a I think a group of people who have made their case to the American people and the American people have said yes we believe that you should be able to stay and so I think that is a really important distinction about why I hope out of all the amendments that we put forward today that this would be at least one amendment that we could agree to on a bipartisan basis the third thing I want to say is I just want to congratulate my colleague famila the other colleague from Illinois who I worked with for so many years and seen be such a fearless champion on this issue for the comments he just made because let's think about why exactly we are in the position where the president the last president of the United States had to pass daca and DAPA it was because we tried over and over again and with Republican support not on a partisan basis but on a bipartisan basis to bring a bill to the floor to make this law to not make it an executive order but now to say that the reason that we shouldn't do this is because this was done through executive order seems to completely ignore the fact that actually for years and years there were Republicans and Democrats who were willing to vote on this bill but then were talked into not bringing it forward even for a vote on cloture or voting against it for cloture because the leadership said don't do this now I think that this is a moment for us all to say hey maybe there's some small thing that we can actually work on on immigration that brings us together and to me it is it would be an enormous sign of the understanding of the pain that daca students are in across this country now let's be clear they're not going to be devoid of pain because most daca students are in families with undocumented parents and so I think about the child who told me that he stands with his hands up against the glass window waiting to see if his parents are going to come back at night or whether they're going to be deported we have families that are putting together emergency plans for what to do if their parents are deported hard-working people who was sometimes in their communities for decades and who have been doing the work that this country is asked of them and because we have not fixed the problems with our immigration system because we have not taken on the underlying question of comprehensive immigration reform they are sacrificed like sacrificial lambs so mr. Chairman I would really urge my colleagues on both sides to support this amendment if you're not afraid that it's going to you know that this bill is going to criminalize doctoral students then let's support the amendment let's make absolutely sure let's send a message forward and I hope that my friend from Idaho would actually speak for this amendment because I believe that this is something that everybody agrees on Thank You mr. chairman I do yield so much I just want to make too quick I don't think I made it absolutely clear it failed in November the DREAM Act which would have been much more broader failed in the Senate because Republican senators who were sponsors of the DREAM Act refused to vote for cloture that means it had a majority of senators more than 50 senators for it actually 54 and I also one point I didn't make very clear it passed the DREAM Act let that contact in the House of Representatives right in November of 2012 I'm and gentleman has expired question is on the amendment offered by I'd like to strike the last word it was recognized for five minutes I thank you let me associate myself with the eloquent statement of the gentlelady from Washington and the gentleman from Illinois has offered this very thoughtful amendment as my good friend congressman Gutierrez mentioned or at least I'm sure that he did there's been a long constructive history of fighting for daca and having it passed by Republicans and Democrats but more importantly there is a long credible history of the dynamic recipients of daca men and women in the United States military scholars of all levels teachers doctors lawyers individuals who've been able to complete their college education engineers employees of the federal government so many individuals have been able to benefit and going on to contribute to not only the society but the greater good of this nation the bulk of daca recipients in adopt as well that did not move as quickly have been constructive vital wonderful citizens or son status individuals with status document daca in the United States and section 314 is a wide reaching and extensive I'm trying to use a word acceptable for the record but fishing net that will grab anyone walking along the streets with a briefcase a book Bank mathematical tools of going on to NASA Johnson to begin their training as an astronaut anybody will be grabbed up that is a doc a person because they may be criminalized because they are unstacked now the argument regarding the executive order look at the history the executive order was not written until time after time at the time we put this bill on the floor of the house but more importantly the good news is that we now have the power to turn that executive order into appropriate law and to therefore not have young people for the first time be a criminal a felon because they are unlawful presence and that is what we would do the section makes it a crime for a person of many different aspects of it but unlawful presence and that would be considered possibly a daca individual and so this amendment only Gerdes these individuals to not be snatched out of a ph.d program or in the middle of a reasonable research lab trying to find the cure for cancer to be able to contribute to the United States so I can't imagine why this simple exception well-thought-out amendment by the gentleman from Illinois protecting children young people the talented group of nation builders if you will and pursuant to our understanding that immigrants have helped build this nation I'd ask my colleagues to take a simple clarification and I hope the audience is only laughing in support and not laughing in mockery for those who are sitting in the audience because this is not a joke it is a serious effort to save lives and I'd be happy to yield to the gentleman from Illinois thank you and I appreciate your good words in closing I want to say for the record that I am disappointed that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle won't answer the simple question I oppose now we've posted three times if you believe that section 314 does not apply to daca recipients why not support this amendment does the gentlewoman yield back I've yielded to the gentleman mr. Snyder I yield a question so he yields back to me is anyone prepared to answer the question mr. Snyder then the question goes unanswered if you believe that it doesn't cover a doctor young people wise not support this amendment that in and himself should indicate the fallacy of this underlying legislation I yield back question occurs on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois all those in favor is bond by saying aye aye those opposed no the chair the noes have it amendment is not agreed to ask for a recorded vote or vote is requested in the clerk will call the roll mr.

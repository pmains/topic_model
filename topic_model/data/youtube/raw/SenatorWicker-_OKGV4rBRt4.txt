funny now local shipbuilders keeping an eye on Washington as the president looks over a bill that could bring more work to south Mississippi Jonathan Brandon is live with details that's exactly right and it could bring significantly more work to South Mississippi especially right here at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula this is all the result of a bill called the National Defense Authorization Act that's something that senator Roger wicker has been behind and it is now going across the President's desk he is expected to sign it and it could expand the Navy let me tell you about how much it's going to expand the Navy if it is signed right now the Navy has 278 ships in its fleet this Act would increase that by almost 80 ships would bring the ship total to 355 ships in the Navy's fleet but on top of that it would also increase the budget that is specifically designated for shipping with the Navy it would increase that by more than five billion dollars then the president had originally planned for in his budget so this is all going across the President's desk he is expected to sign it so we'll see what happens when he takes that pin to the paper as we have seen in the past he is likely to sign this bill that has to do with military expansion and like I said it could be big business for Ingalls Shipbuilding and other shipbuilders across the country if this is signed today and we'll let you know we'll keep you up to date on air and online at WX Khammam Johnathan Brannon live in Pascagoula but to be a little X news now

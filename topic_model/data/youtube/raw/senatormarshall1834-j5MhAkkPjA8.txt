and president this week after waiting more than 20 years amelia earhart statue will replace fellow atchison kansas native and former united states senator john ingles in the national statue sanctuary hall collection emilia will join president dwight david eisenhower our nation's 34th president and abilene kansas native as one of kansas two tributes statues in the capitol building president eisenhower's likeness was placed in the capitol rotunda in 2003 but amelia's journey to our nation's capital has taken much longer kansans and especially the people of atchison persevered just as amelia did in her pursuit of flight to coordinate and create a bronze statue and limestone base an appropriate nod to our state's signature natural stone it was 85 years ago this month amelia earhart vanished over the vast pacific ocean she'd already completed more than three-fourths of her trip which would have made her the first pilot ever to circle the earth at its equator emilia already had made history before this flight she was the first person to fly solo from hawaii to the united states mainland the first woman to fly solo across the atlantic and the first woman to fly non-stop across the united states defying odds and expectations with each new accomplishment she became a global superstar and one of the most accomplished pilots in history while amelia was a pioneer of aviators everywhere she is still today a role model for every person but especially for women and young girls who strive to break barriers and achieve their dreams despite the odds being against them in my home state of kansas amelia's legacy lives on and continues to know no limits kansas is home to the air capital of the world for good reason our state has been home to many aviation manufacturers over the course of a century and on any given summer's day with eyes to the sky you can see crop dusters flying low dodging trees and power lines diving up on acres and acres of cropland and looking further upward you might see hobby pilots or executive jets and often you will hear screeching fighter bombers and giant jet refuellers but to see them you have to strain your eyes forward of the booming sound indeed our spacious land is well fitted for spacious runways and our far away horizons that provide endless visibility that goes on for miles upon miles signaling kansas remain the nation's leader in aerospace and drone development i want to go back for a moment to a young amelia being brought up in the heartland yes kansas is where nine-year-old amelia first took to flight listen to the story inspired by the exhibit she saw at the 1904 world's fair she built by herself a makeshift roller coaster and recall again she's nine years of age in this story she launched her coaster off the roof of her house and after tipping over the edge of the roof line she said it felt like i was flying 16 years later she purchased her own plane and flew to new heights today i also want to honor the people of atchison who have taken to great lengths to preserve and tell amelia's story for all americans to hear my wife and i not too long ago enjoyed a great day visiting visiting her perfectly preserved birth home but the star of the show for a visit i must go see for everybody especially american history buffs is the new amelia earhart hangar museum which honors amelia's aviation legacy and inspires all generations in the pursuit of flight the centerpiece is muriel the world's last remaining lockheed electra tinny an aircraft identical to the plane amelia flew on her final flight muriel is named for amelia's younger sister grace muriel earhart morrissey but what i'm really excited about at the museum is the immersive stem exhibits which take visitors through earhart's adventurous life from growing up in natchez and kansas to the height of our worldwide fame as the first woman to fly solo across the atlantic ocean every school within busting distance has to plan a field trip to atchison in the coming year and parents should be fighting for that chance to chaperone them and finally i want to salute atchison's annual festival in honor of amelia which i attended just a couple weekends ago celebrating her life and achievements with history lessons concerts downtown arts and crafts a world-class fireworks extravaganza and luncheon honoring the amelia earhart pioneering achievement award recipient it was therefore the first time i connected with the legend of amelia and why the hometown folks nearly 130 years after her birth fight to preserve her legacy and especially how much she means to the ladies in the community amelia flew to new heights and traveled longer distance than ever before and today americans everywhere are joining atchisonians and kansans as we all honor amelia this week out of a shared admiration for her innovative pioneer spirit her fellow atchistan native and statutory predecessor john eagles coined the motto of our state at astra peraspera which means to the stars through difficulties amelia earhart personified that model pushing against social boundaries set for women and breaking new records in flight not just for a woman but for all aviators for generations to come her spirit and her likeness in statutory hall will inspire not only kansans but all visitors from around the world thank you madam president and i yield back

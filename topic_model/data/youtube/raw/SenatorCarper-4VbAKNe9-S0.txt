Senator Tom Carper is a Democrat from Delaware and joins us now sir it's good to have you with us the president offering a series of olive branches so to speak to business after two years of locking horns is it working or in your estimation is it a little is this a little too late to make it work I think we're starting to see a good good I always like to say that a major will not the only role of government is to provide a nurturing environment for job creation job preservation we expect companies to play by the rules would be good corporate citizens but at the end of the day if we're pro jobs we can't be anti-business I think it presidents got that message she's making it very clear the president continuing to focus on projects and in his catchphrase to win the future while Republicans and even some Democrats grumbling about his budget which essentially is kicking the can down the road especially when it comes to dealing with the big ticket items items like entitlements and defense so are these two camps talking past each other when it comes to the situation over the big picture of the budget i think the the House Republicans are feeling some heat from there right then a lot of folks you sent them to Washington they feel like they need to deliver on the commitments they made on the campaign trail now that they've done that my hope is that more rational heads will will prevail we if we're going to reduce the deficits and we clearly need to do that we need to address spending domestic discretionary spending defense discretionary spending I think the entitlement programs need to be on the table we need to raise revenues it's going to take a combination of all of those things senator Carper as I understand that you've joined a bipartisan group of senators who want to give the president the power of a line item veto so why is that important and do you think it can get done I started working as some 18 19 years ago when I was a my last year in the house before I became governor of delaware the governor i had line and veto power virtually every governor in the country has lied and veto power the year Congress passed a 96 and sent to the president leiden veto power that was unconstitutional was way over overboard and what Senator McCain and I and others have come back with and said when the president signs and appropriations bill the spending bill into law he or she would have a certain number of days 45 days to send back to us a message that says I've sign this bill into law but there's some areas that I think we ought to reduce spending or eliminate spending we would have to vote on it we have to vote on it and that provides some accountability for both the executive side and the legislative side it's not your balance the budget but it's a good things a good tool to have in the toolbox all right so line-item veto explanation right there I want to talk to you though about what we're watching Wisconsin the governor their governor walker and also Governor Christie in New Jersey who were both Republicans who got elected on a platform of making very painful cuts to their state budgets so when are we going to see that kind of approach in Washington BC when we need to make the painful cuts necessary and also coming up with the difference between what is stimulus and what is waste the the president said what we need to do is to freeze over all domestic discretionary spending that's the non-defense part of the discretionary budget freeze it over the next five years it would save about 400 billion dollars it's a good starting point the what we need what I thought to convince the President to do and my colleagues in the Senate Democrat and Republican is to create what I call Thomas a culture of thrift I know everything I do I can do better and the things same is true of Lee all these federal programs that we have whether their domestic or discretionary or entitlement programs we gotta look in every nook and cranny of the federal government and ask the question can we get better results for less money and if so how can we do that when I was a governor of my state we used to share ideas with all the other states and steal their good ideas for doing just that getting better results for less money and we can do that in health care we can do that in defense spending we can do it in a lot of domestic problems as well yeah there's got to be a way to make the words cutting and savings not dirty words that's where we need a culture of thrift I think most people think we have in Washington culture of spendthrift we need to replace that with a culture of tripped all right son Senator Tom Carper of Delaware senator Carper great to have you on today we appreciate your time thank you Tom

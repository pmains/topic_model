first I'd like to address the role of Congress with regard to international agreements there are those who think that it is our duty as members of Congress to rubber-stamp or at least approve of any important international agreement the number one international agreement left to deal with in this administration is TPP it is the number one of jet remaining objective of this president it is certainly the most important international vote that we will cast I do not think any member should vote for or against TPP based on the view that we should transfer our responsibilities to the executive branch you should vote for against TPP based on whether it's in the interests of the United States in your own conscience and likewise that would apply to other agreements that are put before us and I will not question the judgment or constitutional constitutional dedication of anyone who votes one way or the other on TPP as to the Iran nuclear deal this bill does not violate it it would be a violation if it sought to punish European banks for loaning money to air Iran the bill does not do that what it does is it says that financing to Iran which was never promised in Geneva never promised in Vienna will not be provided by American banks to purchase aircraft that's important because these aircraft are used to take weapons and material and and balcombe fighters from the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps to iran to syria where they kill people it's important because we should not expose our banks to the risk of billions or tens of billions as the gentlelady from California points out of risk that Iran will not pay them as Iran has defaulted on many of its international commercial obligations and finally we should not have a situation where banks on Wall Street are here lobbying saying make this or that concession to Iran or they won't pay their debts to American banks and then we'll have and then you'll have to bail them out now it is said that because the agreement contains language saying everybody should work together that we have an obligation to over perform to do far more than we ever promised what did I ran do how did they interpret that same provision within a month of signing the agreement they violated UN Security Council resolutions to test missiles for the sole purpose of being able to deliver a payload to Europe and eventually to the United States Iran at best is living within the exact letter of this agreement the only time they did anything more was they accelerated the day on which they would get their money but other than that they have not done anything beyond the exact letter of the agreement and neither should we not for a country responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of refugees in Syria so uh you can think one way or the other of the Iran nuclear deal but when the president presented it to us he said he was going to be tough in carrying it out give no quarter when it comes to Iran supporting terrorism and certainly not make gifts to Iran while it's a terrorist state beyond those required by the agreement let's not expose American depositors and banks to the risk that they will not be paid tens of billions of dollars by Iran not so let's not create tens of billions of reasons for Wall Street to become a political ally of Iran in order to get repaid and let us not abdicate our constitutional responsibilities as found in the article one the only place in the Constitution that talks about international commerce I yield back gentleman yields back who seeks recognition for what purpose is the gentleman from Arizona seek recognition this chamber like to strike

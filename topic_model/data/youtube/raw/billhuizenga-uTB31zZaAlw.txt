the gentleman from Michigan is recognized for five minutes mr. Chairman I deeply appreciate that in my other colleagues that are on the committee allow me to sneak out of our other hearing and come here so i just want to get this straight we just heard that in battling our climate footprint having regulations in conflict like this help move along in a more predictable and cheaper way american business there are clear rules of the road and and that your employees have become more productive as you've been trying to build your businesses i'm just curious what your response is to that and if we can start with mr. chard ok so we're more productive at less cost etc I don't think regulations actually accomplish that let me say that we support strong health and safety regulations based on sound science that protect consumers and by the way if I can just yeah it's kind of sad that every right now but decisively Marin actually okay you're looking at the grandson of a man who was part of the original sit-down strikes with Oldsmobile in Flint Michigan mm-hmm all right my family is directly tied to those first needs of safety and concern for employees we are well beyond a discussion about safety for employees when we're talking about the EPA and do II not getting on the same sheet of music here and as you're as you're dealing with your regulations but please frankly go ahead so we aren't asking for regulations to be eased in regard to health and safety we're asking for them to be worked on in partnership with industry so that they don't end up being unnecessarily burdensome and complex a more complex program does not always compute to a better program understanding that nothing has changed in regard to the materials that we're delivering or that our workers are handling it's simply more complicated and now we have they have to be trained they have got a lot more training they have to be using different systems we've taken perfectly good printers and and I'm a huge advocate for sustainability and we've had to throw them away they've been observing a little bit of irony there so not nothing good has come out of this particular regulation as far as health and safety goes mr. Sherwood's congressman first I would submit to you that we would never would have won World War two we had I'll start over congressman I would submit to you we never would have one more award to add we had half these regulations in place but having said that uh we are in a global marketplace a friend of mine was recently in a foundry in China and they were pouring molten metal without shoes and he asked him how can they not have on safety equipment and the response was there's 20 people that want that particular job so we have to absorb that we have this an unlevel playing it's a very unlevel playing field and what we're doing is we're pushing jobs offs over up we're pushing jobs to China we're pushing jobs to India where they don't have these regulations so and mr. Anderson I'm assuming that hiring consultants to figure out the labyrinth of new federal regulations is not exactly viewed as job growth correct no it is not we we met with their we wear many hats in our company I were a lot of hats myself it's it's not easy reading through 6,000 pages of regulatory rules that's that stack over there and again this was just februari and by the way februari there was a federal holiday so thank the Lord because there would be another stack on top of here so yeah we we absorb all the costs of regulatory so as far as reducing the cost or making us more competitive regulations don't do that for structural concepts and and to increase energy efficiency in our product we typically have to go to the next technical components take it from the fluorescent light to an LED light and we have to wait for that that lifecycle curve for the cost to come down and and with the speed at which all this stuff is coming at us that life cycle cost gets pushed into our product it will come down and it has come down but we still have to absorb a lot of that cost is mr. chairman I'm coming from industrial states like Ohio and Michigan and even that little place called Indiana down below as I think the the states and the people that come from states that build things understand what it means to have a supply chain and I think so often these regulations don't reflect that reality and I'm sure all three of you have dealt with that and I know going to structural concepts that's been expressed explicitly I you you know it's not just good enough to have a product to use you then have to have people are going to manufacture it you're then going to have to people are going to be supplying it and you have to have critical mass on it you have to then re-engineer all of your all of your equipment is that not maybe just in closing you can touch on that and again thank you yeah we two for 2017 or even the EPA we will have to go through and look at every single refrigeration component in each of our four hundred are actually priced 600 models now that is no small chore machine sighs compartments can change physical the physical cabinets inside can change dimensions so we'll have to change the whole products torture potentially it is it is not an easy task to accomplish this thank you very much gentleman's time has expired

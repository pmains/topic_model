Thank You mr. chairman and the ranking member yeah chance to travel to India with the the chairman of the subcommittee as well as the chairman of the full committee last year and then recently returned to India a few months ago and you still feel this sense of optimism in India the sense that you know the the economy while it's not a straight shot is still you know quite vigorous and vibrant and you know I think the Chairman's leadership on the resolution that that will be introducing this week to really encourage India's and joining Ave PAC because that probably is the next logical step as they undergo the economic reforms and and undergo much of the agenda that you know Prime Minister Modi has put out there and that you know for us to realize this this potential that both the the president vice president has said of creating the defining relationship in the 21st century and trying to take the bilateral trade from a hundred billion to five hundred billion you know APEC memberships a good next step it'll take us a little bit longer to get that high standard bilateral investment treaty but that certainly is an aspirational goal for both countries and really can set the framework for for bilateral trade you know on our side I urge patience you know the economic reforms in India will take time I think we have to look at this longer time horizon and on the Indian side you know we encourage the the prime minister to continue the economic reforms to ease the ability of our companies to do business to put in good intellectual property and patent protections that don't hinder that investment and also to open up and ease the the ability for US resources and u.s. venture to to help India realize its potential I mean these are all achievable goals requires patience on both sides of the the Pacific it requires open dialogue and and I remain very optimistic that we can reach those goals so you know I look forward to hearing the testimony witnesses who are all experts on on this relationship and again I'll yield back

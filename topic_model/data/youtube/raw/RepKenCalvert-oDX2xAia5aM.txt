Thank You recognized for two minutes Thank You mr. Speaker I rise in strong support of the veterans Opportunity Act of 2013 as our service members returned home from war it is incumbent upon all of us and all Americans to ensure that they're receiving the support and opportunities they need to succeed in civilian life this bill establishes the Economic Opportunity administration which would focus its efforts entirely on veteran education employment small business and housing the bill also contains a text of legislation I introduced earlier this year along with my colleague representative takano which is Bible to mine in his congressional district for community college districts that have multiple colleges as part of the district the Department of Veterans Affairs requires each campus to certify that they're veterans students are enrolled for a specific number of classes before the VA will disperse student benefits under current regulations each of the colleges in a district must write letters to other colleges within the district to verify their classes and meet regulations the Riverside Community College District in Riverside California this unnecessary paperwork delays benefits to veterans that increases processing time and the costs to college districts as well hey this bill which was wrapped into a charge 2481 corrects that problem by permitting each college in the district to verify and certify veterans for all classes attended within the district rather than just for classes attended at that particular college HR 331 would update the rules which would mean veterans would receive their benefits sooner and the VA would have less paperwork to process I'd like to thank subcommittee chairman Flores and his staff ranking member takano full committee chairman Miller and the full committee ranking member mashhad for their efforts to support our veterans and specifically for the veterans Economic Opportunity Act thank you and I back to bouncing how's the gentleman from California yields back

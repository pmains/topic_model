all right well the message is pretty clear south carolina congresswoman nancy mace republican from south carolina joins me now to discuss representative mesa you seems like you've thrown down the gauntlet what what exactly uh what's the message here that is this the rules are confusing there or you think that to your point i've also read you said this might be an insane power grab absolutely charles i woke i walked into my d.c office on thursday morning to read that the capitol hill police were directed by nancy pelosi to arrest staffers and visitors on capitol hill who were not wearing a mask this was an insane crazy power grab by nancy pelosi this is about politics and control and not about public health i can't think of a worse idea right now than to threaten to arrest american citizens for not wearing a masks and rather than have these arguments about mask wearing and not masculine we should be pushing vaccinations i had a really terrible bout with covid19 i had long coveted and i'm vaccinated we need to make sure that we're getting getting people who need access to vaccinations to get it having the right conversations this is the wrong message to send to the american people that you could be arrested for not wearing a mask what also compounds the uh for me is uh this week and also before when there was also these uh restrictions and mask mandates there you see so many politicians who don't wear them you see events uh where particularly democrats gather and none of them are wearing masks and it's so it's it's rules for you or rules for thee but not for me and and that complicates the situation certainly i must must make you even more frustrated absolutely and you could see photos of nancy pelosi yesterday afternoon having a press conference without a mask on it say as i do not do as i say and early on in covet and throughout last year i was i was asking people put on the mask we're trying to do the best we can we don't have a lot of data and information and the other thing the other the other one of my frustrations is right now is we're getting guidance from the cdc but this data we don't have the data or good data or good studies on what's working and what's not for me personally i'm taking certain precautions i'm not shaking hands right now i'm fist bumping that's about as far as i'll go i'm washing my hands i'm trying to stay distant but to arrest people if you're going to arrest someone for wearing a mask are you then going to arrest them for not getting vaccinated it's the wrong message if these spikes are happening across the country and the hill is not a hot spot either 85 percent of individuals on capitol hill are vaccinated that doesn't take into account the number of individuals who also had covid19 we've got to set a good example for the american people we have to stop politicizing kobit 19. we have to encourage people to get vaccinated and particularly ensuring there's vaccine access in rural and low-income areas where there is vaccine hesitancy and i can't think of a worse idea to encourage vaccine efficacy by telling people well they got to wear a mask outside if your vaccine to protect people who are unmasked that message doesn't work do what do you say though the folks who say well you're just you're trying to create a sort of situation where it doesn't have to exist and that you're baiting speaker pelosi i i assume you're going to continue what you're doing and to the to your point in the video come get me you're going to you've drawn a line in the sand you're going to keep it there right absolutely if her line the sand is that you're going to be arrested that is the that is a very dangerous precedent for the united states of america that is something that communist china does there has to be a balance of freedom and also protecting the public health i'm doing my job as a lawmaker encouraging vaccinations working with public health officials to ensure people have appropriate data in different counties where they live in my district ensuring that people in my district know where they can get vaccine working with public health officials to get them into rural areas and low-income areas where there is vaccine hesitancy working with community groups to share with people that you can get vaccinated getting vaccinated today could very well save your life because those who are becoming sick with covid19 with a delta variant and hospitalized and dying are ones that are unvaccinated i've got less than a minute to go let me just ask you about the business the the people's business if you will how we looking with this infrastructure deal the debt ceiling and everything else i mean it feels like the congress waits to the last minute to get all these things done there's a lot of horse trading a lot of finger pointing uh what is what specifically does the infrastructure build look like right now well the infrastructure bill i haven't seen it don't know that it's even written at this point we do know some of the basic outlines of the deal the thing that we don't know is how it's going to be paid for is are they going to raise taxes to pay for it in the middle of the pandemic on hard-working americans that's my biggest question right now and one of the largest expenditures in the infrastructure package would go towards amtrak rather than some of the other infrastructure pieces also electrical vehicle charging stations the government doesn't need to be in business that is private industry that's taking an entire sector of the energy industry away from businesses and entrepreneurs so i have some questions but my biggest question is how do we pay for it and i keep hearing there's less and less road in there uh the more they keep fiddling around with it representative mace thank you so much appreciate it always thank you charles

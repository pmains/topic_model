one so I just came from a classified brief I had a call with the head of the Alaska command General nahom to to debrief me on what alaskans what Americans have been following today and this is this unidentified object that was picked up over Alaska I think it is important to know that the men and women of of the Alaska command of NORAD the 11th Air Force the Alaska guard the resources that they brought to bear to make sure that this was going to be successfully executed this mission to bring down this this object over over Alaskan territory we commend them I think the the reports that I have received is that it was extraordinarily successful it's what they've trained for what is concerning is that it was yet an other unidentified object violating U.S sovereignty by coming into our airspace coming over our Waters and coming through Alaska I I say it time and time again Alaska is on the front lines of defense for the United States of America I was very disturbed very disturbed that the message out of our out of our briefings this week on the High Altitude balloon that was taken down uh off of South Carolina Waters that somehow or other the the the the the threat had gotten to a point where it was good to take down on the East Coast but for some reason we didn't want to take it down on the West Coast or in that on up in the north so what that does is it sends a message to China that if you want to send something to surveil a part of the United States of America Alaska is your your place that's not the message to send that's not that's not the United States of America here we who we may be we may be separated by a foreign country but we are part of the United States and so when we talk about that balloon coming into into the United States we need to remember that there were two points of entry and the first point of entry that balloon was allowed to to Traverse without action I didn't think that that was acceptable I think many Americans and alaskans didn't think it was acceptable so now we we're here at the end of the week and yet another unidentified object I think the message was very important today to say any aspect of U.S Sovereign territory that is is encroached upon there's going to be consequences to it so I'm very very proud of the men and women who uh who went up in some pretty tough conditions off of the northern coast of Alaska it's it's cold and it's dark and these are conditions that not everybody does well with but the mission that was executed was was brilliant and we can only commend them

I rise in strong opposition to HR 1628 which is a bill to take away health care from 24 million Americans whether you believe it or not health care is a basic right this shameful bill steals from those who can least afford it including seniors veterans people living with HIV children's are disabled it would yes rip away health care from 24 million people it would reduce benefits make families pay more for less and transfer it six hundred billion six hundred billion in tax cuts to the very wealthy this is outrageous access to women's health is denied by defunding Planned Parenthood Medicaid as we know it will end healthcare costs for working families and seniors little skyrocket and now it eliminates the essential health benefits like maternity Mental Health and emergency care this is not a health bill it's a tax giveaway to the wealthy and let me just tell you as a woman of faith I am appalled and I am sad by the hypocrisy displayed in this bill by people who say they are religious and want to remind you in the scriptures the book of Mark chapter 12 verse 31 we are reminded to love your neighbor as yourself this bill shows disdain for the most vulnerable and would lead to death and destruction and disease of millions Americans I hope Republicans remembered to ever ask themselves today and vote no on this mean-spirited bill let's defeat this harmful and morally bankrupt bill this is a matter of life and death and the American people deserve better Jen lady

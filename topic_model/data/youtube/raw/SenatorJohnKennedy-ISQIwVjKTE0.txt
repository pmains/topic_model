all right all those texas democrats have fled their state are finding even more ways to embarrass themselves tonight as one texas democrat is comparing the threat of arrest but as governor abbott said it's just the police will take them to the capitol to do their job after fleeing anyway they're comparing it to the institution of slavery and get this we're also learning tonight more individuals who interacted with texas democrats who tested positive for covet have now themselves tested positive including a staffer for speaker pelosi that might explain the sunday pre-planned uh health exam of kamala harris she scheduled it on a sunday everyone goes to walter reed on sunday to get a regular routine exam anyway despite these developments circle-back gen saki still won't call it a super spreader event i wonder if she'd have a different view if this was texas republicans oh by the way they're now saying they're not going to tell anybody if anyone else test positive with reaction louisiana senator john kennedy senator i bet you have a lot to say about this super spreader event well first sean let me say i'm sorry the texas democratic lawmakers got sick by the way and let me echo that and so am i i don't wish this on anybody right and i'm sorry they got other people sick um now of course they are playing the victim here in washington d.c where they're situated when they have no basis to play the victim they picked the right city to do that in they fit in just fine here in washington d.c because in washington dc if it weren't for double standards there wouldn't be any standards at all this place as you know is not like high school except no one ever graduates um in terms of what they're complaining about the texas voting rights bill i've read the bill i've read the statute i've read the the proposed bill i've read the underlying statutes it doesn't suppress anybody's vote it allows for very generous early voting very generous absentee voting yes it does require voter id it does require the people of texas to prove they are who they say they are when they go to vote the american people support that the american people want that and i say gently to my democratic friends from texas if if you don't if you don't see the need for that then uh there are one or two circumstances here either you either you're so dumb you lose your place during sex or you want to cheat and those are your two choices uh are you sure there's no third option here well here's what i think a lot of this is about because i've read all of these proposed laws one of the reasons that the last presidential election was so controversial is because we had a voting month instead of what we're used to a voting day and if you peel off the layers here you'll see that most not all but most republicans want to go back to having a voting day and many not all but many democrats are perfectly happy having a voting month now i don't care what your opinion is about the results of the last election no fair-minded person can deny that it was anything other than a goat rodeo i mean we had ballots flying around like confetti they sent out various states sent out 44 million ballots unsolicited we had uh poll watchers being interfered with we had ballot harvesting out the wazoo we had state uh executive branch officials unilaterally changing the voting laws without conferring with the legislature in their state which the constitution says has the final say some of this i understand might have been necessary we had to make some changes to accommodate the coronavirus and people's public safety but i'ma say it again no fair-minded person can point to the process-wise to the last election and say it was a model of efficiency so that's what most of these bills are doing they're trying to move us back to an election day not an election month and they do have voter id but they also have generous early voting generous absentee balloting and i just don't get their complaints and let's not forget they went to the swamp in dc to filibuster not have a quorum in texas so they can prevent republicans from filibustering that's a whole other shot but senator great to see you thank you sir

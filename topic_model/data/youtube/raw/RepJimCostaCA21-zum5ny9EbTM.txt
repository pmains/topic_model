Mr Speaker I rise today to call attention to the continuing humanitarian crisis that is taking place at our border between the United States and Mexico despite Congress's recent effort to provide relief to thousands of people in detention centers children continued to be separated from their families and people continue to suffer from a lack of basic basic living standards that they need this is not the American Way what's more this administration has just announced new new ice raids in major American cities that will solve nothing we need to do more Congress needs to act and seek long-term solutions to addressing the problems forcing people to flee their homes and seek asylum women and children literally moving 2,000 miles and they are not coming to Disneyland Congress needs to act we should be focusing on attacking the problem at its source by increasing support in Central American countries like El Salvador Guatemala and Honduras where the majority of these migrants are coming from we should not be cutting foreign aid to these countries that just exacerbates the problem I told secretary Pompeo in a hearing in Foreign Relations Committee almost two months ago why does not the president call a meeting with the President of Mexico and and to bring together the Organization of American States to come up with a comprehensive long-term solution to this problem I have spoken with the Ambassador from Mexico to the United States she has expressed to me the problem that they are facing at their southern border with Guatemala that's what we should be doing cooperating and working with the Mexican government and our other neighbors to the south we must also work to secure a basic standard of living for the detention facilities to provide for immediate relief that's why I'm co-sponsoring HR 32:39 the humanitarian standards for individuals that are in CPT to provide house screening and emergency care to improve water and sanitation and hygiene standards to improve nutrition and shelter standards I mean these are things that we're doing in the Middle East with the refugee relief programs from the Syrian refugees why would we not do this in our own border and to increase the coordination and search capacity for the agencies to address what the needs are of these migrants we do really have a humanitarian crisis at our border I mean to be sure I think we all recognize and understand that but finally we need to work together we need to work together in a bipartisan fashion that's how Congress should operate to achieve lasting comprehensive immigration reform when I first came to Congress I supported comprehensive immigration reform with the Bush administration and then with the Obama administration in 2013 we had a bipartisan package that was very close to passage as a matter of fact I think it would have passed the house had the speaker at the time brought it to the floor unfortunately we lost that opportunity I urge my colleagues to join me in their commitment to working to resolve this humanitarian crisis that we are facing at the border that is the American Way that's what we should be doing as members of Congress I thank you and I yield back the balance of my time

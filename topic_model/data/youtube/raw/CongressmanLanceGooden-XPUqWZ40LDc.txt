well joining us tonight is congressman Lance Gooden congressmen Gooden is a member of the House Committee on financial services and we are delighted to have you with us give us a sense of where you think we are right now with the the the issue of oversight with the president's stimulus package the conflict that seems to have developed already and its efficacy well first of all I think the president's doing a fantastic job he's surrounded by I think pretty good people that are giving him good advice and according to the reports that I've seen he is absolutely in control of these efforts and doing a great job of course there are politics at play Speaker Pelosi announced just a few days ago that she's forming a nine eleven style Commission which i think is very premature in a distraction but I think the president is accustom to witch hunts and he's accustomed to do in the business of the American people even if the Democrats want to play politics and at the same time the president is used to witch hunts and with amongst those witch hunts is going after the president you know the China's role here is a cover-up he's facing a a disinformation campaign that becomes more intense not less with each passing week it seems and now right we have seen China be appointed of the Human Rights Council your reaction first of all it's crazy you know I filed a bill on Friday that allows the United States to open an investigation into the origins of this of this virus and if it is a bio weapon did China do something intentionally are they at fault here these are things that we don't know the answers to because China has continued their propaganda campaign they're now wanting to carry that to the United Nations and so what my bill does is it amends the foreign Sovereign Immunities Act that was passed in the 70s that says you can't sue a foreign government and you can't even open an investigation if there's wrongdoing and so I believe that the United States needs to investigate the cause and the origins of this virus if there were bad actors at play then to be held accountable accountable and I'm talking about China but even if they didn't do anything intentional if this truly was an accident they've lied since this happened they've been lying about the numbers of those affected we would have absolutely been able to to really get with the program a lot sooner than we did had China been honest with this we didn't even know how serious this was until China had let this pass for several months yeah they lied to our doctors they lied to the doctors American doctors who went to Wuhan trying to provide assistance the the disinformation campaign was comprehensive whether it was emanating from the World Health Organization whether it was emanating from the agencies in China itself and the government of China obviously and with our medical experts being absolutely bamboozled and this from a government that was trying to pose as a new member of the enlightened community of nations of the world it is far from that it's a communist totalitarian state that is expansive in its ambitions and vicious and it's tough disinformation campaigns you're exactly right and we can't just sit by while the liberal elitist media calls the president racist for calling this a Chinese virus that absolutely is the president was the only person on the world stage the only leader that said let's shut down these flights from China you spoke earlier in the segment about the thousands of people that came across that came over in in flights even after he implemented the ban if you recall Jill Biden called the president a racist said he was a xenophobe when he announced this this ban on flights from China thank God president chose the pack did when he did otherwise that's right I think the president acted when he did otherwise where would we be today it wouldn't be much worse and let's be clear not only did the president put that ban in place over the objection of medical advisors they whether it's the Centers for Disease Control ni are the World Health Organization or the European Union they were having a conniption over it and as you say calling him racist all sorts of ignorant names and meanwhile they followed in his path within weeks the European Union the World Health Organization finally acknowledging what a great job this president has been doing and his Korona task force it is stunning to see the national left-wing media ignore the context the reality the causal relationship between the president's actions that they decried as racist and the effectiveness of his policies and saving American lives it is outrageous what he has to contend with every I'll just say it every damn day has to put up with an oppositional left-wing media that is more ideological activism than it is journalism III couldn't agree more and you know I I think that this commission that Nancy Pelosi has announced is just kind of a foreshadowing of what's to come as soon as things calm down just when the country starts getting back to work and when Congress should really be getting back to work this summer you watch the the final months leading up to the election will be Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff leading another witch hunt and taking the country down that path it's a shame but it's why elections matter I believe that Trump supporters across this nation are gonna turn out like never before in November and I believe that the president will be rewarded for the great job he's doing and lives are being saved yes we're in a very difficult time right now but things could be much worse had the president not taken early action which he did and I'm grateful to him for that as are my constituents

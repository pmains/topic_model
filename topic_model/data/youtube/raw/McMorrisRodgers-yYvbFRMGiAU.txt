all right well I am NOT going to introduce I'm not going to reduce congresswoman McMorris Rodgers because David just did that so just jump right in to this to this really I think interesting conversation are you gonna start with the cosmic crisp the greatest inventions we were talking about that well it's on the market now developed at Washington State University okay it's just kind of fun that we have a new Apple that is taste better than ever and last longer than ever and you know it's just another example of American ingenuity there's two apples yes there's two apples this is the other Apple oh but no you're right actually that is in about innovation in which we lose sight of the innovation is much bigger than what we're talking about today talking about what we're talking about today ENC is as I think as everybody knows is really the hub of where these issues around AI privacy 5g and others are debated and discussed and move forward in Congress can you say a little bit more about that and particularly your role in that process sure well it seems to me that the the issues around innovation technology the issues in front of the energy and commerce committee right now winning 5g a I making sure that America continues to lead in a I are at the are at the forefront of our economy our national security it's going to determine whether or not America leads whether or not America wins continues in global dominance so these issues are are very important to our future and I'm excited to be the lead Republican on the consumer protection and Commerce Subcommittee working with jan Schakowsky as the chair on on many of these issues and and really pleased to see the crowd here today so let's jump into 5g you can't talk about this without talking about fight you we're probably talking about 5g blockchain and AI and other buzzwords but let's talk about five gene there's a lot of with 40 we didn't really talk very much about a race it was like we were leading 4G we did all the right things and we did lead 4G with five G we're obviously talking about a race portunity with China and that ends up conflating I think two issues one is just how our network providers are our wireless providers are going to deploy five gene is that going to be faster than China and the second is network equipment companies which we don't have any anymore we really--we and then Nokia and Ericsson and Samsung to some extent what are the implications on the deployment side of what the carrier doing if we don't adopt it expeditiously well it's a significant impact and on on 4G we LED smartphones and apps and we saw the millions of jobs billions of billions of dollars to our GDP it was significant impact and as and clearly we are in a race with China right now and as I said from an economic perspective and also from a national security perspective I believe it is so important that we are leading and that we are doing that we're deploying 5ga in a way that will ensure that security to our economy as well as our national security you know I often like to remind people that in order for America to be a diplomatic power we have to be a military power to be a military power you have to be an economic power it's it's all connected and it seems to me it's all connected around 5g right now and where we go with IG is so important in China you know they've taken a very different approach and and that race is is clear you and just kind of taking a step back China has gotten to where they are largely by stealing intellectual property and by state-owned enterprises and that is the biggest concern with Huawei right now is that you have a you know a a company that is largely going to be more dependent or beholden to the Chinese government and what does that and how do we make sure that we have protections in place and so I believe it is very important that we are moving forward some of the challenge that we have had you know we don't have the networking capability right now the gear and we need to be we need to be developing that in America and I I think that that is critical to us winning and moving forward so just to build on that point little bit the interesting history I don't think very many people really understand or remember but back in 1919 in World War one the Navy was quite concerned about dependence on foreign wireless providers Marconi the Italian and we were dependent on Marconi International is an Italian and UK company and the Navy said that just is unacceptable when the Navy needed its own equipment so they threw a presidential action they ended up buying up Marconi patents in the US and building essentially creating essentially what was called the Radio Corporation of America we know as RCA and as a independent part of GE that was pretty clearly directional action by government but people are talking about similar things today for example could we leapfrog and go to 6g could we support American companies or American and European partners to do 6g or what people now are talking about is software-defined networks that maybe the Y way advantage which the hardware being the core component maybe we can leapfrog them with the software-defined networks how do you see all of that and do you see there's a role for government there I want to be incentivizing the private sector I believe that the the the best the the private sector responds the quickest and can be more innovative and so my my hope is that we can continue to focus on the private sector leading with this technology and in getting us to a place where it's not the government now I know that there's a group of senators that have worked on some legislation that is around creating these secure networks and and finding this this balance between innovation and security is going to be one of our biggest challenges moving forward one of the things I find a little confusing in the debate is the president has implemented a ban on Chinese equipment in our network providers and our major telcos have all agreed there even without that they're not going to buy Y or Z T equipment so should we really be worried about network security once we have that ban in place there's an issue obviously with rural carriers where they might have to do rip and replace but seems to me at least domestically we should be pretty secure well I think we're going to we're gonna have to just be vigilant and that's going to be ongoing and you know there's there's this concern about developing two networks as such and the decision that Great Britain is making right now on Huawei is is playing into that but in America I believe that getting to 5g as soon as possible and releasing the spectrum that is needed is is one of the best you know we we need to move forward as soon as possible we've done well with the low and the high bands but that that mid band and the disagreements that we've had over the c-band we need to get beyond interagency squabbles and the industry squabbles and get to a place where we can actually move forward because it is critical to our future and you mentioned the the rural broadband and closing the digital divide you know I come from a district in eastern Washington that this is very very important probably the number one issue in my district right now is closing the digital divide you get outside of Spokane at all and people are desperate and it's it's mixed as far as what kind of coverage they have and this is foundational to their economic future you know everything is tied to the Internet healthcare education so they're saying we just need one G right so we we we are as a country we've been focused we're focusing on 5g which we need to do and and be vigilant but we also need to make sure that we're taking action to close the digital divide and that's where I'm I'm encouraged with chairman PI and and the continued focus he's bringing to more resources I'm encouraged that from a congressional perspective where we're looking at the mapping to make sure that we're taking action that is going to ensure no one's left behind question on five to go there are there things the committee can be doing a lot of this is just simply going to be things that the FCC has to do or NTIA or others but are there things that the committee can do particularly around oversight and sense of Congress telling the administration what you think they have to be doing right well I think so far the committee has been focusing more on the the mapping issue or the rural broadband in particular just recognizing that there's more work that needs to be done probably oversight would be appropriate to great so let me switch over to privacy we now are going to be facing another onslaught of notices of our own I love the last onslaught of notices when gdpr went in place that I still suffer from yes I will accept that cookie I don't know what California is going to bring us I was reading actually in a write a little a little piece you had written there at least came out this morning and I come from and it was around the issues having a patchwork of state laws and the problems with that and you wrote quote a patchwork of the state laws would drive up compliance cost and those costs would be passed on to the consumer can you say a little bit more about that one of the problems if we don't get a national framework that that really always that I come from Washington state Washington state is in their legislative session and they're debating a privacy law for Washington state CCPA is going into effect right now in California there's nearly 80 other state laws that are being introduced across the country and in the state legislatures so it is easy to see where we're very quickly developing a patchwork of laws at the state level that will be could be in calm will be there's the potential of being in conflict with one another and creating more confusion for the consumer as well as making it very difficult on the businesses you can see where a business would say well we almost have to block out this state which you know the Internet knows no boundaries so the the work that we're doing around privacy is very important people often ask well it's 20 20 big election here it's going to difficult to get things done I certainly believe that yet I think there is an opportunity around privacy in particular as cpa is going into effect as more states are debating privacy at the state level it's going to raise the awareness as to the importance of there being a national standard and the work that we're doing on the consumer protection and Commerce Subcommittee that jan Schakowsky has been leading and I have been joining her I'm proud that we have a staff draft that at least some sections that we released just before Christmas around privacy we are continuing to work toward a bipartisan bill on privacy and I know that other efforts have fallen apart this Congress but it needs to happen and the chair would and both the chair of the subcommittee and the chairman of the full committee would like to move forward on a bipartisan privacy bill the the staff draft was was focused on strict if protections for consumers it also included enforcement mechanisms with the FTC but ensuring that the state AG's can also bring forward they're going to play a very important role in privacy as we move forward where we're getting the feedback right now we're going through the comments that we have received and the goal is to have a strong bill strong language at the national level that would be stronger than California and a model that people could support and say you know what this is some this would this would be better and stronger and clearer at the national level and get that national standard in place I do not support a private right of action and believe that the work that has been done to date in this bill in the draft language around allowing the making sure that there's strong roles for the state AG's and then it increased enforcement at the FTC is the is the way to go that's going to not have a negative impact on the the small businesses and the innovators and the startups of the future one of my biggest concerns with gdpr has been the increase in enforcement or compliance cost that are impacting the the startups in in Europe right now you see that there's a decrease in the number of startups and America has led the world in innovations and new technologies and we need to make sure as we move forward with privacy that we're doing it in a way that's going to ensure that next generation of startups and and innovators here in America yeah yeah you raised to me at a central point which I don't think has gotten enough attention and that's just the compliance cost of this a lot of the privacy advocates imply that there's really either either that there are no cost or that the costs are meaningless because privacy is so important that we should pay as Kennedy would say pay any price bear any burden the Europeans certainly are paying a big price in burying a big burden as you noted you know there are websites you can't access in Europe now because American companies said it's too difficult for it for my company to do that and I've heard from some of the larger tech companies well you know we'll take care of it I want to make sure that we have that next generation of competitors to the large companies and the startups and the next generation of innovators sure sure absolutely so iti F wrote a report recently in that he did a very detailed cost analysis of what a sort of GDP are California bill would cost versus a bill that's more still strong but balanced and sort of somewhat restrained but still providing strong protections and the difference was Stark we estimated that a GDP our style bill in the US would have a hundred and twenty billion dollars a year compliance cost that's a lot of money for typical middle-class home home if you bear that compared to a reasonable bill that would still provide protective six billion dollars so the Delta is is quite large how do you see members on the committee thinking about that question how do you make sure you get protection without you know making the cost so big that people suffer alright well that that cost is significant and when it comes to small businesses startups any business that's going to be a significant cost and it's going to create another barrier so I think the members of the committee are very sympathetic to that I would also suggest that I'm not sure that CCPA is really creating the trust that we want with individuals I'm sorry the the goal of privacy is to create trust with the consumers sound like I'm crying but to create trust with the consumers so that we can move forward with more technology and more innovation sure absolutely so we've got about three minutes less than I just think we could talk for hours especially if you've had water but I want to just close on on this question of AI I had lunch last week on ER and having lunch with the head of the Europe has created this high-level working group on AI and the chair of it very interesting a gentleman a CEO from Finland we were talking about what Europe is doing in this space and you know in general Europe has this view our I think many European policymakers have this view that if they regulate AI very very strongly there you go that if you regulate it very strongly the things like you can only use data for what you say you're using it for and other things like that that it will somehow convince people to use more AI and it'll convince companies or and consumers around the world the body EU AI not this not this cowboy capitalism American AI but it clearly has some challenge I do you see that sort of the risk of us going down the EU path when it comes to AI right well it's been America that's been the innovator right this has been the the land that we have led on the new technologies and the regulatory approach doesn't result in more innovation that's why America has always had a light touch I is you know is it has huge potential and it's going to be revolutionary in so many different industries precision agriculture manufacturing healthcare there's just a untold ways that AI is going to improve our lives and impact our lives I applaud the way that the administration is leading to date the principles that they have put forward again we can we should we're very you know I'm proud that America is leading on AI and we need to make sure that would continue to lead china's is investing a lot there on our heels but you look at the way China is using AI today in some parts of China there's one camera for every six citizens they are tracking movements they are using AI against the minorities and the dissidents in China and but they're also selling you know their equipment around the world so we need to make sure that we are leading in AI and that we're doing it with a light regulatory touch that always honors America's values and principles around freedom and human rights and human dignity yeah I tell you again we didn't Hawking our reports we wrote a report last year where we looked at about 15 or 20 who wanted to ativ indicators of AI Progress cloutie venture funding startup scientist publications and we still loo lead the Chinese in AI but there they lead Europe and they're catching up quickly but I think to sort of wrap this all up the I think the administrator Michael Kratz EOS is AI principles at the administration released the privacy work you've been doing these are all about getting the balance right about moving forward with legitimate concerns but doing it in a way that allows innovators and innovation to happen so I hope that that process can continue and that we move forward with that so unless you have any last words I will close it well I think this is an exciting time and getting it right is going to be so important so having these kind of discussions continuing to see the input and the ideas to make sure that we we strike that balance so that America continues to lead America has been the leading innovator for the last 60 70 years and we want to make sure that that continues absolutely so please join me in thanking a congresswoman McMorris Rogers [Applause]

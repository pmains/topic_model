The Trump Administration has put a lot of fear into my family. He dishonors everything most New Mexicans
believe in. New Mexicans have faced tough odds before,
and we have persevered. To find the solutions for our future we have
to understand our past. My mother was born and raised in a boxcar
where the Laguna people created a community far from their home. My dad came from a family of Norwegian farmers
who immigrated to the United States. My parents were stationed at Treasure Island
at the same time, my mom in the Navy and dad in the Marine Corps. They taught my siblings and me to respect
our heritage, our traditions, and the land, just as I have passed those lessons on to
my daughter. I'm running for Congress to deliver for New
Mexican families who play by the rules and put an end to back room deals that only help
those at the top. Like what I found at Standing Rock, oil companies
that want to destroy the land for corporate profit. When Republicans cut off funding for Planned
Parenthood, life gets harder for women like me. I've spent my life standing up for my community,
and working for Democrats who fight for the people. Deb has always been the one to come to the
event, take a leadership role, step up, and do what's right. Her mom and dad are Veterans - her dad is
even buried in Arlington Cemetery. She's always going to be committed to us. New Mexico can be a place of strong, safe
communities where our kids can be happy growing up, and can build a life here when they're
grown. I want to double down on our commitment to
clean energy in New Mexico. That way we'll create good paying jobs by
harnessing the power of our natural resources. And when a hardworking New Mexican wants to
start or expand a small business, I want to make sure they have that opportunity. And it's time we make smart investments in
education and find real solutions that pull our kids and all new Mexicans out of poverty. Together we will strengthen the future for
all of us.

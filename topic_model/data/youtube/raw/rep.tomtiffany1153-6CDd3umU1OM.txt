i rise in opposition to the more legislation both before for what it does and what it does not do for starters the bill authorizes the collection of detailed demographic information on marijuana sector employees including their race and ethnicity for a massive publicly accessible government database this is another attempt by democrats to promote their destructive identity politics agenda and lay the groundwork for a rigid quota system that picks winners and losers based on skin color the database will also put more sensitive personal data at risk and open the door to mischief by federal bureaucrats who have repeatedly weaponized access to americans private information to promote a partisan political agenda hello irs i am also disappointed that the majority refused to allow votes on two common sense amendments i proposed the first would have required child resistant packaging and a surgeon general's warning label detailing the danger these products pose to pregnant women and their unborn babies investigative reports have revealed multiple instances of pot shop clerks recommending marijuana to expectant mothers as safe despite well-documented risks few if any of these retail clerks have any medical training and should stick to dispensing pot not prenatal advice the second would have banned the use of ingredients or flavor additives in marijuana infused products such as fruit chocolate vanilla or candy for years we have been told by many on the other side that such flavors appeal to children and should be banned from tobacco products if this standard is so is good enough for jewel and puffbar shouldn't it also apply to cheech and chong mr speaker this legislation will make an already complicated situation worse i asked for a no vote and a no vote on the bill i yield back

mr. president right now if we sit by and do nothing our military is on track to be slashed by another five hundred billion dollars and that's on top of the five hundred billion they have already cut our senior commanders and even the Secretary of Defense have said these cuts are irresponsible they will damage our military radically reduce our defenses and break promises we made to our men and women in uniform but there's a better way a way to be fiscally responsible and protect America at the same time a way to achieve real savings without hollowing out our military or forcing massive layoffs of our troops our solution achieves the savings we need are merely slimming down the federal workforce by ten percent tonight mr. president instead of a veto threat we ask you to embrace our solution embrace our solution embrace our solution one that doesn't cut jobs doesn't hurt our national defense it doesn't ask those who have given so much to give that much more we ask you to stand with us and support of HR 36 62 and a support of our troops you

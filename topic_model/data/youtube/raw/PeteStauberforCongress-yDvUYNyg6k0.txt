[Music] bye [Music] ah [Music] good afternoon everyone memorial day 2021 and today uh i'm here with a uh a marine bryce mo and not only did he serve our country but now he serves uh with the american legion as an honor guard and uh he played taps today at the events he's been uh you've been uh at several events today right bryce uh yes sir we do uh nine different cemeteries around the northland and then we play uh our final our final ceremony at veterans park and i do two additional uh playings as well just for personal reasons yeah you know uh i i was here celebrating at this cemetery today uh just a wonderful job uh a nice young man tell us why you number one decided to serve our nation and then two become a member of the honor guard uh well before i i've been part of the honor guard before i joined actually i in high school i played uh taps for a few years with them um i always felt it was better to have a real trumpet as opposed to a recording because in my opinion you know these men and women fought uh you know and died for us and there's we have to do something we to pay them back there's nothing we can to fully pay back that sacrifice but we got to try you know and i feel like playing personally as opposed to just a recording is something i can do and you know something that has much more meaning and you do it very well and i think that that speaks for you and and really that young generation we can never forget uh we always have to remember the sacrifice that the men and women uh gave before us and they gave the ultimate sacrifice as as we're talking memorial day 2021 today um so tell us about uh a little bit about your family about the history of your service within the mo family so my i've had a few grandparents that served in uh world war ii um grandfather was in the navy was actually a bugler in the navy in world war ii had uh my other grandfather was in the us army in the pacific theater i was wounded received the purple heart my father was drafted in the navy in vietnam my older brother was in the minnesota national guard and i decided to join the marines yeah what a family of service and uh really for for your generation we can't thank you enough for stepping up and serving our country and again today being able to uh you know hear you play taps what a tremendous you know a tremendous opportunity to show your patriotism and you know let the people know not only who you are but making sure that the men and women who served and gave their life they'll never be forgotten and you're a part of that you're a big part of that and for me to be here and witnessing you play taps was really really special and every time um we hear taps we all get a lump in our throat yes and so you bring that you bring that emotion out um to um you know to the families and the veterans themselves so thank you the first uh i remember the first year i played with the cloquet honor guard i wasn't yet in the military i was just in high school at the time went out to a cemetery after i played after they did the rifle salute an old lady in a wheelchair was pushed up to me by son grandson i'm not sure but came up to me shook my hand and told me thank you and i said no don't don't thank me you thank the you know thank the people who've actually served and she said no thank you because you know you came out you did it for real and i've only seen my dad cry once and it was that was during the playing of taps and wow it stuck with me ever since so it's i i have a motivation to play last year there wasn't any official ceremony because of uh kovan 19 going on uh but i still went out to all of our cemeteries uh the veterans park and i uh played that's awesome ten different areas that's awesome price um you know the future of this country is bright with young folks such as yourself thank you sir understanding sacrificing and never forgetting so i want to thank you very much [Music] ah

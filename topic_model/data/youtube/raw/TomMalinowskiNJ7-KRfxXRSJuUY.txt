thanks everyone for attending this evening and we are going to start off tonight with our first speaker who I kind of called the momma bear of the grass roots program so of all grass roots so if you all would welcome with me wind Kong Winnie there yes I am wonderful you guys can hear me could I get a thumbs up I can there you go oh I love it hi everybody so I do not like talking at people so I'm looking at you guys as a huge you know collage of people so so good to see everybody I want to thank Lauren and the whole Malinowski team for inviting me for tonight so excited for it for this year and there's a lot of things ahead for us so listen so I'm speaking first before all the nice honorary people the real you know you're not here for me so I can get I get to say whatever I want to say so so I'm here to represent grassroots and I see a lot of great faces here a lot of you guys were with the sticky note squad and we did a lot of work and so in 2018 we reached nearly 57,000 infrequent dem voters in BB seven and that was because of all of you guys and for you guys who did it now that vote-by-mail is in the public either it's really where we want it to be doesn't it feel like we were like the Pioneers doesn't it feel great so it's actually doing what we always said that we wanted to do we wanted to use boat by mail as a way to get people to vote more frequently and to develop a voting habit and so you will see that in 2018 we were voting around 8% in 2019 23% voted by mail so that's cuz of all of your work and they stick in the note squad scent reach nearly 400,000 voters in the last two elections 2018 and 2019 so kudos to you guys there's a lot of work this year so I want to talk specifically about CD 7 and how you guys can help because we really guys I'm still an unpaid volunteer like all of you guys right we're not in it for the money we're in it because for me as an immigrant I can't imagine living here without having Tom as a member of Congress you know for all the things that he's done you know Tom started from day one he was on the national news he has been a leader and that's why we elected him right right getting a thumbs up on that so you can see there out of the 40 freshmen members of Congress that came Tom clearly rose to the top and he was also even mentioned during the impeachment hearings are referred by representative Adam Schiff do you guys remember that moment Schiff mentioned representative Tom Malinowski my heart just burst so listen however hard it was for us in 2018 it is harder now in 2020 the work is harder no doubt about it so we are going to target as a grassroots and I need your help so you guys you guys have my email for those who don't please email me it's when WI NN at 80 and J org for more information but we are going to reach our goals to reach 60 2300 voters this year to get Tom reelected so we're gonna need all of your help it's gonna be contactless it's gonna be via postcards and I want to thank TJ and Merv for being the leaders for CD seven working with me on this one so let me just say quickly about what grassroots is and so when all these honorary speakers are coming up next they're gonna thank grassroots so I want to thank grassroots in this way I wouldn't describe to you what grassroots really really is on the ground so grassroot is telling you guys an idea that I had about vote-by-mail and you guys said I don't know if they'll work but sure when we'll trust you will try it will go and lo and behold we reached 57 thousand voters in CD seven right grassroots is Dan who works he was a single dad of one works in his cold basement on the voter make of the voter data list it's the same statewide registered voter registration list that the state pays a contractor seventeen million dollars to run and all those problems that we've been hearing the news right the system crashing dan has that in his basement for us he's gonna generate all these voters for us so he's secure it's safe it's on his own server it will not crash so he's working on it right now grassroots is Liz Duncan who owns her own print shop in Union County is a union shop and she printed all of our postcards for us so I Drive there in Union County I live in Morris County I Drive him there loaded up her and her crew loaded up in my outback and I drove it to Merv's house in Westfield and unloaded in his garage and then he his wife have been bundling these postcards in 100 batch is ready for you guys that's volunteers to say hey give me a batch of a hundred voters - right - that's grassroots right that's what we do it takes every one of us to get this done just to give you an idea our results in 2018 so we had infrequent Dems that we targeted right so what our results showed that what was that the most infrequent of the infrequent Democratic voters the one who only voted in 2016 didn't vote in 14 didn't vote in 15 didn't vote in 17 the ones that got our sticky note squad are personalized letters had the largest conversion rate to vote by mail so it works it really really works and it only works because of you guys so I want to thank the genders the Tracy Keegan by the way Tracy Keagan and summit has the best coffee for all the sticky note squads in the state I will go there any day you know to join in writing I want to thank Shannon culture and Pam brood in Union County they hosted so many so you know it's different this year with coronavirus and coronavirus and i have a lot of family in asia and we know that it could it will spike again it could surge and we don't know how it's going to come

very near and dear cuz she's also a very very good friend and she is mayor of a town close to mine so without further ado I'd like to introduce mayor Janice Kovac of Clinton New Jersey Janet's are you there wait a minute am i unmuted you are unmuted now I can hear you technology at its finest it's so exciting so first wind thank you I mean the work that you've done with action together is second to none and for that we are eternally grateful I've benefited from it you know when I was running last year for mayor again so thank you so so much everyone that has done the postcards that has made the phone calls this doesn't happen without all of you I like to tell everyone that you know it's kind of fun to be part of the cool crowd now I've been doing this for almost 20 years and I was never part of the cool crowd well now I'm part of the cool crowd so I'm so excited so excited to be a part of this with all of you so win thank you you are a godsend to us in so many ways and to all of the volunteers and I see there's so many people here that that I know so hello to everyone it's kind of strange to be doing primary night this way but ultimately we're going to get to where we need to be I want to tell you a few things so I got the opportunity it was three years ago this month I had someone reached out to me and said friend of mine is interested in running for Congress would you sit down with him and I said of course you know having done it myself I knew what this district was like and you know it's kind of that the rite of passage every new candidate talks to the previous candidate so I sat down with Tom it was a hot July day in Clinton he came to town and met me for coffee and I knew at that moment that he was going to be our next congressman he had the and it wasn't just his background it was his persona it was exactly who we needed at the right time this district was dying for change and I knew that tom was going to be that changed now I will tell you and there's a few people who are on this that will remember I took a lot of heat for getting behind Tom right away because he wasn't the where everyone was kind of going there was lots of conversations but I absolutely believed in him 100% and to the extent not to tell you a quick story so my son is is 18 now but he had he's a boy scout his Eagle project he finished his Eagle project in September of 2017 I would not let him have his Court of Honor I delayed his Court of Honor until after tom was going to be sworn in as the congressman so that he could then present my son with the the letter from the the congressional office that's how confident I was in Tom being our next congressman so what you know what does this mean as a mayor we are the front line so we're always the ones that everyone comes to and I have to tell you Tom has stepped up and and been a partner and he doesn't look at any of us based on our party he looks at each and every one of his constituents as a part of his team and that he needs to do whatever he can and believe me I have called on him more times then than he cares to count sometimes whether it's a letter in support of a grant application for our fire for our EMS it is during koban I had a number of residents who are reaching out for unemployment which obviously so many of us have no specific people and people that really struggled so when I couldn't keep up with the calls i was getting his office and his team stepped right up every single time we had conference calls with either the county or with the governor's office or just even with a small group his staff was always there and available to us when tom was available he got on those phone calls when we talked about the fact that the cares package didn't give to communities like mine because I don't qualify under the Community Development Block Grants he went to town and worked on the legislation I worked he had someone from his staff call me and asked specifically what we needed and how we needed to be taken care of with this next go-around a package you know what was important to us so that as they crafted the legislation there were some specific pieces to New Jersey because you know we all know New Jersey's really the ultimate it's why we're all here it's why we all continue to pay the taxes that we pay because this is the place to be we are it and he made sure his staff made sure there isn't anything that he's I've ever asked of him that he has said no chair there isn't anything that anyone that I know has asked of him that he has said no to I am part of the New Jersey League of Municipalities so our first vice president will be president next year I happen to be at a meeting and overheard two mayor's having a conversation about some struggles they were having and that they had they didn't know where to turn and they happen to be within his district I called his office and without doing anything more than giving them the contact information they've reached out to those mayor's to follow up to see how they could help I had a the mayor of Hampton or a councilman in Hampton and can't get his mail delivered to his house long story and has been going round and round with the post office I called his office and Tom's office has been working with the post office fighting with the post office to make it happen for that councilman and and they do it because they really do care they're part of our community they're us they are the individuals who we see in the food store we see at the at the gas station ma we're not seeing anyone anywhere right now except on zoom' but the point is is that these are people who care just as deeply he has surrounded himself with an amazingly talented group of individuals I said I happen to have a friend who was down in DC with a group of other individuals from his organization and he happened to call me said oh I think we're going in to see Tom I called Tom to let him know that they were coming and the minute that they walked up to him Tom said oh yeah John has called said you guys were this is who you need to talk to they were blown away they were blown away that he took the time to have a conversation with them to listen to what they needed and I again I can't say enough about the fact that that man puts heart and soul into every single thing that he does and all of the efforts don't go unnoticed people we've all struggled this has been the longest how many days I don't even know anymore I think we're at 16 weeks now it has been the longest 16 weeks of my life but knowing that there's another support system for me as a mayor has made it that much easier and I know that every other mayor has done the same thing we've all reached out we've all just kind of I had a conversation with Tom and just kind of unloaded because it was like I know where to go what to do and he's like okay let's stop let's have a conversation and he's just so calm about it you know I'm like pulling my hair on I got 15 different directions and everything else and Tom was just you know and he kind of brought me back to that center again and I can't you know I can't praise him enough I can't wait to see him sworn in again as our congressman and to continue serving this district and every single resident that has benefited from his amazing service to us so not only did he serve this country as part of the State Department he is now serving us in our district and doing it to the best of his ability and just blowing it out of the park hitting it out of the park I don't know I'm mixing up all my metaphors anymore so you know I can't like I said I can't say enough good things about him he has been there when others have not as has his staff and for that alone he has my undying gratitude and undying support I will follow him to the ends of the earth probably so with that I'm gonna turn this back to to Lauren I know we've got a lot more speakers coming and thank you everyone for all the work that you do this couldn't be done without every single one of you who are here today and and showing spending time here on this call when there's a lot of other things going on in our lives just really brings home how important two wins point grassroots is so thank you everyone Thank You Janice thanks so much thanks for being you and you're right Tommy's pretty incredible I can see it thanks again our next speaker I am so excited about and extremely honored to get to announce him um so it is the majority leader in the House of Representatives representative Steny Hoyer represented by our can you hear we were there an on mute I just unmuted hello terrific well thank you very much Lauren welcoming to your beautiful living room I suppose from my July fourth studio as you can see I am so very pleased to be with you and with all Tom's friends and supporters Tom of course is going to have a big victory tonight obviously but more importantly he's gonna have a huge victory on November 3rd to the benefit of New Jersey and to the benefit of his country and to the benefit of the Democratic caucus and I am so very pleased to be with all of you I just listened to the to the mayor Tom I don't know about following you to the ends of the earth that's but with you and Congress I'm convinced there will not be an end to the earth so madam mayor you won't have to do that we'll both be just supporting him very strongly as he has the kind of success that he's had during the first two years of his campaign you know madam mayor as I was listening to you extolling Tom's virtues and his calmness which I have seen demonstrated and very thoughtful insightful analysis of issues I think that's what you sort of were referring to and I've seen that on a regular basis and Tom comes up to me and we have a discussion about an issue I know that Tom has given a very serious thought has weighed the pros and the cons and has a conclusion of alternatives that ought to be followed that really makes a lot of sense and so I am as I said really pleased to be here supporting Tom with you madam mayor let me tell you madam mayor I was elected to the Senate before you were born in 1966 I was five months out at Georgetown Law School and one of the things I've learned from then to now as a legislator is the legislature can avoid if he has half a brain or she has half a brain can avoid 100% responsibility the problem with your job madam mayor you can't avoid any responsibility you've got the toughest in the country I think being a mayor the buck does stop on your desk and the complaints start on your desk so thank you very much for your leadership I think our local leadership officials are so critically important - you're closest to the people and if you're serving them well they feel much more positive about government in general because you listen to them and you respond to them so thank you for your service and then I I know I don't know whether governor Murphy is on the phone yet or on our Zoo in our zoom room Lauren you're shaking your head he's not on yet well when he gets on tell him I spent 10 minutes extolling his virtues and I save you I mean to be arraigned on that but we're very proud of governor Murphy he's doing a wonderful job and a great leader and what a team you have elected in new jersey over the last few years just and what a what an extraordinary difference this team has made and I'm not gonna speak a long time but I want to want him say at the outset I you heard I was elected to the state Senate in 1966 elected to Congress in 1981 so I've been around for some period of time my first opportunity to vote for president was for John Kennedy in 1960 I just turned 21 so I'm now 181 but I voted for John Kennedy and I voted for every Democratic candidates since never up until 2016 did I think the country would be in danger it might pursue policies with which I did not agree but I didn't think until 2016 that the country would be in danger if the opponent was elected and very frankly I was right and this election is the most important election which I'm going to participate in my lifetime I hope I pray that I will not participate in a more important election than this this is really about the soul and character of our country in so many ways about what kind of vision America is going to what kind of values is going to uphold and and project to the rest of the world what kind of respect we're going to enjoy as a nation around the world where we have been the leader for so many decades Tom Malinowski brings as I said extraordinary wisdom experience insight and Janice as you pointed out common sense and calmness really how do we solve a problem now he knows a lot of things about a lot of big issues obviously served in the in the administrations and notice a lot about foreign policy and Tom cares about that but let me tell you what he cared most about from my perspective was I lived on gateway Boulevard and District Heights Maryland for a period of time and every time I heard gateway of course I thought of my little white house with my three little girls and my wife living on Gateway Boulevard I cannot any longer think of gateway without thinking Tom Malinowski and the Gateway to New York City for all of you who live in New Jersey he has been tenacious focused every day pounding away at how critically important that project was and you know the president is not former gateway the Secretary of Transportation now for Gateway but tom was so tenacious along with his colleagues Democratic colleagues from New Jersey but tom was so tenacious and so effective in his advocacy both in committee and on the floor and finally got the administration to free up some money for the Gateway project and you know if that project I hope it's done sooner rather than later because tom is just going to be tenacious on pursuing gateway and I know that's very very important to all of you which is why he's so engaged in it and so passionate about it and the other issue that tom was tenacious about was about salt the Republicans passed a tax bill and they capped salt and very frankly they were going after blue states plain and simple they wanted to pass you know pass a tax cut for the wealthiest in America and what they did was they went after in the middle class in America and then would after particularly the middle class in New Jersey because they knew that you have high property taxes and if it was capped it was going to cost your constituents Tom a lot of money out of pocket and it has and so we passed a bill with frankly Tom and the other members that other Democratic members of the New Jersey delegation leading the charge that we had to do this for working men and women not only in New Jersey but throughout the country and Tom I want to congratulate you for getting that bill through it's not surprising that McConnell has not done anything with it but then there 275 other pieces of legislation McConnell hasn't done anything with either to the detriment of our country whether it's political reform whether it's equality of pay for women whether its justice reform whether it's infrastructure which we need and of course the Gateway is one of the most important infrastructure projects that we have in the country how do I know that because Tom Malinowski told me so and I believe him I know how important that is so bottom line is I don't want to go on and on but because I think this is the most important election and because I think it's critically important that we now I hold the house but tom was is a member of one of the most extraordinary classes that I've experienced you know we get a new class every two years in the Congress of the United States I in 2018 I think we saw the preface to the expansion in the house of the Democratic leadership hold on the house I think we're gonna see the Senate come over to the Democratic side and I think Joe Biden is gonna be elected presidents and in that context Tom will be even more effective than he has already been which is extraordinary given a McConnell ledge Senate and a Trump I don't want to say lead I'm not sure what Trump does but Annie meant whatever Trump does Tom has clearly made an impact on the Department of Transportation and the Secretary of Transportation who didn't want to pursue because the president didn't want pursue tom has been successful in moving it forward so we all have a personal responsibility not to Tom to the country to our children to our future to what kind of country were going to be Tom Malinowski represents in my view the kind of person every member would want to be represented by a person who has a conscience who thinks integrity and character count who is focused on local issues for his people Tip O'Neill said all politics are local and what he meant by that people elect you to the Congress of the United States and they do not expect you to forget the issues that that are so important in their lives and Tom Malinowski has not done that and he will not do it in the future so I'm asking I represent 750,000 people here in Maryland they don't know Tom Malinowski they may know his name but they don't know him they need Tom Malinowski you need to send Tom back from my constituents so I'm on this zoom yes for your folks that's great but you know but I'm really here also for ten special interests that I have three children three grandchildren and four great-grandchildren they need Tom Malinowski they need somebody of his character and of his work ethic and have his focus on people you send Tom back to the Congress of the United States his country needs him thank you thank you so much you know where and thank you again so much for your Thank You Janice Janice is clapping in the picture thank you again so much alright remember tell Murphy I spent 10 minutes saying what a wonderful great person he was now I know he's on right now so I'm gonna without further ado I'm gonna take this privilege to announce my favorite governor ever governor Murphy can you hear us governor Murphy we good can you hear me all right steady I heard every word and I am bathed in it thank you my man y'all better thank you for your leadership and all you do for our country and of course all you do for for the great state of New Jersey god bless you man we love you and thank you for your incredible leadership so hats off to you terrific listen I'm here with first lady Tammy Murphy I know not only has leader Hoyer been awed but when who's a dear friend Janis Kovach and of course we're all here for Tom Malinowski and we could not be thrilled more thrilled to be standing by his side you talk about a fighter I don't know where would be on the Gateway tunnel where we've made enormous progress without Tom the voice that he's been in pounding away on lifting the cap on state local tax deductions again as clarin a voice as there is anywhere he will not let me rest in peace or otherwise until we get a one seat ride on the Raritan Valley Line I see Lisa I see out there Lisa mantle blessed give me the that's why she's here who could blame you but just literally time and again the progessive part of him the pragmatic part of him after George Floyd's murder Tom and Tammy and I were together at the vigil in Westfield a moment that you know none of us will ever forget he's been a consistent voice across the spectrum and Tom knows this I'm a former US ambassador I first heard about Tom from John McCain and leader Hoyer will will will know the relationship there where Tom worked tirelessly on behalf of the human rights agenda in the Obama administration which by the way as far as I can tell has been thrown right out the window by this administration but but again he's a guy who will do what he'll find the common ground as proudly as progressive as he is he he has also found consistently the ability to find common ground with folks including folks across the aisle I just don't know where the seventh district would be without Tom I don't know where New Jersey would be without Tom he's gonna have a tough race folks this is a you know it's July 7 and and the great news is were together celebrating Tom Malinowski Tammy and I will be with him every step of the way but he's gonna need us now this is this is not a lay down hand this is a district that the other guys they're targeted they think they can win it we know better we know Tom is gonna win this in the general but he's not gonna win it without us we're gonna have to all close ranks and be there for him so I could not be more proud I could not be more honored to stand up on his behalf to stand side-by-side with all of you out there I see so many great familiar faces and most importantly to stand side-by-side with the incredible Tom Malinowski god bless you all congratulations Tom here is to a great few months ahead of us we're gonna kick some butt and I don't know where would be by the way again without Steny Hoyer now bless y'all Thank You governor a Tom you're up Tom Malinowski yeah mmm you did i governor hi stannie hey Tom hey thank you my goodness first of all thank you both so so much for joining us tonight it's called Steny I could not be more proud to not only serve with you but to have a chance to learn from you so much in the last year and a half and there's nothing I like more as a member of the house than sitting on the floor and and watching you listening to use an extraordinary voice that we need in this country right now and governor Murphy what can I say we are unfortunately living through a controlled experiment in America right now the difference between good and bad governance measured in lives saved and lives lost and Jersey is well governed because of you you have made toughest choices under the most difficult circumstances you always take responsibility our state is doing after we were the hardest state in the country by coronavirus every state in America where New Jersey hey Tom your audio is drifting in and out just so you know okay can you hear me now yes okay thank you so much not just for being with me but more important for being being with us let me say some things about this campaign and guys don't want some speech and and given what we're experiencing as a country right now I don't think there are our good friend and whip in the house Jim Clyburn often tells us in politics really you just got to say three things you got to tell them what you're going to do then tell them and then do it and then you've got to tell them what you've done and part of every campaign that's what we've got to do and and and I am confident in this race because I know that we have done what we said and proud this year this is different from 2018 I can run on my record I can run on our record as the Democratic majority in the house we're gonna protect health care and the Affordable Care Act we did that the Trump administration is in court right now trying to strike that law down trying to take health care for millions of Americans in the middle of a health crisis we have consistently protected after bill to improve that law lower the cost of prescription drugs for our constituents we said we would protect our kids and our families from gun violence and we passed the first meaningful piece of gun violence prevention legislation in Congress in over two decades universal background checks we said we protect Social Security and Medicare we did we said that we would protect the human rights of the American people we did we passed the DREAM Act and yes any I said I would fight for my constituents in New Jersey try to restore the salt deduction the House passed that bill that would not have happened with a Republican majority and nobody in the seventh District wants to go back nobody wants to go back to a majority that didn't care about investing in our for we do we promised we would and as you heard from leader Hoyer we have been relentless in pushing for the Gateway tunnel and we have gotten the money and the approval against all of resistance from the Trump administration for the first stage of that project and we will get the rest no matter who is in the White House because we've elected leaders from New Jersey we're going to fight for it we're not going to take no for an answer and when the coronavirus hit us none of us wanted to be in this situation we stepped up we fought for our small towns our rural counties so important in our district we passed the heroes Act everything Jersey needs to stay financially afloat through this crisis as we beat back this disease and I'm so proud of my team including many people who were on this call working day and night last three or four months to make sure every single person who's lost a job in our district gets the health they need every single small business is entitled well over a thousand people to get what we've promised under under that legislation so that's my record I'm proud to run on it I've got an opponent who doesn't like to talk about issues he doesn't have press conferences he doesn't do town halls 50 town halls by the way since I was elected but he does have a record he's a career politician who spent the last twenty years or so as a legislator and so we know what he stands for when New Jersey tried to legislate the protections of the Affordable Care Act so that everybody in our state would have that security in their health care no when we were this close from actually having a new railway tunnel it was called arc tunnel then he supported Chris Christie in canceling that project right now he was on the wrong side of that he's had an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association trying to explain that to moms and dads and summit and Westfield and Summerville who are afraid of what might happen to our kids in this era of mass shootings he's opposed to women's right to choose he's opposed marriage equality consistently throughout his career last week he said he regretted having been opposed to LGBT rights that's nice I wonder what I'm about to cause him to have such a change of heart here's the problem there are probably not enough days between now and November 3rd for him to regret every single vote he has taken over the last two decades that's inconsistent with the values of the people of the 2nd of the 7th district now this were normal election that would be enough I've got my record he's got his record we can talk about the issues where we disagree on policy but of course as we heard from leader where this is not a normal election it's not a normal time in our country so many of our fellow Americans right now are asking what is happening to our country right now Democrats and Republicans we've always had disagreements sometimes we disagree passionately about the issues but most of our leaders in the history of this country they were supposed to be responsible they were supposed to do their jobs they were supposed to tell the truth they were supposed to be ashamed of our country and its interest first ahead of their own selfish personal concerns yeah this isn't just about a bunch of mean tweets although I'm sure all of us would agree we need a little bit less meanness in our political discourse in this country right now this is about a hundred plus thousand dead Americans it's about almost 40 million Americans having lost their jobs it's about America being the only advanced democracy on the planet that is failing to get this pandemic under control as the leader of our country says I am NOT responsible I am NOT responsible and we here in the last few days whether what the White House wants as heads into this election is for the American people to become numb to become numb to the suffering that we are experiencing because of this complete abdication of responsibility at the highest levels of our country well if you know anything about me I'm not gonna be numb not gonna be numb when I see Americans suffering and dying I'm not gonna be numb when I see Russia putting bounties on our troops and the president would rather protect dead Confederate generals and their reputations our men and women in uniform serving around the world if there's one thing I know about the people I represent a leader who is none they don't want just a legislature they do want the leader will look them in the eye when these things are happening in the country and say this is right and that is wrong that's what I've always done when the president last year called out members of Congress who not like me and said they should go home to their countries I led the house in passing the first resolution that either house of Congress has passed condemning a sitting president of the United States since before World War one and when the president sold out our country for campaigned earth against this potential presidential opponent I put my constitution of Duty ahead of any personal political interest that I might have now here's why this matters if a congressional race because I firmly believe that it happened to our country where is making us anxious is not the fault of one powerful man it is the fault of all of the little men who go along who have enabled it to bury their heads in the sand because nobody certainly not Donald Trump forced the governors of Texas and and Georgia and Florida and Oklahoma to reopen their economies before us endangering the rest of us nobody put the gun to their heads they chose to go along they chose to do what was easier for them rather than for the people what they are supposed to represent my opponent made the same choice probably knows better and that's what makes it worse made that same choice when he went to that Trump rally in Wildwood New Jersey every moment when the coronavirus was starting to hit us and the president was out there saying it was a hoax this was long after we saw babies taken from their moms and dads at the border long after he had said that white supremacists nemt Semites are fine people knew what this president was and yeah that's the person he chose to stand back and shear and to say should be the leader in our country for the next four years showing us once again what I think all of us know I'm washing this man's career over the years in Trenton is he's more interested in getting a job than in the furnace well I wouldn't be surprised I have to say yes in the coming weeks this campaign continues King junior decides to make a difference in this country after all the consultants who tell them what to say they see what's going on they they understand how the district is changing they see the polls but if he does it's gonna be another act of convenience another act of cowardice it's not going to be an act of conduct conviction and the time is long long past it's too late to make a different choice and if he does I don't think it's gonna change any minds I don't think it's going to work in this district we do not want another weather vane representing the seventh congressional district because we know that a weather vane cannot change the way the wind is blowing and what we need in this country right now desperately is leaders who will change the way the wind is blowing now it's not going to be easy we have a strong case we have a strong campaign and I'm so so proud of all of you and all of the volunteers out there as you know we don't have an opponent in the primary yeah our volunteers still made 20,000 phone calls just get people to the polls just to get people to exercise our constitutional right and duty to show how committed in the are to to keeping the seat in to changing our government this this November and I'm so so grateful to you and I know we can do that for this primary I know what we can do it's not going to be easy so Tristan Singh which we will probably still be practicing through the fall because of all the irresponsible decisions being made outside of new New Jersey is not conducive to the kind of campaign that we love to run with thousands of volunteers going out there knocking on doors the the other side can't do that so if we can't do that that's a disadvantage and as you know and this is an expensive campaign and I'm the only candidate in this race who will not accept a single penny from corporate PACs I depend on people like you on ordinary people who are in this because of conviction but I'm still hopeful and I'm still confident we heard I think from Diana's she mentioned the governor mentioned the black lives matter rally that we attended together in Westfield I I marched in five of those in the district at the height of those wonderful peaceful protests every single one of them I saw mostly young people pulling their parents along and they were passionate and some of them were angry but when they got up to speak there was one thing that burned through every single time from every one of those 15 16 17 19 20 year-old young people they said vote you're angry you're upset you're disappointed but it's on you it's upon us we are seeing in the midst of all of the stuff that's making us anxious for seeing this extraordinary reawakening pacific responsibility in our country we are despite the voter suppression decision coronavirus whelming numbers of people coming out of people not to mention all the folks who are volunteering who were running for office were civically engaged in ways that they weren't before and the overwhelming majority of us want to restore a good sense and civility to this country well majority Democrats Republicans in the coronavirus crisis they want us to protect public health above all the president says whatever FoxNews may say so we should be hopeful because the American people are reminding us every single day they have not lost confidence and faith in American democracy and they're prepared to do what it takes to get it back we're in one election away from being able to do that one election away from restoring decency to this country one election away from having confident saying principled leaders will tell them the truth will respect the law will put the country in the country's interest ahead of themselves one election away from not having to think about elections every single day politics every single day which I think the vast majority of us would love to be able to do so I'm thankful so thankful to all of you for helping us get this far for taking that enormous first step in 2018 we knew it would be just the first step we knew it was the trial run for 2020 this is the test we are ready we will pass it thanks to you thank you

good afternoon thank you so much for this award for supporting the feed the future initiative mrs lowe and i've worked together on this initiative since its early days we both agree that when it comes to foreign aid we must ensure that our investments are not only helping solve the immediate problem but they're creating long-term results that's exactly what feed the future does and that's why i was so proud to join my colleagues both republicans and democrats in supporting it when i first became chair of the state foreign operations subcommittee i led a delegation to central and south america it was in guatemala that we were able to see a feed the future project first hand this was a partnership between usaid and walmart that connected small rural farmers with supply chains allowing those farmers to earn more for their produce we saw how their training enhanced the quality in production and because of that their household incomes rose it was well thought out and changed the lives of so many people in a meaningful way i also want to congratulate an outstanding institution in my home state texas a m university for the important work they're being recognized for today the initiative could not have achieved so much without the world's best experts from american universities it's an honor to be associated with this vital program and to receive this award today thank you for that all that you do to make our world a better place

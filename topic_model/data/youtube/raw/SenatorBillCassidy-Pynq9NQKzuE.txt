balance of power on Bloomberg television and radio I'm David Weston we welcome now Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana who can tell us about hurricanes but also can tell us about Russia as well Senator thank you so much for being with us first of all spend a minute on hurricanes hurricane Ian which hit Florida thankfully from your point of view not Louisiana but you have some experience with hurricanes in Louisiana what do you make of what we're seeing right now yeah it is terrible our hearts go out to them the American people will come forward I find that the American people are incredibly generous putting aside every other division to go help our fellow American in trouble the Cajun Navy I'm told is already over there helping with rescue operations there'll be plenty of opportunity for others to contribute directly or indirectly and we in Congress will step up it's what we do for fellow Americans so senator from your experience as I say unfortunately you have a lot of it uh is this a question of preparation is there anything you can prepare for something like this that comes ashore with this cut much Fury a cat four absolutely first you evacuate number one um and people in Florida tend to have built the hurricane code you've got Windows you can roll down to protect against you know metal windows that cover your regular Windows ideally that is a situation government can do a lot by having for example gasoline pre-positioned gasoline trucks so that as people Evacuate the gas stations don't run out of gasoline you can quickly fill it up and then they can evacuate similarly there's water supplies and other critical supplies that are pre-positioned close to the area of disaster so that as the people who are there you can go in and help examples and I'm sure the governor DeSantis has done all that so Senator we heard from President Biden yesterday that he's going to do everything he can to help Florida he's been talking with Governor Ron DeSantis a member of a different party your party the Republican Party there's been some contention there between the two of them but at a time like this partisanship goes away at the same time how do we judge how much Aid is required because there's going to be Aid obviously a lot of Aid required I know back in the time Sandy Mr DeSantis when he was a congressman actually voted against the San Diego I believe you did too how do you make sure you're doing enough and not too much it's important to know that the the the context of that no vote there have been an original amount allocated for Sandy but there was included with them that if I recall it's been quite some time ago billions of dollars for things unrelated to Santa Republicans in the house objected as opposed to decrease in the total amount they just jammed it all in to get even more money some of which government Governor Cuomo ended up using for economic development to attract companies from other states to move to New York so first you have to be focused on the disaster and not on pork barrel projects that others would like to do if you do that there will be a hundred percent of people voting for this package Senator let's turn now to the situation with Russia and Ukraine we've heard from President Putin this morning about so-called annexation of parts of the donbos and you and others have been outspoken we have sanctions now from the government but you have a new proposal to deal with the issue of Russian exporting of of oil give us what your proposal is yeah first um our proposal is to set a cap on the amount that the United States and Western countries would pay for Russian oil it acknowledges there's been a paradox of as there's been a paradox of these sanctions in that as the international price of oil has gone up Russia has had increased revenue from selling oil and natural gas this this attempts to do with the administrations tried to do but failed and that is to put a cap on the amount that the West will pay 15 percent above their marginal cost of production put a cap at that level and so therefore they're not profiting if you will from the fact that the sanctions are driving up the international price of oil as you explain it makes good sense what do you do about India what do you do about China there's a limited amount those countries can off take uh so and by the way the bite administration's operation is broken apart because the EU wants consensus and Hungary objects well Hungary is not a major consumer of Russian oil if everybody else accepted uh this this Paradigm except for Hungary China and India there's a limit to how much the Russians can sell and one more thing David important to recognize the Russians have limited storage space what makes this work is that they've got to produce and if they don't produce their their uh Wells lock up and they can know and it takes billions to get them reworking just ask Venezuela and so it capitalizes on the fact that the Russians have to move that oil if they want to keep production and most of the sales are going to countries in the west uh yes China and India do well Hungary who cares but the rest of us will put a cap limiting their income there has been by and large bipartisan support for dealing with Russia over Ukraine up on Capitol Hill do you have bipartisan support for this or do you expect it uh uh I the the movie Frank my Democratic colleagues were waiting to see how the the Biden administrations uh similar proposal was going to work out it has not worked out again they're trying to bargain with the EU as a totality and because Hungary objects then the EU cannot come on board mine takes a little bit of a unilateral approach and invites the European European nations to come along they're therefore not obligated by the their EU um structure hungry won't be a part of it hungry like how much oil do they consume so we feel like it still works from our perspective and even if Hungary decides not to go alone Senators your proposal include a so-called secondary sanctions that is to say if there are other countries that do not comply there will be sanctions against them well these things secondary sanctions upon some financial institutions uh if they decide to circumvent it we cannot keep a pipeline from Russia to China from flowing oil through there all we know is that there's a limited capacity of how much that pipeline can carry and so that's what we're really banking on there's a limit to how much they can offload to other countries and therefore they have to sell to the West let's cap what we'll pay them well speaking of pipelines we had quite a story coming out of the North Sea there off the shore of Denmark this week I I think last time I checked there's something like four leaks there's a lot of Suspicion of possible sabotage what do you know about that what do you think is going on so I what I know is what I've read but one thing I've read is that the Russian oil the Russian natural gas company is is required to pay a penalty if they don't deliver a certain amount of contractual amount of natural gas uh this of course would disrupt that penalty they would not be obligated to pay the penalty and so there's every motivation in the world for the Russians to do this um uh it allows an interruption but not to pay the cost so as my book um they're guilty until proven otherwise and that really takes us back to the energy crisis particularly centered on Europe and particularly Germany is one of the hardest hit we're going into the winter now do you think that the the Europeans will hold firm in the opposition to Ukraine because it may cost them it may cost them they're taking measures already for example some countries are not mothballing nuclear power but as one German told me if our homes are heated by natural gas natural gas which is piped in then then nuclear won't help them we still need natural gas that comes back to our role in the United States we could be producing more natural gas in the United States to ship overseas the bite Administration has done everything they could to limit Leasing and permitting on federal lands they make a public relations oh we're going to do it in reality at one step along the way they block it so we need to increase production in the United States expedite the production or the development of our LNG export facilities so that they use so that we help the Europeans get through this winter and through next year by the way I call for an operation warp speed just like we did it for a vaccine in which we took a vaccine in 10 months from nowhere to putting in someone's arm let's let's streamline our permitting so that we can begin to get our natural gas over there to help our European allies uh to stay warm in the winter to keep their economy going to stay strong against Russia Senator thank you so much for being back with us really appreciate that Republican senator

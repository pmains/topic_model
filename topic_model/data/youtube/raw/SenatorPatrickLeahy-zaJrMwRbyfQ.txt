I want to thank all of you for coming today but I also want to thank chairman Smith and chairman Goodlatte for doing this joint bipartisan bicameral event today the highlight was really a serious problem for American businesses of threat to American jobs and of course my friend congressman john conyers and congressman Howard Berman I want to say that online infringement is not the only issue intellectual property issue we're working on together chairman Smith and good lad introduced the America and America Invents Act and held a hearing on it last week I want to applaud you for the work you've done on that and the similarities between the Smith good light bill patent bill and the legislation that passed the Senate last month is no coincidence we've been working together for several congresses now the fact the Senate bill is based on the original bill authored by chairman Smith back of 2005 you know at a time when everybody looks for strife and and conflict I think a lot of you who spend time covering the Congress know that there's an enormous amount of work that goes on between the house and the Senate between Republicans and Democrats that may not get a lot of press attention was important for the country and I think with the leadership of both chairman we're going to get a bill to the President's desk that will benefit America's vendors and won't add a penny to the deficit keep in mind American intellectual property accounts for more than five trillion dollars intellectual property intensive industries employ more than 18 million workers our intellectual property is crucial to America's prosperity in welfare one the reasons why we have both business and labor who've come together to support what we're doing the theft of American intellectual property threatens our prosperity online infringement the sale counterfeit goods costs American creators producers businesses billions of dollars and results in the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs this theft is unacceptable anytime certainly in this economic climate is damaging really to our security is the nation and the threat is often coming from rogue websites they often operate overseas they steal intellectual American intellectual property they make themselves look legitimate they have fancy graphics they look youthful look like real logos they accept well-known payment cards and then they sell Americans stolen goods that's theft pure and simple nothing more in digital stories selling stolen and the case of counterfeits often dangerous products you're buying a counterfeit product does make safety standards you can risk your life if they existed in the physical world if it was a storefront doing this everyone agree go down rate them lock them up shutter the place well we have to do that the same if it's happening over the Internet and so it shows that this is not a Republican or democratic issue it's not a labor or business issue it is an issue that affects every one of us and I want to stop this I want people to have to obey the law but especially I want to make sure those people the very inventive people in our country and we have such remarkable men and women who invent that they can be protecting what they do thank you very much this is a big problem it's a big problem for our industry it's big problem for our company and it's great to see such a diverse group of people coming together to focus on a very real problem like this and online counterfeiting is becoming increasingly and I think really over the last couple of years it's gotten much worse a growing problem in our industry and we're chasing thousands of counterfeiters who are selling millions of dollars in fake products and that's an obvious problem for branded company Azar's and others in our industry we saw that loss of sales its high cost of enforcement where we can actually enforce that at all and at the end of the day it's a threat to real jobs in this country for people who are trying to make and sell legitimate products but at the end of the day the most important thing to us is it's a problem for consumers and its consumers who are tricked into paying for phony product and putting their payment information over the Internet to a criminal who then sends them a substandard product so the one thought I want to leave you with today is we often get notified of these rogue sites from different services that we employ or we may stumble upon them ourselves but increasingly the way we're finding out about them is through our warranty dept and that's when consumers are coming to us and they've got a product that didn't work that failed them in a rough terrain or someplace where they needed a product to perform and they are more than disappointed to find out that they bought it from someone who's breaking the law and made a product that didn't meet any safety standards or quality standards Thank You senator leahy for inviting my participation today and for your courageous leadership in fighting online infringement and thank you also to each of the members of Congress for your support and combatting digital theft I'm Paul Almeida president of the department for professional employees at the afl-cio the department is a coalition of 23 unions representing more than 4 million professional and technical workers among those unions are 9 that represent hundreds of thousands of creative professionals and other workers in the arts entertainment media industries the members include actors stage employees and technicians musicians writers editors and many others my message is simple for these skilled professionals online infringement is wage theft for these unique industries many hard-working professionals depend on residual and royalty payments for much of their income back end payments from repeated showings of films and television shows and royalties is how they earn their living those payments also fund their health insurance and pension programs digital theft costs arts entertainment and media industries billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of too few people who download entertainment illegally recognize though that they are stealing wages and benefits from workers the reality lends to a special urgency to the work of each member of Congress here today to undertake the nine arts and entertainment and media unions that I am honored to represent unanimously support the combating online infringement and counterfeit act in the last Congress and they are ready to work with you again today you started by saying this was bipartisan and bicameral you also have business and labor so and they're all on the same side so I'm not sure what you call that but I'll leave that to you I tell palomita that we call it very very good coalition sure that somebody who owns a business sell for less to compete with the person who broke into their store the night before and stole half their goods that are selling them on the street corner for less or should they be able to call the police and say why don't you arrest a guy broke into our business I go I go to the ladder you charge too much you're not going to sell and that's a business thing but the fact is and if you make a lousy movie it's not going to sell no matter what just charge it for look at some of the remainder things are you going to store look at your specials on some DVDs look at you said I wouldn't watch that you're paid if you paid me to it on the other hand you find something really good it makes a makes a good thing but those are business things but people should if somebody create something and they sell it for too much and they can't it doesn't sell well that's a business thing and they'll don't change their pricing but they shouldn't have to compete against stolen property you shouldn't have to compete against criminals if you're obeying the law if you're following the rules if you're doing what you're supposed to do you shouldn't have to be in competition with criminals

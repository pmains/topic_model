rain in the crossfire tonight senators Ben Cardin and Lindsey Graham moments ago we learned President Obama wrapped up a one-hour call with Vladimir Putin earlier today President Obama announced a new round of actions to support the people of Ukraine and condemn Russia for its invasion of Crimea Republicans it should be noted support many of these steps in fact Lindsey Graham supported them earlier on our show and yet Republicans like our guest senator Graham continue their personal attacks against the president for not showing leadership our present is weak and indecisive in the eyes of the world right now every time the president has on national television and threatens Putin or anyone like Putin everybody's eyes roll including mine I think Putin believes that Obama is really all talk and no action if you disagree with the President substantively fine disagree dissent is indeed patriotic but the latest insults against the president not only smack of petty partisan opportunism it's these baseless insults that are actually undermining the president's leadership and our nation's in role in the world senator Graham don't you think these sorts of petty personal attacks our beneath your office as a u.s. senator well as much as I like me which is quite a lot i don't think the world revolves around what i say but I do believe my criticism the president has been justified and in our democratic society they didn't mind criticizing bush bush made his fair share of mistakes let me take what my real basic problem is whether you agree with Snowden's a hero or traitor I think it's a traitor when you tell the Russians don't give him asylum there will be consequences they do and nothing happens it hurts us when you tell the side don't cross this red line please don't use chemical weapons against your own people he does there will be consequences and the consequences he's stronger in the opposition's weaker and when you tell the world we're going to get those who kill the four Americans in Libya and CNN can interview the chief suspect and nobody's been captured it hurts us so mr. president now is the time to change that narrative but sir you're also talking about the president who got bin Laden who the use of drones the killing of American citizens abroad you're calling him you're not attacking his polish positions you're calling it a week I said he was very brave to make the bin Laden call to send troops into Pakistan was a very tough decision sir don't you ok this is what never mind I come the United States think I'm being accurate when he does something good and I think his foreign policy is falling apart there are no consequences when you defy wit Obama touch do and they're better start being some of the world's going to be a very dangerous place

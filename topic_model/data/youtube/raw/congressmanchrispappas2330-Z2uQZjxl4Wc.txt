one of the things that we have to address and one of the reasons why we wanted to convene this panel of experts here today is to focus on the disparities that exist uh pre-covered through covid especially as they relate to women in the workplace and women entrepreneurs we know that this has been a tremendously unequal recession that we've experienced um you know women about 23 percent according to a recent study considered leaving the workforce during this pandemic whereas men that figure was only 13 we know when it comes to the experiences of women entrepreneurs there have been disparities as well through this covet experience we know that women according to a recent study uh felt that their overall health of their business um was either good or strong that fell by 13 points during this covet experience and for male-owned businesses that barely changed so clearly something is happening here and i think we have to work to continue to get the resources uh where they're needed most and that's why uh through the congressional coveted relief bills there has been a focus especially through the last few bills on getting help to disadvantaged businesses and women-owned businesses um and we can see some of the evidence of that in the american rescue plan and hopefully we'll get to unpack a little bit of that here today but we knew early on that um those with armies of lawyers and accountants our bigger companies were often the ones who were first in line to get the help that was there and i i'm thankful that we were able to refine that over time to really focus on small small businesses our main street companies those that define the character here in new hampshire and drive our economy forward many of them are owned by women and we've got to continue to work to meet the needs of these companies moving forward

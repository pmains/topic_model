madam Speaker there was no more important advocate of environmental issues as a member of the trade working group than was Suzanne Bonamici from Oregon and I'm proud to yield to her one and a half minutes the gentlewoman from Oregon is recognized thank you madam Speaker I rise in support of the updated United states-mexico candidate trade agreement in the years that followed NAFTA's enactment in 1994 American jobs were outsourced to Mexico and the wages and working conditions were not improved for Mexican workers this agreement while not perfect is an important opportunity to fix the damage from NAFTA and to create a new baseline for future trade agreements the renegotiated u.s. MCA strengthens labor rules so what will be easier to prove violations it includes robust monitoring systems and strong enforcement tools including people on the ground in Mexico to monitor compliance importantly the updated US MCA no longer includes harmful provisions that would have locked in high drug prices and made it more difficult for patients to access affordable generic drugs this final agreement also makes important advancements to protect to our environment it improves environmental rules puts them in the text of the agreement provides a path to reducing hydrofluoric carbon emissions protects against overfishing makes it easier to prove environmental violations and secures more than 600 million dollars to implement the environment provisions and address pollution and marine debris throughout the negotiation process I fought hard for the inclusion of strong climate provisions I'm disappointed that the Trump administration rejected our efforts we did however include a clause that creates a path frame for adding additional environmental and conservation agreements in the future I'll continue to do all I can to pass and implement bold policies to combat climate change the u.s. MCA is significantly better than the agreement that the Trump administration brought to us it is a major improvement over the NAFTA rules that are currently in place it will bring more certainty to workers to organize and for the environment I think especially Speaker Pelosi for appointing me to the workgroup and the hard-working staff that got us to today and I yield back the balance of my time

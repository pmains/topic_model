so is a grand Morgan it's still possible representative Jim Heintz Democrat from Connecticut Matt Lewis a senior contributor at the daily caller and a columnist at the week could see it but beau thanks so much for joining us gentlemen representative Himes first who get your thoughts on that NBC poll well you know Congress has never held in particularly high esteem by the American people certainly in the aggregate you know people always hate Congress but like their own member what was really important about that pole though was and I make this comment just to report the poll which is that it was a salute catastrophe for the Republican Party you know Obamacare has risen seven points in popularity in the last two weeks and the Republican Party is in the low 20s historically low numbers and the reason that's important is because that gives the John Boehner Xin the Mitch McConnell's and the haley barbour's the establishment Republican Party the moment they need to get their Ted Cruz Tea Party wing in line and say look guys we cannot take this for too much longer we've got to do a deal and that's why you see you know optimism in the market in some sense that we may get a deal done soon do you think a grand bargain is still possible well you know one step at a time right we need to get through the debt ceiling potential debacle and I think there's a good chance we're gonna do that and there's some complication around reopening the government that's still a negotiating point and whatnot I hope that where this winds up is just as Luke said that you know there is a structured period in which we have that conversation about our longer term fiscal health but again we you got to walk before you run Matt what do you think should we all just be afraid should we have confidence that a substantial deal could get done what what's your reporting tell you well I'm more skeptical for a variety of reasons I mean look I think it is true that the pole was a catastrophe for Republicans I think it's true that John Boehner and Mitch McConnell know it's horrible for the Republican brand but that is almost irrelevant nowadays they can't whip their members and so if you're if you're a congressman from Texas or Kansas what do you care you wanted to fund Obamacare so you double down you're not going to cave in on this and if you're Ted Cruz are likely from Texas in Utah you know you believe look we need to fund Obamacare so is is important as this poll is it is is concerned as it is for Republicans I don't know that it matters in terms of actually winning votes especially in the house mm-hmm so I mean what would you say to investors who are watching Congress very closely this weekend representative but what do you want them should be thinking about yeah look I I wouldn't you know entirely dispute what Matt said but look politics are a very dynamic thing and you know the establishment wing of the Republican Party never wanted to be where Ted Cruz dragged them into and you know the polls today are the legitimate amor extreme wing of the Republican Party and everybody has always known that John Boehner at some point in this situation was going to need to stand up to that wing the question was how and when and now with the polls that are out he's got a little more standing that doesn't make it easy for him but but I do think it gives them a lot more standing to do so here's how I think it plays out look you know though I think a markets are a little ahead of themselves a deal is not done and and bad things can still happen you know we're working tomorrow while traders are not in front of their screens that is inherently a slightly scary thing but I do think that the trajectory at this point is to at least get a deal in the next 72 hours on the debt ceiling which ought to calm the markets you know it and Tuesday when they reopen so is Obamacare off the table at this point then Matt yeah here's the thing Obamacare was never going to be defunded or delayed but the really interesting thing is that what could happen as was just stated is that you actually could have a deal that raise debt ceiling while the government stays shut down and and it's interesting because there's a weird coalition that actually would support this on one hand you have conservatives in the house and conservative outside groups like the club for growth the Senate conservatives fund heritage action very powerful groups they want the debt limit out of the way because they know that that could be a default catastrophic they want to keep the government shutdown and fight it's a fight over the funding Obamacare but the interesting thing is I think Barack Obama would also love this right he gets off his back the notion that he could be the first president preside over a default and he gets to continue bashing Republicans and seeing them crater in the polls for a government shutdown so I think it's very possible you could have a scenario where the government stays shut down and you get a clean so-called clean raising of the debt ceiling all right we will leave a camera thank you very much we'll be watching preciate time

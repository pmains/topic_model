and i've had the the honor of serving on the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee committee you serve on uh which oversees as you know the department of homeland security since the committee was first formed almost two decades later i remained convinced that the nominees we confirm to lead that department must possess sound judgment integrity relevant experience boundless energy and the leadership skills that will enable them to take on some of those daunting challenges that we face today as a nation the department of homeland security is a department with a budget of over 50 billion dollars in a staff of over 240 uh thousand men and women its agencies protect our country from ever evolving domestic and foreign threats they respond to natural disasters and they help to secure our critical infrastructure unfortunately in recent years the senior leadership ranks of this department have come to remind many of us of something akin to executive branch swiss cheese with critical positions remaining vacant for far too long or without senate confirmation at all in fact the department of homeland security has been without a senate confirmed secretary for 21 months think about that 21 months meanwhile there's no shortage of work to be done from the clear and present threat of domestic terrorism to responding to the solar winds cyber breach to helping distribute the covert vaccine now more than ever it's crucial for this important department to be led by men and women who have been vetted and confirmed by members of this body the american people deserve a capable leader at the helm of this department and i believe that leader is alejandro mayorkas holly represents the best of america born in havana cuba ali knows firsthand what it's like for a family to flee its native land and come to the united states in search of refuge he's a man of integrity a person of principle who possesses a truly truly remarkable work ethic what's more he may well be the most qualified nominee we've ever been asked to consider to lead the department of homeland security he has previously served admirably it's his deputy secretary for nearly four years and before that as the head of dhs's largest agency the u.s citizenship and immigration service as director of this agency he worked to combat immigration fraud he directed and implemented the daca program to protect hundreds of thousands of dreamers and much more as deputy secretary he led the department's successful unity of uh effort initiative to improve morale at an agency which previously had the lowest morale of any large agency in our federal government in fact the department there reported the greatest improvement in morale in the final year of the obama administration was the department of homeland security in large part due to ali's leadership and that of former secretary jay as deputy secretary ms majorca also shepherded through congress cyber security legislation to enable the department of homeland security to better protect our dot gov and private sector networks i think it may have also had something to do with reining in the ebola plague but those who know ali well will tell you that he is no ideologue he has no partisan agenda rather he is a thoughtful policy-minded public servant who has spent much of his career improving the department of homeland security so that the men and women who serve there can better protect our homeland and we've seen that he is willing to work with democrats republicans and their staffs to get things done that's one of the many reasons that five former secretaries of homeland security democrat and republican alike have encouraged us to confirm him swiftly i know that ali can do this job he's already demonstrated that and i believe that many of our colleagues here today know it as well after all ali mayorkas has been confirmed three times in the past including once as u.s attorney for the central district of columbia having said that though some of our republican colleagues are attempting now to use a 2013 ig investigation as a cudgel against his nomination as it turns out we've seen this movie before and i should note that a number of these those colleagues who were not serving in congress at that time in 2013 and most were not serving on the homeland security and government affairs committee when we considered ali's nomination that year to serve as deputy secretary i was privileged to serve as chairman of the committee at that time in fact i led the fight to confirm him toughest fight i've had in 20 years here well it's one thing to disagree with the nominee politically but to continue to question holly's dedication integrity on the basis of an ig report as some of our republican colleagues have done flies in the face of available evidence including his decades of public service and at a time when our nation faces so many crises we cannot afford less than full support for this nominee so i don't take a few minutes today to set the record straight if i can so here here are the facts in 2013 an ig investigation into ali mayorka says oversight of a program within the united states citizens and immigration services known as the eb-5 program was conducted in a highly regular manner including through false leases to the media literally on the eve of confirmation hearing as a result of the ig's public leaks leaks and his failure to complete a report before the close of congress ali was denied a chance to have any uh concerns fully litigated ahead of his confirmation in the senate in 2013. ultimately the ig who investigated the who initiated the investigation stepped down later that year amid bipartisan calls for his resignation and last year that same former ig the same former ig was charged by the department of justice with 16 counts of fraud 16 counts of fraud following ali's confirmation my staff and i worked to ensure that the subsequent ig completed a report into any allegations in 2015 that new ig john roth produced a report building on the work of the 2013 investigation the report found no evidence of wrongdoing by ali none what it did suggest however was that some of his actions as director of united states citizenship and immigration services may have created quote the appearance of favoritism close quote in particular it asserted that ali met with a number of well-connected individuals over time regarding their concerns over the eb-5 investor visa program after ali joined the united states citizenship and immigration services as its director in 2009 it he came to the conclusion that this program was not well run he was not alone in this conclusion ali has testified that his director of united states citizenship and immigration services he received more complaints from members of congress on both sides of the aisle regarding the eb-5 program that he did about any other program in response to these bipartisan concerns as the director of the agency ali did what in my opinion many of us would expect an agency had to do he rolled up his sleeves and he worked with his employees to gain an understanding of how the program was being run and to find out how they might make it run better he directed systemic changes that included improving management and administration of the program in order to reduce favoritism and to combat fraud pride he also proposed reforms of the program to congress in an effort to prevent future abuse abuses reforms which unfortunately were not pursued by congress our fault not his and yes as director he said president for getting back to members of congress quickly and responds to their inquiries even if the answers his agency came up with was ultimately not what they wanted to hear completing the 2015 ig report was important to clear ali of any wrongdoing but his findings and ali's actions have been mischaracterized by some of our colleagues who assert that he showed favoritism by reaching out personally to the state the staff of former senator harry reid over an eb-5 related issue they had raised on behalf of a constituent as it turns out though the report is clear ale mariokas did reach out to that staff not to deliver preferential treatment but rather to let the staff know that the u.s citizenship and immigration services would not be able to accommodate the request for that staff and their senator and why if responsiveness to inquiries by members of congress and their staff regardless of whether the response is favorable or not is a problem for my colleagues any of my colleagues that is news to me let me make one more point if i may as someone who knows uh ali has known him for years knows his family knows his work knows his ethic i believe the 2015 ig report was missing some needed context let me try to provide it fortunately though ali provided in a 32 page response a response was almost as long as the ig report itself among other things he describes how he met not just with democratic members but with a number of our republican colleagues to address issues important to them including international adoption and fighting fraud in our immigration programs and following those meetings just as with the eb-5 program ali took appropriate steps to make improvements based on feedback from his constituents that is what leaders should do those examples and others included right there in the 2015 ig report served to further illustrate ali's commitment to doing what he felt was right to improve the department by carrying out the law without fear of favor and by responding promptly and fully to inquiries from members of congress on both sides of the aisle and if ali mayorkas is confirmed today i'm hopeful that many of our colleagues and our staffs will have a chance in the years to come to work with him and his team at the department of homeland security witness for themselves the kind of leader he truly is we are fortunate that an individual is well prepared and qualified as alejandro mayorkas may soon have the opportunity to lead the department through the many crisis and challenges it faces in which our country face today but you don't have to take my word for it the late tom coburn a dear friend of mine and former colleague of many of us led the fight against ali's confirmation in 2013 when he'd been nominated to be deputy secretary of homeland security tom was then the ranking member of the homeland security committee and i was serving as its chairman tom sally is deceased we lost a good man a really good man a couple of years ago tom staff director of the committee at the time was a very capable gentleman his name was keith ashdown keith ashton and i think it's important to note that last week keith sent a letter to our committee in it he wrote of his strong support today ali's nomination to serve as secretary of dhs and mr mr ashton wrote these words and i want to quote him he said i first came to know uh mariocos when i was the republican staff director of this committee the homeland security committee at that time i was working this is uh mr ashton so i was working to la blaca's nomination to serve as deputy secretary of the department of homeland security he went on to say with the benefit of hindsight i am glad my efforts to block his nomination were ultimately unsuccessful how often do you hear that mr ashton went on to write as deputy secretary mayarchus worked in a bipartisan manner to respond to the committee's requests and concerns he added having been on the other side of this battle i understand the importance of vetting a nomination thoroughly but no one no one has been vetted more than has ali mayorkas mr ashton concluded with these words and he said i urge the united states senate to expeditionally confirm ali mayorkas as department of homeland security secretary without delay without delay signed sincerely keith ashdown let me close today madam president by saying that i'm grateful and i know that the mariokaz family is grateful as well to keith ashdown and to the republican senators who broken rights and committee and on the floor last in last week's cloture vote who have taken the time to fully consider this nomination and who now support it we're grateful to you i sincerely hope that more of our colleagues will join them and us today i would say to my colleagues i don't take my reputation on a lot of people but i am more than willing to stake it on my orcas just as i have three times before in the same chamber and if you're undecided today colleagues i hope you will join me this time ali mayokas will make us in this country proud in fact i believe he already has

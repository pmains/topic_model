Thank You mr. speaker I would like to thank the Senate for working in a bipartisan manner to pass the violence against women reauthorization act however the House Republican version of the bill fails to protect all women including native american women immigrant women and the LGBT community i rise today in strong opposition to the House Republican version of the violence against women reauthorization act as an ER doctor I have seen firsthand the beaten and bruised bodies of women victims and the invisible scars left on the victim her family and community Native American women in my district and across the country endure an epidemic of domestic violence and in most cases the abusers are not members of the tribe tribes must have the right to protect their daughters sisters and mothers from violence we must work to make sure that all women are protected from domestic violence I urge all of my colleagues to join me in opposition to the House Republican version of this legislation and I look forward to the passage of the bipartisan Senate version of this legislation thank you very much I yield back the remaining the gentleman's time has expired

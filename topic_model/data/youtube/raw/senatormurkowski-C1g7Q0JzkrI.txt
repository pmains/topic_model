to our to our witnesses thank you for being here this afternoon we appreciate it uh chairman schatz appreciate the opportunity that we have before the committee to focus on this significant measure this infrastructure bill that was passed into law last year i spent a lot of time last year working to to advance this to make sure that we were able to get it over the finish line but now we're in the harder stage and that is is implementation and ensuring its success and that starts with robust federal oversight of the federal agencies charged with the extraordinary responsibility of implementing the law which in many cases involves setting up brand new programs and ramping up existing programs at a much larger scale so it's clearly no easy task i want to extend my thanks to the four federal agencies that are represented here today and uh and an appreciation for the participation in the federal grant symposium that i hosted in anchorage last month i also want to to thank uh nicole barimo and afn for for your contributions the in-person participation to help tribal state local local leaders begin to navigate this massive new law was pivotal to the success of the event that we had i'm hopeful that we were able to really develop some some good partnerships so that as these programs and the grant opportunities come together alaskans know who to call and can begin to prioritize in that way um so much that is included within the uh the opportunities here um and it was even before the infrastructure bill where we saw federal resources coming together on broadband what we worked to build to create the tribal broadband connectivity grant program funding that at one billion dollars through our 2020 year end appropriations and then the covet 19 relief bill we built on that with the infrastructure law not only building at the broadband but but everything else that that came with it as we're seeing with tribal broadband and many other programs funded in the law successful implementations going to require the interagency coordination robust tribal consultation intergovernmental collaboration at all levels and the development of a workforce that includes members of the local native community many of the comments and questions that we picked up uh from alaskans and native leaders have two themes the first theme is optimism about the unprecedented level of funding but the second theme is a concern about missing out on this once in a generation opportunities so i'm pleased that we've got these federal agencies to testify about how they're going to ensure that the bipartisan infrastructure law will in fact meet the needs across indian country where grants are competitive technical assistance will be paramount to making sure areas of highest need are not left behind after two years of the pandemic many of our tribal administrators and our native leaders they're they're maxed out they're stretched thin and so i'm going to be very interested in hearing how the administration is taking an all of government approach and making tribes aware of all of the relevant opportunities again i want to welcome our witnesses not only on this panel here in present with us but also those who are virtually a particular shout out and welcome to nicole baramo she's the executive vice president general counsel for alaska federation of natives and again i mentioned that afn has been working really hard to help alaska natives navigate the many federal and state agencies that are distributing funds and providing services so thank her for participating and i will look forward with great interest to the testimony from both panels today thank you

there's a three-part strategy on reducing the year the deficit one of those is to freeze in place over the next three years domestic discretionary spending the second piece is to put in place a deficit reduction Commission to come back to us at the end of the year say what we ought to do with respect to entitlement program spending is what we ought to do with respect to the expiring Bush tax cuts third part I just really a waste fraud and abuse agenda and the last part is to to wane in the growth of defense spending secretary gates wants to take a hundred billion dollars out of the defense budget that's the four part 4 part strategy it's now two thousand two agencies have had a responsibility not all federal agencies but a bunch of them had a responsibility report improper payments payments by mistake fraudulent payments out sort of thing and so agencies of denison if not we strengthen that just considerably with legislation the President signed in July that I authored and included there is not only do all federal agencies have to report in propagators they got to stop making and the second thing the third thing they need to do is to run and recover the monies that have been improperly paid over pace in many cases finally pay and so report your improper payments to stop make an improper payments three Gladding record we cover the money that info misspent your son called a tax cap that's been around for a long time and in 2001 the IRS said that there's about 300 billion billion dollars in taxes that are owed not being collected by the the IRS we have some idea who owes but unable to recover full of reasons the dreary we've in my own office we've gone to work on this to say how can we go to the or dr. eliminate the 300 billion dollars in tax gap but we've identified a number of provisions that we can change in the tax law that will make sure better ensure that everybody is paying their fair share you know before we raise the taxes I think to me at least we ought to say the smart thing to do is to make sure before the raise taxes make sure that people taxes are pink what they owned his Governor of Delaware had the line invito I could be to a bill I could be two parts to build most governors have that power the president has something like that all that's very weak the president back and scientists spending bill into law and come back and say by the way Congress there's some provisions here I'd like to reduce or eliminate and the he sends a message to the congress it's called a rescission to rescind reduce spending the Congress generally ignores them going to go away our legislation would say but in the future when the president signs and appropriations bill spend money have some ideas to reduce portion of those appropriations to resend them that we'd have to vote on it we could vote it down in the House or Senate simple majority 51 and the Senate 218 a house would kill the presidential decision we'd have to vote on it the idea is to try for four years of see how it works it's not the whole endgame that it's actually to be a very helpful tool in our toolbox reducing our deficits 2001 there's some time 45 billion dollars in major weapon systems cost overrun 45 billion dollars last year 295 billion dollars in major a weapon system cost overruns then we have that going on the key is to find out which weapon systems are coming over budget we're not performing and eliminating if they can't get to get them straightened out last year we kill the f-22 fighter aircraft usually expensive not very reliable this year we're going to pull the plug on the production of c-17s we're a good airplane we just have to have a whole lot more of them then so this kind of thing that we need to do we need strong presidential leadership we have it leadership from secretary gates Barbara defense we have it now we have to have to stand up and be counted in the Commerce we can ignore deficits we could sort of like let them go along without trying to Dressen that's no less luckily I'm not good for our country is not good for our long-term economy it's not good for the kids to their grandchildren we leave behind behind us there's no one silver bullet eliminating budget deficits we have to go at it from all different directions we need Democrats with problems we need to house the senate so we need the other president and together I think we can make a real difference and I'm determined to do just

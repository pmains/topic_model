Thank You mr. Speaker I rise to urge my colleagues to become co-sponsors of my bill the pregnant workers Fairness Act while current law prohibits discrimination based on pregnancy childbirth or related medical conditions and directs employers to treat pregnancies the same as any other condition that might temporarily limit an employee's ability to perform some job functions these protections have proven inadequate case law shows that courts are uncertain even confused about the scope of the law requiring Congress to set the record straight while several states have clarified pregnant workers rights this is a national problem that warrants a national solution my bill would require an employer to make reasonable accommodations for these workers unless this creates an undue hardship on the employer an employer would be prevented from forcing a pregnant worker to take home addition that she does not want or need and an employer would be prevented from forcing a pregnant worker to take a leave when another reasonable accommodation could keep her on the job this is a simple solution to a problem I work our women and families should not be facing I urge my colleagues to become a co-sponsor of this bill to ensure that a pregnant woman need never decide between maintaining a healthy pregnancy and maintaining her paycheck thank you and I yield back

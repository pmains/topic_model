[Music] please welcome u.s representative scott franklin of florida's 15th district thanks for coming on the show congressman good morning thanks for having me congressman can you tell us why it's important for congress to pass your bill that prevents abortion organizations from profiting off of the sale of fetal remains this actually was something that was banned by law uh back in the early 90s but unfortunately there was a loophole in that bill and has subsequently been exploited as we as we've determined this is a bill that's been brought up before in previous congresses it's also been discussed in the senate that's just not anything that we've finally gotten over the goal line and we were looking at it as a staff and wondering why that was the case so we reintroduced the bill and uh we're hoping we can get uh get at the attention it deserves in this congress if not we will continue to push it in the next congress and can you describe more specifically how these abortion providers exploit this loophole so you know the the sale for profit of fetal tissue is supposed to be illegal per per prior law but what's happened is these abortion providers have discovered that there's some loopholes in there that allow them to charge for handling fees transportation processing disease screening other different types of of mechanisms that they can put very vague pricing onto and there's no guidelines around that and when we've we've seen examples where we're groups like planned parenthood that are profitable or they're profiting very significantly off of this and you know as an example from a study that senator chuck grassley had conducted several years ago there was an example of planned parenthood selling a 20-week old aborted fetus to an outside company for 60 dollars and then this company turning around and parsing out the fetus grotesquely and then making a profit over 2 400 and they do it under the guise of transportation fees handling costs and that sort of thing and this is happening on scale and it's allowing these companies to circumvent the law 20 weeks that's almost more than halfway through the pregnancy correct yeah it's a pretty sickening report if you read what they've done to these these fetuses and so it appears it appears that the law prevents them from profiting off these but this bill that you're proposing is more of an enforcement proposal yes it is yeah the law already prohibits it but this is going to make the language very specific and clear that none of those fees that they've been charging and associating with what they're calling legitimate expenses can be charged there'll be no mechanism whatsoever to make a profit off the sale fees and how would a potential supreme court decision to overturn roe v wade play into this well that's that's going to change the landscape significantly and um you know it's going to push a lot of this back to the states and that's going to be interesting to see on the state by state basis how they choose to proceed with it but in any case whether a state has an outright ban or they allow abortions to any extent by federal law there'd be no opportunity for profit if there are fetuses out there congressman democrats control both chambers what do you think the fate of your bill is going to be and how are the midterm elections going to play into this well especially considering now we're about to head into june we've got elections coming up in just a few months i don't see this getting the lie today on the house floor but it's really more than just a messaging bill this is a bill that's been introduced as i've mentioned previously and has never gone anywhere so we're patient just as it's taken us 50 years to fight against roe uh we'll continue to fight this issue and if we can do it in this congress we will if not you can be certain that we'll be bringing it back up again in january u.s representative scott franklin of florida thank you so much for your update on this thank you

three thank you very much and it's thanks for everybody being here thanks miss Wilkes for being here with your ear story and you know it's kind of frustrating it gets to kind of a larger thing I'm on a Oversight and investigations we're going to insulin pricing and it kinda looks the difference and net price and list price and it seems here I have an instance that we all have instances in our area emergency situation wasn't murder suing physicians where first in my district who's actually a insurance brokers reserves 250 a talk about insurance literate had an emergency situation with the son and was built over 30,000 dollars for a service and if he had had an insurance event and network had been less than 10 and he actually sent down what he wanted to they would refuse to do it said if you'll sit down with me and show me your price and your charge and some kind of reasonable return I would pay but they wouldn't sit down and go through their price and charge so that's just a big issues I'll write you a check today if you let me if you can show to me that that's really part of it and that's that sort of the problem that we're getting at just the overall system here but mr. gillich Gelfand they're getting back to the to the notice of out-of-network and your testimony you mentioned the need to tighten the requirements in the discussion draft on patient consent of for out-of-network procedures could you elaborate what it what you think this should be you know we associate ourselves with the remarks of families USA and that you cannot simply give 24 hours and allow the physician to surprise bill as long as you have 24 hours notice that a surprise bill is coming because oftentimes you may be going to facility but you literally have no choice about some of those ancillary providers that will be present at that facility so against to miss Thornton mr. ranking member Walden said that the person asked about my is anesthesiologist verse on this form and network and that provider there didn't I'm sure was a gastro knowledge asur whoever's do it didn't know I mean how did the health insurance plans fit in to notice how you were talking about how this would work so I might walk said I need service there in or out or network how do we know and how would the health insurance plans be involved in this so in the first in the first place it's important when you have an emergency or you're at an in-network facility patients are protected right the federal law this federal law would sort of swoop in have situations where consumers are getting that bill because they would be protected by the payment benchmark that we're talking about today now in scenarios that aren't covered by the bill we do think there is an important role to get notice to be able to call the health plan and say hey I've got this procedure next week can you let me know you know what the network status of my provider will be and we think that process can work for more things that are scheduled in advance and that emergency can when you have no control over who's gonna see you and you're in no position to have that discuss look at me in just an emergency room because mrs. Wilkes wasn't she was in a labor and delivery room I assume and next thing you know you're in a NICU so I mean it's not just in tala type of situation I understand that you know we talked about just don't look at unintended consequences we just have to move forward but but it is an issue with emergency room physicians because they have to take care of they can't talk about price and we that is different than than other things moving forward I do have a question miss Thornton you're subject to the medical loss ratio requirements and those requirements require minimum percentage of premium dollars taken to be spent on pain claims can you speak to how an arbitration system might have an impact on MLR requirements sure happy to do that so there are two different components of a medical loss ratio sort of what we're spending on medical care and what we're spending at administrative costs on the medical cost side it's really important here that any solution that we're talking about to end surprise billing does not increase medical spending that $30,000 bill that you mentioned right that's reflected in people's premiums that they pay every month for coverage so that's sort of one piece but on the other side if you're taking a bit of a bureaucratic process and inserting it into the healthcare system dr. Friedman mentioned 150 million ER visits a year even if you took a percentage of those and threw that to arbitration with those administrative costs I would be adding a lot of costs to the system so we would have to your argument would be that we'd have to take that out of the medical loss ratio calculation it would be administrative cost and borne by the health plan yes okay so this really isn't for everyone but might I just have a few less than a minute but so once the bills put into place there's a furball if there is it becomes a federal arbitration system what do you think congressional oversight should be I know that would be something as well just wants to talk about or well I've been sitting here listening thinking I pay my insurance premiums I do my part and I expect the bill to be paid I mean there's only so much I can do to control that and I don't really care how the reimbursement works and quite frankly I think the insurance industry is doing probably better and their bottom line than my bottom line I want to go to the best provider possible and I want the best care possible I don't really care how the payment works okay thanks Edna and I won't go down the list because my time is expired but hope things are going well and are in other part of our area we're looking at genetics and things like that and some really great things that are happening in Emily's hopefully your son will qualify for those as well as they his genetics will qualify not just your insurance your in genetics I'll qualify is my point thanks appreciate the gentleman yields back

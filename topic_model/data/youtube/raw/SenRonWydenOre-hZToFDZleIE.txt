senator wyden thank you mr chairman it's been an excellent hearing and i want to talk for a minute about one way and in my view that our country can address this income inequality issue and do it in a way that democrats and republicans will support that we can actually see some real coming together around i want to start with you dr bernstein i know you're one of one of the advisors to somebody who is part of my little cross section of economist mark thoma at the university of oregon and let me start with you if i could one of the fastest growing parts of the federal government are the tax expenditures were upwards of a trillion dollars today and what is clear you see it with progressive folks you see it on the conservative pages of the wall street journal that disproportionately tax expenditures go to the folks who are best off in america so it seems to me that if you clean out these tax expenditures that democrats and republicans now correctly have concluded disproportionately benefit the folks that are best off and use those very same dollars to broaden the base of the tax system we would be in a position in our country to help grow the economy create good paying jobs that's what happened after progressive democrats and ronald reagan came together in the middle 80s we'd be in a position to grow the economy and make a real dent in terms of income inequality i mean you could almost legislate what amounts to a pay hike for middle class folks because you would uh be broadening the base and putting them in a better position to uh keep up with with costs and they haven't had a pay raise for a decade dr bernstein any quarrels with that kind of analysis uh i very much agree with the broad architecture of your thinking there and i do view this as somewhat of a holy grail for tax reform and i think that's fairly widely agreed upon by folks on both sides of the aisle now you know the devil's in the details and when you start going after people's tax expenditures they get a little sensitive but one that i mentioned in my discussion today and i even cited a a tax expenditure cost from the joint committee on taxation was uh the benefits we uh uh provide uh in this in this uh in that part of the code to capital gains and dividends which amount to 450 billion in terms of its cost to the treasury over five years but i would say this two things one um the distribution of of of expenditures is skewed as you suggested not that many go to the middle class the main one is the mortgage interest deduction and that's that's not trivial uh but that again is largely uh uh benefits those in the top uh few uh in the upper percentiles uh i'd also say that that where there's also some important tax expenditures that i've i had argued in my testimony that that this committee on the budget should protect uh are refundable credits that help to support the uh income and i'd argue the opportunities of lowest our lowest income families uh two particularly important ones because uh they were introduced in the recovery act and have been uh i think uh smartly uh uh renewed uh um in in at the end of 2010 uh was the uh uh uh refundable uh credit uh on the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit uh those uh are uh tax expenditures that i i think actually uh are very consistent with improving the opportunity and dampening moderating the inequality that we've talked about so far i want to let your colleagues um get into it i just wanted to again highlight the prospects in your response to my question i think reaffirms this the opportunity for bipartisanship in this area for example senator coats and i have introduced the first bipartisan approach really in 25 years since the reagan proposal senator coates to his credit keeps the refundable credits that you're talking about so we retain those and then with respect to capital gains and essentially investment income we put that on a progressive scale as well so as to really again try to bring this base broadening approach to essentially the entire economy i mean there's no reason why it can't be applied to uh investment income as well essentially under our approach we put a certain amount off limits and then everything above that we put on a progressive scale so yes somebody who makes all their income just on investment will pay a bit more but we've talked to people who work in that area and they say they can live with that and we broaden the base so as to bring a whole lot of additional people can i make one more quick point about this sir is it's very important not to view i i fully support everything you just said but i think it's very important not to view this as solely revenue neutral as if you'd want to essentially return all of the tax expenditures that you you get back from boarding the base in lower rates some of it needs to be reserved to reduce the deficit and to offset uh some of the deep spending cuts particularly the ones that threaten opportunity and mobility it's it's not fair that if i respond to everything that you you've said i want to get everybody into it our bill was actually scored by the joint committee on on taxation they essentially give informal analyses as generating you know revenue and then of course again on both sides of the political spectrum brookings folks who've been on the progressive side heritage folks on on the other side also highlight the fact that this kind of pro-growth approach to tax reform whether it will produce exactly what we had in in in the 80s the principles are still the same and given the fact that we have this growing income inequality in the united states and all sides all across the political spectrum people say tax expenditures have played a role in it this is a chance to bring i think democrats and republicans together and we're going to we're going to prosecute the case would any of you other other four who've been very patient like to add anything on on the question of tax expenditures and income inequality not required if nobody else is going to i'll just i wanted to add one thing um on the issue of taxes and the and the potential for some sort of alliance there's a new poll that just came out from the small business majority that asked small business owners about whether or not millionaires are paying their fair share in taxes and it has some really interesting new findings so i would encourage you to look at it because it's it's connected to that logic that a majority of small business owners favor letting the bush tax cuts lapse for those making more than 250 000 a year so um so that i think there is some opening there to at least talk about the folks at the high end any others yeah uh thank you for the opportunity uh senator wyden um i i would not disagree with uh some of the principles that you've articulated um i think it's not completely clear to me that it would have a big impact on the the sort of striking charts that we were just looking at i think um and maybe dr bernstein will correct me if i'm wrong the difference between his chart and and the chart in the back is that uh his is after tax and i think the one that's been presented up front was before tax so so i'm not sure that it will have the direct visual impact on on these charts what i what i do think is unfortunate about the tax expenditures is because uh the the benefits uh do do tend to flow to folks who have already accumulated assets it tends to subsidize uh asset purchases that would have been made anyway which is inefficient but which also has the effect of bidding up the price of these assets and so it puts things like home ownership take a look and i chairman conrad has been good enough to let me just wrap wrap up with this point take a look at some of the increases in income that middle class people would have under what senator coats and i are proposing he i'm not here speaking for him he's a conservative republican but for example we triple the standard direct deduction that means for a middle class family that is making ten thousand dollars a year in income that means thirty thousand dollars they make fifty sixty thousand dollars is put off limits so we're talking about putting thousands of dollars into the pockets of middle class folks by broadening the base doing it in a bipartisan way by getting at this tax expenditure issue which is so tilted according to all all philosophies and giving people that relief permanently so take a look at those numbers and be interested in your thoughts mr chairman thank you for the extra time yes

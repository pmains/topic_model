okay I'm ready to go uh yeah I think so I am ready to go alrighty Tommy ready to go we're always ready extra all right so welcome everybody to the happy hour for North Hunterdon my people tonight and I have the best people here in North Hunterdon so everybody welcome the way we'd usually do this is we ask you to post your questions in the chat and um we'll go ahead and call on you and this win he'll unmute you at that time and you can speak to Tom and how are things Tom how are you they are that's a loaded question Lauren start off with the hard stuff right I'm doing great well I'm you see where I am I'm sitting here in my on my back porch on a beautiful early summer day enjoying Hunterdon County and trying not to think too much about the problems of the world but that's that's somewhat hard you know I when I do think about the problems of the world I have moments of pessimism and terror but also moments great optimism and hope and strangely right now and in a more positive mood we've been through so much over the last few years and so much more over the last few months it's it's hard to be totally positive when we've just lost more than a hundred thousand Americans to this awful pandemic knowing that we that we could have prevented much of the suffering seeing millions of our fellow Americans unemployed anxious about their economic future again as a result of something that I think was largely avoidable but at the same time I think the way that the people are responding to these child just should give us a lot of confidence about our future the overwhelming majority of Americans did the right thing in response to the coronavirus not mostly I think because state government governments ordered us to shut down and stay home and practice social distancing but because we're practical people and we know that that was the right and responsible thing there was a study published by Nature today which estimated that the lock downs in the United States and I think five other countries saved somewhere between 1 and 3 million lives so think about that just by by being sensible by staying home and for many of us accepting very serious personal sacrifices we we contributed to saving between 1 and 3 million of our fellow human beings so despite all the noise around those policies we did the right thing and we did it relatively successfully and here in New Jersey of course were were on you know in the early phases of a of a careful gradual reopening and that's made possible because of wise decisions that our leaders made and because we all participated in that effort so that makes me feel somewhat optimistic and then the response to this horrible murder of an unarmed man by a police officer in mini Annapolis what happened to George Floyd galvanized up Americans in a really positive way and I think most of us most of the people demonstrating and the overwhelming majority who aren't demonstrating but who support the demonstrators according to all the coals understand that what they're what we're upset about is not just one incident that happened to be caught on tape but a much deeper problem of racism in many in just about every aspect of our society certainly in policing but not exclusively in and a feeling of disgust about about that about and determination to do better you know it's pretty extraordinary that there is overwhelming bipartisan support among the American people for the kinds of reforms that we are pushing now in the House of Representatives so much so that I think we may get some bipartisan deal ultimately on a police reform bill before you know Jordan in the next month something that we can send to president Trump something that I think he'll feel tremendous pressure to to actually sign that that could happen in the midst of all this apparent turmoil in our country I think is is pretty amazing obviously there are a lot of good things that can't happen until we have another election and depending on the results of that election but I'm I'm increasingly confident that the America of the the near and midterm future the America the next ten years or so is going to be defined by the opposite of what Donald Trump has tried to stand for the ideas that have been given new life in opposition to the contrast to the ugliness and brutality and almost nihilism of the Trump administration I think those are going to be the dominant ideas in this country for some time we're gonna be a country committed to universal health care that cares more about the environment that believes in equality and human rights that understands more deeply the meaning and importance of the rule of law and the fragility of our government institutions the importance of of constantly renewing them and reforming them and I think the importance of America being that shining example to people all around the world even now with President in the White House obviously he's not a shining example for anybody around the world apart from Putin people like that but he's look at all these demonstrations and European capitals around the George Floyd killing and they're not just protesting something that happened in America they're there looking to change their own countries for the better in Belgium they tore down the statue of King Leopold how many of you guys know who I so many of you know he was the king of Belgium when Belgium had colonial empire and committed horrible atrocities and genocide in Africa in the Congo especially at the turn of the 19th century and they were inspired by our grassroots Americans stand against racial discrimination to finally take action against confront an ugly card of their own history and so even now America's inspiring people in positive ways so that's those are my my more optimistic thoughts on this beautiful Saturday afternoon of course for all of that to come true we have to do a lot more than than recline in in our deck chairs in our backyards on the weekend we've got a tremendous amount of work to do to realize the promise of this moment but I think I'm also hopeful because I know we're going to do that work I've seen what with good people who care about this country are capable of in the last couple of years and and I know we're going to be up to the challenge of the next few months so with that over to you guys any issue you want to ask me about or or stories you want to share concerns you want to raise let me know and look forward to the discussion everyone should have something to drink I got the hour supposedly I have Ironbound North Hunterdon hard cider awesome great thank you chomping Lauren um so I just want to remind everyone to post their questions in the chat below so Tommy your first question is from Marian and Callen I'm just gonna unmute you Marian can you hear us Marian yeah can you hear me yep hey Tom I have two questions that are sort of interrelated um my sister's a schoolteacher and I have a friend that works in educational services and they're both as am I really concerned about whether or not they're gonna have jobs so part of the first question is what's the status of the federal funding going to the states and then the second half of it is I think that the PA ends the end of July and if I'm correct there was an extension in the heroes Act aside from it sitting on McConnell's desk what's going on with that so both of those things were in the heroes Act the state and local funding in my view is the most important part of the heroes Act because I just don't know how our our state our municipal governments how our County is going to get through this without some infusion of help from the federal government as you all know state and local governments have to balance their budgets they can't they can't print money so if tax revenues are down as we expect because of the economic shutdown only choices are to start laying people off or raise property taxes we don't like either of those options municipal governments have to by law they've got to make their contributions to our schools first through the county so you know if the revenues are down 10 15 percent they'll still make those contributions but then there's they'll be very little left for police fire Department of Public Works really basic things that our municipalities do not to mention the jobs that they support something like eleven twelve thirteen percent of the u.s. workforce works in the public sector so I think McConnell knows this there's been a lot of posturing and strutting around what he says will be the final package final coronavirus package but you know when he says it'll be the final coronavirus package that's addressed he's acknowledged that something has to pass that it is going to happen and we've said in the house state local is our number one priority so I can't imagine any negotiation that ordeal that does not leave something on the table for state and local governments anyway I'm gonna fight like hell to make sure we got that on the PA I think that's less likely to the extended it is in the Euro Zac that's the six hundred dollar boost per week that we added to unemployment insurance for this this period there is some concern that you know if you extend that indefinitely $600 a week is fairly generous and and it might create for some people a disincentive to go back to lower paying jobs because they may actually be making more from the 600-plus the base unemployment per week our solution to that many of us in the house have proposed a different kind of program that supports business payrolls directly through the the IRS that could that could replace the PUA that could replace the PPP the small business loan program and just be a very simple straightforward way to keep on supporting people while they remain attached to their employers so that would be my ideal solution but either way I think the P way we extended through January when the heroes Act I'm skeptical that we're going to be able to end up there so you know and again businesses are beginning to to reopen and for public sector employees that's you know I don't want them on unemployment let them working I want them paid by you know by the county by by the municipality by the state and that's where the state and local relief becomes super importance okay thanks thanks I'm your next question is from Jan risin Jan I just don't need you Jen can you hear us okay I think you already answered my question I wanted to know what the status is of the police reform bill and I guess you already answered it well not fully I I mean I did say that I was hopeful that we would be able to come up with something but you know in greater detail we've introduced a bill in the house I hope you've had a chance to read about it or to look at it it's very comprehensive I think but but still something that I that that can be the basis for a bipartisan compromise because most of the stuff we've proposed I think is extremely straightforward and sensible everything from banning racial profiling to grant programs for police departments to transition to new ways of policing to the banning abusive techniques like choke holds except when it's you know a fight to the death and and an officer has to protect some of his or her life we place significant limits on the militarization of police departments across the country the transfers of military equipment to state and local police one of the more controversial pieces this is where I think we're going to have some resistance from Senate Republicans and police unions you is the elimination of of this doctrine of qualified immunity which is something it's not a law it's something that courts have basically made it's it's a doctrine the courts have made over the years but basically makes it almost impossible to sue a government official including a police officer unless it's for an act that the courts have already defined as a civil rights or constitutional violation and the similarity to that the previous Act has to be almost perfect and that has led to some ridiculous situations where you know you there's a previous case that says if the police six an attack dog on a suspect who has surrendered by lying on the ground that's a violation and so you could sue a police officer today for doing that but if it's a suspect who surrenders by sitting down and putting their hands in the air you can't because there isn't a previous case where it's sitting the line right so there's it's one of its one of the bars to accountability in the weeds we absolutely want to encourage greater accountability for police sources in this bill this is you know I've been talking to our local police leadership here or have been actually very very constructive very open to most of what's in our bill this is what the piece that they are most opposed to because you know like walk in their shoes you can understand they don't want to you know be exposed to lawsuits for every possible that they may do that would be you know me channeling their their argued and so there's going to be some negotiation I think on that provision even if it drops out or if it goes forward in a more limited form very very important we really kind of invigorate the ability of the Justice Department to step in and conduct investigations and an an oversight of state and local police departments that that have patterns of abuse and neglect so I think it's an it's an extraordinary opportunity I actually my assessment is that on this issue unlike almost any other we may have a better opportunity to get serious legislation passed now than we would if we waited for the first couple of months of the body ministration just because there's so much else that's going to be on the table then so I want to get as much as I can get done there thank you Tom your next question is from Joyce and Steven Joyce they just unmuted you hi hey did you know we see some discussion about what the unemployment numbers actually looked like there was some numbers released by the government and then there's been some issues about what those numbers are actually meant and you know the two sides of this is one well it's just a bureaucratic error and the other one is well strangely strange it's a bureaucratic error in favor of Trump so what is your feelings about that I don't know it is very hard to measure you know to you know not give them a little bit of a benefit of the doubt it is actually very hard to measure unemployment or even to define it at a moment like this you know technically if somebody's sitting at home and not working but still getting their paycheck because we gave their business a PPP loan they can't as employed they're still getting paid by their business even though the business is shut down that's blended up there's nothing happening right so some of those definitional problems I think have have created the effect that you're referring to the truth is you know what Trump with the president touted was that the unemployment rate went down slightly in the last month and if you included more people as unemployed under a broader definition then the number of people unemployed still would have gone down in the last month just from a higher number to you know the two numbers would have been higher but but but there still would have been in that decline what I find just slightly ridiculous about this is that anybody any politician would be declaring victory because you know we've gone from an extreme depression to a mild depression over the most ridiculous we're in the middle of a historic he can own the crisis there are tens of millions of Americans out of work a lot of worries about whether businesses that shut down temporarily during the lock downs are all going to be able to reopen nobody should be gloating nobody should be saying success we should be happy that that social distancing in states like ours worked well enough that we can begin the long hard road to recovery but that's not mission accomplished some of the numbers I've looked at was we have need something like eight months of similar employment gains to get to back to get back the numbers back to where we were in in February which is a huge a huge ask I mean yes I know eight months of back-to-back record you know just show you how big the differences yeah so you know that that also raises the question of whether we're going to be able to pass a stimulus bill and now I'm using my terms very precisely because we haven't passed a single stimulus bill yet we called them we've used that word but the cares act the heroes Act are not about economic stimulus they're about helping people to survive a you know this coma that we have induced in the economy particularly when we passed the care sack we didn't want to stimulate we wanted we wanted to shut down the economy we wanted people to not be working for the most part and we needed to pay them so that they survived that period at some point I strongly believe that we've got to do something that's really nice and the best candidate for that everybody seems to agree van president Trump theoretically is an infrastructure bowl and that would be great commuters create tons of jobs here and and even if you know your job is not directly related to infrastructure we're all connected and if we get a lot of people working building and fixing things in in our state it's going to benefit every part of our economy so that's that's what you know that's the other priority the state and local aid is number one for me most urgent but try to get it infrastructure go though which is possible thank you Tom your next question is from Alana Berman Alana I just unmuted you thank you Tom I just want to say what a big fan I am and how great it is that we're doing these virtual happy hours everybody I was wondering what is going on in the federal level to help protect American citizens from cyber terrorism and foreign hacks I think that's been a concern for a while and as you know the world economy is an American economy continues to be frozen or in a coma as you as you put it because of the pandemic I'm really worried that I think there will be an increase in foreign cybercrime and Americans can't afford that ever well there you go ray saying something that is important and not just urgent you know we've been so focused the last few months on winning the day and surviving until next week it's been harder to think about some of the longer-term threats and challenges that our country faces and that's certainly one of them you mentioned that we're more vulnerable now you know there there has been some fraud related to coronavirus programs from foreign hackers who managed to get into the unemployment systems of some of our states I don't think this has happened to you Jersey but it has happened elsewhere to basically siphon off the the new unemployment benefits that we very rapidly created we have a lot of decrepit systems across the country that are vulnerable you prioritize things like the electrical grid and nuclear plants for obvious reasons but that still leaves a tremendous part of a segment of the American economy vulnerable and it requires investment when we talk about infrastructure we're not just talking about roads and bridges and railway tunnels although we're certainly talking about those things too we're also talking about hardening and protecting our critical infrastructure from from cyberattack and I think that's got to be part of any larger investment we make if we do in fact as I hope choose to make some large long-term investments over the next over the next year we can get into a lot of other aspects of this you know I'm interested in foreign policy and national security I think it's really really important that we that we are we're vigilant about not allowing for example China state companies to take over or manage big parts of our critical infrastructure like for example the 5g Network I don't like to be paranoid and I think we have to be careful about some of the anti-china paranoia that's spreading or being spread across our country but this is a sensible concern a reasonable concern that companies that are basically subsidiaries of the Chinese government managing our communications network is not a good idea so that's something else that we're working on Tom your next question is from Michael gsella Michael I just unmuted you ok so my question is obviously I know everybody's hoping for a vaccine in the short term however if you have another large second wave where this continues for a long time at this are we going to have a more coordinated effort on the federal level or the states for sufficient PPE and testing and everything like that because when this all started that obviously seemed to be concerned well it's still a big concern you know for some time I was calling and many of my fellow members of Congress were urging begging pleading that the president take the lead on behalf of the federal government to create a national nationally managed supply chain for a critical medical equipment including PPE he has the authority to do that under the defense production Act it would have been I think the most sensible way to manage this problem and he just refused to do it didn't want the responsibility and I've quit bleeding because I just you know he's not going to do it so the system we have right now basically is one in which Congress provides a lot of resources hopefully more if we pass something like the heroes Act there's a lot more in there for for our public health system and the states basically manage the distribution of those supplies and and the rules around testing and contact tracing that need to be put in place as we reopen the economy I've you know I've been very focused on our progress on testing in New Jersey both trying to help the state get the resources it needs from the federal government but also pushing our governor pushing our state authorities to prioritize it more we're definitely doing better than we were say a month ago it's now easier to get a test if you need it we still don't have the contact tracing system up that that we'll be in you know that we need that now to encourage people to get a test who may not know that they need to write we don't have as many symptomatic people right now who know okay my gosh I have a fever I need to get tested so what we now need is a system that tells you you may be feeling fine but you know yesterday you spent more than 10 minutes with somebody who tested positive and you leave sure there's a precaution get that test we don't have that yet that's got to be the next step when we have that I think you'll find there are a lot more places you can get a test pharmacy CVS and Rite Aid and and so forth Walmart's community health clinics and a lot more places than just the drive-through testing facilities that we started with and so that's good news for the longer term I've got a bill that was incorporated in the heroes Act and which I think will we'll manage to pass this year one way or another to fix the national stockpile for PPE for future public health emergencies when we didn't have enough and that wasn't just the Trump administration's fault that was a long-standing problem so I've got a bill that basically requires the stock file to be adequately stockpiled for a major global pandemic and so either get that through in the heroes Act or some spending bill down the road that's one of my goals for the year Tom your next question is from Jen Robinson Jen I just needed you Thank You Johnny Dumon is that your is that your backyard behind you yes it is not it's not a fake zoom background this is where I get to this is my office actually since March so unfortunately a friend of mine lost her husband very suddenly and when she asked in here in Hunterdon County and when she asked the coroner to test him or Co bid and and this is sort of follow-up to what you were just talking about he replied he didn't have symptoms shouldn't we be testing anybody who dies of unknown unknown causes automatically it's an interesting question you know what I think I saw Cindy barters on the call Cindy are you there yeah let me zoom you I'm wondering if you have thoughts on this I don't I just didn't know yeah yes I am here and I'm a physician and absolutely I think we should be testing and I'm not sure why that response was given I do know that we still have a lack of adequate number of tests so when we've been sure there's been situations where we've wanted to test people and we were told no because we only had like five more swabs so we needed to save it for somebody that was severely ace are severely symptomatic so whether it's because there wasn't enough tests to be able to do it and at one point the guidance and the guidance are have been continually changing but at one point the guidance was we were only testing people that were symptomatic I don't know how long ago this person passed away weeks just okay if this is a county function or or is there or would this be controlled by the state determining whether that's that's a good question I don't know I know a lot of the guidance comes from the CDC to the state to the local that then you know is given to us and some of it depends on locally like how many you know vials do we have and how many tubes you know how many swabs do we have - how many tests can we perform so it's a combination of what the direction is as well as what resources do we have but I'm I especially just being a couple weeks ago I am very surprised that the responses to this test yeah it left her and her family and in you know sort of a strange place where they have I mean I don't know if they've gotten a report yet but on a cause of death but it leaves them in a place with it that is very uncomfortable for them of course we need to know we need to know for any number of reasons for sure if such a person had been kovat cause that if you need to know because you might have exposed others and and ii just from the state's public health management perspective we need accurate statistics and we all know that the the the total number of cases in new jersey is higher then the total number of positive tests that we've had and you know the governor and all our state public health officials would acknowledge that we assume that the total numbers higher because not everyone has been tested and some people have tragically passed away without being tested and so I know there has been crossed rumors testing in part for those reasons so I am I am very surprised that's that's worth looking into to see like what what is the County Health Department's policy was this in a hundred in County yes it was okay and the question is to is when the question was asked we had a woman that lost her baby at 38 weeks pregnant but by the time we asked the question can we test the placenta and the baby it was already too late to be able to process that so you know she did ask immediately yeah so again I think it should have been done I mean we're at a point where anybody you know if you live in Union County you don't even need a doctor's prescription or be symptomatic you just go to the drive-thru and they'll test you at the CBS you you need some reason you fill out a questionnaire obviously if you have a prescription you will be tested if you've been tagged so to speak by contact tracer you can be tested if you had any of the symptoms and you just self-report you can be tested so it's a fairly black standard there so again I'm surprised in that case so yeah we can look into that and see what the what the guidance is because I presume somebody was following some guidance there thank you okay and since we have Cindy unmuted I'm gonna go to Sydney for a question I'm gonna steal the mic thing it was actually mine that's I'm Bob Cindy's husband your other half not the better half so Tom my question is you know what action is Congress taking well my guess is in November there's gonna be a lot of mail-in ballots it takes a lot of time to process these ballots as we've seen through some of the primaries my guess is uncertainty is going to cause a lot of mischief potentially in the election and then every state will be litigated its results as they come in so what what steps is Congress taking to try to be able to enable States and local municipalities to handle this influx of mail-in ballots so that that way we can have a speedy resolution to the election it's a very very real worry you know in my more pessimistic moments I fear we're gonna have a third-world election in the United States with all kinds of localized chaos and accusations of fraud on every single side which I think would serve you know whose interests very very well and we're just not accustomed to that in America we're accustomed to fighting and screaming and yelling and arguing and but when the ballots are counted it's done and one side is upset is sad but you know you know you've lost and we're just not we really really don't want to live in the country where we don't have that certainty that would be terrible what Congress is doing well the House of Representatives is doing o'clock we have you know we tried in the cares Act and then once again in the heroes Act we have an election security a whole set of election security provisions that both provide money to States to prepare for what will likely be a very heavy increase in mail voting and a mandate that states have to allow people the option to both early from home and to do it in the way New Jersey has done it in this primary were about to have where the state just mails everybody a ballot they said incredibly simple so where are we there is some agreement that we should provide money and we already did in the cares act will probably provide more but there's been extreme resistance from Senator McConnell and from president rumpus I think you know any sort of mandate they they dismiss it as quote federalizing our elections which are supposed to be run traditionally in the United States by the states but it is a federal election so the federal government the nation has an incredibly important stake in making sure that this is a credible election whatever the outcome that we all trust it and I'm I'm afraid that a lot of this battle is gonna have to be waged state by state by state rather than counting on a comprehensive solution from Congress because I just don't see McConnell and from bending on this I the Trump I mean he's sometimes extremely honest you know he'll tell you exactly why he does what he does and he's been very candid in saying that if to quote too many people vote it'll be bad for him so there you go Tom your next question is from Karen Rankin Karen I just unmuted you Robert poaching's Robert I just Sunita you Robert can you hear us yeah now I can go ahead I had a few questions I'm I was going to ask you about the POA but you kind of pretty much went over it but I do want to add a little comment to that yes if we have a roughly 80% of the population is not going to get sick or die from this or they will get sick but once I are there a cinematic or whatever the 20% that will weather they'd be elderly or or younger and can get it I'm more focusing on the elderly population those over fifty years old I'm concerned that if I go back out into the workforce that I'm going to be possibly I'm going to have an issue where if no matter how safe or how cautious I am that I'm going to get sick from this virus and pass away and I don't want to do that to my wife and I don't want my wife to have that to happen to her she's currently trying to find work at home jobs but it's really difficult you know I said we're both home because of the corona virus and I don't want to get sick and so is there any way we can address in with legislation some sort of legislation that would be more focused towards those with health conditions and those with elderly that are older that have a greater chance of being injured by this virus and I think that yeah that's an excellent question and you know we have not done that honestly we've the two big bills we've done the cares act and heroes Act we target everybody and I think that made sense in March April etc but I think as we go into this new period when we're gradually reopening the economy businesses will be tentatively opening their doors a lot of people are going to be really eager to go back to do normal things but at the same time some of us may not be for very very sound reasons and we don't want a situation in which the rules of the game discriminates against somebody who feels like they're more vulnerable and therefore is going to be much more cautious so let me let me take that back and think about it it's certainly an argument for extending the duration of a lot of the programs that we created in the cares Act which we do try to do in the heroes Act recognizing that many fewer people are gonna take advantage of so it'll cost less but that they should be there for for that purpose thank you all right Tom your next question is from Kira Lauren can you just wait one one quick second yes okay sorry all right yeah so we've got we've got a couple things we're doing for the primary GOTV phone banks and text banks cat owners post the links in in the chat there so folks can sign up Tuesdays and Thursday nights 5 to 8 p.m. we've got phone banks and Saturdays and Sundays in the morning from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. we've got phone makes as well and then every Wednesday from 5 to 8 p.m. we've got text banks to chase ballots across the district and in hundred and county because ballots are out to leave for Tom you can also count Taylor for people yeah so miscible chair democratic committee I'm happy to build a stock I'm back bank for you guys alright Tom Beck so Carol Lawrence I'm gonna go to you Kara you're on hi Tom how are you hey so I'm pleased that bill barter asked my question about to be concerned about how concerned are we about the the November election and the answer is quite concerned and so I mean I guess we're you and I are on the same boat about that nervous about November but that gives me the opportunity to ask another thing that I'm also deeply worried about which is this you know in the three-and-a-half years we've had Trump he is basically just floated every norm in our governing system and it is deeply distressing to watch and not really in some cases have any ability to rebut the efforts he has undertaken to flout those norms and I guess the most recent recent of which which i think is deeply distressing is you know his sense that he can use the military to you know clear bull from the the Lafayette Square or while they're exercising their First Amendment rights and I guess I am heartened by some of the outcry from you know military leaders former military leaders and they kind of maiya coppa from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff but I guess my my question the essence of it is I I hope that we're kind of keeping track of all these norms that someone like Trump has floated and thinking about how in the next Congress we are going to be thoughtful about how we codify some of the expectations that we have had for our leaders in a way that there will not be this continual erosion of our democracy that we have been witnessing so I'm hoping you can kind of speak to that yeah it's a long list and and I actually hope someone is keeping a list I trust somebody is keeping the list I know that I forget a lot you know like there's so much to be angry about this week but I don't remember everything I was angry about six months ago or a year and a half ago and that's part of his technique you know he just as you're getting ready to correct some outrageous violation of decency the rule of law you know something else happens and you move on to the next one so a lot a lot of work is going to be done you know on this on this particular issue I've been looking at the insurrection Act which is the law that does technically allow presidents to call up the military for domestic purposes other vague laws that Attorney General Barr has cited to justify the use of the National Guard in the putting down of a peaceful protest in front of the White House we will we will take a look at all that and I'd like that work to start in this Congress even if it may not be finished until the next one but you know again on the more optimistic side I would argue that the norm against politicizing the military is stronger today than it was three weeks ago because we've had this teaching moment for Americans and our military leadership the uniformed leadership responded very well in in total you know general Milley walking across the street and his fatigues was not a good response but but his apology the thing the Trump never does right because when you apologize you reinforce the norm you acknowledge that yes that is a rule I should not have violated it the apology reinforces the more and this is being you know discussed privately throughout our military retired military it disturbed a lot of people including folks who may not have been quite as riled up by Trump in the past as some of us on this call may have been so we we dodged a bullet and and perhaps are stronger for it yeah I appreciate kind of I guess just - I appreciate the military's response right it did sort of does reinforce that there are people who are in charge of our country who still respect our democracy and sort of the fundamental tenets of it but I I guess I worry that if we are not very deliberate about how we think about creating regulations or rules or restrictions about you know how long can someone serve in an interim capacity as a member of the cabinet or something like that right just to name another example that that you know Trump is already used as wrecking ball it's more of Trump or someone else of Trump's ilk would would really be an epic disaster and maybe this is a wake-up moment for us to be doing that and sounds like that work is underway but I I guess I think they really deliberate about it matters yeah it no I don't like there is not some Court Select Committee that is meeting to hear to plan the first month of norm restoring legislation for we're just so busy but but there are I know there are very smart legal scholars so it became to network and we just have to get ourselves to a place where it becomes viable right that's the most important if we win this election and by we you know I don't just mean that in the partisan way I mean good people who want to restore respect for the rule of law many of whom are Republicans if if we win November December and January are going to be very very busy months as we prepare the first kind of days agenda for both Abidin administration and the new Congress that's elected and you know well we'll have time to to remember who is naughty and nice and to check the list and and come up with what needs to be done and some of this you know I were doing the national defense bill like now I would at least like to make a go at some of this in that bill there will be a provision for example on renaming military bases we're gonna do that now so thank you who'd have thought Tom your next question is from Liz colas you know was I just unmuted you girls thank you Tom for spending this nice afternoon with us and I'm Joe policy no on Elizabeth's computer Hado and and I guess following up by curious norms what she spoke so eloquently about there's a some serious speculation that should Biden win the election Trump won't go peacefully and even James Carville one of his interviews and he said he spoke to some of his friends in the military at a high level that they would march into the White House and bodily remove him should that happen so my question is what can we do constitutionally to ensure a peaceful transfer of power because that norm is the bedrock of our democracy so whoever wins the election whoever certified as the winner of the election so let's knock on wood assume that there will be a winner that person becomes president of the United States on January 21st 2021 why because that's what the Constitution says it does not matter whether that person is sitting in the White House that person is president of the United States on that day and from that day the entire US government everybody who swears an oath to uphold the Constitution including our military and the Justice Department the FBI the Secret Service everybody else is working for that person and I absolutely confident that the government and the people working within it will uphold their oath and if they're and you know if that person is not Donald Trump and Donald Trump handcuffs himself to a bedpost in the Lincoln Bedroom that is a logistical problem that's not a constitutional problem we'll take care of that hopefully gently so here's what worries me more it worries me more is not that somehow he can cling to the presidency but that he will try to mobilize his most and supporters to cling to him and to challenge the legitimacy of the electors and but you know November and December could very well be very dangerous months for the country he's in that scenario there could be violence there could be things we don't want to see in America and you know remember when we had those protestors descending on state capitals heavily armed with ar-15s and and other fairly scary weapons that could happen again it could happen on a larger scale if the President of the United States is actively encouraging it so you know if that happens we're going to need to take some of the actions that are sometimes necessary to reinforce respect for law and you know that's why as angry as I am about the response to some of these demonstrations over the last couple of weeks but I don't want them you know the military involved and weren't the National Guard used only when absolutely necessary to control real violence we do need to remember we still need the capacity in this country to respond to violence and when it arises and when they need to use that capacity if if the worst happens also the elections thank you Tom I think Sydney barter is a common see I just said yeah there's from Robert earlier the question was about returning to work particularly if you have some kind of pre-existing health condition that puts you at higher risk and I just want to reinforce masks make a difference in the hospital we had none of our ICU Doc's or nurses get Kovac we have only like 1% of our employees and most of those were folks that worked at another facility and I know I personally took care of patients that work Ovid positive both in the ER on the floor and not everybody needs to wear an n95 but wearing masks makes a difference so if you do need to go back to work if you know Congress can't through the Senate get something passed to give relief for folks in and it's a matter of getting food on the table or not masks make a difference so thanks for letting me say that Thank you Thank You Cindy you're absolutely right I should have mentioned that it may not be enough reassurance for everybody so I still think it's a very legitimate question that we need to think about but but yes and that goes for everybody like you know where things are opening up in New Jersey let's not get complacent we still have I think 400 something new cases yesterday in the state of New Jersey we haven't beaten this it's just we've beaten it down but we haven't beaten it and it absolutely could come back really really badly in the hall if we lose that vigilance that got us to this point and the most important thing is just sensible precautions masks and distancing reasonable distancing were possible don't let anybody around you forget those things for the next few months thanks Andy and thanks Tom you ready to wrap up it's been an hour well thank you everybody as always thank goodness that we we have zoomed over one of my projects is I've been beating up on zoom for being a little too chummy with the Chinese government recently and I need them to fix those problems I don't want to have to boycott zoom because I love this platform but anyway it's great to see you guys and good to see everybody is is healthy and I hope I've convinced you that despite all the fears that we have which you rightly expressed in your questions we really do have an opportunity to get this country to a better place not just better relative to where we are today but relative to some of our more ambitious hopes so with that can't wait till we can do this again and I hope everyone has a happy and safe rest of your weekend all right

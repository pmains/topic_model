Thank You mr. president I have to unanimous consent request the first won't draw objection the second I fear will my first is that the following five interns in my office be granted floor privileges for the remainder of the year of Madison Malan Chris Brown Britt Djokovic Devin Bradley and Ilana Van Nostrand without objection thank you very much mr. president as Senator Murray noted 100 people died from gunshot wounds every single day we can't go 24 hours without news of another mass shooting somewhere in America my kids and millions others hide in corners of their classroom or in their bathrooms preparing for a mass shooting at their school and this body does nothing about it the good news is we have a piece of legislation that enjoys 95 percent support in the American public and will undoubtedly make an enormous impact on gun violence rates in this country and so I will give more extensive remarks after I make this unanimous consent request but my request will be that the Senate immediately take up HR 8 the universal background checks bill that was passed in a bipartisan way through the House of Representatives and has received no action no debate here in the United States Senate since that time so mr. president as if in legislative session I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of calendar number 29 HR 8 further that the bill be considered read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate is there an objection mr. president senator from Mississippi mr. president reserving the right to object legislation that would affect the rights of American citizens under the Second Amendment should not be fast-tracked by the Senate efforts to criminalize otherwise lawful conduct conduct with firearms by law-abiding gun owners should not be exempt from consideration by the appropriate committee of jurisdiction it should not be exempt from debate on the Senate floor if this so-called common-sense bipartisan legislation was indeed crafted with strong bipartisan input it shouldn't have any problems advancing by regular order many questions about this legislation need to be answered before it's forced upon law-abiding gun owners if I wanted to give my best friend's son or grandson my hunting rifle would we first have to appear before a licensed gun dealer and go through a lengthy and potentially expensive background check this is my understanding we have many questions like this my constituents would like to have an opportunity to weigh in on our measures like these which is why we can't fast track legislation that affects America's Second Amendment rights I object to this unanimous consent requests mr. president and I yield the floor objections heard present is hearing from Matt Connecticut mr. president I appreciate the good-faith objection from my friend from Mississippi but the good news that I can convey to her is that my Republican Senate friends who want to have some impact into the consideration of the future of American gun laws have ample opportunity to do that because you're in the majority the Senate Republicans control digitus sherry committee Senator McConnell can decide to bring any measure to the floor and so if the concern is that there hasn't been enough Republican input into the question of whether criminals or terrorists or people who are seriously mentally ill get guns um then convene a discussion on this bring a debate to the floor have a process in the Judiciary Committee don't just stay silent it just doesn't it doesn't pass the straight-faced test to come down here and say well we can't take up HRA despite the fact that it has 90% public approval because we have in that input on it you're in the majority you have the ability to pass legislation that you support that Democrats can support as well and the idea that we're just going to sit here and twiddle our thumbs week after week as a hundred people are killed by guns through suicides and homicides and accidental shootings it's an abdication of our basic responsibility as United States senators there's nothing that matters more to our constituents than their physical safety and there are kids that are walking to school in cities in every single state in this body who fear for their lives whose brain chemistry has changed by the trauma that they go through because of that fear for their safety and they can't learn they can't cope and they can't build strong relationships my kids go through active shooter drills at school because they in fact expect that someday someone will walk through their doors and start firing a military-style assault weapon in one of their classrooms and I get it there's a difference of opinion on exactly how we should expand background checks I understand that maybe my Republican colleagues don't want to support HR 8 but you're in the majority you have the ability to lead a conversation that can find that common ground on expanding background checks so I'm just not going to accept this argument that we can't bring a cherry to the floor because we've got some concerns about it I can't get a piece of legislation on the floor in any other way other than to offer this motion and the American public are not going to accept silence from this body week after week month after month in the face of this epidemic carnage that is happening across this country parents know that their kids aren't safe they know that their kids aren't safe and they expect us to act the president the president's Attorney General said the other day that we made some progress on the issue of background checks over the summer but now we've got the impeachment proceedings and so that's stopped all this discussion that's that's not true the impeachment proceedings right now we're in the House of Representatives the discussion on the future of a background checks bill was in the Senate it was happening between myself and Senator Manchin and senator Toomey we are still at the table ready to negotiate a compromise version of a background checks expansion act and we frankly got lots of time on our hands here in the Senate because we're not doing anything other than approving a appointee here a judge there we got plenty of time we got plenty of bandwidth here in the Senate to negotiate with the White House over a universal background checks bill and so you can't say that we can't take up HR 8 because we haven't had input Republicans are in charge you have the ability to have as much input as you want the White House can't say that impeachment is stopping a debate on background checks from happening I'm ready to talk senator Toomey is ready to talk to Senator Manchin is ready to talk and we have evidence just from this summer about how important universal background checks are and the last day of August a gunman fled from police in Odessa Texas he hijacked a United States Postal Service van he killed its driver and then randomly fired on people as he drove through the streets during his shooting spree the gunman killed seven people and wounded over 20 others a reign of terror throughout the streets of this Texas town now the current background checks law worked as it was intended to work the shooter tried to buy a gun in January 2014 but he was denied why because he had been found to be so seriously mentally ill when he was committed to an inpatient institution that his name was placed on the list of individuals who were prohibited from buying weapons the problem is Texas doesn't have universal background checks meaning that it was as easy as pie for the shooter after he got denied a gun purchase at a bricks and mortar store to just go find a private seller who would sell him a military style weapon without a background check and in this case it resulted in 20 people getting hurt and seven people being wounded this easy way to find loopholes through the nation's background check system but that happens every single day every single day somebody buys a gun at a gun show or online or through a private sale because that's the way they can get a gun without having to go through a background check and so I am deeply deeply troubled I'm profoundly profoundly aggrieved by the my body's reluctance to even take up a conversation about the future of gun policy in this country I wish there wasn't an objection I wish that we had an opportunity to be able to discuss the future of background checks the future of our gun laws on the Senate floor our constituents expect us to have that debate and this won't be the last time that we come down to the floor to try to force a debate to force a conversation in this body so that we can find bipartisan consensus on an issue that enjoys 95% public support 80% support from gun owners 70 percent support from NRA members there's almost nothing else that is less controversial in America today than the issue of universal background checks and we will continue to press that case on behalf of the American people I yield the floor

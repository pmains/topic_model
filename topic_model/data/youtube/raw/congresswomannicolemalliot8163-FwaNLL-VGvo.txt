report from a group of house republicans exposes a quote what they refer to as cozy relationship with the teachers union listen we needed to get our schools open we in that context engage as we often do with organizations and groups that are impacted by our guidance and our recommendations at the agency look how nervous she is again according to the lawmakers report the cdc allowed the unions to make line by line edits to school reopening guidance congresswoman nicole malliotakis and marionette miller meeks they sit on the committee that released this report and they join us now good morning ladies good morning good morning congresswoman maliotakas what did you find well we're finding is that the biden administration is continuing to erode the public's trust in this case they're allowing the tail to wag the dog and verbatim verbatim if you compare what the union recommended for the guidance and what the cdc ultimately used it is literally plagiarism this is not an issue of following the science this is an issue of following the influence and the money of the largest union in the country 43 million dollars donated to president biden and democrats and liberal groups throughout the country and they have this amount of influence where the cdc is supposed to use medical science to determine their guidance and recommendations to the american public and this is exactly why the people in this country do not trust this administration or the cdc with the mandates and the recommendations that have come out sure congresswoman meeks you know what she just said essentially validates the fact that uh the administration uh was bowing to their large one of their largest donors and they had the donors actually writing the law and ultimately they didn't the teachers didn't want to have to go back to school and the administration helped them out well i can tell you as a physician and a former director the department of public health that it's not unusual to get bring people together and to convene individuals as you develop policy but to have emails prior to the release of this document prior to the release of the guidance as representative maliataka said that are almost verbatim as a physician if i did this in in a a medical review article i would have to disclose financial disclosure and conflicts of interest at least they should have footnoted the teachers union right too bad anthony fauci uh didn't step in and realize how wrong that was and step up and try to embarrass the administration like you did the previous one cdc uh said this to fox cdc has traditionally engaged with organizations and groups that are impacted by guidance and recommendations issued by the agency the strength of this guidance resulted in 99 of schools being open and children being in the enriching environment of a classroom during the delta surge in the fall of 2021. okay that explains it those kids stayed out of school with the faulty information between six feet apart which prevented them from going at three feet apart and then the teachers were too scared to go to school for a while little did we know remember congresswoman when one was in actually on vacation on the islands while she was doing her remote teaching so this is this is a train wreck but we kind of knew about this already didn't we well remember that billions of dollars went to the schools in order to prepare them we put teachers at the top of the line for vaccinations so we could get kids back in school and iowa was a great example did they contact the department of education or governor reynolds in iowa because we we reopened schools in august of 2020 so they could have gotten information from iowa about how safe it was to open schools because we didn't have incidents we didn't have super spreader events but they didn't contact iowa this was you know a teachers union who as you said the unions gave 43 millions to the democrats to biden to their causes and then you have a document that is almost verbatim with what the teachers unions wanted to do so that schools would not reopen and it did immeasurable harm to our children both in learning their mental health their anxiety and even suicide as young as nine years of age congresswoman malliotakis the bottom line is we trust the cdc it's the centers for disease control we look to them for our health and to find out how we're supposed to react to certain diseases and illnesses and things like this so for them to listen to the teachers union and not the doctors and not the science what else are they telling us that's false information and i my concern is that's what the american people are concerned about look the reality is they're following the political science not the medical science and if they want to you know have the american people trust in their advice and their guidance and their recommendation and their ultimately their mandates then we must make sure that this organization is run by somebody who's not going to be influenced by political outsiders and so here in new york city uh we're the opposite unfortunately of iowa and and you know our children suffered greatly over the course of the last two years because mayor de blasio is also somebody who is influenced by political outsiders by those who contributed to his campaign instead of the medical science i think the president needs to reevaluate who's running his agencies across the board because they've eroded the public trust whether it's the border whether it's the cdc uh whether it's those who oversaw the botched withdrawal of afghanistan sure and yesterday last night the administration fired dr oz who sat on an advising award uh because he he was the problem yeah and hershel walker fired anyway um congresswoman thank you very much for joining us live thanks ladies all right meanwhile critics are saying joe biden's defense budget increases aren't even close to what the military needs right

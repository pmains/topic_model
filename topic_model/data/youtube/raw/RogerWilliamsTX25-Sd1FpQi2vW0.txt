Thank You mr. chairman and thank you chair white for being here today I'm a small business owner live in Texas now last year you testified that the markets are not rigged in July of 2014 a staff member from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago issued a research paper titled recommendations for equitable allocation of trades and high frequency trading environments now first question are you aware of this paper I do recall the paper it's a year ago right approximately government a second question does the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago have any regulatory responsibility for the conduct of equity markets not to my knowledge did you ask chair Yellen or the president the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago to write this paper no and has the staff the division of trading and markets analyzed the papers nine recommendations and does the division have concerns of any of the recommendations the answer to that is certainly to a degree the staff analyzed it because I asked the staff about it and they had a you know a number of you know comments about it I can't give you the details I sit here right now but certainly they have analyzed it have any concerns about the study are about that well with some of the recommendations you know I i mean i think they sir that is yes but i have to get back in and look at what that is so i could be more specific for you they'd like I think we'd like to hear what they are happy to do it all right just last year a second question just last year you stated that the SEC was a duty to Congress the staff and the American people to use the funds we appropriated proof that we have to be prudent and efficient now do you believe the SEC has responsibility to demonstrate that it is good steward of its current resources before it asks for additional funding and I'm always amazed as a private sector guy how we just have unlimited money up here that the unlimited line of credit just drawing the people's money till it dies so with that before you answer that I will note where I come from in Texas my constituents are not overly concerned about the rules for instance that we've talked about earlier that deal with the CEO pay ratios which the SEC spent over 7,000 staff and 1.1 million dollars and labor costs for rule that we don't even have implemented yet I think I can see in response to that and alluded to earlier I think as well is that is a congressional mandate as are many of our other rulemakings that I do feel an obligation to carry out and carry out in the most cost effective way given the statutory requirements clearly there are costs and workability concerns and that rulemaking that you know require a lot of staff time in order to achieve that objective so I mean I think that's I think the explanation it is the explanation for the resources that have been applied to that it's a congressional mandate and we want to carry it out because it's our obligation to but do it in the most cost-effective way we possibly can next question earlier this year JPMorgan Chase indicated it would cut back on its fixed income trading desk because the regulatory requirements and capital costs following the lead of over what other investment firms are doing are you concerned about these new regulations that they are reducing liquidity in the US fixed income market I mean I have a concern about all impacts including those that are being occasioned by regulation regulations are killing small business I would just tell you that they are choking it to death one more question last week the SEC lost a case that it ran through its administrative hearing process the administrative law judge called the SCC's claim wildly exaggerated will the SEC enforcement staff who did this who received bonuses for bringing that case will they have to pay them back you know because I would I've listened to your testimony today that you're short of funds to get the job done they paid that back that it helped your cash flow wouldn't i guess i have to say at the outset that that case may come to me on appeal so i can't really talk about the specifics of it we're also limited by various you know civil service rules and other things in terms of you know what we might be able to do in that space were we to take a decision to do that but I'm not commenting on the merits or demerits of that situation right now it's been deemed wildly exaggerated I heard I heard that mr. Chairman I you back

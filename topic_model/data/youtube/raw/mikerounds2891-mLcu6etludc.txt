senator mike rounds of right now the south dakota republican senator his his view of where things stand the administration still is clinging to this notion that much of the inflation we're seeing is ukraine born in other words the the russian attack on ukraine and then the build-up ever since now we we know that a lot of this was happening well before the war be that as it may he he now is going after the oil companies specifically to say why don't you share the loot that you're making and i'm just wondering um what you make of all of that because it's actually getting more hostile and i'm just wondering uh how republicans are responding well neil i had the opportunity to read the letter that the president sent the oil companies it reminded me kind of of an excuse like the dog ate my homework it's somebody else's fault i got stuck behind a train what he's basically saying is it's everybody's fault but my own the reality is is that this inflationary trend started when he became president a lot of it has to do with the policies that he started with and that he still continues you can't tell the oil industry number one don't get any investors because i'm not going to let you survive you can't tell the oil industry we're not going to let you pipe your your supply back out to where it's needed you can't tell the oil industry that number one we're not going to let you get any of the new the new exploration locations and expect that investors are going to invest in in production and right now what we've got is the president now saying he's going to go visit with our our competitors overseas to have them increase their oil production now in this particular case inflation a lot of it has to do with the price of energy and the supply side of things the the federal reserve they can handle the demand side they can slow down demand by making money more expensive but what i'm afraid of is is that this administration is going to blame the federal reserve for inflation when they really can't take care of all of the different uh parts of what's causing the inflation today the president needs to modify his policies with regards to energy production well the president wouldn't be the first president to be angry at the federal reserve i remember you know uh president trump had the same sort of chilling relationship but that notwithstanding i'm just curious where you see this going because it's some economists are right and and that could be a stretch but they're saying that we maintain this high inflation rate uh and even higher for four months the federal reserve sees that senator it's going to keep hiking rates way beyond what people are thinking and therein brings you a recession are you worried about that i am worried about that and in fact we've got the chairman of the federal reserve in front of our banking committee this coming week and that's one of the questions i'm going to be asking him is do you realize that you can do more damage than good if you continue to raise the the fed rate at a substantial amount trying to fix all of the inflationary trends i do believe they can fix part of it i do not believe they can fix it all in south dakota right now south dakotans since the time that this president took office well they're paying about about 682 dollars more per month per household than what they were when he before he was president that amounts to almost eight thousand dollars more per year and that's just because of the inflationary trends that we're seeing right now this president is responsible for these policies the vast majority of which he could address you want an energy policy which is all of the above we've got to become energy independent again that will impact the supply lines i think that's a major step that he's simply looking the other way saying it's somebody else's fault the dog ate my homework all right you know i wonder if anyone did actually have the dog eat their homework you know they're like what this guy actually that's a whole nother discussion senator very good seeing you thank you very much for that i don't

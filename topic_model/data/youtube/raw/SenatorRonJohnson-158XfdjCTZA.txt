we have a lot of individuals in the joseph project that have have faced many difficulties and challenges but the really awesome thing is they come into this program really broken we're not communicating but by the end of the program we give them hope encouragement and they can't see a future of success they had faith in me and it felt really really good because when i was out there on the streets i lost my identity you know i used to be a carpenter and at that point i was nothing so i have to ask who kind of just wants a job raise your hand now who really needs and wants a job raise your hand okay so this is the thing about the joseph project it's you genuinely wanting a job i can't force you to want this job the reality of life is that nothing is handed to us and so in anything in life you have to want it you have to work hard for it a lot of these individuals they have experienced so much negativity setbacks in life and they just need somebody that is going to mentor them and coach them through this process i'm glad that they're second chances because like for me i need one real bad i messed my life up pretty bad and i'm not getting any younger we are able to help people who are downtrodden these are individuals that are currently going through different challenges in their life and i used to be that person being a hmong refugee growing up in america here i understand poverty i understand what it means to struggle but through hard work and god's blessing i'm better off today and so i want to pay it forward two and a half years ago i was living in a tent homeless didn't have a job and since the joystick project i've been employed full time for two and a half years i have my own apartment i've only missed three days and i take extreme pride in that i can't force you to want to show up this entire week and want to get this job you have to be genuine from the get-go and say i am willing to do whatever it takes for me to be able to get this job the joseph project it's week-long and so we have several different classes in the evening we have classes on time management conflict resolution some spirituality classes but we also believe that it's really important to be able to make the students of our project feel good and because of that we take them to the career closet to get close if they need a haircut we provide them that and i think what also makes our program really special is that every evening when they come into our program we provide a free meal for them it is definitely a wrap around support of any way that we can to help these individuals find success it's going to change my life for the good because it's going to give me a stable income and it's going to help me do good in life i'll be able to get my kids back because i'll have steady employment i won't be selling drugs like i once was depending on that like i'll have a dependable paycheck i'll be able to have stable living like just have my life back joseph project never gives up on you if i could be that person to give them hope and encouragement i just feel like that's the reason why god has created me is to be able to give hope to these individuals oh

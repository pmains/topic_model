hello everyone it is national clean energy week and today i'm going to tell you about the cleanest the most reliable and most environmentally sound energy source known to man you might think it is the sun which is correct but down here we call it nuclear power the sun is basically a giant nuclear fusion reactor the sun utilizes nuclear fusion radioactive decay and particle annihilation very similar to how we generate nuclear energy on earth near my district just outside of buckeye arizona is our nation's largest nuclear power generating station the palo verde plant its average electric power production is about 3.3 gigawatts and it serves 4 million people nuclear power is the safest form of energy production it has the least environmental impact and is the most reliable every town in america should have nuclear power water is needed to cool the palo verde reactors and this plant uses the treated sewage water from phoenix and other nearby cities for that cooling that's the strafe poop this is congressman paul gosar and i thought you should know that as we celebrate national clean energy week look up at the sun and say yes to nuclear power [Music]

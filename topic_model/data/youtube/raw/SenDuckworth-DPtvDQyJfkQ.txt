Thank You mr. chairman I have no comments in this cheese I want to start by thanking the FCC for its work to address predator a prison phone rates each of you has publicly stated in your support your support for clarifying FCC's legal authority to end the gouging of vulnerable families to keep things simple if any of you no longer supports these efforts please raise your hand great for the record no one raised their hand chairman PI yes or no if your intrest state authority is clarified will you reaffirm your commitment to exercising it expeditiously yes thank you that's good because yesterday senator Schatz Marky Portman Booker and king joined me interested in introducing the bipartisan Martha Wright read just and reasonable communications act our targeted bipartisan legislation would permit the FCC to use its traditional procedures and authorities to end unjust and unreasonable rates thereby keeping families together and enhancing community safety by reducing recidivism the bill is actually named in honor of Martha right Reed who for years struggled to keep in touch with her grandson while he was in prison ice is often the case her grandson was moved repeatedly while incarcerated from Virginia to O'Hara to Ohio to Arizona to Kentucky to Pennsylvania and this made it impossible for her to make in-person visits as his common phone calls quickly became the primary method for their family to keep in touch her fight for affordable phone rates lasted more than 20 years but led to the FCC's interim rules implemented by former Commissioner Clyburn who supports my legislation and today a mrs. Wright's grandson you Landis Forte's with us in the audience we have you had mr. forte I want to thank you for your family's dedication to this very important issue mr. chairman mr. forte recently wrote about his family's experiences and the importance of addressing this issue and I request unanimous consent that his op-ed be entered into the record thank you sir I should have said a committee chairman my partisan legislation enjoys the support of nearly 100 civil rights groups technology organizations phone companies forcement entities and experts yet some who want to protect their golden goose argue that eliminating predatory phone rates and fees will impact public safety commissioner rosen more so there is nothing there's nothing in my bill that prevents a law enforcement from receiving fair compensation for the cost of offering and managing inmate communications instead my bipartisan bill clarifies that inmates and their families should receive just and reasonable charges drawing on section 202 of the Communications Act and these are not radical ideas would you agree with this assessment I would totally agree with that assessment thank you the simple fact is that our prison phone system suffers from a market failure families are paid forced to pay outrageous charges because locational monopolies are protected from marketplace competition even as new technologies lower cost for providers again Commissioner rosenworcel today's inmate communications providers use advanced technologies to cut their costs while maintaining the highest levels of security do you agree that my legislation makes clear that the obligations of fairness and just and reasonable rates apply to all inmate communications regardless of technology used yes it does thank you achieving just and reasonable intra state prison phone rates is not rocket science we know it can be done because states like Illinois are leading the way over the last decade the price of a 15 minute in-state call from an from an Illinois prison has dropped 98% so it went from 16 dollars and 41 cents for a 15 minute call to just 14 cents the same goes for out-of-state costs in Illinois a final question commissioner pie minutes ago you reaffirm your commitment to acting expeditiously if you were given authority to address intrastate calls but the FCC can also do more to enforce its existing $0.25 permanent out-of-state rate caps that went into effect more than two years ago rates at some correctional facility still far exceeds that limit and when you factor in excessive fees and kickbacks that do nothing to enhance security the price skyrockets for struggling families will you commit to meeting with me and some of the advocates I've been working with between now and the end of the year to discuss both out of state and in State inmate communication costs and I'm happy to host it so senator I would be happy to meet with you and I would also point out that under my leadership the Commission blocked a merger of two of the leading providers in this area precisely because we thought that would cause a concentration in the marketplace that would end up raising rates even further so I share obviously the goal that you have identified in your remarks Thank You mr. chairman I'd like to include in the record letters of support from numerous stakeholders who support my legislation without objection as well as documents that have to do with this issue as well is there objection without objection senator Thune

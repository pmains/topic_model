republican senator john kenney at a louisiana member of the senate judiciary committee how you doing sarah i know you've got a lot to say about this let me show you what the national education association statement says on that by the way 3.2 million union members strong publicly through existing media convey its support for the accurate and honest teachings of social studies topics including truthful and age-appropriate accountings of unpleasant aspects of american city in teaching history rather in teaching these topics it's reasonable and appropriate for curriculum to be informed by academic frameworks for understanding and interpreting the impact of the past on current society including critical race theory here's the deal the union wants it but even the far left progressives thought this is too much it's too complicated we'll save it for special classes or special courses for older uh students but the union wants it from the kindergarten to the 12th grade how's that going to go critical race theory is a fairy tale promoted by many not all but many of my democratic colleagues including the biden white house critical race theory teaches that america is totally screwed we need to just tear it down and start over critical race theory teaches that the primary reason that america was founded was to maintain white supremacy not freedom not rule of law not equal opportunity not personal responsibility but white supremacy critical race theory also teaches that non-uh black americans are racist that they they don't much like black people whether those non-black americans realize it or not that's why critical race theory also teaches that white children are born bad it teaches that black children are born trapped there's almost no hope for them it's a very fatalistic point of view in my judgment critical race theory is cynical a historical uh sophomoric insipid and dumb as a bag of hair um america is not a racist country we have racists in it just like everywhere else but most americans black and white think a whole lot more about character than they do about race they believe in equality and most americans understand that to a bear we all taste like chicken i'll take your word for it uh two dozen states have banned it i would assume there would be a challenge at some point in those states can they win their case and keep it out yes um the history of america is the best evidence that it's not racist in 150 years which is the blink of an eye in historical terms we have gone from institutionalized slavery to the election of a black president who was also reelected um we passed civil rights laws in 1866 uh 1871 1875 1960 1964 1968 1990 1991 and i'm probably leaving some out we have over ten thousand elected public officials in america today who happen to be black uh pollsters don't even pull it anymore but when they do they find that over over 90 percent of americans support interracial marriage america is not perfect but we are good we caught the disease of slavery but we beat it back and it's something we work on every day but i i don't support as does the biden white house just tearing this country down and starting out we'll see what the president has to say about as far as i know he hasn't been asked point blank about it do you uh i don't know and but and i'm sure he'll be coached to dodge and bob and weave and stall and restart but uh i think all of this is coming from the uh the biden white house and its purpose is to set us up for a massive reparations appropriation you think this is coming from the white house i do well dr jill biden was a teacher still has the credentials to do it you think the bidens are pushing this yes look i have uh i i i'm in the senate i've listened to the testimony of the nominees by president biden uh the the these folks are radical they all believe in critical race theory uh ask attorney general garland i asked him if he thought the department of justice during his committee testimony was inherently racist he wouldn't answer that was my answer wow senator thank you come back again by the way i misspoke the nea the teachers union represents two million members but there are 3.2 million public school teachers in the u.s department of education we get that right thank you so much if they take their orders they take their i just didn't want to sell it higher than it actually is senator thank you we'll talk again

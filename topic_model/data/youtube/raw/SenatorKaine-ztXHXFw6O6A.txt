House and Senate Intelligence Committee members are balking at talk of the u.s. taking military action against Iran in retaliation for the suspected Iranian attack against Saudi oil fields after strong congressional criticism of the Saudis for the cosy murder for their war against rebels in Yemen the president has ignored bipartisan efforts to curb US arms sales to the Saudis and brushed aside intelligence assessments that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia himself knew about the plan to murder The Washington Post journalist joining me now is Democratic senator Tim Kaine a member of the Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees senator first of all the vice president today has repeated the the very belligerent rhetoric that the president used on Sunday on Twitter that we are locked and loaded the u.s. is locked and loaded to take action about this attack against the Saudi oil fields now the president yesterday specifically said I don't want war and he was projecting a much less you know military opinion but what are you getting from the mixed signals here well look there's there's real confusion at the White House but the locked and loaded language the Vice President is just parroting what President Trump said two days ago and I'll just make it real clear indriya under no circumstances none should the United States go to war to protect Saudi oil I mean we have worked so hard to become to develop our own energy economy during the Obama administration we became essentially essentially energy independent for the first time in a very long time to put our troops in another war in the Middle East I say this is the father of a marine to put our troops in another war in the Middle East to protect Saudi oil would be absolutely ridiculous and I'm gonna do everything I can as an Armed Services Committee and Foreign Relations member to stop the u.s. from getting in another Middle East war especially to protect the Saudis well the House Intelligence Committee is going to be briefed I'm assumes something's gonna happen on the Senate side as well but you know there they could make a national security argument that this is a critical you know juncture for the oil supplied global oil supply the US economy it's a national stage not dissimilar from the argument we made when Kuwait was invaded by Iraq yeah and when Kuwait was in dated by Iraq remember President George HW Bush brought a brought an authorization to Congress and there was a debate and vote and congressional support for that the president I would predict would not get congressional support in either house for a war to protect Saudi oil the president has said in the past he thinks he can do it without Congress and but that is a clear violation of the Constitution and we would if the president starts a war against Iran to protect the Saudis I will tell you this we will file a motion immediately to force this to the floor of the Senate and force there to be a vote there's a procedure under the War Powers Resolution that would give us the ability to do that and we would do it within minutes because we shouldn't be in another war in the Middle East what we definitely should not go to war to to protect Saudi oil I mean it would be so unwise and and unjust for us to put this on the shoulders of our troops and their families the Saudis and the Iranians are essentially next-door neighbors they're separated by a small body of water they got to figure out their own problems you know that they are they're engaged in a proxy war throughout the Middle East that's crushing people in many many different countries we ought to be promoting them de-escalating tensions rather than do what the president has done which has raised tensions throughout the reason region by blowing up the diplomatic deal with Iran do you buy the parent intelligence that we are reporting that others that this did come from around and it was much more sophisticated than the previous missile attacks and drone attacks that had come from the rebels in Yemen Andreea I think that it is likely that it came either from Iran or from Houthi rebels in Yemen with Iranian support I believe that to be the case what you see the vice president others saying it was an unprovoked attack go look at what Saudi Arabia is doing to Iranian positions and look at what the US is doing to Iranian positions the notion that this was unprovoked is absolutely ridiculous through reimposing sanctions on the Iranian oil sector we basically disabled them from selling energy do you think that they're just going to X that no they're not going to accept it so the US has been engaged under this administration in blowing up diplomacy and militarily provoking Iran and when you do that you get an escalation that's what we're seeing the US should try to de-escalate the situation and not talk about more military action and another war in the Middle East and what would happen if they do this on their own without congressional authorization you are the the father of the fight over the AUMF and have failed to get their agreement to authorize the military actions in Afghanistan and Iraq and in Syria in Syria that's true but recently we had a hearing before the Foreign Relations Committee and the the administration witnesses were pretty candid they acknowledged that neither of the existing authorizations would cover a war against Iran so they need they need congressional approval if the president decides to ignore the Constitution and start military action without us there is a provision under the War Powers Resolution that gives us the ability to file immediately a resolution to stop military action and we're guaranteed a vote on that on the floor if the president foolishly decides that America should go to war to protect Saudi oil we will file that resolution immediately we will force a vote on the Senate floor in full view of the American public I come from a state that's very connected to the military and I'll tell you my state does not think the veteran heavy military have the Commonwealth of Virginia does not believe that another war in the Middle East makes any sense whatsoever the father of a u.s. Marine thank you thank your family for your service absolutely our Tim Kaine thank you very much sir

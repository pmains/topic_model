thank you lisa hi everybody hi thank you for joining it's great to see you guys uh so here we are we have i think it's 60 days right today uh until uh november 3rd until um election night although the way things are going it it may be like election week or election month but that's okay because the american people are gonna make a decision and that decision is gonna stick i'm sure there will be some questions about um that but i'm very confident that um this is gonna this is gonna be okay um the whole world is watching the united states for obvious reasons because america is the hope of the world and we have not been giving people hope the last three and a half years or so but the world needs us and all of america will be watching a few states that will be decisive in the presidential election and a few congressional districts that will be decisive in determining who controls the house of representatives and which direction our government will be going in in the next two years um are we actually going to have a responsible leadership in washington um and that is a very low bar i have a higher bar that i hope we will meet but my very basic bar is that we have leaders in washington who can calm things down in this country who can focus on solving problems who can do the things that the overwhelming majority of americans are eager to see us do and will wake up every single morning believing that they have a responsibility to the country rather than simply to themselves if only if only we had that now um so we are going to have a big say in that we had a big say in 2018 we made an enormous difference in this district and just a handful of others in giving us a house of representatives that would stand up for the constitution apply checks and balances and pass legislation on infrastructure on health care and the environment on gun violence on all the issues that we care about in this district that that we want to see progress on we're one election away from having not just a congress but a president that will line up behind that kind of agenda and start getting work done um that will make this country truly better so i don't want to say much more than that because i want to get to your questions um i have a sense of uh some of the issues that are that are already in the question queue and uh and that i assume you'll want to um hear me um offer some uh thoughts about i really would love to hear your thoughts as well your suggestions for the next couple of months we've got um most of september back in dc we're going to have our last legislative session before the election so we have a lot to try to get done but then we have a decision to make and i am working very very hard to try to have a chance to to be there for for you all and for the district in january when i honestly think we're going to have a chance to do some great things so with that let's open it up and uh and have a uh have a fun time and a good discussion all right great thank you congressman um our first question is from walter levy he has a question about everyone's favorite postmaster oh i wonder who that is walter you should be unbeating yourself here we go stack your congressman hey walter um the joyless i have to add the suffix um when he fails to meet his a subpoena other than announce his net profits i know to put it this way what can or will happen to that nice guy oh i'm glad that you're concerned about him yeah right so look i i i mentioned that we did a pretty big thing when we um when we elected a new majority in the house of representatives in 2018 and i think this is a good example many people are anxious and frustrated about what we cannot do there's a lot we cannot do but having that democratic majority that check against abuse of power in the house really does make a difference and i think we're seeing that on the post office if not for uh for us fighting for funding for the post office exercising over oversight calling this guy's you know what in front of congressional committees and um you know and and using our leverage uh in these coronavirus legislation uh talks to to try to force um a reversal of some of the changes this guy has made there would be no stopping him right i mean there would be absolutely no track on the ability of the postmaster general and the president to slow down the mail all the way through the election and we know what it is um so we've we've already achieved some things i know i know you're not satisfied you shouldn't be but we've already achieved some things we got him to go back on some of these crazy no overtime rules that we're preventing uh mail carriers from delivering uh by the end of each day the mail that comes into a post office at the beginning of the day we got him to go back on his threat to uh charge um to to no longer treat uh ballots as first-class mail um which the post office has always just done as a matter of course it's not a law that they've done so he was threatening he was telling the states that they're going to start treating ballots as bulk mail which would have delayed them significantly um he's promised she's not going to do that anymore um what they haven't done is uh plug back in put back in some of the sorting machines that they've yanked out of the distribution facilities around the country we are looking into what impact that has had in new jersey i've you know i've heard some reassuring things from folks within the postal service they think that given where we are now given what we've been able to stop him from doing that they should be able to handle the huge increase in election related mail in october um but we're gonna stay on this as you know we've subpoenaed uh more documents uh all of that all that that just keeps the spotlight on him it keeps the pressure on him um if he doesn't comply with the subpoena uh our next option is to hold him in contempt uh i know some folks would like us to send the sergeant of arms out to arrest somebody uh and unlock whatever little room may exist in the basement of the capitol i haven't been able to find it by the way but apparently there's a little room that that some people refer to as the house jail uh i i don't i don't know if it's gonna come to that the guy did come and testify when we told him to so so far he has complied and i think the ultimate sanction that he needs to worry about is not so much what the house can do right now but the fact that um you know slowing down the mail is a criminal offense and there is at least some chance that we will have a sane president and an independent justice department um pretty soon this guy's no idiot and i think one reason why he's somewhat some a little bit retreated is that he understands that he may be personally held accountable if um if there really is a delay in the mail leading to chaos in the election because of changes that he made so um be vigilant but be confident always fill us with confidence thank you all right our next question is from carol shimmerling and she has a question about the housing at the border she'll be able to elaborate sure yeah i got it um what is the status of the housing situation at the border in mexico are the kids still in cages or no people still in cages no so um we we put an end to that uh but there is another problem that arose so um you know through a lot of uh yelling and screaming and oversight from congress and most importantly um actions uh forcing actions by the courts uh the administration was compelled to stop the family separation policy that was leading to the caging of children and other cruel measures that were deliberately designed we know this i think beyond any reasonable doubt deliberately designed to deter people from applying for asylum at the border in other words we were kidnapping children to deter people from exercising a legal right so that ended but in place of that policy the administration instituted something called a remain in mexico policy this is now before the coronavirus they decided that anybody who approached a a border crossing and asked for asylum in the united states would be immediately turned around told to quote remain in mexico until their number came up for a hearing which could take weeks or months interestingly this policy did not apply to people who snuck across the border and were caught um those people actually were brought into the u.s detained briefly at border patrol detention facilities and if not taken back by mexico were released into the community in cities like el paso so they actually got a better deal but if you actually did the right thing and walked up to a a lawful a normal border crossing say juarez and el paso that's one that i visited on a codel uh last year um then you would be told to turn around and remain in mexico and so no they weren't in cages but then they were stuck in these mexican border towns and oh you know most of these folks are from guatemala el salvador nicaragua they're not mexican um there are a lot of ngos trying to help them there but they were were and remain very vulnerable to gangs who see them as uh prey because many of them do have relatives in the us and so um these gangs see them as extortable for money um that that was i think not as bad as family separation but still very bad i've co-sponsored legislation to try to stop it and all of that kind of got put in limbo when the coronavirus resulted in just a shutdown of the border across the board and as you know it's you know the irony is it's not just the u.s shutting its border against people crossing from mexico right now mexico is shredding its border against um americans just as canada has just as virtually every country in the world has the president absolutely has succeeded in building his wall and indeed mexico and canada and every other country is paying for it except it's a wall to keep us out not a wall to keep them up and um so step one we gotta control this coronavirus repair our relations with the rest of the world uh and then hopefully with a new president in congress we'll be able to actually pass some um decent thoughtful um humane immigration reform that um could have i think gotten bipartisan support in almost any sane era in our recent history but the last few years has has been blocked by the the hard right of the republican party thank you congressman um our next question is from one of our interns maddie maddie has a question about um fair elections and freedom of the press not here but in hungary go ahead maddie hi tom how are you hi um i was wondering what do you think that the us should do to promote fair elections and freedom of the press in hungary while the country is backsliding into a dictatorship well thanks for that thank you so much for raising that i don't often get this question so i'm very happy um that that you raised it um so hungry why is this important first of all hungary is one of the countries that emerged from um the warsaw pact um the soviet bloc it was a communist dictatorship it was like poland and the czech republic um a place where people bravely struggled against dictatorship and freed themselves in 1989 when the berlin wall fell and built a really wonderful open successful democracy hungary became a member of nato it's one of our allies it became a member of the european union and then like a lot of countries in eastern europe and around the world including us it saw a kind of you know populist nationalist movement rise under a leader named victor orban who's kind of a much smarter trump uh and and who won elections by getting people scared of of immigrants and running against the european union running on hungarian nationalism and he was very successful and the more successful he was the more he consolidated power eventually started cracking down on free press um changed the constitution to give himself all kinds of new powers he's packed the supreme court hungary is barely a democracy anymore although it has many people who still strive for it and awkwardly it's a member of nato which you know wouldn't have been admitted if it hadn't been a democracy but now we don't really have a provision for kicking it out um what can we do well uh number one elect a president who isn't a big fan of victor orban because trump and orban are buddies they're very similar number two work with the european union encourage them to use some of their enforcement mechanisms because an eu member can be suspended it can be denied some of the benefits of eu membership if it's moving away from democracy and then finally um one of the tools that we have that i would like us to be using very vigorously against all kinds of dictatorships is to go after orban and his people based on their corruption most dictators around the world are also very corrupt and most people around the world whatever their feelings about the united states or about democracy one thing that almost everybody has in common don't like leaders who steal from their people right and we have a justice department that can prosecute international corruption if the money touches the u.s banking system we now have sanctions under the magnitsky act a law that i helped get past when i was in the obama administration where we can identify corrupt foreign officials and sanction them our intelligence community i think should be doing a lot more to track the flow of dirty money around the world whether it's from putin and his cronies or this guy orban or um from other dictatorships that that would be hugely embarrassing to this guy um he's fine being called a dictator by the way he's not fine with being called corrupt and so that's that's the tool that i would use they are in a lot of other places how did you get interested in hungary by the way um i took this class at rutgers um with an eu expert um professor kellerman and it was called lessons from europe and um i just when we started talking about what was happening in hungary it just became really interesting to me and i ended up writing a lot about it so i'm just really happy to hear your take on it as somebody who knows so much about foreign policy so thank you thank you well if you've been writing about it then you're you're probably more of an expert current expert on hungary than i am so i don't know about that i'm gonna have to get her to work in the state department um we are gonna need lots of good idealistic non-corrupt young people absolutely yes all right thanks so much maddie um our next question is from frank vito frank is a high school government teacher in cranford go ahead frank uh so i have two questions tom one is um would you come uh well would you zoom with my class maybe after you win re-election yes okay that was easy and then the second question is how do you feel about term limits and uh campaign finance reforms um good uh thanks for raising that i'm gonna take those separately um campaign finance reform i am incredibly passionate about uh if if you were to ask me if you were to tell me i could pass one bill and no others i would be very upset with you number one um but if you put a gun to my head the one bill i would pass would be hr1 which not coincidentally was the first bill hr one that we introduced in the house after the 2018 elections and there's stuff in there on ethics reform there's stuff in there on voting rights the heart of it was campaign finance reform um transparency full disclosure of all political contributions not just to campaigns like mine which aren't direct contributions are disclosed but also to these dark money super pacs these independent groups that are sponsoring tv ads most of the ads you will see criticizing me in our race here in cd7 will not come from the kane campaign they will come from these super pacs and nobody knows who's giving the money um so that's an absolutely critical reform the other one is to reverse the citizens united supreme court decision that was the the court decision that basically said corporations are people and people including corporations can spend an unlimited amount of money influencing election because money is speech that's a supreme court decision we can't pass a law overturning it we can only do it be a constitutional amendment so that's harder but that's something that i very much want to do um and the reason why i would make that the one thing is that it would unlock the possibility of progress on so many other issues you know why is it that we got 90 some percent of the american people thinking we should have universal background checks for gun purchases and it doesn't pass why do the overwhelming majority of the american people want to see some action on prescription drug prices but it doesn't pass um climate change protecting the environment things that have overwhelming um public support you know you're this is this is a kind of basic question about it's a great question for a government teacher right because you would think if you just studied our system on paper that if 90 of the voting public is for something that the system would produce that outcome for them so what is it in the system that interferes with that functioning that intended functioning of our system and i would say money from special interests is probably the the main answer now you also asked about term limits um i am very much in favor of term limits for presidents when i was at the state department we started a little crusade to promote term limits around the world as part of our foreign policy this was a big big deal in africa and president obama took this up with great gusto because you've got a lot of leaders who you know get elected and then stay for life um and so we were pushing that really hard but i've actually never been in favor of term limits for members of congress even way before i was a member of congress and i think here's the distinction in my mind um if you're the chief executive of a country um all this power is concentrated in you including the power to appoint everybody else who works for the government and so if you're in for 20 25 years inevitably the government becomes loyal to you as a person rather than loyal to the country to the people to a constitution i think that's unhealthy even if the leader is a good person as a member of congress i'm one of 535 people i don't have that power concentrated in me the power is it belongs to the body to the collective and so i don't think there's as much danger of abuse of power if a member of congress is in there for 10 or 20 years on the contrary i think there is a benefit to having some people with that kind of longevity because they gain experience and maturity and wisdom and when i think about historically members of the house and senate who i've admired the most i think about people like say ted kennedy on the democratic side or john mccain on the republican side they didn't do very much their first term or two they became great figures in our country over time and i wouldn't i don't think i would support a reform that would deny us the possibility of those kinds of leaders emerging in congress thanks great thank you our next question is from arn arne olsen has a question about bbm security yeah hello um all right so when i listen to our republican opponents they're very skilled at rhetoric and a lot of times i feel a lot emotional pressure and i find i have to resort to fact checking to sort of restore my sense yeah does it work it does good but the point is is that influence of you know their personalities it's it almost looks like we have actors who can talk the democratic line but probably have no ability to legislate if they're in office but my question is related to the vote by mail i mean typically when you vote you know once you are registered you go to the voting booth and nobody is around you and you have a secure location and nobody knows how you cast your ballot right so there's a sense of pride uh privacy and sobriety to the event right when we're talking about vote by mail of course it's motivated because of the pandemic but when you fill out your vote now it's at the kitchen table if you have a kitchen table but even in people who are in healthy family units you know there's usually a little bit of competition between uh family members about who they vote for and if you're in a situation where you have multiple families perhaps on one location you know where does someone get the privacy to actually sit down and think and cast their vote and i don't know if there's a remedy other than i mean right now if you go to the voting booths on election day you can fill out a provisional ballot which would be similar to a voting booth you would have a place to sit in privacy but it just seems to me an oversight that we haven't even noticed that you know we're certifying security of the counting process but i don't think anyone is addressing the fact that people need to have pressures from their peer groups excluded when they're voting so you know one thing that i would say for i don't think there's any perfect method of voting there are risks associated with voting on a machine there are risks associated with voting by mail as you well know there are states that have uh for many years have 100 mail elections um washington oregon utah colorado hawaii everything seems to go well in those states this is not a complaint that i've heard from anybody i know who lives in those states but for anybody who's concerned about it here in new jersey one of the points i would make is that we have multiple options uh you know what what's going to happen is everyone's going to get a ballot sent to their home at that point you can fill out the ballot at your kitchen table and mail it back in and you know families generally talk about how they're going to vote anyway right so it's not like a you know mystery under normal circumstances but you know that's one of your choices you can fill it out you can mail it back in um you can also uh take that ballot to a secure dropbox by yourself you know if if you don't want your husband or wife to see you filling it out um you know if you're uh if you're going to vote for me but you want to tell them you're voting for tom kane uh tell them what you want and then take that ballot with you in a car and take it to a secured dropbox fill it out there drop it in the dropbox or you can take it to your county clerk or you can wait until election day and you can take it to the polling place and drop it off there again filling it out wherever you want you know in in in your house in front of your family or in a private place or you can also as you mentioned go to that um to that polling location just as you would in a normal year and fill out a brand new um ballot there um in fact president trump just said today you can do it twice which is not a good thing to say um certainly you should not do that deliberately but in practice you know you you if you vote by mail um [Music] you know you you do let's say you vote you know two days before the election by mail and you go to uh you forget that you've done so and you go to the um polling station and you vote again then your mail ballot will be discarded um because we actually do have very good security for these things so i think almost any concern that a particular individual might have is addressed by the fact that we all have these multiple choices and everybody can do whatever they're most comfortable doing but importantly all of us have the option to vote from home if we believe that that is the safest thing for ourselves and for our families does that make sense it makes sense but but since everybody is voting by mail i think it's a detail that shouldn't be overlooked on some level i mean we're calling people to tell them that the vote by mail applications will be in october 5th right and you know the issue of basically security when you're voting it's not even a dress i don't think it's almost like it's an overlooked aspect of voting this time well again they can fill that out wherever they want um there will be secure drop boxes in every town um you know every well i mean legally there will be at least 10 in every county and one in every municipality with more than 5 000 people that has a municipal building with a municipal clerk so that's probably most towns in uh in our district and um so you know that's a that's a very private option for anybody who needs it and then as far as you can fill out your ballot at the dropbox i mean you can you fill out your ballot at the municipal clerk is it part of to the library request spell it out wherever you want i mean it's your ballot but it's a matter of awareness i think do people know that that's something on the democrats well that's a good question and and there will be you know a huge effort by the state to educate people and we will supplement that um my campaign and i think most all the other campaigns too will be communicating with voters about how this is going to work uh we just had a practice run in the primary but but there will be more options for people in the general election and so we will we will absolutely communicate that to everybody i just thought i'd mention it i didn't want it to be an overlooked detail that became a disaster there will be no overlooked detail not in my campaign we are very detail-oriented here at khan malinowski for congress thank you so much arne um our next question is from owen he has a question about the restart act good evening uh congressman thank you so much for taking my question uh on tuesday september 1st uh this past week uh live entertainment and performing arts venues across the country went uh read in order to raise awareness of the struggles that they're currently going through during this uh current crisis as obviously uh performances aren't happening in these venues and they're struggling financially um and the other thing they were trying to do is gain support for the restart act which would give essential support to not only these venues but uh other plenty of other small businesses across the country and my question to you actually is two-parter but do you support the restart act uh hr 7481 and do you have any other plans to help support out-of-work arts and entertainment workers such as myself thank you yeah um so this is this is about restarting the paycheck protection program right for um which has um which has expired after doing a tremendous amount to help small businesses of all kinds uh in our district and around the country uh you know we shouldn't lose sight of as bad as things are we shouldn't lose sight of how effective that has been in our district we've received more than a a billion dollars of assistance from the paycheck protection program for our small businesses supporting about one quarter of the working age adults um in our district a quarter of the jobs um i mean think about where we would be if uh if that hadn't happened now we're at this point where we're you know we're gradually reopening uh we'd be doing it faster if the rest of the country had made better decisions but nevertheless we're gradually reopening and i think one of the things we have to consider in that reopening is that um there are still some categories of small business that are in in a more difficult position that that will have to move more slowly than others because of the nature of the work that they do in march every small business was in a sense equal apart from the the truly essential businesses that we needed to stay open the government was saying to everybody shutdown and so we we passed this this relief program for everybody um i think going forward um i've argued that there are some sectors of the economy that that need special help um the restaurant sector is obviously one of them the performing arts sector is obviously one of them as well because you know you rely on getting people together in crowds and that's not that safe and and so if we want you to to take a longer time to reopen i think we've got an obligation to provide some targeted assistance um to you and to to others in that industry and other industries that that are also in that category um so the answer is yes and that's why and all that's part of the you know negotiations on the covet build that we're uh that we're going through right now thank you congressman um our next question is from bernadine greene she has a question about poll workers [Music] hi tom um i just want to ask you how we're doing on i saw there was a group i forgot the name of it that was trying to get uh younger people to sign up for poll working uh and i was wondering where your connection is with that because i know you work with a lot of young people and how that was going uh you know i don't know how it's going i know that it is going i know that um that we're encouraging younger people to sign up for that day for obvious reasons because there will be plenty not as many but certainly plenty of um of polling stations open um actually lisa is this something we're kind of encouraging any of our volunteers yet to consider um the other day was national poll worker recruitment day i'm just looking it up right now as to what organizations are doing that but we could certainly add that to one of the things we're doing i i would i would think yeah um i i leave that to to our campaign brain trust as far as how we mobilize people but we do have you know we you remember all of you who were involved in 2018 you'll remember how many committed people were out there knocking on doors and making phone calls especially in those final uh weeks and uh unfortunately we're not able to do all of that um particularly the door knocking and so i i you know i think that may be another way that that folks who might otherwise have been uh out and about greeting voters uh can can also um can still do something incredibly valuable that's obviously not directly for our campaign but but for the health of our democracy locally absolutely yes and i just looked it's vote saveamerica.com and um you can go on there and i think they'll give you some information as well but thank you for that we will definitely look into what we can do thanks thanks um our next question is from mathangie from monty for justice she has question about the george floyd justice and policing act hi can you hear me i can yes sorry my internet's being a little slow right now that's okay i can hear you perfectly well natanji well i can't hear you now um can you guys hear me i'm oh okay um can you hear me well my question i was uh now you faded out do you want me to ask the question i can find it um bear with me is is she still on the call excuse me my internet was being a little weird that's okay don't worry i think can you um you can also type your question in the chat she did i can read it angie would want me to read it for you um yeah sure okay she's from monty for justice she's a from montgomery township her question is how do the reforms in the how okay concerning the george floyd justice and policing act maintaining mandating body cameras will that create the fundamental change for police reform when it has made little change in other states where it's implemented there's not one thing that will solve this problem and you know body cameras alone are not going to solve it but i do think we're better off having a body camera mandate than not having it because well look one reason we're having this national debate about about policing and racism and law enforcement is because we have video footage of these terrible encounters between police officers and members of the african-american community um so you know i'm very much in favor of body cams but that's not all we need to do and it's not all of what the justice and policing act does that bill creates a national standard for the use of deadly force making clear that it it can only be resorted to as a last resort um it restores the powers of the justice department to supervise police departments in jurisdictions where these problems become systematic it stops the transfer of military style equipment of surplus military equipment to police departments around the country we don't you know we this is all about building trust between police officers and the communities that they're supposed to protect and we don't think that kind of trust is fostered when the police look like the u.s special forces parachuting into afghanistan it provides a lot of funding for better training of police departments and how to de-escalate conflicts it stops things like the ability of police officers who are fired from one police department to hide their their record of misconduct so that they can be rehired by another police department so there's a lot of stuff in that bill that would be extremely helpful if we could pass it it passed the house there was a more modest proposal put forward by senate republicans they were at least willing to consider something and um then you know politics got in the way and trump started uh seizing on law and order as his theme for the campaign and accusing democrats of all wanting to defund the police so it got a little bit harder but i know that the folks in the house congresswoman karen bass was the main sponsor of this bill they are still quietly talking um to those senate republicans who seem to be serious about wanting to move legislation forward so i have not given up on uh on this and if we don't do it this fall we'll do it next year great thank you thank you for your question thank you congressman for that thoughtful answer um next we have rachel gallagher who desperately misses camp okay that's really mrs canvassing go ahead rachel yeah i was wondering if there were going to be any kind of opportunities i think you mentioned earlier that we can't go knocking a door to door but i was thinking that you know i mean could we do literature drops masked um you know maybe talking to people from six feet away or anything um would there be any kind of opportunities to do that i mean i've been doing phone banking obviously but um you know it was do kind of miss that door-to-door feel it's not up it's not up to me it's up to all of us okay sense that we have to we have to make these decisions based on what people are comfortable with um our volunteers and of course the voters that we meet because we don't want to make them feel uncomfortable by inventing their space that would not be right and it wouldn't be helpful to the campaign so i think it's something that we continue to feel out and one way we feel it out is by getting feedback from all of you um how would you feel about somebody showing up at your door um what about those middle ground options literature drops probably you know i imagine we'll be doing some of that uh my opponent's campaign uh they have done some door-to-door although i don't think they have volunteers i think they just like send their campaign stuff out to make a show of it but they actually have done that and that kind of i don't know i was kind of turned off by that like really i don't think that's right right now but that's the decision they've made so you know i we very much welcome your feedback and that of everybody else here in the meantime yes we're doing phone yes we're doing text messages um i you know i want to be doing a lot of postcards as well i think we can run postcards in the way that we did canvassing like giving people um uh you know giving people addresses based on data just as we would if you were going door-to-door ideally people in your own town um so that you know you can say i'm your neighbor and i support um this candidate so uh there there'll be a lot of alternatives and and we'll continue to consider whether and and how to do things more in person i appreciate that i mean i've been doing the postcards i've been doing the phones calls so yeah i was just curious if you know at what point do we take can we take the next you know step so thank you yeah again your feedback is an important part of that decision great great thanks um moving on we've got susan blubow who's got a question about a potential rescue package hi um yeah i lost where i typed that um i i read today that mitch mcconnell is having second thoughts about withholding a second rescue package and i wanted to know what you've heard about that and if the looming fiscal cliff in september is putting pressure on him is that a sort of a leverage that uh speaker pelosi is using to get some relief to people who you know need to make their rent their monthly rent and feed their kids etc etc yeah so um the fiscal cliff is the end of the um of the fiscal year which is september 30th and ideally if we were a functioning congress we would have we would be passing our appropriations bills to to fund uh the various government departments i'm very proud the house has done that we did it last year we did it this year we did it on time but the senate has not taken up taken up any appropriations bills so that means we will pass um by the end of september we have to a continuing resolution which just you know funds the government by kicking the can down the road i think it would be very hard for us to pass a continuing resolution to fund the government if we don't also uh uh agree on a relief package which most people apart from some members of mcconnell's caucus agree we need to do we disagree on the details but we agree that we need to do it so i think that is that that does increase the pressure on mcconnell i imagine he is hearing from some of his more vulnerable senators like uh corey gardner and um uh tillis and graham and um you know all the the the the members of his caucus who susan collins obviously who who could lose this november um and you know it will not be good for them if we don't reach some sort of deal and as long as they're in a deal-making mood then look the only sensible deal i think most americans just understand this is meeting somewhere down the middle we we proposed a very expensive bill we passed it in the house three months ago um we always knew that we were not going to end up with a 3.4 trillion dollar bill that had everything that the heroes act proposed they put forward a proposal to do about a trillion dollars and i think you know anyone who understands negotiation understands that like the the compromise is somewhere in between and so far the republicans haven't been willing to budge from their initial proposal we've budged we've gone way down from ours so um i think we do have some leverage uh there's also an effort by rank and file democrats and republicans in the house um including some of my very close friends so i'm in touch with them about this to put forward what a compromise would uh look like um because we've you know dem pelosi said we're willing to go down to 2.2 trillion but she hasn't spelled out exactly what that would um entail so we're trying to actually put forward a more detailed proposal um and show that it has republican and democratic support in the house i think that would also be a breakthrough so that's where we are and you know what's at stake it's the state and local relief which is so important to us in new jersey a non-partisan issue in my district because every town needs this every county needs this the school aid because the republicans want to condition it on schools reopening which i think is outrageous they shouldn't be washington should not be making that decision for us or for any school district in the country um election security post office money all of that all of that good stuff so i'm sorry it's taken so long i'm disappointed but uh i think it is it's important that we try to get something meaningful here even though we all know that democrats will have to compromise hopefully not too much um all right thank you our next question is from annie morrow she's a question about trump's threats to defund cities hi congressman um i'm seeing different reports various threats that come in and then this one is a story that came out this evening or late afternoon that trump is threatening to defund certain cities you know because of i don't know bags of soup rioters who knows but anyway he's threatening to divert some of the federal funds to cities such as new york it's not out of the realm of possibility that he would look at certain states that he doesn't like either ultimately if he if he's away if he's able to get away with this it the report i saw i think it was with the new york times said that he was asking the u.s attorney general and the office of management and budget at creative ways to divert funds what is the house's response or possible response to that um he can't do this um this is not about diverting funds this is about diverting attention from the coronavirus from the fact that there are a thousand people dying a day from this pandemic that he has completely abdicated responsibility for controlling um it's about trying to scare people and making the election about fear of anarchy fear of crime um even though there's just as much crime in cities led by republican mayors as there is in cities led by democratic mayors um he you know i've read the the text of his order it's just ridiculous you you can't like it can't be done he knows it can't be done legally i will immediately be stayed by a court at the moment you know if it's actually applied to a city which i doubt they'll actually do right this this is i think something he's doing so that we waste time talking about it but if they actually try to do it um they'll be taken to court and any court in this country will tell them um that they can't do this so you know this is but this is how he governs by not governing um by constantly creating drama by distracting us by dividing us by pitting red states against blue states democrats you know democrat cities against republican cities anything anything to avoid doing the one thing that he is supposed to do which is to govern this country solve problems and bring people together thank you thank you congressman and i think we have time for one more question um brian haas has a question about the fact that we may have an election week or election month go ahead brian yes hi thank you tom uh i'm from new providence um and my question i'm sure you've heard this before is about this possibility that because republicans are more likely to vote at the polls in person uh than democrats that the night of the election could look like a red wave basically election night so new jersey i think has solved that problem by saying that they will begin counting mail-in votes up to 10 days before the election but i don't think other states have done that so what what is going to happen here basically or what is the recourse so i'm glad that we have done that i think i don't have a um i don't know exactly which other states allow it and which don't i think some do some don't but yes you're right certainly some don't including some important states in this election and so my answer to your question is first and foremost we are going to need to have nerves of steel this what you just described is real like you know you could have on election night uh the network's reporting that trump is the head by five points in pennsylvania they won't call it for him because you know they're responsible but they could just report here the votes he'll call it for himself and try to create the impression in the minds of his most adamant supporters that anything that comes in a week later that contradicts that is somehow fraudulent right because his goal is to try to destroy confidence in this election our goal has to be to build up confidence in this election and in our democracy and so we're just going to have to be messaging this for the next month number one try to vote early number two encouraging states to to begin counts early but number number three just everybody needs to be patient and recognize the as you know this was the case for much of american history we may not know who won on the night of november 3rd all votes are equal it's not like there are two different piles of votes or just votes that are cast by american citizens lawfully and until every vote is counted we're not going to know who won but once every vote is counted we will know who won so that's partly just it's on us to communicate that again and again and again and again so people are aware of what's likely to happen okay thank you it's going to be a long month but thank you thank you so much everyone i am so sorry we couldn't get to every question i think we ran the gamut here um we tried to get in as many as possible and we will you know we'll do these again so stay tuned next week uh tuesday at 5 00 pm we are going to be doing a round round table on social security and we are honored to have bowser from shanana will be joining congressman malinowski we might be in for some musical entertainment um please go to mobilize sign up for that tell your neighbors this is something we're going to focus a lot on issues that are important to seniors so that's going to be the focus and social security so thank you is bowser going to do his presentation i certainly hope so okay so look everybody um i'm guessing not everybody on this zoom call is a bowser from shanana fan but it is one of the best presentations on any issue by anybody that i've ever seen and if he does the thing he did last time for us uh he combines um a kind of seminar on social security with music in a way

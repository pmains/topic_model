and welcome to the issue is I'm Alex Michaelson and welcome back to congresswoman Karen bass she is the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus she's a Democrat representing Los Angeles in Culver City and this weekend she's going to host a special town-hall meeting to discuss the Mullah report that is free and open to the public it is on Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. at the Crenshaw United Methodist Church congresswoman good to see you welcome back thank you so this week we hear these comments from President Trump that say that he's open to listening to a foreign government if they've got dirt on one of his opponents the question that results from that is is it time to impeach the president well in regard to his comments why should we be surprised he certainly has rejected the idea that the Russians did anything in our election so do I think it's time to impeach I don't what I like to see Trump removed immediately absolutely if you recall I was concerned about him the year before the election in terms of his capacity to be the president we need to go through a process we're at the beginning stages of that process and I think it needs to play out some of your colleagues say we're not at the beginning stages of this process we've gone through a mall report we've gone through years of investigations we have findings that show potential obstruction of justice isn't it time to at least move forward with an impeachment inquiry what do you think one of the reasons why I know everybody thinks that is because the investigation has gone on for a long time meaning the Muller report Congress for two years did absolutely nothing when Republicans were in charge Democrats have only been in charge for six months and frankly we've only been at full speed for three months we need Muller to come we need McCann to come we are going to have hope Hicks come this week and so we need to go through the process of oversight and investigation only been added three months perhaps the most important person weigh in on this is the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi she reacted to the president's comments this week about that foreign interference here's what she had to say and what the president said last night shows clearly once again over and over again that he does not though that difference between right and wrong but she still has not said anything in terms of moving forward on unimpeached if this seems to be her position which is that politically if you go forward with impeachment in the house it'll probably be a party-line vote the president's not going to get convicted in the Senate because Republicans aren't going to vote for him exactly so you're handing him a political win he'll say I'm acquitted well it's really not I don't believe it reduces itself completely down to politics again we have several different committees that are involved in oversight and investigation if we are going to impeach him we need to have all of the information the mother report remember looked at just one issue alone we need to look at conflict of interest we need to look at corruption we need to look at emoluments this man in my in my opinion has been running a criminal enterprise but it does not make sense for us to rush and to do something that we know is not going to result in him being removed I know if you did a survey of my district people want to see this man gone why would we take people down a process when we know that he's not going to leave if you remember at the beginning of Nixon's you know scandal with Watergate he had very high poll numbers the Republicans in no way we're going to impeach him but when they saw the evidence then they changed and I do think if we did it today there would be no conviction in the Senate but who knows as we go through this process maybe my Republican colleagues will grow a spine and realize that this man needs to go they know he needs to go but they have decided to essentially compromise because they get tax cuts they get deregulation and they get the courts let's talk about another big issue which is that of homelessness which unfortunately the numbers show argue is getting worse in LA County and in so many different counties around California I mean California is run by Democrats at every level yes state locally you know is this a failure of democratic policy because Democrats keep asking for more money to fix homelessness and the problem just keeps getting worse well I don't think it's a failure of Democrats again I think it's a complex issue there our responsibility on the federal land - we need to do more to provide resources to California we need to provide section 8 vouchers there's a lot of things that need to happen but is the issue resources or is the issue too much regulation oh no I don't think it's too much regulation but we have to deal with NIMBYism in our city - you can't complain about the tents and say I don't want them built anywhere near me so take your choice tents or be more neighborly and welcome people in your neighborhood and NIMBYism meaning not in my backyard in my backyard let's talk about one of the few issues on the federal level that people actually agree on which is foster care right yes it's an important work in bringing together foster children from around the country and pairing them up with members of Congress as well see there are bipartisan issues that we work on they just don't get a lot of attention and in improving and transforming the nation's child welfare system which is the driver by the way to the criminal justice system is a bipartisan issue so a week ago we had a hundred foster youth from around the nation from a hundred different congressional districts we had them in Washington DC for an entire week learning about Washington the legislative process and shadowing their member of Congress every year that we have done that right afterwards we're able to move legislation forward in a bipartisan fashion so thank you for highlighting it all right we'd like to have some fun on the show you know that so let's do something called personal issues this is where we put 30 seconds up on the clock and get to know you a little bit better with questions you haven't seen in advance okay favorite la restaurant farinelli restaurant oh my goodness nataly's Thai restaurant favorite conservative favorite conservative baby Kevin McCarthy favorite sports team Lakers favorite holiday Thanksgiving favorite Disneyland ride Oh God in years the d-cups one thing you bring to a deserted island [Laughter] I don't know books lots of books favorite presidential candidate I'm not gonna ask you later favorite Marvin Gaye song I heard through the grapevine heard it through the grapevine which I think we just happened to have ready because some way we named a post-office um hasn't came together for your love of Marvin Gaye right this weekend there's a Marvin Gaye post off that's gonna dedicate the posters to Marvin Gaye Marvin Gaye was an L a celebrity and community person that all of us loved very much his work and the public is welcome to come out and enjoy that and maybe they'll see you dance to some Marvin Gaye muse I don't know about that mother report it in the shoulder actually yeah there you go [Music]

Aaron all right Sarah thank you I've fun tonight the house Minority Whip Democratic congressman Steny Hoyer and congressman thank you for being with me you heard Sean Spicer he says president Trump is quote extremely confident that the DOJ has it they have the evidence that Trump was wiretapped do they you know well you know president Trump is so extremely confident that he has so many things that he knows that aren't true so I think it's very difficult to believe Sean Spicer if they had proof it seems to me they would have disclosed it to the Congress but more importantly to the American people and president Trump would have been happy to do that the fact is i think his representation was untrue it's an alternative fact that's either made up in his own head and there's no evidence to corroborate that so he may be extremely confident but we've seen him day after day after day be very confident that things were as they are not he makes it up as he goes along so when they said they needed you know they asked for that delay of course as you're well aware right they want to delay from yesterday for for another week which they were granted by the House Intelligence Committee Chairman does that make you think that they could have some type of evidence if so what is it I mean to your point you're saying well you think if they had it they would have already put it out there yeah it makes me think they don't have it and they're trying to figure out how to get out of a statement that the president made that's not true and they can't corroborate as I understand Spicer's comments also where well they may not been talking specifically about wiretapping I just think that's it can't be true or if it is true is a wildly irresponsible statement wiretap means something specific to every American remember being American knows what a wiretap is every American knows that you have to get a court order with probable cause to tap some an American citizens phone or communications and so some representations no he meant something else like somebody standing at the door of Trump Towers and seeing who's going in and out just not believable so so yeah when it went on Spicer did say that and say that that Trump was referring broadly to surveillance against his campaign not to wiretapping specifically well but I was there there many surveillance that could be do you think that could have been you know with other I don't know what he's talking about but as I made an example there's no doubt that candidates for office watched the other can they go to their town meetings they listen to what they have to say they even put a camera in their face sometimes I've had that done to be and ask him a question but all of that is not anywhere close to alleging that the president united states had trump towers or the Trump campaign or organization wiretap that's a criminal offense if it was not done with probable cause and if there was probable cause the president says he didn't do it the Director of National Intelligence under the Obama administration says he didn't do it they didn't do it and we believe I can't say that he said that but we believe that mr. Comey the director of the FBI has given reason to believe that the FBI didn't do it so I don't think it happened and I don't think they have proof that had happened and I think they're now trying to weaseling weasel out of a very very serious and unfortunate allegation that made off the top of his head as he said so many things so I want to ask you briefly here about health care Democrats of course you're all united against the GOP leadership health care bill tonight though I don't know if you're aware congressman another moderate GOP congress person has come out against Nick congressman Ross latina from Florida tweeting I plan to vote no on the current HCA bill as written the bill leaves too many from my district uninsured can you say at this point that this bill definitively will fail I can't say that definitively Aaron as you know I'm the whip and if you ask me how many Democrats are going to vote against it i could say definitively how many Democrats going to vote against it but i haven't whipped on the Republican side obviously the Republican side is deeply divided which is not a new phenomenon it's keeping deeply divided or four or five years from in the past and that's why John Boehner is no longer the speaker and that's why Paul Ryan has so much trouble unifying his party on a proposition that he puts forward their deeply divided I think there's a real chance that it will fail on the floor but we'll see before you go congressman steve ban and told the atlantic magazine would give an interview there and he said during the access hollywood video tape of course you know the one when Trump talked about sexually assaulting women Kellyanne Conway saved Trump's candidacy that Steve's man as points of view his quote is Italian and not been there when the fire storm hit I don't know if we would have made it she literally became a cult figure during that time period that again Steve benen is he right I think there's a lot of Merit in that argument because I think the women of America were extraordinarily offended and outraged by the statement and the alleged to conduct or the conduct that he said he involved himself in what Kelli Ann did a woman came forward an articulate woman and look he really didn't mean that that's not the kind of person he is I know him and she gave her her imprimatur to Donald Trump and we know that an awful lot of women did in fact vote for Donald Trump which I found very very surprising given what he said and and his conduct so that I think there's some merit in what what Bannon says on that issue because I think Kellyanne Conway did in fact give him some greater credibility than he otherwise would have had as a result of that tape all right congressman where I appreciate your time as always thank you you bet thank you frontenac Secretary of State Rex Tillerson using the fake name Wayne tracker for sure

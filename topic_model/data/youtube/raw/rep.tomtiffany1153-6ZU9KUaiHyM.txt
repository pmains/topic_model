thank you mr chairman uh first of all sir thank you for being here and i'm sorry you were subjected to scurrilous comments about the previous president who gave us peace through who gave us peace through strength kept us out of wars uh who took crime seriously who gave us energy independence which we've given up in just a little over one year and um had kept illegal border crossings down to a level that we had not seen in a long time and we wish for those days to come back when we had a strong america i think mr bishop's testimony showed that i would say to the chairman that it is time to bring the director back in there's a lot of questions to be answered as we heard from the witness here there's things that he could not answer i would hope that the fbi director would be able to answer some of those questions that we'd like to have answers to um as you follow social media and efforts to facilitate illegal immigration um does it raise concern for you when you have people like the vice president of facebook who openly admits they facilitate illegal immigration fbi is in the business of stopping illegal activities breaking the law here in the united states does that raise concern for you um sir again i'm not familiar with that post or what you're referring to i mean any violations of u.s law we are interested in exploring right and those referrals should come into the bureau they can either come to the local field office but if there is a violation of u.s law that is obviously what we're here to do so if i um show those to you will the cyber security division follow up on them it's not going to be a cyber security responsibility the what you're describing is going to largely fall in the criminal investigative division but if that's what you want to do you want to make a referral to the bureau then we can get it to the right people so it should be a criminal investigation if they're posting things that facilitate illegal immigration is that what you're saying sir i don't know what the post says what i'm saying is that if there is a criminal violation of u.s law criminal allegation that you think warrants investigation then we'd be happy to take a look at it um absolutely spread the word at fbi it needs to be done and by the way it wasn't a post it's numerous posts and as you know how social media works it spreads like wildfire and that's what's happening down in the southern border where the big tech companies are helping facilitate illegal immigration in february 22 the biden administration just recently last month decided to scuttle its china initiative program launched by the justice department during the trump administration to protect america from national security threats posed by the prc um i'm troubled that that's going away um what comments do you have isn't that something that is important to protect americans in american interests what i would say about china is from a cyber perspective they are the top overall cyber threat that we face as a country um that poses both security and economic so in other words when we hear from the other side russia russia russia russia it's actually china is the biggest threat is that correct not um not diminishing that we should pay attention to russia also but you just said china is the biggest threat is that right so we have a big four right china russia iran and north korea they're all formidable adversaries from a cyber perspective we would assess that china is our most formidable adversary does um the biden administration scuttling the china initiative bring you any concern sir we operate fairly autonomously independent of what the biden administration did or didn't say our investigative posture on cyber threats posed by china has not diminished in any way and we have the largest percentages of our organization dedicated to those types of investigations thank you for that answer um it was recently reviewed at the uh start of the uh russia ukraine conflict that um uh information that president biden passed on to general secretary xi in china that it was compromised that information was sent on to russia do you know if any of our foreign assets and or infrastructure was compromised sir i don't know that answer who do i go to to get that answer what i would say is let me take that back and we'll get that answer for you i don't know that answer in the moment yeah i'm deeply concerning mr chairman that we're seeing information just simply passed on to our number one adversary china and the russians are able to use it and just another thing where it seems this administration the biden administration is giving away the keys to the castle here in the united states

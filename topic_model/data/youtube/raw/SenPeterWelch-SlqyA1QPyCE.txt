THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN YIELDS BACK THE  BALANCE OF HIS TIME. FOR WHAT PURPOSE DOES THE  GENTLEMAN FROM VERMONT SEEK  RECOGNITION? >> TO ADDRESS THE HOUSE FOR ONE  MINUTE.  REVISE AND EXTEND. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE:   WITHOUT OBJECTION, THE   GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED FOR ONE  MINUTE.  >> MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT T.  THROUGH HIS WORDS AND ACTIONS  PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS ALLIES   ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN  TO DESTROY THE INTERPEND   INVESTIGATION OF SPECIAL   COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER THROUGH   PROVOCATIVE TWEETS,  WITCH-HUNTS, RECKLESS ACTION,  FIRING DIRECTOR COMEY AND  ASSISTANT DIRECTOR MCCABE, MUEL  PROVOCATIVE TWEETS, HIS   PERSONAL ATTORNEY CALLING FOR  AN END TO THE INVESTIGATION. M WELCH: THE QUESTION, MR.   SPEAKER, IS NOT WHAT THE   PRESIDENT WANTS TO DO OR MAY   DO, THE QUESTION IS WILL   CONGRESS DO WHAT IT MUST DO,   PROTECT THE MUELLER  INVESTIGATION. A NUMBER OF US HAVE A BILL THAT  WOULD DO JUST THAT, REQUIRING A  THREE-JUDGE PANEL TO APPROVE   ANY DISMISSAL. MR. SPEAKER, NO AMERICAN IS  ABOVE THE LAW, NO MEMBER OF  CONGRESS IS ABOVE THE LAW, AND   NO MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE   BRANCH IS ABOVE THE LAW,   INCLUDING PRESIDENT TRUMP. MR. SPEAKER, LET THE HOUSE VOTE  ON OUR BILL. MAKE EACH ONE OF US BE   ACCOUNTABLE TO OUR CONSTITUENTS  ON THE RULE OF LAW.  WILL WE VOTE TO PROTECT THE  MUELLER INVESTIGATION OR WILL  WE ACQUIESCE TO THE PRESIDENT'S  THREATS AND TEMPER TANTRUMS? MR. SPEAKER, LET US VOTE.  I YIELD BAC

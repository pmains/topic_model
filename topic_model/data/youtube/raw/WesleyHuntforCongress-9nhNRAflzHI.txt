you think these lack in numbers are actually the fact the military is going perhaps woke this is the problem here and at some point you have to stop blaming covid we're at the point to where we need to start enlisting brave men and women that just want to serve our country like I did and look and not not just me but my father and my brother my sister we all went to West Point and we also understand what it takes to fight Wars in a foreign land and that's the kind of people that we want in our country and the kind of mentality that it takes to do that it does it doesn't mean that we care about wokeness we care about pronouns we just want to learn how to fight and I have somebody that actually spent time in Robert E Lee Barracks at West Point I was actually stationed at Fort Rucker Alabama I was stationed at Fort Hood and at no time in the hundreds of times that I entered those buildings and entered those bases that was I concerned with the name of it look that's our history that's our past renaming buildings doesn't change that but what it does do is we forget about our past and we are doomed to repeat it look let's get to focusing on war fighting let's not worry about names on a building and by the way if you're looking at what's happening with aggression right now North Korean aggression right now Irani aggression right now and also quite frankly Chinese aggression the future Chinese aggression they're watching what our focus is on and this is why we are hurting on the national scale it makes this November so important we've got to take back the house and our Senate so we get our country back on track and focus on American values and being strong again on the world scale our military is winning on wokeness I don't know if that's an award we actually want to win Wesley hunt appreciate your time as always sir thank you thank you God bless you good morning thank you very much likewise sir

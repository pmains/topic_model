Chris thank you for that US congressman brad Sherman who represents the 30th district at the San Fernando Valley is a member of the US Foreign Affairs Committee he revealed an email threat sent to an LA school board member and he joins us now on the phone thank you so much for calling us I know you've had a really busy morning this morning congressman you've seen this email thread and I think what has made everything so fearful and everyone got so fearful is that it was very specific can you talk about what you've seen well it was very specific as to the types of violence that would be done references to pax pressure cooker bombs Kalashnikovs it was not specific as to which schools would be hit but it was very specific that it would be Tuesday what lacks a little credibility is a claim that the writer would be joined by 32 comrades to think that there were 33 individuals ready to die today and that federal authorities hadn't even raised the threat level would be surprising as you may know New York received a similar email but in that email the writer claimed that he had a hundred and thirty-eight comrades and that would have been even less credible okay so your your colleague and fellow congressmen from the San Fernando Valley Adam Schiff he's gone so far now to call this a hoax would you go that far at this point I would say that it was that the New York email lacked credibility that there were certain that there are certain parts of the Los Angeles email that are not credible but i would say that we've got officers there at Granada Hills charter high school etc and they should continue their work and congressman you know no matter what people think if they think that you know cortina is possibly spoke too soon and pulled the plug on this or not there was a lesson that was learned day can you explain what that lesson was if there was one well they're both good and bad lessons and demonstrations to the world Isis is watching they see on the one hand that we can deploy efficiently that we can react very quickly and we can put professionals in every one of nearly a thousand schools they also see is that in light of what happened in San Bernardino at least those of us in Southern California are acting out of a very large abundance of caution and the purpose of terrorism is not necessarily to blow things up & to cause gazal tease but to create fear and this email did just that at very little cost to whoever sent it and I'm by no means sure that the person who sent this was in a Muslim extremists or a jihad 'used there a number of indications to think that maybe this was sent by somebody who has no involvement with Islam at all all right all right congressman brad Sherman from Sherman Oaks we certainly thanks for joining us here live to give us your thoughts on this interesting situation today as he mentioned we've all been terrorized because of this weather if anything was blown up or not we're going to take a quick break and we'll be

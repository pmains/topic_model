welcome to each of the witnesses let me start mr. stormer with a couple of questions for you as you note in your testimony although the number of launches has increased in the past five years from 12 to 32 that number pales in comparison to the roughly 15 point 5 million flights that trends at the national air space in a given year given this dramatic disparity and frequency as well as the maturity of the traditional aviation sector is compared to the commercial spaceflight sector does it make sense in your judgment to treat commercial spaceflight exactly the same as traditional aviation for the purpose of national airspace integration thank you very much for that question senator I think at the time no I don't think they can be compared the same and let me give you a few quick examples in the past past week alone out of Texas in southwestern Texas l√º origin recently launched and landed their new Shepard launch vehicle a vehicle that wasn't around six years ago five five five years ago if that SpaceX just recently launched a mission to the international space station carrying crew cargo to the International Space Station a year and a half ago SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy launch vehicle that landed two boosters successfully back to earth this had never been done before we have new entrants that are I should say new entrants but new concepts new capabilities that are entering the market at a rapid pace that are all very unique so the maturity of our industry although we are making rapid advances I don't think that we should fall under the same guidelines and rules than an industry that has been a very robust industry for the past 50 or 60 years have fall under those same rules so I think it takes a little more time I like the regime that we have right now with the FAA s office of commercial space transportation the licensing procedures the permitting procedures and how they've been working with industry and regulating industry I think that's the ideal approach as it's a crawl walk run the industry is doing outstanding but there's a lot of unique entrants into the industry and it's a only gonna continue to grow and we need that support to help it continue to grow mr. Monteith as you know title 51 in the US Code directs the Secretary of Transportation to quote encourage facilitate and promote commercial space launches and re-entries by the private sector how important is that statutory mandate and and how how does d-o-t go about complying with it Thank You mr. senator first off I would tell you that that the best way for us to enable facilitate and promote the industry is to ensure that we have the right regulations at the right scope at the right time the worst thing we can do for this industry is over regulate to the point where we are not increasing effectiveness of Public Safety but we are creating hurdles to either new innovative technologies or putting undue bureaucratic overhead on our existing companies as far as the what we call EFP specifically the way that that we and the department carry out those responsibilities are primarily through our engagement with industry with organizations like mr. stall MERS and that way we understand what industry is doing we listen to their concerns where we should focus and quite frankly where we can get better in our processes primarily related to the length of time it takes to license and operation without compromising safety okay mr. Lovering according to a report published by Deloitte in India why of 2018 the market for vertical takeoff and landing vehicles is is burgeoning in a meteoric rate the report estimates that the market will be worth 21 billion dollars by 2035 the report also states that the global unmanned traffic management market is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of over 20% from 2019 to 2025 all of which will mean more jobs and more opportunity for Americans mr. Lovering in your judgement how will the growth in in the US market benefit Texas and the nation more broadly thanks senator Cruz um really is while it is folks today on launching urban access to the skies this is just the beginning so in your state but in particular we've already seen a lot of activity around Dallas and the interest there there's obvious lots of other cities that there'll be a very interesting for us to explore and I think while in the beginning we're looking at having city integration for these services as battery technology improves as the battery costs come down we're looking at be able to expand this to more and more area so we maybe will start off in urban areas but then eventually suburban and rural areas so really seeing this as being able to tax us a wide range of people in the cities and also in rural areas thank you

one last question um from his sims hip and this takes it back to to the 638 contracting and and what we were able to include in that farm bill um so there is also uh authority to conduct forestry management activities within this tribal forest protection act i think there's a lot of interest in this uh by tribes who are looking to to use this new authority but we've heard that the the limited authorities that are authorized under the the act itself under the tribal forest protection act and the narrow definition of tribal lands um could prevent this demonstration project from being fully utilized so i don't know if you're looking at these as barriers and if you have any updates for me as to what what you're doing to make sure that this is something that again there's interest there but let's make sure that we've taken away the things that would uh would limit the ability for participation my office has actually already received the question and so we are already working on it within the office of general counsel to really uh dissect what those limitations are that we have heard as well uh we've heard it from tribal leaders but we've also heard it within the forest service itself okay and so we're we are working on that and i would love to uh get with you and your staff and give you and the committee an update on that but we're it's on my desk let's do that and i i'm going to ask all three of you as our federal witnesses um if you can respond to us in writing last year in february the president issued this executive order on america's supply chain this is executive order 14017 and this directs um the administration to support a resilient diverse secure supply chain and as part of that order it requires consultation and outreach to stakeholders so i'd like to know what each of you and your respective agencies have done with regards to consultation with tribal governments or the relevant stakeholders and and just what level of outreach has gone on but that is something that that i'd be happy to take in in other communications thanks chairman

chairman very briefly I just want to thank you for not adopting the administration's proposal to end the revenue sharing program gomez authorized by the Gulf of Mexico energy Security Act of 2006 unfortunately it was not the first attack by an administration to cut this program in order to pay for national debt the funds received are deserved there region-specific dollars by law they must be spent on coastal conservation restoration hurricane protection and infrastructure coastal states that helped reduce our nation's energy needs deserve these funds and fair share of the revenues especially since they bear the cost of providing the services and maintain the infrastructure the supports offshore production and because they also bear the risk if there is an accident so thank you again by ensuring that these funds are continued Gulf states will be more equipped than ever to carry out the necessary coastal restoration and flood mitigation projects needed to combat region specific vulnerabilities on behalf the Gulf States thank you thank you mr. pallazzo miss kau

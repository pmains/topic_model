there's a q a box and if you click on that you can go ahead and put your question in there after we get through the introductions i will help moderate the q a and i'll call folks out by first name and last initial at which time you'll be able to unmute yourself and ask your question live so again that's the q a button at the bottom of your zoom screen all right congresswoman lizzie fletcher i'll hand it over to you great thank you so much aaron and thanks to everyone who's joining us tonight um for this zoom discussion our virtual community conversation uh this month and tonight the topic is mental health uh a topic that i'm excited to visit with you all about and with our our panelists this evening um as well as to have an ongoing conversation about the work um that we're seeing across our community and the work that we're doing here in washington um but you know as as we uh talk tonight of course i think we can all reflect on uh the many challenges that that we have seen uh certainly over the last 20 months and the impact that covid19 and this pandemic has had on all of our lives and it's been a real shock to our system um it affects the way that we function and interact and there there's been so much that we have learned and we have seen as a result of this pandemic and while it has presented us with a lot of new challenges um it has also provided an opportunity to see some of the existing areas um gaps in our our health care system um including our mental health and also i think an opportunity to discuss some issues around our mental health more openly so you know since since the pandemic began um more than 20 months ago many people across our community have experienced isolation stress grief or trauma we have seen that i think each of us all of us in our lives uh whether it's the loss of loved ones um or the associated traumas from the the changes um in our uh in our daily lives and the impacts on the people around us and of course unfortunately uh we are no strangers to trauma most recently um we had a terrible trauma in our community with the events at the astroworld festival uh leaving so many in our community just shocked and saddened and experiencing the psychological effects from having witnessed this tragedy unfold and it's something that i've heard um from from people since i have been in office as we've talked about some of the other tragedies we've experienced in our community from hurricane harvey and the tax day flood and the memorial day flood and other storms and rain events that have really taken their toll on people across our community that the mental health impacts of those in in our community um is lasting um it's also evolving and it has it has really left a lot of families a lot of people struggling to understand what's happened how to cope with grief and loss and you know it's it's my understanding i'm not an expert here but um it is it is my understanding that trauma changes the way that people see themselves and other people and the world and that regaining a sense of safety can take days or months or years um and our panelists are here to talk tonight and i'm i'm really looking forward to hearing from them um share their wisdom i think it's important for all of us to to understand that you know we sometimes think um of trauma as as kind of an acute incident um but at an unexpected global pandemic that fundamentally alters the way that we work and go to school and socialize um and the incredible and and i think for many of us just unimaginable death toll that we have seen in this country and around the world um is also traumatic as it has unfolded over the last 20 months i think this really is a moment for us to reflect on how our mental health is affected by environmental factors and to discuss how mental health diagnoses really can be impacted by them because the challenges that we've faced over the last year and in recent years um you know they just they matter and these men these issues don't just matter you know in a moment or an isolated period it matters all the time and what really matters is that we discuss it openly using facts and uh talking to uh health care providers and if we think of mental health as simply one part of our overall health care just like cholesterol or allergies or diabetes or our vision um you know that's how we can and should think about it and that's why i've worked in congress to ensure that during the pandemic and beyond that mental health resources are accessible and available and i'm i'm just going to mention briefly a couple of things that hopefully you all know um but in in july the house of representatives passed a funding bill that included more than nine billion dollars for the substance abuse and mental health services administration including 100 million dollars for the national child traumatic stress initiative more than 130 million for suicide prevention programs and 5.5 billion for substance abuse and prevention treatment efforts um those are um those are programs that were supported and funded because of the experiences that my colleagues and i um have seen across the country and know how important it is um to fund this really important work and then in september of this year i introduced a bill uh working with folks from across our community introduced a bill that's called the collaborate in an orderly and cohesive manner act it's bipartisan legislation that invests in a delivery model that integrates behavioral health care within the primary care setting for the treatment of mental health and substance use disorders that require regular follow-up like depression or anxiety and substance abuse and so that's one of the ways that we can help more individuals get access to mental health care and we know that more access to mental health care can improve lives and communities so tonight i want to provide a space to have your mental health questions answered i know we've been hearing a lot about it from people calling our office talking about what can we do in congress to address uh real concerns across our community um about the mental health of members across our community and so you know these questions can range especially tonight um but you know things we're hearing you know can we address stigma where can we seek help um you know how mental health can impact you and those around you and so um i'm really excited um that we have an incredible group that's joined us this evening for this conversation and i want to turn it over to them i'll introduce you very briefly um to this really esteemed panel tonight we have dr andy keller who's president and ceo at the meadows mental health policy institute angelina hudson the interim executive director of the national alliance on mental health of greater houston and wayne young chief executive officer at the harris center in houston so each of these leaders brings a wealth of knowledge to our discussion and i'm really grateful for their their leadership uh on these issues uh in our community in our state um and at the national level in in thinking about how we address uh some of the challenges in front of us and also for their partnership uh with me and my team and with all of us here tonight so i thank you for joining us i'm excited to hear from you and i think we'll just um go in that order maybe i'll turn uh to you dr keller first um for a few remarks in an introduction and sharing with folks who are participating a little bit more um about you and your work thank you so much great well thank you congresswoman fletcher and thank you for your leadership on this uh you know the two things you mentioned i mean that budget for samsa that's almost double what was being spent on the substance abuse mental health services administration before the pandemic uh and then the you know the bill where you know you're really putting those resources in primary care bipartisan bill i mean you're you're not just providing more through that legislation but you're really changing uh how we deliver care and trying to get it just like we have we made advances for heart disease and cancer so i just really appreciate that and i think too you know the way you frame that i mean there are a lot of hard things and i'm going to talk about that briefly but but i also think we're talking about this more you know i think we are more open and i think you know one thing cova does it convince us all the mental health is real and it affects all of us so i'm a clinical psychologist and i do a little bit of practice but mostly what i do is lead the meadows mental health policy institute which is a non-partisan data-driven mental health policy and substance abuse treatment policy and res program research institute so we really basically try to help local texas national leaders uh say if we want to help children or if we want to help reduce the number of people in the jail what are the things that work and then how do we implement those pay for them sustain and partner with uh folks uh to make that happen so that's what we do and in in houston we have a special set of operations through the hackett center for mental health and the hackett center was really set up after hurricane harvey to respond specifically to the kinds of needs that the houston community has and we are really excited dr chianta moores our new executive director there and she's a wonderful expert in early childhood mental health and we also have a trauma and grief center there which focuses on that type of those types of services which is you know very much cut with what you're saying and and i do think you know alongside trauma of grief is just has been something i think we've not paid explosive attention to and it's something that's dramatically impacted us through cloven in just a couple steps i mean 3.4 times as many americans today are depressed than they were before the pandemic about 22 percent of us one in five are just depressed and that's that's unparalleled the number of young people especially young women and young people of color presenting in emergency rooms for suicide is double double what it was before the pandemic and the pandemic has been deeply inequitable as we know building on earlier inequities so if you're a black child you are 50 percent more likely to have lost a parent to covet and we know that four times as many hispanic texans uh in the prime of life were lost to coma than compared to other races and ethnicities so we really need to grapple with it the equity issues but also with the grief issues we need to really make sure that the treatment and care is available for those things so that's a big thing we're working on and i look forward to the discussion tonight to hopefully help folks think through some of those things well thanks so much dr keller for that um that introduction uh lots of information there lots of interesting things to um to talk more about so i'm really glad that you're here and also um angelina hudson i'm thrilled that you are here um so maybe i'll turn to you next for for your opening thoughts to get the conversation started thank you well i want to echo a big kudos and thanks to your work congresswoman fletcher because you know without someone with your influence and attention and time to this matter sometimes mental health along with the stigma that's involved with it can kind of push this down and put it on the back burner not only on people's minds but also those dollars that we need freed up to serve the families and individuals that are facing um these troubling challenges which are cyclical they're lifelong so i represent nami i'm serving as interim executive director but i've been a part of nami for for 20 years and i champion as the entire organization champions for individuals and families who are actually dealing with the mental health diagnosis on a day-to-day basis it's one thing to kind of talk about it in theory but it's it's a completely different matter you know when it's not about statistics that do not impact you and those those statistics represent what is really happening to you within your own home so what our organization does we partner with individuals and families that are looking for help they want to know where to go um it is not one of the easiest illnesses or mental uh conditions to navigate within our systems of care right number one you're terrified and uh you don't know you don't necessarily know that you're exactly dealing with a mental health challenge because the behaviors can be elusive one day a person can be just fine and then the next day you don't know you don't understand what's happening and so we are here to serve families and individuals who are looking for what is the first step that i take who can i talk to where can i share this information and then from that first moment that they know that there's a diagnosis or a real behavior health challenge on board we offer free psycho education courses we offer support groups and we walk the journey with those families and individuals and we do this at no cost to the families that we serve true advocates of course can always you know write a check and do something to keep our doors open and um uh help us activate more volunteers in our community but it's the families that really um are desperate for answers they want to hear where can they find a trusting uh guidance or trusting information that they can uh lean and and depend on when facing these terrible challenges and that is the work that nami does best and that's why we're here so thank you for the invitation terrific well thank you so much for being here and for the work you do and um you really just touched on something important when you just said that when families are in um searching for information to be able to find trusted sources um and knowledgeable people but also people who have empathy and understanding and can help them navigate a path not just for you know a day or a week or month but really a partnership for the long term is so so important and i'd love to come back and circle back in our conversation um about you know accessing um those trusted sources of information so um really important point you touched on and um really excited to hear more of the conversation um and more about what what you do and what you think we should know and families maybe people who are participating or watching should know about how to go about that process i think would be really really helpful but before we get to that i would love to turn it over to wayne young uh for his introduction and introductory comments i knew i would do that thank you congresswoman i appreciate it um and i appreciate your leadership in this conversation the fact that we are talking about this and and you're lending your voice and time and attention to this issue is critically important and extremely helpful um and bringing people like dr keller and angelina into this conversation they're kind of the best of the best out there you put together a really nice group and i get to kind of write on their coattails in this deal but i am the ceo of the hair center for mental health and idd we are the local mental health authority um and the safety net behavioral health system here for harris county we have about 2 400 dedicated team members who deliver care on an average basis to about 85 86 000 people a year here in aries county um and we do that in 83 care locations across our community and so we have a large impact but i think we also know there's a large need we have a lot of individuals in our community who need these resources and supports and as you've referenced and my colleagues referenced that's a growing need through the pandemic we also have the good fortune or the opportunity to serve i guess really through operating the state texas is statewide covered 19 mental health support line and so we have literally talked to thousands and thousands of people from across the state who've been impacted by this in large and small ways and we've seen it kind of run the spectrum of individuals people who never thought they would find themselves trying to reach out to a support line um you know typically didn't see themselves as particularly vulnerable and as dr keller mentioned this is a shared experience we're all going through and so we have seen that impact we ourselves are serving about 26 more 20 more patients than we did just a couple of years ago we answer the calls if you are in harris county and call the national suicide lifeline those calls are answered by our trained crisis counselors and we've seen about a 33 34 increase in those calls with individuals who are are reaching out trying to receive support and so we we see that need every day and we we live it and try and meet those needs in our community i will also express my appreciation for the you you mentioned the recovery funds that you and your colleagues work so hard to bring into the community and just so everybody's aware those funds are reaching our community we we had an award from the county through the county funds that they had many millions of dollars to be able to help support community-initiated care models where we're going to develop skill building and resiliency in our community all the way to very specialized programs from state funds that are coming through so we're beginning to see the impact of the hard work that you did and the resources you brought to our community and i'm excited about being able to expand the capacity delivered here in our community because of that terrific thanks so much wayne um i i really appreciate the work you do um for the people of harris county it's so so important and um it's nice to hear that uh the resources that congress has approved um are making their way to you i think that's one of the questions um we get pretty consistently up here um on all sorts of issues and actually i've been fielding a lot of questions because of course as hopefully you all know the president signed the infrastructure investment and jobs act today um and the first set of questions i got from folks at home is how are we going to make sure they get to houston and harris county um and so it's good to know that these uh coveted relief funds that congress has appropriated uh have made it um to you and have made it into our community and that's been a real priority of the congress in fact many of us have worked to get direct allocation to to our cities and counties like houston and harris county um directly because the need is so great um and because time really is of the essence and here i think you all have all touched on some really important issues i have lots of questions for you but i also know we have participants with questions so um i think what all i'm going to do is i've got to know from erin um that she has some questions and um i'd love aaron if you are ready to to start with some of the questions from our participants um and hopefully we can get kind of each of your perspectives um on some of these on some of these questions as they come through absolutely yeah so we have some great ones submitted so i'm going to go ahead and read them out to you guys um and they're in no particular order so um the first question is from amy k what are we doing or can we do to ensure that mental health is appropriately handled in the work environment many have access to an eap but there are still perceived career consequences for taking stress leave or being open about mental illness thanks that's a great question and i think it really is a good starting place um who who might want to take that first and share with us what you know about um you know how this how these protections are being implemented kind of in a work environment i'm i'm happy to talk about that one i mean we're part of an initiative called the path forward for mental health and substance abuse uh work closely with the houston business coalition on health uh here in the houston area uh chris kazakh in the group their conference is coming up in december uh but what they really focused on is it's not enough to just do an eap it's not enough to just have workplace promotion you actually have to give people health services and these are private matters and the problem is what we see is you know you can do all the stuff in the workplace you can say hey you know pay more attention to depression mental health is real but then when you go and access your benefits and you have to call 10 different people before you can find somebody uh and you know three of those people are like dead but they're still somehow in your network or they've moved that's a real problem and businesses are stepping up on that houston business coalition on health is a real leader on that and really uh congresswoman email you know as you know i love that bill on the collaborating orderly and cohesive manner and that's the trick i mean we have to really get it in primary care we can't wait till people are so stressed out and overwhelmed that they go to their eaps so that's that's what businesses are doing and we are seeing them doing it which is it's very exciting um well that's great thank you and yeah i i know i mentioned the uh collaborate in an orderly and cohesive interact um in my in my opening remarks but i do think it's it's important to say this is an existing care model that has had a lot of success and that's part of why we are trying to facilitate it and make it um something that's more accessible to folks because uh we have seen that where there are fewer barriers right to getting access uh to those those care providers when it's when it's a more direct route um you just have a greater likelihood of success uh with that connection and so um you know both eliminating challenges um on the provider side to making sure that those um primary care physicians have the resources they need to making sure that the patients have immediate access to the care that they need um this has been a successful model and that's why um i introduced it with my colleague jamie herrera butler uh it is a bipartisan bill and i think it's a it's a good um you know a good example of the kinds of things we can do together where there's a lot of bipartisan agreement but also the kind of work that comes from people who live and work in our community who've talked about how how important that is so thank you very much for um for mentioning that particular bill and and i i hear what you're saying about um about these challenges and i i do think it's it's important to know um you know how how we can eliminate some of those challenges people face uh in the workplace in terms of getting access to care angelina you're nodding you may have additional thoughts to add i did and it's it's a very um you know nami is a grassroots organization so this is going to be a very grassroots response to amy and that is invite some of your community based organizations to come and share with your eap group or even share with some of your executive leadership team your middle managers and do presentations on mental health mental health interventions to your staff and employees i know nami is invited all of the time to come and partner we have a cadre of volunteers who share their story in a program called in our own voice and they actually represent every arena of industry whether it's a lawyer's associate association or the transit authority or oil and gas nurses doctors it doesn't matter we we have speakers who are in recovery and have successfully path uh passed through this journey of accessing help you know finding their recovery path and they're willing to share that information with people who find themselves in the same predicament so we do this for every every type of business organization that there is and we'd be happy to come to your organization as well thank you um so the next question i have we have submitted is are there mental health organizations for children i feel there is a large need to address this early on to prevent complex trauma that may carry over into adulthood and become a generational issue there there are several um so number one i see nami grady houston as sort of a clearinghouse to help families navigate and find which organizations are going to help them best but they're they're like 10 12 organizations if i started naming them some will be angry but uh but there there are a lot of non-profit organizations that are community based that have been working for decades specifically focused on children's mental health and there's also clinics that are focused and have initiatives to do outreach for children's mental health especially since the pandemic so i would recommend a if you need those services you can certainly give us a call on our warm line and we will share exactly who in your community is serving from a to z different types of signs and symptoms or diagnoses themselves and then b if you are a person looking to volunteer and work in this arena then look for the child of children mental health serving agencies that are there and whether or not they're recruiting for volunteers and then willing to train them to do this important heavy lifting it's going to take all of us just like dr keller's it's all of us that are being impacted and it's going to take a lot of advocates and volunteers and support from our community to set this right side up again thanks angelina wayne anything to add there yeah just the the the kind of additional thought that we certainly are a child and adolescent serving organization there are many of them in harris county that deliver high quality behavioral services um i i do think it's important often to start that conversation with your pediatrician they often can provide the most insight they know that child they know where they're at developmentally and and can often help at least point people in the right direction if not well connect them at some point in this process i'll certainly share our crisis line and our our tech support line and because we also can help people kind of way find and navigate through the system i also think that we've done a lot here in texas to begin to think about how we might expand child adolescent services and here in harris county we have several organizations who deliver a lot of care through school-based partnerships and locations and so i i think that is a growing model that's critical to be able to provide supports where those youth often are and where they are are comfortable engaging in care and i think it requires less less direct intervention from families they're able to leverage that support in a more accessible ready way and i know dr keller and his group had a lot to do with some of those increasing access to school-based services so he probably would have a comment about that to share as well but but there are lots of points of access um and at the same time there's not an adequate number of service providers either so it's kind of a catch 22 in that if i could just say the only thing i would add is that's another uh example of congresswoman fletcher where the american rescue plan act dollars made a real difference uh 113 million dollars was just allocated in this last special session of our funds for school-based supports like wayne's talking about and more supports in pediatrician offices through partners like the harris center through baylor college of medicine ut health houston so and other medical schools statewide so you know without those funds um you know we would not be able to surge that but we don't have enough providers but the ones that are out there now have the resources to to do a lot more than they did so i think that's just an important thing for folks to know thanks um one thing i well i know there are a bunch of questions um so i'm gonna i'm going to uh just put a pin in this but maybe by the end we can talk about or y'all can work in one of the um one of the other things about access and care um our earlier uh participant asked about the eap plans and accessing that i know one of the things um a lot of those plans are um kind of telephone based and one of the things we worked on um with the rescue plan act and and some of this coveted legislation and are continuing to discuss here in congress is increased access for telehealth services and so that might be something that would be um useful to folks to know as we kind of go through some of the other questions but that was another really important piece of the work that we're doing on our committee um in thinking about um not only uh making sure that we are providing more resources in various um in various settings but also that we're providing um the ability to access telehealth services so um would love to get input from y'all on that but aaron i want to turn to the participants in the next question um and maybe y'all can share some of those thoughts as we go through more questions um so we have a question from diane m i would be interested to know what doctors are noticing regarding issues that middle school students are currently experiencing such as anxiety depression and suicidal ideation are there more cases now than in previous years and are they covid related or something else well i can share a little bit on that one um so unfortunately there are more children affected so uh you know over the last decade we've seen suicide rates uh which is just one indicator but you know sort of the tip of the iceberg it's terrible it's a terrible tragedy but that means there's a lot of other children of anxiety depression trauma-related concerns so you know before the pandemic suicide was the second leading cause of death among young adults adolescents uh and it was a historic race um and then what's happened unfortunately during the pandemic we've seen actual visits double uh to i mean our pediatric emergency rooms are overwhelmed right now with children hospital beds are not available providers are you having a hard time like figuring out how to respond so unfortunately it was worse before the pandemic that it had been and now it's even worse and so you know really that's why it's like uh like angelina was saying and we've all said it's we all have to come together on this like this is a a real urgent matter where parents need to partner with their primary care folks and schools you know wayne was talking about the school partners and there are so many organizations across the houston area working with schools you know legacy some of the fqhcs there's a lot of great providers out there and we all basically are going to have to come together and to provide more because it's kind of unprecedented what we're going through right now unfortunately good news is these are eminently treatable the vast majority of children are going to get better if they get care but we need to get them care as quick as we can and i would add to that that just recently the american academy of pediatrics and the american academy of child adolescent psychiatry and children's hospital all came together um to declare that pandemic related decline in child adolescent mental health is a national emergency so from from all the different seats that they they perceive this thing they recognize kind of the trend we are i know that um just in the last year emergency room visits for youth related to suicide attempts has gone up 30 percent and i believe we're just seeing the tip of that iceberg frankly because i know for most of us who work in mental health services when school is not in typically summertime and holidays the number of children seeking services falls off because those supportive adults in their lives aren't there to say hey something's wrong something's not right and we've had now almost 18 months of that where some of these youth haven't had that regular contact and as we're transitioning them back in they've been you know this school year is a couple of months underway now i think we're beginning to see that rising tide and and i worry about what's behind that that's still to come that we may not have fully seen yet as it evolves and um i think there's a tremendous need and and we're gonna have to figure out how we rally to meet those needs because frankly there's not enough behavioral health providers in the system to do that you even if we had all the money in the world there's probably not enough clinical folks to bring together to try and individually meet those needs so we're going to have to think about collective responses to that and community approaches to be able to meet some of those needs thanks wayne angelina anything to add here well because most of our services is done by peer-led is not handled by physicians the one thing i can say with our warm line here in the um in our offices we have an uptick of calls from people who have never been on the radar for a diagnosis they've never um and honestly they're not really looking for a diagnosis however they are struggling with their mental and emotional stability and they're looking for answers where to go where to get support you know and they're not sure exactly what type of doctor to go to so wayne was right on the money with you know start with your primary care physician they do have a lot of um recommendations of where you can get started in trying to stabilize your own mental health care um there might be i have one that might be a follow-up for that um somebody asked how can i find a mental health provider in my network we do a lot of that work i mean just because we have this warm line that you know we have information and referral specialists that will sit on the line the first uh point of action is they will try to help you navigate your own system but as you know when people are stressed out they just don't want to read one they don't want to call one more number they don't want to read one more brochure and so in those cases we will um try to facilitate more hand over hand than finding the appropriate physician within their network to support them and i would say just you know particularly for children uh there's more resources than ever if you go to your family doctor go to your family doctor and ask them and there's a thing called the child psychiatry access network which the state has stood up with all of our medical schools a lot of our local mental health authorities clean the hair center partnering in that too and what they can do is they can both help your primary care doctor figure out what do you need because you know maybe that you can just deal with it with just going to your regular doctor maybe you don't need to go to a therapist but if you do need to go to a therapist there's folks who can kind of try to find the right referrals in your community and help you with that and they will kind of stick with it until you find somebody so for children and adolescents that's a fantastic resource that's probably the right thing for any of us i mean um and if your doctor can't help like i mean a lot of times you got to be pushy i mean you know like you have back problems sometimes you say well it's just in your head it's like you got to push sometimes so i think take an advocate with you and have somebody with you to kind of buck you up and you're like what angelina was saying nami's great at that i mean you know peers support why not so i think that those would be my recommendations and if i can just add a thought to that because the majority of the individuals we serve do have limited resources and often aren't insured don't have resources to be able to pay i mean so for those individuals if they reach out to us at 713-970-7000 that's our access to our crisis line but it doesn't have to be a crisis per se we can provide support services and help people without resources um either access care through our system or any number of other nonprofit providers that do care on a sliding scale or limited cost basis so um certainly it is it is not a an easy task to get care if you have insurance because there is a whole lot of hoops to jump through but for those who don't have that that's an even bigger challenge sometimes yeah wayne thanks i think that's an excellent point um and it's good for everyone to have that number and to know this incredible resources available in our community and i i think andy what what you were saying and angelina what you were saying um about for those who do have um who do have health insurance and have a health care plan to think about mental health as part of your health care and to treat it like you know you have a back problem you have other challenges and and really kind of removing some of that stigma to say this is this is something and going to your primary care physician or your family doctor um and making it part of your overall health plan um is is an important and i think useful way to think about getting access to these services aaron do you have another one i do um so uh bijan n asked how can we as a community support ongoing or new research to address mental health participate in the research trials one of the things we talk about often is how in the minority communities the you know some of the protocols for treatment the medications they're not they're not for us they don't they don't represent um you know the the minority population and and how the um the medications might be metabolized or you know i'm not going to get into the specifics of it but i will say this there are opportunities through baylor college of medicine ut health to participate in studies surrounding uh new treatments and new therapies and it it takes all of us to participate in those trials and those studies in order for the outcomes to reflect how they're going to impact such a diverse community so i think one of the things we can do is you know if if we if we hear about some and you can sign up you can actually go to some of these um research hospitals and say you know i'm interested and if you have a particular area of interest you know participate in the studies it's a great point it's a great point and i would say i'm not going to say write your congresswoman because she's here so she's listening but at the state level you know one thing that was done with our state representatives is about six years ago we put in a thing called the cancer prevention research institute of texas uh secret which put over a billion dollars a year into research into cancer cures uh here in texas that's why md anderson and other folks across the state are world leading we need to do the same thing for mental health and there's a start we have about 10 million dollars a year the legislature puts into this child's mental health consortium but you know texas still only gets about three percent of nimh research funding for mental health and substance use disorder treatment last time i checked we're about 10 of the country so we really need to beef up our infrastructure so we can be more competitive and and get more of those grants so and i love what angelina said too we have to have folks participate and we need inclusive participation and i think the institutions you know baylor ut houston university houston we have excellent schools here who are doing great research social work schools as well not just our medical schools psychology schools so but we do need to kind of beef up our infrastructure so let your state representative know you care about that thank you guys um so one question we have um from angela oh i'm wondering what effect social media may be having on young adults do any of you have thoughts on what parents can do as our children become more active on social media that's a hard one so i'll share so here's the thing i mean i two years ago i gave a different answer on this and so uh the answer and the answer i gave two years ago is still somewhat true i mean at the end of the day social media in some ways uh can be good and bad uh you can get social support through social media you can reach out to networks of folks and get support through them but unfortunately what we've seen is there's this sort of polarization you know kind of pushing people to like worry more we're seeing a lot of negative impacts on folks i think we really need to as parents we need to just it's we need to control it and so you know they're your children and the devices your children have are your devices too so you know making sure that those devices are you know downstairs at night they're not in the bedroom they're not with that child um you know what we kind of think about bullying like when i was a kid you know bullying was pretty bad but like when you went home it was over i mean the bully didn't follow you home now the bullies follow you home and so you really have to take charge of that device and you know yeah it's your child's but it's yours too and you've got to put some limits on that and i think the other thing is focus on the other parts of life that you know it's not just saying no don't use your uh stay off of social media it's like get outside do things exercise uh you know let's do things with the family let's do things uh together you know or if you are a working parent you're not there you know and it's hard for you to be able to do that church faith-based organizations other humans in your life so you can kind of we need to get more humans in to kind of counterbalance the devices would be the things i would say i do want to add one thing to that congresswoman you're right on the spot you know but being a parent and recognizing that it's a it's an uphill battle and it's not just the children um i'm not going to say any more on that um and so what i do is uh i just try to outsmart the social media i plan camping trips as a matter of fact the day after thanksgiving i'm looking for a hotel in the area where the the antenna strength is very very weak and so i just continue to um plan events around family where you know gosh i did not know that the farm was not going to work in this part of texas and so you know or just like uh you know andy said find activities and things you can do you know when you said bullying i almost thought you said bowling you can't really do much with a cell phone in a bowling alley because your hands got to go into the bowling ball so just find different things that you can do and outsmart the social media because what children and adults really want and what they really need is connection i think that's um it's such a great point i too thought um when andy said bullying the first time and um and so we you know we're thinking alike but but i do think it's important that you know part of what these social networks offer us and we talk about this on our energy and commerce committee um where we have oversight of a lot of these issues is um you people crave connection and you can get a connection through social media but you want to have healthy connections through social media and so how how can parents help their children make healthy connections and how can we continue to have human connections so that they complement each other um instead of having you know only one or or feeling um that you can't get it in those places but i do think that this pandemic has really challenged all of us um and certainly you know whether it's our elderly parents um who we were worried about getting the virus and we're much more isolated or kids who are home and you know doing school from home and not able to see their friends and do all of those just natural things that you do as you're maturing and developing and connecting with other um other people your age and you know becoming who you're going to become i think that those those challenges are really in front of us because of this pandemic and because of the isolation that we've seen in so many different ways and so i think just bringing back that focus to it's important to have human connection it's important to have connections to others and how do we make sure that they're healthy and so i think andy what you were talking about and putting some guardrails on those things to make sure that um there's sort of healthy habits around it and also healthy substance um is really important too and i think those are some huge challenges in front of us that certainly folks in congress are talking about as you said it's there aren't easy answers um but i think it's really important to be paying attention to it because asking the questions and caring about making sure that this is um a healthy place to be is is a huge step in you know just identifying the potential risks and and figuring out strategies like you were saying to avoid them uh we have a question a specific question here from andy i have a family member who has a substance abuse issue and i'm worried about the holidays being a trigger what are some strategies i can think about to create a safe space for him you know i recommend co-planning you know the minute you know um recognizing that there's a problem is the first step in you know mediating that problem and so um i understand if you're being a support to that person of course you have to watch what's on television again go to movies stay away from commercials on netflix or something in your home and then of course make sure the varieties that it's being served you know kind of steers clear of anything that would be tempting i don't know what the addiction is but i will say that um uh whatever the practices that are adopted as a replacement for um some of the old habits or even um the tactics that are uh adopted to divert that person's attention when they get a certain craving or a certain itch to be around a certain group of people or to practice certain um bad habits then it's best to get in partnership with that person and identify for them what is what is going to work and what is not going to work because in your best efforts you could really trigger the person by not picking the right type of intervention i'll add just in the spirit of transparency i'm a person on long-term recovery and so i've got a little bit of insight probably in this deal and i will say that i think angelina's right on having a conversation is a tremendous help right if somebody had diabetes we wouldn't go around and try and figure out how we're going to support them in the background right we'd call them up and say hey what do i need to plan for food like how can i support you if things aren't going well is there some way that you can come to me you know how do we get you to a meeting if you want to go to a 12-step meeting you know what is if things don't go well and you know sometimes holidays are kind of fraught with stress and conflict even at times and so if that happens how can i support you through that how how can i be there for you and i think those transparent open conversations really go a long way related to substance use disorders but as well frankly almost anything right from a mental health perspective from family conflict from managing stress to you know overeating whatever it might be that these stressful events kind of bring on i think having an open dialogue that that voice and willingness and offer of support is pretty impactful to most people right and so them knowing that you're thinking about them and caring about them and and trying to help them come up with plans to be successful through the holidays will probably mean a lot to that person and be really appreciative so i just add that that's the advice that wayne and angelina gave is great we also have a site called oktosay.org put it up we have tips on there on how to have hard conversations with people you basically as a supporter someone who wants to help someone and like wayne said it doesn't matter what you're helping the person with whether it's substance use food it's hard sometimes and so to help you with that i'll put that up and you can kind of check out some of those tips there for how to have those conversations that's great thank you so much and i do think you know it touches on this this issue that yeah i kind of raised at the beginning um but i'm interested i know we've got we're going to wrap up in a few minutes but but sort of having this conversation wayne like you said really to minimize the stigma right to tell people that you're you're there and you care about their success and you want to be a partner in their success also i think it seems like it eliminates some of the stigma and some of the concern that you know people might be thinking something that they're not willing to tell you um you know for folks and i think that it really is important um again to think about this in the same way you would you know as you said think about somebody who has diabetes saying what can i put on the thanksgiving table that's going to be good for you uh what can i do that's helpful to you and so um i don't know if any of y'all can kind of touch on any other um strategies that you think are particularly useful in in addressing some of the stigma around mental health well the to sign up it up actually congresswoman was exactly for that and you know and i think and i think we and i think talking about our own struggles like i have an anxiety disorder i've had anxiety disorder since i was i think since i came out of the womb i mean it took 26 years before i got help with it i think you know being able to speak and openly it's huge i mean it's a really big deal and i think the other thing we can do too is is uh get over some of the myths like i mean i can't you know people and think about really like what wayne was saying think about it like you would with anything else so like you have people say well you know you know my cousin he's talking about suicide should i talk to him like yeah you should talk to them i mean it's like if they said they had like a large growth coming out of their neck i mean would you talk to them you say go to the doctor you would help this i think we just you're not going to make it worse by helping it by talking about it there's no contagion effect to talking to somebody you're not going to get the illness you're not going to make it worse for them take their hand help them go get that help and i think the last thing i would say too is we have to talk about getting better about recovery because you know what was it that helped with cancer you know it was when we got better treatments and we have really good treatments for balance i don't know why we don't talk about i think part of it is we make it so hard to access them we wait so long to get people care so we have to point out that most people the vast majority of people with depression the vast majority of people with anxiety more than half of people with the most severe disorders get better and so i think that's a big thing for giving people the hope to to kind of reach out because if they think they're going to get better then they're going to be more likely to reach out wonderful so we are just coming up um on the end of our time uh almost so i'll do one last question um and then you know feel free to sort of take it from there but uh congresswoman um what do i know what do i do if i know someone who's in a crisis who can i call to help them without endangering them and what are resources i should look to i say number one you got to define the crisis right so our our local account you know harris county city of houston we have a wonderful crisis intervention system if a person is a is in danger of harming themselves or in danger of harming others um of course you can call the harris center that seven one three nine seven o seven thousand number um and there are a number you can call 911 and say this is a mental health crisis and they will do their best to have a special city cit team address that particular call the issue turns though when it's a crisis for you and not a crisis for that system that's that's what you have to prepare for and what we share with our families is it's not if a crisis is going to arise it's when the crisis arise are you are you prepared and so sitting down and just thinking what would you do if you had a christmas party on christmas day and a family walked in and was having auditory over the visual hallucinations what would you do right they're not really a threat to anyone but they're afraid not only are they afraid but you're afraid who are you gonna call where are you gonna go and write down the prescription for your own family for your own team how do i manage this where do i go who do i talk to and i can tell you that was an actual scenario for me it was christmas day and uh i i emailed the entire coalition of behavioral health services and some wonderful people emailed me back and the the organization that i was able to get help on christmas day where i could actually put the family in my member my car and drive was um the council on recovery who knew i'm not saying that's the same in 2021 and 2022 that was several years ago but have some step-by-step process put a plan in place earlier if you need help putting together a plan of course you can call our warm line but you know just remember that a crisis to one is not a crisis to all so whatever your situation have a plan in place on what you're going to do to get active when something presents itself whether it's a family member or a stranger that's great insight thanks angelina wayne or andy yeah i'll just add their angelina reference there are a lot of crisis response options in our community we um we have a broad kind of array of them if it's an immediate kind of life-threatening suicide concerns that sort of thing harming themselves or others 9-1-1 is is often the best first call and there are a lot of really well-trained officers who have been through mental health training and respond with empathy and compassion we do have teams of co-responders where our mental health crisis clinicians are dispatched along in the same car with law enforcement we have virtual response options in some parts of the community where they have tablets and connected our crisis counselors virtually so we can provide crisis assessments we also angelina i appreciated the the little promotion there of the crisis line i dropped it into the chat function as well um that our crisis counselors were there 24 7 they can help provide that response they can also dispatch our mobile crisis outreach team um so we have people who don't have to involve law enforcement they can go out to people's homes when they're in crisis um and begin to provide support there in the community with the goal of helping that person remain in the community if that's possible so there's lots of options i also dropped in the chat line our tech support line some people prefer text as opposed to calling these days right so there's also that option for people to get help if if something is going on and they don't know quite where to turn congressman if i could just add so angelina and wayne covered it i mean the supports they are great but i think the other thing is let's not wait till there's a crisis we wait eight to ten years now before we give people treatment for their symptoms so eight to ten years go by when we could have been doing something and so the kind of supports that you asked us actually to talk about earlier which are some of these uh telesupports it's a great way to make sure we get access to people and i think one that is often under represented but is super useful is audio only you know we're trying to get more broadband to people and we're making great progress and that's another place where you know thank you congress and congresswoman for making more resources available but it's going to take a while and also sometimes i don't know if you all found this but i kind of like it when our videos are off like i kind of like it when it's voice only and so that works really well for a lot of treatment options so whether it's text like wayne was talking about uh tablets uh phone the the the thing you all are doing in the health committee to i mean uh sorry the commerce the your committee i get everybody's food back up you're right health subcommittee on energy ecommerce exactly um is we do need to try to level the playing field there because these things work may not work so well for surgery to do that stuff over the phone but it works super well for mental health that's great well and look that makes that makes a ton of sense um i really appreciate y'all sharing all those numbers and resources and i think what we will do is send a follow-up um with the information that you've put in the chat to the folks who are participating and for the folks who wanted to participate but told us they couldn't participate live who will be able to watch this um in perpetuity we're going to make it available for for people to watch this conversation because as we approach the holidays as we uh process so many of the things that you know many people have just been forging through um over the last 20 months and more um you know people are really appreciative of opening up this conversation opening up this dialogue and um i know that that those who have come to you um understand and know what an incredibly valuable service each of you provides and your organizations provide um but not everybody knows and that's part of our goal is to help get the word out um and so i'm really grateful to you for the opportunity tonight to hear from you um all three of you are so approachable and accessible and thoughtful and i want to stay on zoom for another hour just listening to you talk about um these issues because um it really is it makes it something that uh you want to engage on and that you want to help and i think that that's one of the privileges for all of us um of the jobs that we have that we're here to help people and we want to help people and so um you know as we wrap up i'll i'll turn to you for any closing thoughts but i will just say we'll take the information you shared the phone numbers website links we'll circulate that and um of course while we can't do exactly uh the same things uh my team in my office and i are always here to help as well and so we'll circulate our contact information again for folks that can reach out and sometimes what we can do is legislative help and working on bills or voting for good legislation um and also some things we can do or help people connect with people and organizations in our community that are really going to make a difference in their lives and uh and help connect people with federal agencies that can help you know some of the things that are so incredibly frustrating um are are things that we can actually help with getting through uh to some of these federal agencies getting access to your social security or your medicare benefits so that you can have access to these things accessing your veterans benefits um anything with a federal agency uh i'm i'm always glad and really proud to be able to help our constituents with so we'll circulate all that information to everyone but i would love to turn the floor back to the three of you for for your any closing thoughts you want to share for a minute or two here before we wrap up well i will just close by saying that i don't you know nothing is going to replace education if this is on your radar if this is your issue if mental health is something that you want to be an advocate for you got to get educated and nami can help you do that again we're not a we're not the end all and we're not the only answer to every issue but we have a lot of partners and a lot of resources that we can help undergird whatever your efforts are whether they be you know education supporting volunteering with families and children or or even being an advocate and partnering with you congresswoman we will um help direct you to the right to the right spot thank you for inviting me again thanks so much angelina well it's hard that much what angelina said and i'll let wayne have the last word but i'll just quickly say if you're trying to figure out an answer for something we didn't talk about tonight a good shorthand is pretend like it's a another type of health concern and say what would you do for that like to pretend like the the and i what i've been telling people to do is actually pretend like your brain is actually part of your body and if you do that what would you do what would you do differently but you would go to the doctor you would help the person so i think a lot of times we were hesitant and we know what the right answers are we just for some reason don't want to do them for these disorders so pretend like your brain is in your body that's terrific thank you wayne yeah yeah absolutely and i'm gonna echo something that andy said a couple minutes ago which may be the line of the night for me which is don't wait till there's a crisis right these resources are here um it may take a little bit of legwork to get to them we've tried to make it easy by sharing the information but there are a lot of options to get support and help and don't feel like you've got to struggle through this alone or that you're the only one going through it so if you reach out no matter which which path you take to reach out do so and we'll be happy to help get you connected to supports absolutely wayne that's a great way to close out the evening and i i think that we couldn't have a better example of people who care about and are committed to the people in our community uh than the three of you who are here tonight so i'm grateful for your time and your insights and hope that we will continue this conversation and all the ways we can help address these issues in our community so thank you all so much thank you thank you i'll take care

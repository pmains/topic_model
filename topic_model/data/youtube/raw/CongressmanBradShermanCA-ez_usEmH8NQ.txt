  OUR DEMOCRACY. >> JOINING US NOW IS DEMOCRATIC  CONGRESSMAN BRAD SHERMAN OF  CALIFORNIA. CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. YOU WERE ONE OF THE EARLIEST  SUPPORTERS OF IMPEACHMENT  SIGNING ON TO A RESOLUTION BACK  IN JULY OF 2017. WE'RE IN 2019 NOW. DO YOU FEEL THAT THIS PHONE CALL AND THE ALLEGED DECEIT AROUND IT WILL BE WHAT FINALLY HAS NANCY  PELOSI TO JOIN THOSE OF YOU WHO  THOUGHT IMPEACHMENT WAS THE  RIGHT ANSWER? >> I DIDN'T SIGN ON TO ARTICLES  OF IMPEACHMENT, I WROTE THEM AND SUBMITTED THEM TO CONGRESS IN  JULY OF 2017. I THINK IT IS TIME THAT WE BEGIN AN IMPEACHMENT VERY AND IN FACT  I BELIEVE WE ALREADY HAVE. THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WENT TO  COURT TWO MONTHS AGO AND SAID  WE'RE CONSIDERING THE ARTICLES  OF IMPEACHMENT AND THEY CITED  THE ARTICLES THAT I HAD  SUBMITTED AND SAID FOR THAT  REASON, WE ARE SFWILGTSED TO  CERTAIN INFORMATION FROM GRAND  JURY IN OUR ROLE AS PROSECUTORS. YOU SEE, GRAND JURY INFORMATION  IS USUALLY SECRET EVEN FROM  CONGRESS EXERCISING ITS ROLE OF  OVERSIGHT. BUT WHEN WE'RE IN THE ROLE OF  PROSECUTOR, WHICH WE ARE FOR  IMPEACHMENT MATTERS, WE WHERE  ENTITLED TO THAT INFORMATION AND I HOPE WE GET IT. SO THIS IS JUST THE LATEST HIGH  CRIME AND MISDEMEANOR FROM THIS  PRESIDENT. IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE GET ALL  OF THE INFORMATION LAID OUT  BEFORE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IF  WE'RE GOING TO GET A REASONABLE  HEARING IN THE SENATE. BECAUSE IMPEACHMENT WITHOUT  REMOVAL IS PERHAPS WORSE THAN  NOTHING. IT IS -- IT MEETS OUR  PSYCHOLOGICAL NEEDS BUT DOESN'T  REMOVE A PRESIDENT WHO HAS  COMMITTED HIGH CRIMES AND  MISDEMEANORS. >> AND THIS HAS BEEN YOUR  POSITION SINCE 2017. WHAT SPECIFICALLY IS IT THAT YOU BELIEVE HAS CAUSED THAT NUMBER  TO GO UP IN THE LAST 24 HOURS  WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT LETTER BY  SEVEN FRESHMEN WHO ARE FROM  SWING DISTRICTS, WHO HAVE  NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERTISE,  WHAT SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THIS  INCIDENT HAS BEEN A GAME  CHANGER? >> WELL, FIRST, IT IS HOW MANY  STRAWS ON THE CAMEL'S BACK. IT IS CRIME AFTER CRIME, OUTRAGE AFTER OUTRAGE. BUT THEN WHEN THE PRESIDENT HE  SOLICITS A CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION FROM THE UKRAINE GOVERNMENT AND  DOESN'T JUST SOLICIT IT, BUT  DEMANDS IT AND PAY IT IS WITH  $390 MILLION OF OUR MONEY, THAT  SEEMS TO HAVE CROSSED MANY  LINES. BUT I BELIEVE THAT THE  PRESIDENT'S OBSTRUCTION OF  JUSTICE, HIS VIOLATION OF  SECTION 15 B 3-2 WAS ON THE  RECORD OVER TWO YEARS AGO, THIS  PRESIDENT IS GUILTY OF HIGH  CRIMES AND MISDEMEANOR. THAT BEING SAID, WE DON'T WANT  TO GO TO THE SENATE WITH  ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT TO  REMOVE THIS PRESIDENT UNTIL  WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL GET A FAIR HEARING. AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT, WE HAVE TO EDUCATE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. >> IS LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THAT, CONGRESSMAN. IN THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE, JUST  THIS UKRAINE ISSUE, THERE ARE A  FEW YOU'VE MENTIONED. THERE IS THE POTENTIAL QUID PRO  QUO OF GETTING THE MONEY THAT  CONGRESS HAD AUTHORIZED, YOU  KNOW, IF THEY DIDN'T DID WHAT  THE PRESIDENT ASKED. THERE IS THE IDEA THAT YOU ARE  INVITING A FOREIGN POWER TO  INVOLVE ITSELF IN THE ELECTION,  SOMETHING THAT HAS PRE-OKAY PID  THE AMERICAN MIND. AND THERE IS A REASON THAT  CONGRESS APPROVED THE MONEY TO  UKRAINE BECAUSE IT IS ON THE  FRONT LINES OF A WAR WITHED A  ADVERSARY. AND DO ALL OF THESE STAND OUT TO YOU? IF YOU HAD TO TELL SOMEBODY ON  THE BUS THIS IS THE REASON WHY  THIS ONE IS MOST IMPORTANT, WHAT OFFENDS YOU THE MOST ABOUT THIS? >> WHAT I THINK IS CLEAR,  BECAUSE WE MAY NEVER SHOW THE  EXACT QUID PRO QUO, ALTHOUGH  THERE IS A LOT OF EVIDENCE OF  IT, IS THAT IT IS CLEAR THAT HE  WENT TO THE UKRANIAN GOVERNMENT  AND ASKED THEM FOR A  CONTRIBUTION TO HIS CAMPAIGN. NOT OF CASH, BUT OF SOMETHING  EVEN MORE VALUABLE, SUBSTANTIAL  INVESTIGATORY EFFORTS DESIGNED  TO DISCREDIT HIS OPPONENT. THE FEDERAL ELECTION LAW SAYS  THAT YOU CANNOT SOLICIT EVEN  $100 CONTRIBUTION, EVEN A $5  CONTRIBUTION FROM A FOREIGN  GOVERNMENT OR ANY GOVERNMENT. AND CERTAINLY ANY FOREIGNER. AND SO THE IDEA THAT HE WOULD BE SOLICITING THE AID OF THE  UKRANIAN GOVERNMENT TO HELP HIS  CAMPAIGN BY REVEALING DIRT ON  HIS OPPONENT SEEMS A VERY CLEAR  VIOLATION. OF COURSE I THINK THAT THERE  WERE VERY CLEAR VIOLATIONS IN  THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF THIS  PRESIDENCY WHICH IS WHY I FILED  ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT OVER TWO YEARS AGO. >>

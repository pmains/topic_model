you sent a letter just this morning I'm going to read a little bit here to DHS Homeland Security asking Secretary John Kelly to disclose additional information on the full scope of foreign attempts to interfere in the 2016 elections by hacking into state and local election systems what are the questions you want answered specifically about a state and local election well first of all let me make clear I don't believe the Russians affected any vote totals in 2016 but there been lots of published reports that have said that literally dozens of states they Russia's attempted to hack into so far only two states have come forward Illinois in Arizona and acknowledged the russians hacked into him i'm not trying to embarrass any state but i'd like more information to get out into the public showing how extensive this russian attempt to interfere was not to embarrass the state but to make sure that we're ready for 2018 in my own state of virginia where elections in this year in 2017 to make sure that states are sharing information that they had best practices one thing that the secretary Kelly did do that I strongly commend as he said our election infrastructure is critical infrastructure so we just need more core fishing and to be on guard so based on the information you have senator you believe Russia did hack into state electoral systems but somehow did not affect the vote totals why would I think they did was certain places they attempted to hack in they may have been identified and caught certain places they were just probing the system but what what I've got out of DHS is that DHS feels that states were then in effect victims and it's up to the states to come forward with that information I'm not I don't believe we're made safer by keeping this information in secret I can only say a lot more than to states that have publicly come forward the russians attempt to get in attempted to get into in 2016 and the more we can be aware the better we can prepare for future elections

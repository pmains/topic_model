all right I think we've got pretty much everyone and I want to thank you all for coming to our backyard series and you can see that our mayor has taken it very seriously I'm Lisa mandala and it is my complete honor and pleasure to introduce our mayor or my Nair Shelly Brenda thank you Lisa yeah I heard that your chat so I'm in my backyard you outdo me thank you for introducing me and Thank You congressman for offering to host this with me and thanks to everybody who's tuned in with us tonight you know I have the great pleasure and we all do having congressman Mel now ski represent us in DC and I think many of you hopefully would agree with me that he probably has to be one of the hardest-working Congress persons in DC He is everywhere all the time and not only what we see was doing but he and/or his staff or in constant contact with me and other local elected officials and feeling like he absolutely 100% has the pulse of his district if his into what he does to represent us is any indication from his early support of the Raritan Valley line when she tried initiative which we could talk about and and I honestly know where has his support been more evident than what has transpired over the last several months under the age of Kovac which we'll talk about so with so I'm gonna let congressman kick us off and then I hope that this is just gonna be a really informal chat between the two of us which you know we hope to get lots of folks to chime in with their own questions to think about and talk about things that really matter to you so thank you a common Thank You Shelly and yes actually this is our second conversation of the day the first one was on the 1c tried issue because we got briefed on a study that New Jersey Transit did or had an outside firm do on all the ways in which that would be so so hard for them and so Shelley and I are teaming up and have been teaming up to make it even harder for them to do nothing we can continue to talk about that with with you all today look I'm really glad to you know always happy to have a chance to see you guys I'm glad to be able to do it with the mayor because the buck really does stop with our mayor's as it has with our governor and as it should with our president times like like this every every elected official who runs something a town a state or a country has been making life-or-death decisions these last few months and a crisis like this is a test of their mettle of their commitment of their integrity of their sense of responsibility and we're blessed to have leaders like you shall you can pass that test in the most difficult of circumstances I want to you know I do want to talk about where we are in the course of this crisis we've done a very good job in New Jersey I've said that if the whole country was New Jersey America would define right now relative to where we are of course not a hundred percent fine we'd be on the path to eradicating the disease but of course we're not not every state has been as responsible as we have been and as I'm sure Shelley will remind us given some of the recent news in Westfield the ourselves have been getting a little bit lacks here and there and we need to guard against that very very very vigilant Lee especially given what's happening in other states and the dangers that were still in I I'd love to talk to you about the local finances in Westfield and in other municipalities as you know the the thing I've been fighting for hardest the last couple of months in the federal response to coronavirus since I've pretty much given up on the president taking responsibility has been for us to provide the resources that our governor's our mayor's our County leaders need they take responsibility to deal with this problem and we know that the crisis has placed a lot of pressure on local revenues and therefore on every single thing that our local governments as well as our state government does to touch our lives we are I hope close to the final stages of negotiation on the next Pro no virus bill we've you know informally this the House and Senate leader should should have been talking about end of July as a deadline Mitch McConnell has pretty much acknowledged that we have to do something there was a time when we we took an extra few days to negotiate with him on the cares Act literally an extra few days and every single day the other party put out a message about how I was stalling because we were actually negotiating they've been stalling for two months and they haven't even been negotiating until now but we are close to that point where we have to get something and and I will reassure you that for the House of Representatives not trust me because I constantly check in with our leadership on this our number-one priority is the state and local financing because that's the key to everything else everything we need to get done in fighting this disease is being done right now by our state county and local governments so that's that's number one we passed an infrastructure bill in the house as well so we can we can talk about that as it relates to Gateway and and of course Gateway is ultimately the key to to one see tried reliable once he tried for every single train we still have the policing reform bill which has passed the house and was introduced in a very different version in the Senate that's that's kind of the business of the day for me and I am you know over the next several weeks I'm focused primarily on things that I think we can actually get done not just messages to be sent the things that we can actually get done before the election to help people and then the election itself will determine whether we can do all of the other work that I think all of us agree America needs to see our government doing so with that maybe you know turn it back to you Shelley tell us a little bit about what's happening in Westfield on the coronavirus and what you see is your biggest needs yeah so yeah we've been in the news a little bit the last few days term things I'd rather not be in the news for but it is a cautionary tale I think that we've seen this uptick in cases initially there we were there traced back to for the cases where four people have traveled from out of state and I think it's a reminder to everyone that this 14 day quarantine coming from these hotspot states it's really really important that that gets adhered to and then and then the other cases many are being attributed to attributed to the between the 18 and 24 year old set I know governor Murphy I think he actually mentioned Westfield today but he also reiterated where that age group used to make up 12 percent of the cases they're now making up 22 percent of the cases and here in Westfield you know we had our 14 days 14 days with zero cases and we are all kind of celebrating because that's a bit of a milestone right and literally I think it you know people a little overconfident there's a false sense of security I think both and what's happening in New Jersey and the numbers that were reporting and that married matched up with fourth of July celebrations and graduation parties and and I think it just created this sense of invincibility and we saw it in the numbers and so I think some of the cases were were traced to a very specific party but I think the good news about it is when individual realized they were positive they immediately started texting every person that they knew that had been at the party and so there's been this very concerted effort on behalf of students and these are college students and their parents who have been doing a lot of contact tracing on their own and again you know doing a lot of testing and I hear this is much quite frankly up to I have two college-age daughters who are giving me as much information as I'm able to get from anybody else so I think the good news is I think that they act once they realize that ego crap this is a problem they all acted very responsibly and proactively today we had zero cases I'm not naive to think of this day as zero I think anytime we reopen up I think I always have an expectation that we are gonna see some type of uptick but but I think it was a good lesson it has been for everybody that Eaton's especially for the for that age group that and many of them are asymptomatic or having very mild symptoms but clearly you know they can easily pass it on to someone who is not so fortunate so it's it's it's it's pretty serious and I'm hoping that you know that part is behind it's for the most part but fully expect to see some changes and you know and it's also just really important that people cooperate with their contact tracers because we're hearing in sunny many cases that they're reluctant to share information and so I think people least really understand how critical that is to to getting over this so there's the health public health aspect which is obviously first and foremost most important but then there's the economic aspect and from Westfield I'm sure you're hearing this another municipal so far we're doing okay but that's mainly because our second court of property taxes which were due in May we had the extension until June 1st 50% of our property taxes are paid via escrow and so by the time the pandemic really happened and things shut down much of the escrow had already been collected so when that was paid we actually had we have exceptional collection rates with our second quarter taxes now now that there's an extension on mortgage payments and so forth of 90 days we do not know if there's any escrow being collected right now so we really won't know and then we've already changed our budget to reflect a lot of the reductions in revenues that we've seen right now if this prolongs prolongs a lot further than we anticipate that could be problematic and I think what will really really know how much how problematic is gonna be with the third quarter property tax payment when do you when do you know that well August 1st is the deadline there's a 10-day grace period what we don't know is if we'll be granted the same extension as we were in May to September 1st so by September 1st or by mid-september we will know really what what we're looking at and I think you know it's funny we have like an exceptionally high tax collection rate typically 99% but a drop to even 90 percent can be catastrophic and so so I think that's why I'm the cares act or the heroes act that you've been working on is and for most people may not realize like the cares Act and others they all account for expenses but there's not really help for lost revenues and that really is the majority this wasn't like a natural disaster or like a hurricane where there's suddenly all these immediate hard expenses that are put out right away to you know to deal with that it's just it's the lost revenue so even our cares Act expenses that were sending up through the county honestly this but I mean the county had somewhat like takane testing center and things like that for municipalities perspective i mean yeah we're getting reimbursed for things like you know the new just protective measures we're putting up in town hall and things like that but they're not huge expenses the real real real dramatic is going to be on the revenue side and and that's the real uncertain factor that we're all quite nervous about yeah I mean II can you know everyone where is the heroes at and what do you think the likelihood is a passage of that realistically there's zero chance that we will pass 100% of the heroes Act so the heroes Act is this massive gargantuan bill that we passed in the house three trillion dollars we put everything in there that we thought was needed and the the biggest piece of it and I think most important was the state and local funding it's why we called it the heroes Act because we saw we saw that funding in part as a way to support our first responders who are of course paid by our state and local governments and it went over to the Senate and crickets McConnell just said well you know I don't you said quote I don't feel a sense of urgency they want to see how how things go what's happened since then what's happened since then is that because of the irresponsibility of a lot of these other states where Arizona and Texas Florida and Georgia are seeing cases through the roof and it's just no longer possible to deny the severity of this crisis in those states III think the pressure on McConnell from his caucus is gotten greater you can't you can't say this is a quote coastal state or blue state problem anymore there was that blowed a couple of months ago yeah but no more so you know whatever problems you're facing Shelly you know a similar town in Texas it's gonna be facing exactly the same thing maybe just a little bit later because you know even if they're not formally locking down again and some of them may be formally locking down but even if they aren't it's not like people are gonna be flocking to the bars and restaurants and the stores and the malls in the way that they were two weeks ago or a month ago and and so I think that makes it very very likely that we will pass something that will just be smaller than the heroes Act and there gonna be some tough choices and negotiations one thing I think we'll probably go and and honestly I think actually personally think should go is the extension full extension of the $600 a week unemployment payments I think we need to be more targeted right now back in March we needed to help the entire economy because we were telling the entire economy to shut down we were telling everybody except for essential essential workers to go home and stay home and therefore we need it to be really generous with everybody we're in a much different situation now where different sectors of the economy are moving in different cases and I think we should be much more targeted in helping those like the restaurant industry for example that clearly will be suffering and unfortunately needs to be suffering probably through the end of you know certainly for several more months and I'd rather provide that assistance directly through employers than by just offering very generous unemployment payments to anybody who's ever and that's just me talking the Senate Republicans feels even more strongly that that shouldn't be done so that's a big chunk of the money in the bill there'll be other things the post-office relief package is in there and we'll see if these senators from rural states where you would think people care more about the post office then say you know Millennials from Brooklyn rather they do the right thing there is hazard pay for our real heroes out there and my gosh in you when you think about what our EMTs and our nurses have been through the folks really on the front lines go out call after call after call think about New York more than Westfield here and and every day again and again deal with people who are potentially losing their lives or the loved ones of those who are losing their lives and they're paid thirty eight thousand dollars a year and they're driving an uber night because that's just not enough in this part of the country and like we put our lives in their hands and that's how much we pay them so that's a part of the bill like we owe that to these folks but we'll see bottom line I think we'll get something it will not be everything and number one House priority is the state local and what is talked about specifically in the next Cova bill you guys are thinking you're gonna pass soon well this is it I mean we don't have another you know what's gonna happen honestly is we're in through right now we're in through the end of July in session the Senate is in through the first week of August so probably will be in through the first week of August because a lot of these things will get pushed to the end of that time by way we also have to do the national defense bill which is something that pretty much always passes every year so it's our best opportunity to legislate on foreign policy and national security I have a bunch of pieces of that that I'm working on and oh and by the way the house wants to pass all of our appropriations bills the bills that fund all the different parts of the US government the Senate won't do that I don't think that we want to get that done so that's a lot of work to do between now and the first week of of August almost everything we want to do on coronavirus is in the heroes Act and you know what we've learned in the last two months since we passed the heroes Act we can make adjustments in the negotiations to take it that into account and then there may be you know there may be some smaller things I I mentioned restaurants I I'm co-sponsoring a relief bill that is just for the restaurant industry we'll see what comes out of heroes but depending on that there may be a good argument to go ahead with that bill I've been going around talking to small business owners the last few days just doing a tour and it's brutal its brutal and and you know they're open quote-unquote right but we're not allowing them to be open enough to break even and on top of that whatever we're allowing them to do customers aren't necessarily going to show up try especially in things like in Westfield right people here oh gosh it's back right do you go out to dinner that night so I just think like we got to do some something special for for them otherwise like we're not gonna have restaurants and when this is over or maybe we'll still have McDonald's you know a few national chains but the independent restaurants and cafes and bagel shops and all the stuff that makes LA it's misting in our communities so yeah it's it's brutal and that and I think I don't know I think even even though New Jersey is doing pretty well at the moment I do think just when they take a look around and you see what's happening in other states when the conversations I have the business owners it's almost like this sigh like it's you know just when you think that you're seeing maybe a end zone and sight I think you are jolted back to reality if I see what's happening in other states and what does that mean for us unless we can't build the only wall I want to see built is one around New Jersey at the moment and we just know that it's I think everybody's wondering what impact these other states are going to have on our ability to continue to move forward and that's very discouraging yeah well no discouraging is diplomatic yeah I'm furious I'm serious because look you we are we are running a controlled experiment in this country in on the differences between good and bad leadership good and bad government and unfortunately this experiment is not being run on laboratory mice it's being run on us where we have good governance good leadership we've suffered but we have made progress were recovering and where we have irresponsible leadership and I use that word very precisely it is irresponsible is people who are in a position of responsibility abdicating responsibility that's not my problem is what they're saying and look what's happening and unfortunately there's not you know well fortunately or unfortunately there's not a wall between us and what happens in Texas in Florida can affect us here and I just there has to be a reckoning well yeah yeah I think November is the only reckoning as far as I can tell well that is and that's yeah that's our system that's how it's supposed to work yeah and I think it will work but but gosh you know it's not just mean tweets anymore it's yeah a lot of broken and lost lives and hopefully the lesson of that sticks with us that we need good government we need responsible people not just elected but you know all of the the folks who dedicate their lives working for the Environmental Protection Agency in the Center for Disease Control and the NIH and our law enforcement agency Health and Human Services and all you know that's so-called bureaucrats the politicians love to run against you know damn it I want America to have the best bureaucrats in the world again what do you think oppose that like our public health director you know you may not realize but Wes you know that runs Regional Health Department we support eight municipalities and and it's interesting because our Regional Health Director who's amazing Megan is get some insight into what's happening in a lot of places beyond Westfield and and she says and the the vilification of some public health officials around has just been unbelievable and she certainly has been you know on the receiving end of that and she says it really is just the culmination just such a neglect of our investment in public health over time and we're all seeing the results of that what do you think a post koban world looks like in terms of priorities and and expenditures and and and manufacturing and supply chain like what do you but just curious from where you said are those conversations already happening some of them are some of them are almost too big get our heads around right now the most obvious one is supply chain yeah you know week envision what we saw what went wrong here and it's not hard to figure out how to fix that in fact we already have the structures in-laws many of the ones that we need to deal with this the defense production act we've all heard of in the last few months if only the president used it he actually does have the authority or he did have the authority to command the US economy the private sector economy to produce what we needed to test everybody to equip everybody who needed PPE the masks but there is going to be some legislation done this year on supply chain I I have a bill that is that attempts to fix the national PPE stockpile by requiring an annual public report from the Department of Health and Human Services to the Congress to the public on what is needed in that stockpile to meet the demands of a major global pandemic how much that would cost so it's outside of the normal budget request to Congress but something that we are presented on its own so that we will be under pressure to pay for whatever is needed to get the stockpile to where it needs to be that is being included in the appropriations bill that we will be voting on soon so that will pass the House of Representatives and then there are other stockpile supply chain bills aiming at sort of made made in America provisions ensuring that you know the really critical medical equipment that we have enough production in America so that in a global pandemic we're not competing with other countries for it if you allow the market to do its thing then you could very well have a supplied in which almost everything is made in China for example and then a truck right even if they cared about us right if they're having the same pandemic they're obviously going to apply themselves first so that's the easier part but gosh you know how society changes how does this change what a Biden administration knock on wood will attempt to do on health care on the economy on inequality in our country how much does it change what will be possible politically I don't know but it does feel as if a Biden administration could end up achieving a more ambitious set of goals then an Obama administration was able to achieve even if Vice President Biden himself temperamentally is not he's not a radical reformer but the times may demand more ambitious actions got some questions I think we do Debra she has a question about school opening every guy had you should be on me a dead yeah yeah I look I don't I don't know what you know I can tell you we haven't we have a national government with Trump and Betsy DeVos who think their job is to order the schools to open rather than help the schools to open we need from them is help not a command that they are they are basically trying to create a situation in which parents have to choose between the safety and edgy occasion of their kids it's Jake he's crazy and wrong we all agree every sane person agrees the schools should open like we want them to be open we know it's a lot better for our kids to be in school we know it's a lot better for our parents particularly working parents to have a place to send their children all of that is obvious the question is are we doing enough as a country to make it safe for our kids to go to school in New Jersey again as we've been discussing we've done more than a lot of other places we are actually in a more enviable position to be making this choice if you just take New Jersey we look a little bit more like Germany and Denmark and Holland and the European countries that were hit hard but now have a lower rate of infection and many of them have experimented with different forms of in-person schooling over the last couple of months and we can learn from their experience some of which is still a bit ambiguous about you know can young children be vectors for transmission for example but a lot of the rest of the country they're not even close to where these European countries were when they decided to gradually reopen their schools so look we're gonna have to make this decision school district by school district in New Jersey with a lot of parent input local government input and unless the majority of us the majority of parents and kids and very importantly the adults who work in our schools are comfortable with that decision then it can't be made I'm sure you saw in Westfield they said just gave very general terms that they're looking at some combination of in-person and online and every student will be given a Chromebook and that's as far as they've gotten I've heard a neighboring district are doing like morning and afternoon sessions so but you know it it's so the is so changing so quickly I'm sure you know so but yeah we know this it's not gonna look like a normal school year sure yeah yep and again it's like the the evidences I've been reading a lot about what's been happening in Europe some of it suggests that it it should be safe to reopen if we keep the rate of infection as low as it is right now knock on wood but then you know it then actually we have Israel which has seen a pretty significant spike in infections which they are tracing to schools so we're gonna have to understand this better and and look my philosophy has always been and this is I think rightly our governor's philosophy as well that you you can't make this in either/or between public health and the economy between public health and education because if you don't take care of the public health aspect no matter what the government says people are not going to have confidence in sending their kids to school in going out to eat in going back to work and so we have to get the public health conditions right first so what Charles daughter has been very patient waiting to ask his question he has a question about this is probably mostly to you Shelley and I'll let him ask a Charles are you Spencer CMU did she Charles you're unmuted you can go ahead sure thank you with the spike in cases in town recently my question was what can the town do to enforce the wearing of masks without in public the enforcement of self isolation for those who test positive over people who are Gaston contact with them and any cooperation with tracing if tracers are not getting that cooperation does a town need to get authority from governor Murphy to enforce such things does it have its own authority are they fines it should be imposed we recall that in New York State in early on in this pandemic New Rochelle was basically quarantined because it was such a hot spot very early on we don't want that to happen here obviously and and oh not to ignore congressman Malinowski but if the federal government could provide any enforcement aspect of this to help the towns and the localities and doing this what can the federal government do as well yeah that's a good question and it's a tricky one and I've talked to our police chief about it so regarding the enforcement of the 14 day quarantine you know in absence of something havin no how you identify who is out of the state at all to be able to be in a position to enforce it and and I think governor Murphy you know knowledge as much as that so that's a really really difficult one and on the math I mean we're going to be doing a lot more regarding signage and encouragement but again I mean I like I go crazy when I'm downtown and people aren't wearing masks you know it's uh it's it's ridiculous and regarding like putting up a wall around the site New Rochelle I don't like I think what the governor even said today about the cases I Westfield what we've seen it's I would only be concerned if the spike in cases start growing significantly beyond this 18 to 22 cohort that we're seeing again today there was zero so I think and we're monitoring very closely so if so i right now I'm not thinking that this is going to be a huge spread but we're going to when that starts changing then we might have to revisit other measures but I'm also getting the sense that what's happening in Westfield is no different honestly with it something happening in other parts of the state so you know I just don't know how you can get beyond people acting responsible I really it just blows my mind and some of the Cavalier attitudes toward this it's it's it's really difficult so yeah I don't know our numbers don't show that we're there yet and I don't anticipate that we will be but I think if we start noticing that there is this broadening of community spread in consultation with our regional health director then we'll have to see what other may be more direct enforcement actions could be taken but just you know it's not like Western can do that on our own like we have to get permission from the Union County prosecutor there's a whole process that has to go through we can't just unilaterally say we're gonna do this and and I think if it gets to that point I'm sure governor Murphy and others will be on board is looking at to do something like that more statewide I share your frustration though I just I just can't I just I just some of the things that people say or do or just beyond so well not to add to your frustration but Emily root has a question that's near and dear to my heart so I'm gonna let her ask her question Emily appear I made it you did you can speak I just wanted to know what the update is on the RVL congressman we can chime in on this we've both been briefed on it and it's not you know I would say it's overall pretty disappointing I'm not surprised by that but it felt to me as if the consultants who did it were were focused more on explaining how complicated and in their view expensive it would be to allow for one seat ride in the absence of the new tunnels under the difficult conditions that that creates more more interested in explaining how difficult and expensive would be than in trying to figure out how to make it less difficult and less and so you know we went into a lot of detail with them and basically they looked at a couple of different options the more ambitious option would be to shift some trains lines like the New Jersey coastline and the Northeast Corridor line that are currently 1c tried to shift maybe three of those over to the Raritan Valley line so that we would have some you can't do just one train because then everyone would want to become that one train and less ambitious they looked at adding a couple of trains to what they call the shoulders that would be before 7:00 a.m. on a weekday and trains arriving in New York City 9:30 a.m. and after that which is not quite peak but I think would be helpful for some folks especially if schedules start changing anyway you know because of kovat I think especially the arriving in New York say at 9:36 might actually be attractive for some people who can work out a slightly different kind of schedule so you know unsurprisingly the shifting of trains from other lines they think is the most complicated both practically and politically for some reasons that I understood that I think a real a couple of others that I thought they exaggerated a little bit and then I was most surprised by how they tried to complicate the the shoulder scenario I mean basically there was a point where I mean they actually said it would take 6 to 11 years just to add a couple of trains at 9:30 and I'm like you're basically telling me that adding a couple of choo-choo trains from the Raritan Valley line that aren't even peak you know for a few extra people to get into New York late in the morning will take you as long as the entire gateway tunnel project like come on give me a break and then we kind of dug into the details and we realized they were they were they were they were trying to to to turn into such a big project you know they wanted to lengthen every station they wanted to add trains to every cars to every train they were almost deliberately making it more complicated and it seemed so I pushed them and I know the mayor's and local leaders pushed them to consider additional options particularly for those shoulder hours and that's I think what I'm gonna be focused on in my advocacy in particular and then remember what we really need the the only true solution to this problem is the new tunnel it is the gateway project because until then the capacity is limited and it's a zero-sum game where everything you add you have to take from somebody else it was not all I mean I agree with his assessment that it was overly complicated and intentional so this is just essentially take away isn't worth the effort enjoy gateway with Bill however I do think what was helpful about the study at all is that in all of our conversations with them are the the data has been very hypothetical and theoretical and so we are operating from well can't you do this and can't do this it's almost I look at it as an opening point in a negotiation where you kind of start at the extreme for us to get to someplace in the middle so as I wasn't surprised by what they did but the fact that they did it at all there's a good thing and and I think it's just going to take a ton of pressure from local leaders our congressman and and governor Murphy to kind of direct it to happen and I think at the shoulder to show that the additional shoulder trains what they call them I think would be the most immediate and most helpful I think that's right and we will seize every opportunity we can and I think you know there are some opportunities here because we now have a lot more information about what goes into this and meanwhile we keep plugging away and Gateway you guys know we got the portal bridge that was honestly my main transportation goal for my first term and I feel you know there's a sense of accomplishment there that's gonna start going up and even without a tunnel you know that bridge that ancient bridge is itself a source of delay a significant one for for transit so we will get some relief with a new portal bridge even before the new tunnel is ready to go okay thank you we have a question from Violetta Watson she's a question about the upcoming election and election security hi Dylan hi I'm wondering what Congress is doing to ensure that our elections happen it's protected and happens and nationwide and not just in New Jersey and that absentee ballots are available or mail-in ballots well this is a very low bar but it'll happen you can assure you of that I have occasionally heard fears that somehow the president can postpone the election or prevent it from happening and well no he can't and whoever wins that election whoever has a majority of the electoral college will be sworn in as the new president on January 20th in terms of voter suppression ensuring that everybody has the opportunity to vote from home in states where that may be the only safe way to vote unfortunately the House of Representatives cannot guarantee those things alone because we're just the house and unless we have the Senate and a president willing to sign legislation on election security we can't do it alone we've tried we've passed bill after Bill after Bill the beginning with the first bill we introduced when we were elected and sworn in last year HR 1 which was an election integrity election security election of honesty though and since then we passed a lot of others including bills I've introduced on foreign interference in our elections and now in the coronavirus crisis we have in the House passed legislation requiring all states to allow the kind of vote-by-mail that we just did in New Jersey but mcconnell has explicitly said no not a chance we should be very angry about that so what can we do well we've provided money to those states willing to spend money to secure their elections from all kinds of threats including the coronavirus and i think the majority of states including many with republican leadership are going to want to do that so that's good the second thing we can do and I hope will do is to hold hearings on all of the different ways in which a president seeking to discredit the November election might try to do that I think sunlight is good disinfectant and the more we talk about these things in advance the more we get the Republicans in the House and Senate to you know mock us and these hearings by saying how dare you suggest that the president would ever consider doing that sort of thing it's ridiculous it's paranoid the more they say that the better right because they're by saying that they're reinforcing that this would be bad if that kind of stuff happened that's something we can do and I've been I've been urging it and I know a lot of other folks have been talking to Speaker Pelosi and our leadership about about that and then the rest is up to us because the best antidote to voter suppression is voters voting we saw in Wisconsin and in Georgia more recently really maddening efforts to suppress the vote by putting voters in that position where they have to go to someplace that's not safe and it didn't work because we had higher turnout in those primaries than any time in recent memory despite all those efforts and so that comes back to to us not just as voters but as people who will help to turn out the vote in in November that's ultimately the way we beat this David Owens had a question about helping restaurants I know Tom you talked about a little bit more but the elaborate go ahead David David are you like I'm not sure there's any uniformity among the towns in this area about the rules for safe operation under the for restaurants and other establishments I mentioned in my comment online that we have a friend who recently went to a restaurant in a neighboring town and the waiter wasn't wearing a face mask and our friend who happens to be a physician said he was uncomfortable with waiter not wearing the face mask and the wear was upset and rude and said his municipality didn't require them to wear a face mask so I'm wondering Shelley in particular in do you know coordinate with the other mayor's about these rules for reopening isn't that a state rule by the way that's an executive order by the governor that's well I mean it's a role that was that was my understanding but yes this person was told that that municipality didn't require face masks for restaurant employees maybe that's what that restaurant employee was telling you he was told but there is absolutely an executive order and what I would have suggested and because I get notes from this from people all the time if they find someone you should send a note to their that municipality and let them know yet what they have it you know and so our we're lucky to have a special Improvement District with you to the downtown Westland Corporation and I forward all of those and he's doing like spot checks in restaurants all the time and definitely if we ever get notice of one he's letting the owners know and generally quite frankly it's a it's it's a it's a server maybe a new server that didn't know better didn't know but that's you when you go out anywhere absolutely should expect your servers to be wearing facemasks it's the law that's what I've got yeah yes thank you we have time for one more question and I do apologize for those if you folks who have put questions in those chat we haven't been able to get to you but we will hopefully be doing more of these so please come in join us and can reach out to us as well and we'll try to get answer questions answered Roz Harrison had a question about about the environment so Roz if you're unmute you and you can ask your question eerily and I'd meet yourself I'm trying to meet as we're waiting for Ellen to unmute herself there is going if you look in the chat there's going to be a upcoming phonebank and you can sign up to help with that by going to Tom Malinowski for New Jersey his website and they're being done virtually and sort of in a chat they're trying to make it as much fun as possible so please if you have some time sign up to do those all right guys you ready I did it Oh what I am concerned about is that this administration is doing so many things to destroy our air and our water and our our soil and our ground I mean there it's really dangerous I mean this latest thing that I just read in The Times all of the fracking facilities that are closing with all of the the methane that is being released and nothing is being done about it it's extremely dangerous and they're doing that as you know congressman with with so many things my question is is there anything Congress can do between now and January the 20th to protect us from this kind of disaster you know I'm again I'm I'm afraid that there well there are some things we can do but the house alone in just the next few months it is not going to be able for example to cancel the rollback of an environmental regulation by this administration because well we can't do that unless the Senate goes along and we have a veto-proof majority when the president vetoes whatever we've done and so you know in the next few months that's not in the cards we can you know we're at our are we have the greatest leverage when we are passing appropriations bills spending those because those are huge pieces of legislation that fund the government and in the end the president has to accept what we have done or see the government shutdown and even there when he did that once in the end he had to accept what what we did but that's for next year that's hopefully very Biden administration whatever we put in the appropriations bills that we're passing right now will only have effect in the next fiscal year so you know that that again is the reality that we're operating under we can and we have continued to provide robust funding for the federal agencies they force our environmental regulations and but we still have a lot of very powerful environmental regulations laws on the books and we have prevented Trump from completely gutting the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Interior and NOAA and and all of the others in the government who we rely on to actually be able to enforce these rules they will be there for a Biden administration because of the work that the house has done in resisting these cutbacks but the rollbacks that requires legislation which ultimately the president has to sign and we can't we just can't do that with having a veto-proof majority I would say the the silver lining here is that while you know it doesn't take a long time for the Trump administration to tear up an environmental regulation it still does take some time for the effects of that to be felt by people by the environment if we have a new president next January with the Congress that we can help elect in this district I think the actual harm to the environment will not be catastrophic because it takes more than four years or in the case of some of these new rules one year two years to be able to have that effect and will we'll be able to you know basically undo everything the Trump has done and I would say I also hopefully write the laws in an even more tight way so that the future Donald Trump can't pull off what this one has tried to do in his first term so I'm optimistic we can do this so long has been in November otherwise he's got years that's scary yeah thank you so much Thank You mayor Thank You congressman thank you everyone for joining us I hope that you enjoyed this and stay tuned for more events that we're gonna be having like this and also sign up to volunteer wherever you can and be well and enjoy your summer and wear your mask yes thank you or Wednesday well

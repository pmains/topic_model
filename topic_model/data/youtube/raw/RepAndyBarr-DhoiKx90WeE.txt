a lexington family whose toddler daughter has a rare congenital anomaly reached out for help in an email that help showed up today at their door and will now extend all the way to washington d.c soon-to-be three-year-old tanner schlernitzauer is a typical toddler in so many ways playful smart funny full of energy but she has something that isn't typical she has a rare form of ectodermal dysplasia called aec for short that affects the development of her skin hair nails and teeth she has a limited ability to sweat that can result in fevers and seizures her skin so fragile she lives with constant painful open sores her parents daniel a sergeant with the jessamine county sheriff's office and katherine a special education teacher at henry clay high school knew she would be born with a cleft lip and palate but had no idea what was to come until her birth i remember the tension in the room nobody wanted to touch my newborn daughter she looked like a burn victim when she was born this is a strong family with great support including from tanner's older five-year-old brother blaine but they're also human and there have been dark moments i remember walking this house in the dark just not understanding why she was alive because it was so unfair like why i mean she was in so much pain the the amount of pain this child has been through part of that pain has been the brittle misshapen teeth that decay because of a lack of enamel teeth that are essential for chewing digestion speech development health insurance companies routinely deny or delay claims for oral or dental procedures calling them elective or cosmetic out of pocket dental costs alone can total near half a million dollars the family took on extra jobs to try to keep up with the crippling medical debt then one day catherine did something she'd never done before wrote her congressman republican andy barr of lexington telling tanner's story in an email and asking him to support and push the ensuring lasting smiles act legislation that would require private health insurance plans to cover diagnosis and treatment for congenital anomalies and birth defects of the thousands of emails barr's office receives from constituents catherine's stood out and caught the congressman's attention i was just so inspired by the love and the courage and the strength and then the positive spirit of these parents fighting for their daughter congressman barr was so moved he came to the family's home on monday and vowed to push the legislation that has bipartisan support and is backed by a broad coalition of dental and medical groups that support means the world to this family it was such a weight off of our shoulders because it felt like it was us versus the world and then now it's like this this team has gotten bigger congressman barr brings a different approach to his job and life which changed forever nearly a year ago after the sudden death of his wife to cardiac arrest my personal experience losing carol to heart disease it can't help but make you a more empathetic person not not just a lawmaker but just as a human being that's why the congressman calls backing this legislation and helping this family a no-brainer and for the schlernitz hours what many see as a burden caring for their daughter they see as a blessing this is such a blessing and so cool i've found my real purpose and it's to be a mom are you amazing yes you are yes you are yes she is congressman barr optimistic at the ensuring lasting smiles act will pass this session and we'll be tracking

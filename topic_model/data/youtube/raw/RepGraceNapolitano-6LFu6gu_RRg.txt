GDP over the next decade it is no wonder employers and corporate America are demanding a solution the economic case for passing the DREAM Act is strong it's not just the right thing to do for our economy though it is the right thing to do period HR 34 40 the DREAM Act builds on these great successes and honors our history and our heritage as we are a proud nation of immigrants from all over the world after poll after poll reflects overwhelming support for allowing the dreamers to remain permanently in the United States nearly eight out of ten voters including almost three-quarters of Trump voters agree on these only 14 percent believe they should be forced to leave the faith community is also imploring Congress to do the right thing compassionate and just just this morning I met with the Archdiocese of Los Angeles who said this is about human dignity and how we treat people they understand the weight of our inaction and indecisiveness and Excite V and hopelessness continue to grow as the president dinners we are now less than one month away from the end of the six-month delay period set by the president Trump to fix the mess he created no more delaying no more inaction dreamers kept their promise to the only nation they know and they love our governments must honor its commitment to protect them and their families mr. speaker this is a 20th time we have asked for vote on the clean DREAM Act we're asking all we are asking for is a vote give us a vote so we can give young immigrants their families their employers their teachers at coworkers and friends some certainty and peace of mind I ask my colleagues to vote against the previous question so that we can immediately bring dreamers and the DREAM Act to the floor and finally do what is right for our young people and for our country sir I yield back

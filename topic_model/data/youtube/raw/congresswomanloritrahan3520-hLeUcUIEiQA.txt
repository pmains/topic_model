Madam speaker in every state where abortion rights were on the ballot last year Americans voted to protect life-saving reproductive care in Republican strongholds like Kentucky and Montana voters rejected attempts to restrict or ban abortion in Vermont Michigan and California voters codified abortion rights into their state constitutions after such a resounding defeat for anti-abortion politicians you would think that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would have gotten the message but rather than listening to voters and bringing forward legislation to codify the Reproductive Rights our mothers and our grandmothers fought so hard for the new Republican majority is catering to demands of extreme members in their conference who have called for a National Abortion ban the partisan bills on the floor today will do nothing to protect women instead they'll undermine access to reproductive care that millions of women rely on Madam speaker the women we represent deserve better our daughters deserve better I urge my colleagues to oppose these pieces of legislation and I yield back

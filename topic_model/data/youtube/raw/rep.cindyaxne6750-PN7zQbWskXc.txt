axne for five minutes thank you chairman delgado and as we work on solutions to address the climate crisis it's absolutely imperative that we utilize the tools that we have in rural america and we take full advantage of the opportunities there to not just support our climate but of course our farmers so thank you for holding this hearing today and then of course one of our best solutions we have is the use of biofuels and in our transportation sector biofuels of course support good paying jobs in our rural communities it's a robust market for our farmers and of course address climate issues that we're facing so i'm thrilled to see that in the build back better act my bill the one that provides for a billion dollars towards the expansion of infrastructure for biofuels across this country uh will help uh not just iowans but americans so miss score my question uh first is to you and thank you so much for being here and lending your expertise to the committee as congress debates the build back better act this week what kind of benefits can we expect from the billion dollar investment in biofuels infrastructure within the bill itself congresswoman thank you so much for all of your work to make sure that that infrastructure funding is included in the buildback better act as you well know this would be the largest investment in higher blend infrastructure we have seen to date it really would unleash the power of biofuels it gives us the ability to work with our retail partners to accelerate the market inclusion of e15 which is a lower cost lower carbon higher value fuel choice for consumers so this is an unprecedented wonderful opportunity for biofuels it's great for american drivers and it's certainly great for the rural economy thank you for that and i'm looking forward to build back better act getting put into law and i sure hope that all my colleagues that are here today vote for it because it's a billion dollars in biofuels uh that we're talking about directly here of course another top priority for me is making sure that we get e15 year round we just talked about that a little bit and as you know uh earlier this year a court case struck down the epa's authority that had a loud year-round e15 very thankful for my colleague angie craig and her legislation to fix this issue to make clear that the epa has the authority that's legislation that i helped introduce and once again we talked a little bit about uncertainty earlier on in the previous question ms score but if we don't address this issue of epa year-round and pass our legislation to allow year-round e-15 how is that going to impact sales and the market opportunities for farmers well i appreciate the question and again thank you for your support for year round e15 we agree this is a misguided court decision and unfortunately next summer e15 has sold across 30 states 85 of those retail locations will not be able to offer for three and a half months next year their consumers a lower cost higher value fuel e15 averages about five to ten cents per gallon less than eighty than standard 87 fuel it's a higher octane it's cleaner burning it's better for the pocketbook so this is something that we've got to rectify we appreciate your support absolutely we cannot realize the full potential of low carbon renewable fuels without year-round access to e15 well thank you and those are some sobering numbers that we all need to be keeping in mind here um i'm also you know absolutely concerned that reduction of these e15 goals would impact our climate goals you know they run in tandem earlier this year a harvard study concluded that corn ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 50 percent compared to gasoline all while being produced of course by our great farmers and communities across this country who support those economies so my last question to you ms score is as we look for ways to decarbonize how can we utilize biofuels both domestically and internationally to take full advantage of carbon benefits there are so many ways that we can better utilize biofuels and as you said we cut carbon emissions in half relative to gasoline today and with technologies that are available today we can become as an industry net zero in terms of our carbon emissions we need strong policy signals to show that there is a marketplace and a growth opportunity we need a strong renewable fuel standard that blends 15 billion gallons of biofuel of corn ethanol every year into our fuel supply we need year-round access to e15 we need infrastructure investments in terms of to allow for higher blends to be sold in 50 states across the nation and importantly as the discussion in our carbon focused world continues we need to make sure that the carbon modeling and the measuring stick is fair it reflects up-to-date science and it accurately accounts for all of the innovation taking place at the plants and on the farms well you summed it up so well uh we've got eight seconds left here but thank you so much and i want to continue to work with all of my colleagues here as we advance biofuels across the country to help our farmers and address climate appreciate it

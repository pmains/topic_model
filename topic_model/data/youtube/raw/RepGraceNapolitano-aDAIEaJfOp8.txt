or laughs and I do look forward to working together on water issues mr. chairman this is my first hearing at the water resources as ranking member and thank you for your efforts in welcoming me to the subcommittee and for your offer to work collaboratively with our side of the aisle on some issues including those related to infrastructure investment and implementation of water well I do not expect that we will always agree and I say that laughingly I do look forward to building a strong and transparent working relationship with you and all of the members of this subcommittee the American people want us to continue the bipartisan traditions of the subcommittee to accomplish tasks that our constituents have sent us here to do to address the water resources challenges facing our nation one of the greatest challenges facing today is crumbling infrastructure and over the years we've spoken to listen to countless mayor city and county officials stakeholders on the issues to discuss what a related challenges in all of our communities and about the lack of attention or the lack of progress if you will in addressing these challenges unfortunately much of the lack of progress can be traced to the slow and steady decline in federal investment to critical water related infrastructure which is a good segue to today's hearing on Environmental Protection Agency's 2016 budget request very few federal agencies are as praised or as vilified as EPA depends on which side of the fence you're on depending on your point of view this agency which created by a Republican administration in charge by Congress with safeguarding the health of the public and of the environment is often portrayed as the last safeguard of our natural environment or as an overzealous impediment to unfettered industrial growth well okay I'll go with industrial within versus the industrial growth with us our people and our environment I would tell you where I come from I suppose a reality somewhere in the middle where this agency makes a concerted effort in reaching a sustainable balance between the health of the public the health of the environment and the health of the economy while working with Congress to be effective entertaining these mutual goals we must agree on the need to balance healthy economic growth while protecting the health of the public end of the environment for generations to come in my own district the health of our communities and our economies is integrally tied to the health and availability of the natural resources specifically the available availability of clean safe drinking water unfortunately ensuring this careful balance will all but be impossible if EPA must face budgetary cuts called for in the recent House Republican budget resolutions back in 2011 Congress approved budget control act that drastically underfunded the discretionary budget authority of the federal government including EPA I voted against the Budget Control Act because of its devastating cuts to both mandatory and discretionary programs relied upon by our nation's seniors our cities our communities and by our constituency yet last year the House Republican majority voted to approve a budget which calls for even greater cuts to these programs jeopardizing our nation's economic recovery attacking our nation's efforts to promote a global economy and undermining efforts to create additional good-paying jobs in the US according to the summary of the budget from 2016 with this house majority is urging a drastic reduction in non-defense discretionary spending over the next ten years cut by 1.3 trillion or twenty-four percent below the amount just to keep pace with the inflation in fiscal 20-24 alone the house budget would be thirty percent below the amount necessary simply to keep pace with a fiscal year 2014 spending budget let's not forget these cuts come at a time when we should increase investment in our crumbling infrastructure for example to according to UPS most recent assessment our state's need approximately 300 billion with a B for wastewater and stormwater systems over the next 20 years without question such a draconian proposal would have a devastating impact on our agency's ability carrot statutory obligations as witnesses later will testify they just sorry / had to prioritize how to spend as reclining resources and has had to make tough choices and not funding programs and policies that are important to our business to our industries to our communities into our nation if cuts call for in the Budget Control Act are allowed to continue or worse to deepen as proposed in this budget there will be consequences in the ability vp8 image is statutory obligations causing unintended and possibly intended consequences if the cuts are cough 1 2015 Republican budget are implemented it will impair EPS ability to respond to industrial spills and other contamination outbreaks that threaten local drinking water such as recently occurred in North Carolina and Indiana and Ohio in Montana and West Virginia it's up to the taxpayer to bear the cost of the cleanup in all of these instances officials will provide critical expertise to minimize the extent of the contamination and to restore local drinking water supplies as quickly as possible similarly this subcommittee has heard testimony of a number of businesses and industries that rely on federal regulatory agencies for Clean Water Act permits in their concern with the complexity and delays in obtaining these permits however under the budget recommended by the House Majority both the regulatory office of the core and permits division of EPA would face potential significant budget cuts result would be it would take longer to recover funded staff further of these discretionary spending cuts are implemented uniformly we would expect continued cuts to other programs widespread sub with widespread support for our communities such as the clean water and drinking water state revolving funds the Superfund cleanup the brownfields remediation and and we can go on and on and I just like to say that I've heard others say that cutting the EPA but you will not have an adverse impact on the environment because decreases in federal protection of the environment will be more than made up by the states I got news for you to the best of my knowledge not the case states are asking for more support because of the serious budget cuts they face less Congress Gao identified several states where custody federal environmental grant programs will result in reductions of state environmental staffing cutting less critical programs and increasing state fees the list goes on in conclusion if members are planning to question this administration's commitment to addressing the environmental challenges facing our nation perhaps we first should look in the mirror and ask whether this Congress is meeting our commitment to the environmental to our business in terms of providing critical resources necessary for its protection for the sustain health of our populations and of our future economies in short I believe the answer is no and I fear that we will soon see the consequences of a lack of physical foresight through continued crumbling water infrastructure declining environmental quality and worse still handling handing our children are great grandchildren and their progeny a world of a less on a less environmental and sustainable path then we have inherited so thank you mr. chairman and I look forward to this hearing thank you and I also look forward to working with you in the full subcommittee and the implementation of wardha we're going to have some hearings

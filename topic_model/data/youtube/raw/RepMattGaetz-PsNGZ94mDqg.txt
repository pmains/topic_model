matt gates along with devin nunes and a bunch of others you guys put a lot on the line you got a lot right everything we told the american people is true your reaction to vindication now devin nunes is a patriot and i'm glad you went through trey gowdy's exquisite questions in 2017 to these corrupt officials i guess my question sean would be why was it then in may late may of 2018 that trey gowdy went on martha mccallum's show and said that the fbi did exactly what all of our fellow americans would have wanted them to do and that it had nothing to do with donald trump both of those things have now been proven to be not true and it seems that gowdy's brilliant lawyering back in 2017 that we're only able to see now proves those two statements untrue the number one question i get asked from americans is why no one has gone to jail and been held accountable unfortunately when nunes and meadows and jordan and i wanted subpoena power it was paul ryan and trey gowdy that wouldn't give us that subpoena power democrats sent out hundreds of subpoenas when we had control and could have run this to ground 2017 we didn't send out a single subpoena not one and that's a failure of our republican leadership should have sent them out but i will say to all three of you thank you for taking a lot of heat all three of you and you are all right this program was right the mob was wrong thank you all

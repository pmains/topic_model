listen to my final comment mr. program mr. chairman that we also have to weigh in here the public's absolute need to know they're wondering what's going on they're wondering what type of activities we see this pattern that without confirmation or denial appears that the president not once not twice but we will hear from director Comey tomorrow this pattern where the president seems to want to interfere downplay or halt the ongoing investigation not only the Justice Department is taking on but this committee is taking on and I hope as we move forward on this you'll realize the importance that the American public deserves to get the answers to these questions Thank You mr. pole-sitter I would like to respond to that if I could first of all I'm always I had told you when I committed to the committee that I would be available to testify before the committee I don't think this is the appropriate venue to do this in given that this is an open hearing and a lot of confidential information relative to intelligence or other matters I just don't feel it's appropriate for me to do that in this situation and then secondly when I was asked yesterday to respond to a piece that I was told was going to be written and printed in the Washington Post this morning my response to that was in my time of service which is interacting with the President of the United States or anybody in his administration I have never been pressured I have never felt pressure to intervene or interfere in any way and shape with shaping intelligence in a political way or in relations all I'm not wearing a vest again I'd say director coats is there was a chance here to lay to rest some of these Press reports if the president is asking you to intervene or downplay you may have felt pressure but if he is even asking to me that is a very relevant piece of information and again at least in terms of the conversation Admiral Rogers I think we will get at least some another individuals version but at some point these facts have to come out Thank You mr. chairman

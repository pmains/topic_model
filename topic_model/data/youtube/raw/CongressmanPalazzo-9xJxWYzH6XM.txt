Thank You mr. chairman I want to echo the words of Miss Edwards the ranking member of the space subcommittee this truly is a bipartisan agreement we can all be proud of the great work of the subcommittee and full committee has done to be inclusive of members on both sides of the aisle the managers amendment before us today includes those outstanding items that were unresolved prior to the subcommittee markup three weeks ago since that time chairman Smith and I have been working with the ranking members to come to an agreement on what additional provisions could be compiled into the manager's amendment in compiling this amendment we were very careful to ensure that the spirit of the bipartisan subcommittee bill was not compromised the various provisions contained in the manager's amendment were meticulously discussed before they were included in our agreement the managers amendment continues to build on the subcommittee's work to provide for a human exploration roadmap NASA's put for several items proposed as a roadmap in fact I believe NASA is holding an open forum today describing NASA's human exploration path to Mars unfortunately many questions remain unanswered regarding NASA's way forward for deep space exploration as of today nASA has not provided the specific set of capabilities and technologies required to support a manned mission to Mars nor have they identified the mission sets necessary to demonstrate the proficiency of these capabilities Congress is still waiting to hear how NASA would stage intermediate destinations Mars mission risk areas and potential risk mitigation approaches additionally nASA has not described the process for evolving the fully integrated Orion crew capsule with the Space Launch System and finally there is currently no framework for international cooperation or the potential risk posed by relying on international partners for items on the critical path of development in short for all of NASA's rhetoric about a roadmap to date we've seen very little substance to back it up this amendment includes important language on the development of next-generation liquid rocket engines this provision will ensure that any next-generation liquid rocket engine developed for national security purposes takes into consideration the objectives of the civil space program as much as possible the United States already has a diverse portfolio of engines that reduce risk and access to space this language will provide for greater coordination on any new development so that it will meet both national security and civil space needs while the base bill includes a section on relief from New onerous termination liability requirements this amendment includes a provision to ensure timely notification to Congress should the administration plan to cancel a program covered by the bill the relief from termination liability costs will allow hundreds of millions of dollars to be freed up from bureaucracy and applied directly to program development word orbital debris is continues to pose serious risk to the operational space capabilities of the United States and the NASA Authorization Act of 2010 Congress directed the administration to coordinate with countries within the interagency space debris Coordination Committee to mitigate the effects and growth of orbital debris however the status of this coordination is unknown the managers amendment requires NASA to produce a report on these coordination efforts and a strategy to mitigate orbital debris the roads of this agreement was not easy and we still have work to do before a final product is done with the Senate we are well on our way there are most certainly things from both sides that did not make it into this amendment I know that I would have preferred a little bit more direction in the expiration sections and more oversight of the progress of SLS Ryan development to make sure the administration is on track and with that I would like to once again for the third time thank chairman Smith miss Edwards and miss Johnson for their efforts and pulling together this agreement as well as all of our staff who labored over this hill Megan Mitchell who has faithfully advised me throughout the process Rebecca rounds legal extern on space subcommittee staff Tom Hammond Jared stout Alison Rosen arson and Nelson on this Edward staff and minority staffers Pam Whitney and Alan Lee I look forward to continuing our work to pass this bill in the House floor and I'm proud that we were able to put our names on a bipartisan bill for the sake of our nation's space program national pride and our national security Thank You mr. chairman I yield back and thank you mr. pallazzo let me make an offer to the members

OF HIS TIME. THE GENTLEMAN FROM CALIFORNIA IS RECOGNIZED.  MR. SHERMAN: I RISE IN SUPPORT   OF THIS MEASURE AND I YIELD  MYSELF SUCH TIME AS I MAY  CONSUME. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED. MR. SHERMAN: I RISE IN SUPPORT   OF H.R. 3542, THE HAMAS HUMAN  SHIELDS PREVENTION ACT.  THIS IS AN ACT THAT CAME BEFORE  OUR COMMITTEE AND WAS ADOPTED BY VOICE VOTE UNANIMOUSLY.  I WAS THERE. MY HEARING HAS BEEN TESTED   RECENTLY AND THERE WAS NOT ONE   DISSENTING VOICE.  I WANT TO THANK THE  REPRESENTATIVE WILSON AND  REPRESENTATIVE MOULTON FOR   AUTHORING THE HAMAS HUMAN  SHIELDS PREVENTION ACT AND I'M   PROUD TO BE A CO-SPONSOR.  THIS CALLS OUT THE HAMAS AND   SANCTIONS ANYONE WHO SUPPORTS OR TAKES PART IN THIS HORRIFIC  PRACTICE.  LET US BE PERFECTLY CLEAR ABOUT  WHAT'S AT STAKE. THERE ARE DESIGNATED TERRORIST   ENTITIES USING INNOCENT  CIVILIANS EVEN INNOCENT CHILDREN AS A MEANS TO CAMOFLAUGE THEIR   AR SENDINGALS AND EVERY TIME   HAMAS DOES IT AND ISLAMIC JIHAD, THE LEADERSHIP IS MAKING A   HORRIFIC STATEMENT AND PUT A   HIGHER VALUE TO KILL ISRAELI   CIVILIANS THAN THEY DO ON THE  LIVES OF GAZA CIVILIANS. KEEP IN MIND, THIS PRACTICE IS A VIOLATION OF THE GEEF  CONVENTIONS ON THE RULES AND   LAWS OF WAR. IT IS A WAR CRIME. AND SHOULD, INDEED, BE   SANCTIONED BY THE UNITED   NATIONS. FIRST AND FOREMOST, THIS IS AN   ISSUE OF BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS. HAMAS HAS FORCED CIVILIANS TO  GATHER ON THE ROOFS OF THEIR   HOMES SO THEY CAN HIDE TERRORIST MILITARY LEADERS AND HIDE  WEAPONS BELOW. HAMAS HAS EVEN BUILT THEIR   TUNNELS THAT THEY USE TO MOVE  WEAPONS AND FIGHTERS RIGHT UNDER CIVILIAN INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS PUTS HOSPITALS, SCHOOLS,  MOSQUES AND MARKETS AND INNOCENT PLINGS AT GREAT RISK.  AND IT DOESN'T STOP THERE. HAMAS PURPOSELY PUTS ROCKETS IN  U.N. FACILITIES COMPELLING THE   U.N. TO LAUNCH DAILY INSPECTIONS OF EACH OF THEIR FACILITIES  DURING TIMES OF HEIGHTENED   TENSION AND PUTTING  INTERNATIONAL PERSONNEL IN   HARM'S WAY.  HAMAS USE OF HUMAN SHIELDS   RAISES IMPORTANT NATIONAL  SECURITY CONCERNS FOR ISRAEL,  BECAUSE UNLIKE THESE PALESTINIAN TERRORIST GROUPS, GROUPS THAT  SEEK TO KILL AS MANY ISRAELI   CIVILIANS AS POSSIBLE, IN  CONTRAST WITH THAT, THE ISRAELI  DEFENSE FORCES ARE NOT BLIND AND NOT BE BLIND TO A PLIGHT OF  INNOCENT CIVILIANS.  THAT'S WHY THE ISRAELI   GOVERNMENT HAS TRIED TO WARN   PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS OF   UPCOMING STRIKES, INCLUDING  EVACUATION NOTICE, TEXT MESSAGES AND CALLS AND EVEN LOW EXPLOSIVE WARNING KNOCKS.  THESE WARNINGS JUST DON'T GIVE   INNOCENT CIVILIANS THE   OPPORTUNITY TO EVACUATE. THEY PUT THE TERRORISTS ON   NOTICE THAT A STRIKE IS IMIN THE EVENT, GIVING THEM AN  OPPORTUNITY TO STRIKE. THEY HAVE MADE AN EXPLICIT   DECISION.  THEY CARE ENOUGH ABOUT WARNING   AND SAVING THE LIVES OF  PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS THAT THEY  ARE WILLING TO GIVE AN ADVANTAGE TO TERRORIST GROUPS, GROUPS THAT ARE TRYING TO KILL AS MANY   ISRAELI CIVILIANS AS THEY  POSSIBLY CAN.  THE CONTRAST, THEREFORE, IS  ASTOUNDING.  WHILE ISRAEL HAS MADE BOLD   INVESTMENTS IN EARLY MORNING   APPS ON ISRAELI PHONES AND   DEVELOPED THE IRON DOME TO   PROTECT IS ISRAELI CIVILIANS,  HAMAS MAKES NO EFFORT TO PROTECT GAZA CIVILIANS AND ENGAGES IN  ACTIVITIES DESIGNED TO CAUSE   GAZA CIVILIANS TO BE KILLED. HAMAS PUTS INNOCENT CIVILIANS IN THE LINE OF FIRE.  THEY HIDE THEIR WEAPON IN  SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS AND WHEN   THE CHILDREN OF GAZA DIE AND   INNOCENT MEN AND WOMEN ARE BLOWN APART, HAMAS LEADERSHIP CHEERS   QUIETLY FOR WHAT THEY PERCEIVE   IS A PROPAGANDA COUPE AGAINST  THE ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES.  I SUPPORT SANCTIONS AGAINST  HAMAS AND ANY OF ITS SUPPORTING  ORGANIZATIONS AND SUPPORTING   INDIVIDUALS THAT FACILITATE THE  HUES OF HUMAN SHIELDS. I URGE M

gomartov temple emmanuel and shanatsuva thank you robert for that gracious introduction and for your friendship gratitude to rabbi spike anderson my friend for his gracious invitation to address the congregation today thanks also to cantor desnik rabbi rachel miller rabbi max miller your congregation co-presidents robert and of course also edie disner vice presidents evan altman wendy frank bill kellert ellen lindemann the board of trustees the brotherhood and sisterhood and the entire congregation i am deeply honored by the invitation to address you on this day of all days the tenth day of tishrei as we observe yom kippur today is a day for reflection and so my message today is reflective i think it's hopeful and it's founded on a conviction that just as we can resolve to live better and kinder and more virtuous lives in the year to come as individuals together as a community as a nation and as a human family we can build a better world that will last for many years to come just as i'm deeply honored to speak here today on yom kippur i'm also deeply honored to serve you and to represent you in the united states senate in preparing for today's remarks i paused to reflect on the events in our state and in our world over this last year first let me extend my heartfelt condolences to all of you who have lost friends family and loved ones in this last year more than 650 000 americans who have died from covid19 my heart is with you may their memories be a blessing reflecting on the last year in our state i reflected of course on political events and i think we all recognize that the election in january was a turning point for our state and for the american south but in my view [Music] it was a turning point beyond the scope of partisan politics and for me and for so many georgians it was a turning point deeply connected to the intertwined histories of two peoples who have faced persecution and genocide throughout history because few i among them would have predicted even as recently as a few years ago that the state of georgia both the heart of the old confederacy and the cradle of the civil rights movement would send a black pastor and the young jewish son of an immigrant to represent our state in the senate as robert acknowledged we are respectively the first jew and the first african-american to represent georgia in the senate and upon my election i became the first jewish senator elected from the deep south since 1879. [Applause] my father's grandparents israel and annie ossoff came to america from lithuania in 1911 and 1913 fleeing deadly anti-semitism in eastern europe when i was sworn into the senate by vice president kamala harris i had in my jacket pocket copies of the ship's manifests that logged their arrival at ellis island what happened in georgia this year represents the historic alliance between blacks and jews in the south an alliance that was vitally important during the civil rights movement in which congressman john lewis urged me and all of us to sustain the first time i sat down for a meal with my mentor congressman lewis nearly 20 years ago that's what he wanted to talk to me about how blacks and jews had marched together and sat in together at the height of the movement in the 1960s how a people that withstood centuries of colonialism genocide and slavery were tied to a people who endured bondage exile pogroms and holocaust how our alliance was vital but couldn't be taken for granted and required commitment across generations and so with those ellis island ships records in my pocket documenting how israel and annie landed in america over a century ago and with congressman lewis words echoing in my mind as i was sworn into the senate i placed my hand on a tanakh that had belonged to a georgia rabbi named jacob rothschild rabbi rothschild had led the temple in atlanta for decades the temple where i was bar mitzvahed and it was while rabbi ross child led the temple in 1958 that the temple was bombed by white supremacists in retaliation for the rabbi's alliance with dr king the day after that bombing dr king sent an urgent telegram to president eisenhower calling for an emergency white house conference on race relations that dr king said quote could revive for the citizens of our country and the freedom-loving peoples of the world the great american heritage of justice law and order and could help recommit our nation to the peaceful settling of differences which is the only method consistent with constitutional democracy dr king's words after the temple in atlanta was bombed to quote recommit our nation to the peaceful settling of differences which is the only method consistent with constitutional democracy that revival and that recommitment were necessary in 1958 and they're necessary today if the rabbi will indulge me as i stray into your lane yom kippur being a day for reflection and reckoning and atonement and recommitment it's fitting to take stock today of the threats to pluralism to tolerance to democracy to peaceful coexistence in our society and around the world threats not just lurking and rising but already at crisis levels as i'm sure is true for many of you not all of my ancestors made it out of europe before it was too late and once it was too late just a few escaped i'll never forget as a young boy tracing with my index finger the numbers tattooed into the arm of my cousin nate krugman we called him great uncle nate numbers etched into his skin upon arrival at the vevara concentration camp in estonia and i was trying to grasp with my child's mind some comprehension of how that horror could be possible uncle nate and some of his friends had bolted from a work party beyond the camp's fence hiding and foraging in baltic forests for months until he reached soviet troops eventually contacted our family in america joined them here and built a vibrant life but most of those who hadn't come earlier never got the chance my generation was raised with the words never forget pressed into our minds and so when at pope high school in marietta georgia a swastika and a tribute to adolf hitler are scrawled on school walls during yamin no our days of awe no less it must inflame in us the same passion for the survival of our people that burned in the hearts of the generation that emerged from the shoah and built a future for the jewish people here in america around the world and in the land of israel two weeks ago i returned home from israel coveted restrictions prevented me from getting out to spend time with my israeli family orthodox jews who made aliyah about 10 years ago but it was a profound experience to arrive in the holy land representing the united states as a jewish member of congress in jerusalem and tel aviv i met with prime minister bennett president herzog and foreign minister lapid prime minister bennett having lived in new york shared in our nation's surprise at the nature of the new representation for our state in the senate the new israeli leadership asked me to convey their regards to the jewish community here in georgia and in ramallah i spoke at length with prime minister shtaya of the palestinian authority i met with ordinary israelis and palestinians yearning for an end to war reminded as always when we visit the region of israel's vulnerability of the vital importance of our alliance of the necessity of strong u.s leadership to ensure israel's long-term security and while the situation remains intensely challenging and my optimism is cautious there is a new atmosphere of possibility in the region and a new and promising tone in the relations between israel and the united states it was a deliberate choice that my first mission as a member of the senate was to the middle east and it won't be long before i return i'm working to build the open honest and trusting personal relationships necessary to help advance a u.s foreign policy that will hasten the day when all who live in those lands live with security with peace with prosperity and with freedom that is a mission founded on the same values that sustain america's place as an inspiration to the world inalienable rights bestowed by god of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness those are the promises that still draw dreamers and strivers and pioneers from all over the world to our shores about a month ago i was on a flight to springfield illinois lincoln's hometown and i was sitting across the aisle on this little regional jet from a young lithuanian woman she was on the final leg of her journey to live for a year in rural illinois full of excitement to be in america dreaming about opportunities she could pursue and maybe even the life that she could build here and i just couldn't get over the fact that this young woman who decided to come to america who was sitting right across the aisle for me was from lithuania she reminded me of annie and israel ossoff they came to this country at about her age she reminded me of my own mother who immigrated alone to america as a young woman just 23 years old my mother came to this country because she believed in this country she still does and so do i on this yom kippur as we reckon with the last year and resolve to live better lives in the year to come it's with gratitude that i'll continue to serve you i will continue the work aimed at more fully realizing america's founding promises and i'm at your service shana tova thank you again rabbi anderson thank you all for your time and hospitality today

is really long I represents the seventh District image or a Springfield Joplin branch area southwest part of Missouri of the 435 congressional districts in the country I represent the number one district my pigeon anyway but we you know New York City doesn't get eighty percent of their power cold San Francisco does not get over eighty five percent of their power from cold Missouri guess what gets over eighty percent of our power from cold if you don't remember anything else that you heard here today remember this dr. Lawrence tribe not ever known as a rock riff Republican but he is known as a brilliant constitutional professor at her he represented Al Gore's versus George Bush front of the Supreme Court argue that case he wasn't a rock grip Republican that he's not a rockery of Republican now but he is a brilliant constitutional professor he said at our committee hearing at the table with the folks from the EPA and he looked at him he said what you all doing what you all are doing is absolutely I'm constitutional now that comes from dr. Larry tribe so remember that one other real quick thing the North American Electric Reliability corporation president and CEO told me on May the 19th at the energy and power hearing that the deadlines for states to meet standards must be slowed to minimize negative impact on grid reliability that's pretty serious he questions whether Kohler alternatives such as natural gas would be there every day in the cold days of letters that's why I'm supporting and voting for this bill

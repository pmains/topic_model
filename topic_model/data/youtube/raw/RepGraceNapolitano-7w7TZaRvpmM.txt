recognized for five minutes Thank You mr. chair my amendment is simple it authorizes the director of unit US Geological Survey to complete a study repair report and document the potential impacts of oil shale on water quantity and quality available for agriculture and municipal use prior to implementation of the Act I'd like to submit for the record a GAO report dated October the 2010 on energy versus water and nexus and it is entitled a bitter and coordinator understanding of Water Resources could help mitigate the impacts of potential oil shale development the second one I'd like to introduce into the record is the Western resources advocate of 2010 oil shale triple threat report in both those reports I've handed to mr. Tipton so he have a look at them mr. chair the Colorado River is the system serving seven states including Mexico where the water supply exceeds the demand for over 30 million people it originates approximately 4 million acres of land is the lifeblood of 15 Native American tribes and communities has seven national wildlife refuges refuges has four national recreation areas and 11 national parts the demands are further complicated by a decade of drought in the West and of course climate change the interim reclamation reported Colorado River Basin supply water supply and demand study saw that in one of the scenarios assessed in 2010 recently or two years ago year and a half ago the water supply in the Colorado could decrease by nine to twenty percent by the year 2050 if oil shale is developed in the Colorado River basin water demands will only increase and change the western slope as we know it a 2008 BLM programmatic oil shale environmental impact stated concluded that by shifting water from act to oil shale oil shale development would likely transform communities from in the western Colorado for agricultural based economies to industrial economies similar changes of projector for eastern Utah October 2010 government accountability office report found that while water may be available during the initial development of this resource there have been very few studies that document the long-term viability of oil shale development and its impact on water supply the study would also help to provide states of Colorado Utah and Wyoming with baseline information on water supply and oil shale development that can use in managing the state's water there are various scenarios that I have a concern about sitting in this committee for 14 years I have a great respect for development of jobs for a further looking of production of oil for our nation and I'd like to ensure as mr. Bishop pointed out that new new technology that might have a better use of water then leaving ponds that are contaminated with the chemicals that sometimes are left for the community the taxpayer to pay for it those are some of my base base concerns the you see the moon as the bill moves along I would ensure that any water used for oil shale production is cleaned up and not left for the community to shoulder that the the cleanup process I do ask my colleagues to look at it to support my amendment that would study that long-term viability of oil shale in relation to water supply it Neil back the balance of my time

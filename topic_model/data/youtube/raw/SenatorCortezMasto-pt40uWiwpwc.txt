Madam President I rise to thank my colleague from Maine whose amazing work as chair of the aging committee continues to inspire me and I also rise today to share a story that is very personal to me it's a story about one of the smartest people that I've known my grandmother Katherine who I was named after she was the daughter of an Italian immigrant and his italian-american wife she was exactly the kind of person you think of when you think of an Italian grandmother and if you've ever had one you know that they loved to feed people and she would invite the whole family aunts uncles cousins everyone over to her house for dinner on Sunday nights and the other six days of the week she worked on volunteer projects throughout Las Vegas with her sorority Beta Sigma Phi she never graduated from college but she was a leader in our community and she was always greeting if you walked into her house it was full of books in fact the first thing you saw when you walked into her house was on one wall floor to ceiling a bookcase with all of the books that she had read she was brilliant and she was one of my greatest inspirations her work in our community in Las Vegas is one of the reasons I decided to pursue a career in public service unfortunately Madam President in the 1990s my grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and at first you could barely notice a difference there were small things things that could happen to anyone lost her keys mismatched socks books left in odd places and then a woman who spent her entire life loving to cook for her family and grandchildren suddenly stopped cooking and over the next ten years she got progressively worse we could see the changes in her every single day but our lives changed too my grandfather became her caregiver my mother became her care give her my aunt became her caregiver my cousins and I and my sister we all became caregivers and that's what happens when someone is diagnosed it doesn't affect just one person it affects an entire family there's a common misconception that people suffering from Alzheimer's aren't aware of what they're losing that their memories are gone but not missed that wasn't the case for my grandmother I don't think it's the case for anyone struggling with this disease my grandmother frequently had these moments of clarity when it was clear that the losses were just as painful for her as they were for all of us one thing that happens to many people with Alzheimer's is that they tend to wander wander away from home or they get lost and she had one of those moments of clarity after she had wandered away from home one day and the entire family spent an afternoon looking for her in our neighborhood my aunt and I found her and we went to pick her up in a car and I'll never forget I sat in the backseat while my aunt was driving and my grandmother who was in the front passenger side of the seat asked my aunt why am I doing this why am I in my housecoat and slippers why am I doing this and my aunt looked at her and she said mom you're sick you've got something they called Alzheimer's and that means that it is impacting your brain and your memories and you're forgetting we were so powerless we couldn't do anything but make her comfortable and bring her home and for many many families dealing with Alzheimer's they've gone through those same moments those moments when they're dealing with their loved ones either trying to explain to them what's happening or give them the comfort because they know their memories are gone and they want to make sure that they're giving them the comfort that they need and deserve we know unfortunately there is no cure for Alzheimer's my grandmother passed away like many people with Alzheimer's do when her illness got so bad that she lost the ability to eat or drink but the experience of caring for my grandfather grandmother excuse me opened my eyes to the true impact of this disease I saw that when one person is diagnosed a whole family's lives are transformed - I think about my grandmother every day every day I returned to some piece of wisdom or guidance that she shared with me I'm committed now to honoring her memory by fighting to prevent Alzheimer's and provide caregivers with the support they need and deserve when my grandmother was first diagnosed we did not understand Alzheimer's like we do today we didn't have enough healthcare programs for it or support for the caregivers it was seen as an individual disease that struck at random with no cure and no hope although there is still no cure we know now that there are things we can do to help to keep the brain healthy for longer and possibly reduce the risk of Alzheimer's there are things we can do now to promote prevention and for those of us already living with Alzheimer's and their caregivers like my family was for my grandmother there are things that we can do to dramatically improve their experiences and help lessen some of that burden and today there are things that we can do to invest to invest in finding that cure for Alzheimer's it is just a petri dish away but we have to believe that it is there and we can continue and support that investment I have visited the Lou Ruvo Center for Brain health in las vegas and met with its director dr. jeffrey cummings I have seen the incredible work they have done in looting methods for the early detection of Alzheimer's that simply didn't exist only a few years ago but education in the community and the spreading of best practices still lags behind there is no longer any doubt that this is a public health crisis that's why I am so grateful and proud to be sitting on a committee working with a chairwoman my colleague from Maine who has made it her effort here in Congress to really bring attention to Alzheimer's disease and help to fight for funding and investing in a cure I am proud to join my colleagues from Maine West Virginia and Virginia in introducing legislation known as the bold infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act this bill will create centers of excellence dedicated to promoting effective interventions and educating the public on Alzheimer's disease cognitive decline and brain health it will provide grants to state and local health departments to build the infrastructure necessary to address this public health crisis and it will collect the data necessary to keep pushing the frontiers of what we know about this disease I urge my colleagues to support this vital piece of legislation this bipartisan piece of legislation that has the potential to have a positive impact on millions of Americans across this country Madam President with that thank you for listening and I yield the floor and notice the absence of a quorum

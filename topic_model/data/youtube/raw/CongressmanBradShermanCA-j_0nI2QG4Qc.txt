alright welcome back on for drink of woodfield the fight for gun control laws got rather emotional this week frustrations reached a boiling point on Capitol Hill when Democrats staged a sit-in and Republicans pushed for recess at one point representative a Gohmert a Republican interrupted Democratic prep resented of brad Sherman and here's a clip congressman Sherman was involved in that altercation and he's joining us right now okay so take me back to that moment I mean what was your interpretation of what was being said by the other represent you know what was your response well I was interrupted earlier in the speech by several other Republicans but the real problem here is that we didn't have regular order on the floor of the house because the speaker will not allow us to deal with common-sense gun gun safety laws the whole country once did us to deal with those the Senate has had half a dozen votes all we were trying to do is get a vote in upon the floor of the house that would have been a regular debate and we wouldn't have had altercations we wouldn't have had sit-ins we wouldn't have had people interrupting each other we can debate calmly and according to the rules if only to speak who will let us debate what America wants us to debate and so what do you say to that speaker who said you know this was not respectful it defies decorum and he essentially said that this sort of protest is more obstructionist it's an interruption as opposed to it being an impetus to help push anything forward well this was an act of desperation because it's the speaker who has blocked the Congress he won't allow us to vote on common-sense gun safety and the Senate as I said has had several votes we haven't had one and so it was a desperate measure to try to get the house to do the people's business and I hope that when we reconvene right after independence day but the speaker will relent and let us have a vote on sub perhaps the Collins bill or any other of the proposals that has substantial support and in what way would you hope they're there was a continuation after the fourth of July holiday break i mean this sit-in was largely pushed by you know well-known civil rights icon and Congressman John Lewis of Georgia with this sit n he helped remind people of the effectiveness of sit-ins that he was involved in during the civil rights movement and is an extension of that this sit n did end and the holiday break is now something all lawmakers are participating in in what way will this protest or this demonstration continue if not mice by way of a sit-in but how my hope is that it doesn't continue because my hope is that we go back to doing the people's business in an orderly way that would mean the speaker would let us vote on the Collins bill or any of the other several bills that are pending that have substantial support you have any you feel hopeful that that would happen yes because the American people are focused on this and frankly I think the the speaker has has lost in the court of public opinion we're talking about common sense no fly no bye that's overwhelmingly popular with the American people had he simply dealt with this in regular order you'd be talking to me about brexit but instead we're talking about the need to to have a no-fly no by that is to say if you're so dangerous that you can't sit next to me on a plane even when I know you don't have a gun because you've gone through all the the detectors etc then for God's sakes you shouldn't be sitting next to me on a park bench with a gun that you just purchased so if if someone is so dangerous that we have to impede their ability to travel by air then the we ought to impede them buying a gun and we at just as I was saying before Gohmert interrupted me on the floor to protect our civil liberties need we need an effective system to let people who shouldn't be on the list get off the list so we should have the best list we can have protect people's civil liberties but for God's sakes if you if you're so dangerous you can't sit next to me on a on a on a plane don't buy an assault weapon okay so congressman Sherman yet you did just bring it up for excited to hear about that and there have been some parallels analysts have made about what has happened in you know with as a result of brexit and the parallels being made to the race for the White House and do you think that's reasonable can you equate the ambition behind the brexit you know vote the nationalism the protectionism the same kind of language that a particular presumptive Republican candidate of Donald Trump is also extending to the to the American people well remember this was 52-48 in their electorate we have a completely different electorate in different issues so one certainly can't predict our vote as a result but it does show that the elites need to listen to the the people and what we have is a situation of this trans-pacific partnership Hillary's against it Bernie's against it Trump is against it and I hope that the president would announce that he will not use the connivance of coming to Congress for the lame duck after the election and trying to get its approval because we need to reassure the American people that that the elites are listening to them and overwhelmingly the American people have said we don't want bad trade deals we only want trade deals that raise wages in the United States and we should be look talking to Britain about a trade deal with Britain that's a country with a high unionization rate at high wage rates instead this TPP deal is with a Vietnam with 40 50 cent and our workers I don't want to have to compete against my people and people might district compete with 40 and 50 cent an hour labor especially when we not we're not going to be selling anything to Vietnam they'll just be selling things here they've got a communist system so they don't have a free market anyway all right representative brad Sherman thank you so much for joining us from

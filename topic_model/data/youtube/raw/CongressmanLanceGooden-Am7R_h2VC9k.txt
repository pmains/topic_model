Republican congressman Lance Gooden is here welcome back to primetime as you've probably heard me say many times congressman I just don't see the reality in the Senate I don't even know if there's gonna be a trial I'll explain that to the audience later let's put the pragmatism aside and let me ask you about this the fundamental question of did the president put pressure on Ukraine to look at Biden and if they didn't was there any type of suggestion they wouldn't get aid do you believe that that question has value I believe that the question you're asking will be answered tomorrow based on what we've learned in the last hour and a half and that is that the White House is going to turn over the whistleblower complaint they're going to turn over the transcript of the call so the speculation that I've watched back and forth on this network for the last two hours will all be put to rest in about 12 hours if the White House does is they're saying they're going to do tonight why well because the last 12 hours or rather the last 72 hours have been about what was discussed between these two presidents what is in this whistleblower report it sounds like based on what we're hearing in the last two hours a lot of time going on here that tomorrow morning both the whistleblower complaint and the transcript of the call are going to be released so all these great questions can finally have an answer and the speculation can stop why does it end the idea that let's say the president didn't really mention money in the call with the Ukrainian president I have to believe they wouldn't release the call let's say the complaint let isn't that let's go to bed and wake up tomorrow and have answers to these questions but why do you think it will answer the questions if the complaint says look I don't like what he said to the Ukraine president how does that action is what happened between the two of them and what's in the whistleblower complaint those are the two primary questions that we don't have answers to everything you've seen happen today on Capitol Hill is all based on speculation I'm saying that speculation of what took place between the two presidents should be answered tomorrow morning we can in speculation about what took place between the two maybe what happens next is still under consideration but at least we can stop questioning what happened between these two gentlemen so you have no problem that the president gave two different explanations in two days for why he withheld the aid and that they have nothing to do with one another I've often done things and had multiple reasons for doing them I don't know why he withheld to aid but I believe that tomorrow morning we'll have answers to questions that I've seen speculation run rampant on across the weekend these last few days but speculation suggests that you haven't known anything except that fundamental question we keep learning more and more you'll remember I think Rudy Giuliani was on this show and he went both ways and whether or not Biden was even in the offing when he went to Ukraine and he said that the president he didn't know what he knew and that he knew nothing about what he did and then we find out that the president was forwarding the same goal by withholding the money surely that's got to raise your ears a little bit the questions that I've heard the most over the last 72 hours are what's in the whistleblower complaint what happened between yes yes fundamental fundamentally we'll have answers to those questions tomorrow and then let's talk and so you want to say let's see what's in there do you have any reason to know what's in there by the way you got any scoop for us that's above my pay grade too bad so if they are open questions after tomorrow are you in favor of pursuing them I'm in favor of coming back on this show and talking with you about it and let's move forward from there I have a feeling that no matter what comes out tomorrow just like if we go back in time to the Muller investigation and the hearing no matter what Democrats find out we're gonna still be talking about it so I'm confident that this time tomorrow you'll still be talking about it no matter what we learn tomorrow morning I would congratulate you for your benign outlook on all of this if it weren't for the fact that you are moving to remove chairman adler because you're so frustrated by the process what is the legal basis or you don't need one this is politics why do you think you should get rid of them oddly enough it may surprise you we're not just making this stuff up the house rules say that the house determines whether or not there's an impeachment inquiry we have to actually vote on that what's been happening since July when chairman Edler just went forward for this investigation was he was doing this on his own he said his words exactly we are in the middle of impeachment I am investigating this is an inquiry none of that's legal House Rules which are determined via the Constitution the rule of law says that the US House of Representatives has to vote on that and that's not happen if you go back to July we actually had a vote on impeachment and it failed Democrats didn't like that and so now they're saying that's just investigate investigate what Nancy Pelosi said are you supposed to Pelosi said today yeah was no different than what's been happening this whole entire disagree here's what the Constitution says I don't know if you can see congressman but you see these bags under my eyes I've been reading about this at a makeup coverage them recently not well enough I got to get on it the idea is this the Constitution says the sole power to impeach rests with you guys and the sole power to try for potential removal deals with the Senate there are no procedures you are correct you must have a majority vote for there to be articles of impeachment then let's have one the president grow a sponsor you said you weren't making it up I'm just saying there are no procedures in the Constitution there is no right way and wrong way to proceed with impeachment there isn't even anything called an impeachment inquiry in the Constitution I will all you need is the majority vote so what did he do your producer the house rules that spell it out and that's not how it's being done right now and that's why I'm saying if we're going to actually move forward into this impeachment process which it sounds like we're gonna get there if you talk to Nancy Pelosi and the far left caucus that's driving the agenda if we actually get to that point we need someone to at least be fair chairman adler has not been he's gone on his own and said this is how we're gonna do it that's just not how the house rules say we've talked to parliamentarians we've talked to former members both parties and I'll be happy to share with you the actual room I'm not saying that there aren't procedures but I don't know that that gets you to lose your chairmanship and the judiciary is where you're supposed to be doing this contemplating although you don't have you this year you could create a special someone that's actually fair and is gonna follow the law that's not gonna say we're impeaching the president we're not in the middle of a night said he's impeaching in fact I and he says they investigate we are in impeachment now I'll send you the quote because his point is that it's all the same body of investigation that anything you want to call it you can call it but until you call for a vote of the entire chamber you're investigating as you should and they better be able to make one hell of a case if they're gonna bring articles of impeachment against a president they do not see politics Democrats don't really want to impeach the president they want to be under an impeachment process throughout the next election cycle Democrats know that if they vote for impeachment even if they are able to muster up the votes which by the way they can't because they have 31 Democrats in districts that went for Trump in the last election cycle they know they don't have the votes for impeachment but let's just assume for a second that they did when that goes to the Senate the Senate will equip the president they know that I don't even know that they'll trial maybe not I'm with you they may not my point is is why waste all these time this time and these resources why not get to work for the American people others from Democrats the Senate morning we took office I'm a freshman all my freshman colleagues across the aisle said Lance I want to work with you we want to get to work for the mayor and you guys have passed and behind but now we're talking the president it's outrageous why don't you call Mitch McConnell and say that I will call Mitch McConnell and ask him do you think it's wise for the Democrats to take up the next three months it's not what I'm asking why do you ask him to put some votes on the floor on some of the bills that your house passed some of these bills most all of them actually are bills the Republicans wanted to work with Democrats on but Democrats know that if we work across the aisle and actually have a bill that we're all in unison on then the president might actually sign it god forbid the president signed something that the House passes because then we'd have to give the president in a victory Democrats won't go for that the u.s. Mexico Canada trade agreement they won't even take it up because they know it's bipartisan because they know the votes are there and if it passes the house it sells through the Senate and the president signs it the president can declare victory that's something that the demo sad reality is Lance that they say the same things about the other side and you know what I'll agree with you on this as I did the last time I saw you and you're welcome back again the more you guys can figure out how to do things together the better will this move help that I doubt it but I appreciate you prediction quick correction you got on election night Donald Trump gets reelected and today today today is a milestone that Democrats will regret noted I'll talk to you soon you be wings alright how long will all this impact the 2020 race prescient notion from congressman good

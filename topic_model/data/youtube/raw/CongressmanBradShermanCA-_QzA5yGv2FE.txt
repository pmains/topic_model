THE GENTLEMAN FROM CALIFORNIA,   MR. SHERMAN, IS NOW RECOGNIZED.  MR. SHERMAN: I RISE IN SUPPORT   OF THIS LEGISLATION, H.R. 535,   THE TAIWAN TRAVEL ACT, AND YIELD MYSELF AS MUCH TIME AS I MAY   CONSUME. THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: THE   GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED FOR SUCH TIME.  . I'M PLEASED TO FLUSTE THIS BILL, THE TAIWAN TRAVEL ACT. IT IS NOT JUST AN PORTRAYEDING   PARTNER, 14TH LARGEST MARKET AND NOT JUST THE LAND OF 23 MILLION  PEOPLE BUT A DEMOCRATIC ALLY OF  THE UNITED STATES, A PLACE WHERE OUR VALUES ARE DISPLAYED IN THE  ASIA-PACIFIC REGION. AND YET, IT WOULD BE SURPRISING  FOR MOST AMERICANS TO KNOW THAT  LEADERS FROM TAIWAN ARE NOT  ALLOWED TO VISIT THE UNITED  STATES UNDER ANY REASONABLE  FORMAT.  INSTEAD THE PRESIDENT OF TAIWAN  CANNOT VISIT WASHINGTON D.C. BUT CAN VISIT LOS ANGELES FOR A  REFUELING STOP ON THE WAY TO   COSTA RICA.  THAT IS ABSURD THAT THE  PRESIDENT OF TAY WAN WOULD SAY I FLY ACROSS THE PACIFIC AGAIN AND AGAIN TO VISIT THEIR FRIENDS IN  CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRY.  AND THAT THE REFUELING STOP IS   JUST A TWO-DAY EFFORT TO PUT   FUEL ON A JET PLANE. NOW MY DISTRICT ACTUALLY   BENEFITS FROM THIS, BECAUSE WHEN THE PRESIDENT AND SEVERAL  DIFFERENT PRESIDENTS OF TAIWAN   COME TO AMERICA, THEY REFUEL AT  LOS ANGELES AIRPORT AND THEY   COME TO THE SHEER AT TON HOTEL   IN THE 30TH CONGRESSIONAL  DISTRICT.  DESPITE THE BENEFIT IN TERMS OF  IMAGE AND ECONOMY THAT THE   CURRENT SITUATION PROVIDES FOR   THE 30TH DISTRICT, IT'S TIME FOR US TO GROW UP. IT'S TIME FOR US TO REALIZE THAT TAIWAN IS A VITAL ALLY AND   THAT'S IT'S MOST IMPORTANT   LEADERS SHOULD BE VISITING   WASHINGTON, D.C. AND TALKING NOT ONLY TO THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH   BUT TALKING TO THE EXECUTIVE   BRANCH AS WELL.  WE SHOULD NO LONGER BE IN A  CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE WHEN MEMBERS  OF CONGRESS FROM OTHER PARTS OF  THE COUNTRY WANT TO VISIT WITH   THE PRESIDENT OF TAY WAN, THEY   HAVE TO FLY TO UNIVERSAL CITY  AND STAY AT THE SHERATON IN MY   DISTRICT AND VISIT THERE.  WE COULD COMMUNICATE BETTER IF   THE PRESIDENT OF TAIWAN WAS ABLE TO LAND AT DULLES AND BE IN THE  HALLS OF CONGRESS. SO THIS BILL SIMPLY SAYS THAT  IT'S TIME TO ENCOURAGE TRAVEL OF THE HIGH-RANKING OFFICIALS OF  EACH COUNTRY TO THE OTHER AND  MEETINGS AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS.  THAT IS ONE IMPORTANT STEP IN  ENDING THIS EFFORT TO ISOLATE  TAIWAN, BECAUSE BY ENCOURAGING   GREAT LEVEL OF HIGH-LEVEL VISITS AND DIALOGUE, WE WOULD EASE  TAIWAN'S INTERNATIONAL ISOLATION AND REAFFIRM THAT THE UNITED   STATES HAS A POLITICAL AND   SECURITY COMMITMENT TO THE   FREEDOM OF TAIWA

I still can't believe they passed that healthcare bill this is going to be a disaster for Pennsylvania a disaster for America the only thing bipartisan about that bill was opposition to it and little wonder when you consider what's in it I mean start with 2000 pages of new mandates and bureaucracies and commissions all designed to put government in control of health care to insert bureaucrats between patients and doctors and with all those new requirements our health insurance premiums are going to go up that's not what this bill should be doing of course it's not just that the taxes are going to be awful as well over a half a trillion dollars of new taxes at a time when our economy is so weak taxes on medical devices pharmaceuticals on employers employees taxes on jobs themselves this is going to make it harder to create new jobs not easier and then there's the spending well over a trillion dollars over the next ten years of money we don't have it's going to create debt that we can't afford yes it's going to create significant new deficits and added debt and it's just a disaster that didn't have to be well we could have done and should do and still can do is repeal this Obamacare and replace it with a kind of common-sense incremental reforms that will lower costs and improve access to affordable health care for Americans that's what we need to be doing I hope you'll join me in this effort join my campaign help us take back the government help us take back our government and restore some balance in Washington

Virginia is right in the line of fire when those spending cuts take effect but Virginia senator Tim Cain says it is not too late to cut a deal that would replace the sequester he is calling on Congress and the White House to work until the last minute to spare the Commonwealth and the nation the consequences senator Cain joins us now it's always a pleasure to see the morning so you remain very optimistic that perhaps besides to sizing and where are you we have to I mean it's it's a matter of will we have to find an alternative whether we do it in an hour or five hours or a day or two day we've got to find an alternative I took a tour around the state last week kind of an armed services to her given my membership on the committee and everywhere I went you know in ship repairs and hampton roads getting more notices that they're going to get laid off one small ship repair company 450 employees laying off 300 employees 90,000 DOD civilian employees in virginia are going to start getting furloughed a day a week beginning at the end of the month and allison these are like you know the nurses who work at Fort Belvoir hospital taking care of our wounded warriors so this is a massive effect we could lose as many as 200,000 jobs in Virginia when it's fully implemented so we've got to stay at the table to find a deal yesterday in the Senate there were two proposals a democratic and republican proposal the Democratic proposal got votes the Republican proposal got 38 the decision to filibuster meant that the 51 wasn't enough but the good thing about it is as soon as those bills both dropped now there's a lot of discussion going back and forth in bipartisan ways about what could we do this or that and I see a lot of that so what I hope the president will do today is that look Congress you know the congressional leadership in the eye and say Congress has got to stop the gimmicks sequester continuing resolution it seems like Congress is trying everything in the world to avoid making decisions and compromising but we've got to have a willingness to compromise that's bipartisan that's between house and senate and i hope the president kind of gives that strong charge today as well as reminding the congressional leadership he's had a plan on the table it's a 1.8 trillion dollar deficit reduction plan for some time and i hope he goes over the specifics of that plan which is a mixture of program cuts entitlement reforms revenues through closing loopholes and then interest savings that would result in he ought to remind the congressional leadership about that plan and then open to their ideas as well should would be encouraged by this new deadline i think everybody thought when it when the clock struck midnight march first that was going to be it now it's midnight on march first should we be encouraged say you know it's funny I actually think discouraged because there's just you know there's just one self manufacture deadline after the X we know there's nothing magic about March one why is March one this deadline is there some big economic issue in March one know is the world less or more safe on march one know we put these manufacture deadlines in place and I actually think the right way to get out of this artificial deadlines mentality is for Congress to do something that it really hasn't done since 2009 which is start to write a budget again for the first time because normally you should be making your spending and your tax and your deficit reduction decisions as part of a normal annual budget process so here's some good news both houses have agreed this year that if the houses do not pass budgets by Dean our paychecks stop so we're working very hard on a budget in the Senate House is doing the same thing now when those two budgets come out they're not going to look identical so there's going to have to be some tough discussion and compromised but at least we're returning to a normal budget practice for the first time since 09 and if we can just find over the course of the next hours and days you know this willingness to compromise we can at least mitigate most of the sequester effects there's some effects that have already taken place in the contracting world but we have to stay at the table till we find a deal and there's just no substitute for listening and for compromise and for Congress making decisions rather than coming up with one new gimmick to avoid making decisions when and you know I applaud your optimism I think all of us are hoping that there is a way to not do the across-the-board cuts be some of the most vulnerable of us will be effective actually but when Senator canes you you say well these two sides just aren't coming together well we can't we just can't say that I mean we're not in an eight you know we're in a nation where this Congress for all its you know warts they has worked pretty well over the course of you know 230 plus years and there isn't anything it's not sick building syndrome up there it's not in the water supply and it's just in the character and inclinations of people who walk into the building every day I when I was traveling last week it was interesting throughout Virginia I had all kinds of people just tell me just compromise and find a deal and what did they say cuz you're looking at our human being yeah who might not be able to put food on their table like they used to what do you say to those people well that you're hearing their stories and and in every different way you know from the wounded warriors why it was at Fort Belvoir and this you know wounded were there getting treatment his wife's right next to man she speaks up and says what about my husband's a nurse you know she's advocating for the army nor the DoD civilian her she's there at that hospital so you you're struck and people who are saying well this hat doesn't have any effect on people's lives come with me i'm going to show you some people who it's a fair now and it's creating huge anxiety in the situation that's already too tough but but what they all say at the end is just go up and find compromise and get a deal and i didn't mean one person in virginia who said save my program by doubling up the cuts on somebody else nobody said that they really believe that we should find a deal the deal that I voted for yesterday would have reduced the cuts in half by putting some revenue into the equation and taken the cuts instead of making them across the board as you mention allison making them targeted so i mean just to give an example the senate had already agreed in the bipartisan way that we could do some dramatic reductions of some farm subsidy programs that are no longer needed well let's do that rather than just across the board cuts on everything because there's already bipartisan agreement that that's the right thing to do gotta end it there it's been a pleasure talking to you we surely will be following the story of course and hope there is some sort of compromise right thank you alrighty tim kaine thank you so much senator came from virginia Tony over to you

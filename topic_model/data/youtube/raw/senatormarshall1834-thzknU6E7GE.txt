john sandra while the president looks to put a stop to his predecessor's policies at the border one senator is saying expand them specifically title 42. kansas senator roger marshall saying the policy should be broadened to help fight the deadly wave of fentanyl destroying american families senator marshall of the state of kansas joins us now senator good to talk to you you had rachelle wolenski the cdc director before the help committee yesterday in which you said to her look we i think that you should expand title 42 in order to help combat the scourge of fentanyl that's coming across the border she said there's no more health emergency we don't need title 42. listen to what she said the question of title 42 that was posed to me is is there a public health emergency that should bar people from coming into the united states we now have as of april 1st when i when i comment on this we now have the tools the tests the vaccines and the therapeutics that are available our hospitals are not full everyone in most people in this room are not wearing a mask there is no longer public health emergency there is no longer a public health emergency that was in the context of covet but you say that there is a clear and present health emergency because of fentanyl explain that that's right john fentanyl poisoning is now an epidemic that's killing more young adults than covet is than anything else is you know every day america loses about 200 people to fentanyl poisoning and as you know this the fentanyl precursors are made in china they're brought to mexico that the chinese work hand in glove with the cartel they lace oxycodone percocet marijuana xanax adderall all the illegal drugs as well they're bringing it across the border and that's why kansas is now a border state most every day we lose the cans and do fentanyl poisoning as well so how exactly would expanding title 42 stop the flow of fentanyl from coming across the border would it serve as a return to people trying to get across or would you have people who potentially won't check for drugs that were set back how do you see it working right well let's remember how tight title 42 worked under president trump it worked beautifully that he was able to return people to mexico that were seeking asylum and what title 42 is gives the government more broad range authority to return people because of a health condition because of an epidemic uh covet at the time so now my theory and thanks to senator bill cassidy for bringing this bill to light um he's doing some great work there as well but this would expand that same thought process towards fentanyl again fentanyl is killing more people than covet is more young people than covet is i want to ask you about uh gas prices because you recently introduced the gas prices relief act that would block the president from implementing regulations and other policies that would drive up the price of oil and gasoline jennifer granholm had a rather extraordinary commentary yesterday when she was asked about where she would want to see oil production in five to ten years she seemed to want to have it both ways increase production now but then do away with the oil and gas industry later listen here what we're saying is today we need that supply increased of course in five or ten years actually in the immediate we are also pressing on the accelerator if you will to move toward clean energy she's saying she wants the oil and gas industry to produce more now but we want to get rid of them in five to ten years what what what company in the oil patch would want to get involved in a business model like that john you nailed it this administration joe biden is creating uncertainty when there's uncertainty in any type of business we're unwilling to invest so his policies are what's driving this uncertainty people in washington dc think that we can just turn on a faucet and we're going to get gasoline at the pump but it typically takes two or three years to start the return on investment and typically more like five or seven years to pay it back this is very complicated it's very challenging it's high risk high reward sometimes as well so this uncertainty created by their policy starting with making it hard to get financing hard to get new permits even if you do get the leases as well they are driving up the price of gasoline this is on the backs of joe biden yeah well i mean that that comment from the energy secretary seemed to be a classic example of let's try to have it both ways which which i don't think in this particular instance you can senator roger marshall of kansas thanks for being with us appreciate it have a good weekend thanks john and back

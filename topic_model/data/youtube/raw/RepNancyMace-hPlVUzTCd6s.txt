more on this let's turn now to democratic congressman charlie crist of florida and republican congresswoman nancy mace of south carolina this morning they are set to introduce the free act it's a bill meant to protect americans against guardianship abuse brought about by britney spears's recent allegations this legislation brought about great to have you both with us this morning congresswoman mace let me begin with you what exactly do you seek to do with this legislation how do you give more power to the person under the conservatorship well first of all i want to thank britney spears for coming forward having the courage to come forward as a very public figure to tell her story to the entire world what she has been through for most of her adult life now britney spears conservatorship is a nightmare and if it can happen to her it can happen to anyone and there are approximately 1.3 million people in america who are on in conservatorships and what this legislation will do is allow that individual to petition the court to request and ask for a public guardian who has no conflict of interest financial or otherwise that they believe they're being abused and are not satisfied with the the individual their member of their family business partner etc um that has their con conservatorship at that time and so this is a small but meaningful first step to conservatorship reform so congressman crist i think as you know these conservatorships usually start with the best of intentions to protect someone a lot of times it's used in the case of dementia for other people who may need some help guiding their financial affairs ford from that point but what did you see in britney spears's case that made you look deeper into this and what else do you hope happens because of this legislation if it passes well i think as it relates to britney spears one of the most disturbing parts of her story was that she was forced to implant an iud in order to not have children that kind of personal decision should be a very sacred and something that's taken very seriously obviously that really draws your attention and as nancy said i would agree that her courage brittany's courage as well as nancy's frankly bipartisan legislation that we're sponsoring it's rotten not really willie about right versus left it's more about right versus wrong and i think that's the point we're trying to make here that we can unify we can work together and we can do things for the american people that make common sense and we need to do more of that and i'm curious congresswoman mace in the legislation that you all are pushing are you keeping in mind that there are a lot of people out there who are suffering who have family members who love them and perhaps can help them through their time of suffering i just wonder what what are you doing about the balance of rights between the two parties because i do understand that um you commend britney spears for having a voice and using it but i also wonder about this legislation as it pertains to family members loved ones those who have the best interest of those who are suffering in mind right and we're trying to find that balance here which is why we started this legislation with a narrow focus to get the ball rolling to find something that republicans and democrats could agree on and has a real chance of getting through the committee process and passing the floor of the house of representatives and getting to the senate i think that in this case small parts make a big difference and there were human rights abuses and conservatorships long before britney spears ever topped the charts and so we do want to recognize that but in some cases we that individual needs to have absolutely needs to have the right to petition the court to find an individual to represent them in a public guardianship role that doesn't have a conflict of interest in their life and sometimes that person it's better off when they're not a family member and i was disgusted when i heard this story and i want to talk about what charlie said about the iud limiting her reproductive rights in that way i'm a mom a young mom with two young kids and it's just disgusting to see what's happening here and it's all the more important that we take a first step in the conservatorship reform movement today congressman charlie crist and congresswoman nancy mace thank you both very much for being on this morning

Madam Speaker, The President abused the power
of his office by corruptly putting his own political interests ahead of our nation’s
security. He blocked Congressionally-authorized military
aid to coerce Ukraine to launch a phony investigation into his political rival. In the months since, he has waged a campaign
of absolute obstruction against Congress’s constitutional authority, ordering all federal
officials to defy subpoenas and refusing to produce even a single document. I take no joy in today’s impeachment vote
or that the President’s actions demand this response. This is sad moment for our nation. Only twice before has the House voted to impeach
a President, and never before on accusations of compromising national security. I hope in the Senate both prosecution and
defense can call and cross-examine witnesses, and the Senators will hear the evidence and
make their decisions without prejudice or prejudgment. This is a solemn moment, but our system of
checks and balances was designed for times like these. I have faith that our Constitution will guide
us on the path ahead.

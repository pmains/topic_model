those of you living in southwest minnesota stop what you're doing right now stop and listen for the next half hour because a gentleman who wants to be your next congressman has stumbled into the faculty lounge not inebriated but lost in in sioux falls south dakota uh jim hagedorn is uh is in the faculty lounge today and he didn't stumble in and he's not lost he's in sioux falls on purpose because i'm assuming because we're a media spot and people in southwest minnesota pay attention to sioux falls south dakota media you bet and it's all about you rick nice to be here oh yeah thank you yeah yeah you're i'm the reason you are a conga you could be a congressman you are so full of it we're in training jim hagedorn um first run for congress i i got my feet wet in 2010 took a little run then learned a few things and we're back at it okay you're a republican yes sir which works well in southwest minnesota a conservative republican and southwest district or whatever that district number is first district minnesota first israel all the way across the state and the southern part are there other republicans who have dared to challenge you for this two other two other fellows nice guys okay and um so you're in a primary well we don't we're not doing a primary we're going to go to a convention an endorsement process april 5th and albert lee so what how does that work well you need about 165 people to tell you that you're the one and and then you win so we're you know each county elects delegates and those delegates decide who the winner is it's kind of like the iowa it's kind of like the hour caucus it's a caucus process and you go through and keep electing delegates through throughout the process okay so two years or four years ago you ran and it didn't work out and obviously you're glutton for punishment and you're back again why do you want the job well because the country's in a lot of trouble and i feel that the my life's experiences have put me in a position where i have experience that i can help the folks uh you know i think the government's got so big and so powerful out in washington dc that people are beginning to fear their government we're going from liberty and the rule of law in my book to tyranny and the rule of obama and we've got to do something about that what kind of republican are you i'm a conservative reagan republican would be the way i'd put it okay you're not one of those are you a tea party i respect the tea party and we've had many events with the tea party but uh no i since i was 12 years old i've been a reagan republican and had some experiences that allowed me to fight the national liberals and it's uh i think you're in this in this uh arena because you you feel that you have something you can contribute and make a difference and help people so uh let's assume for a moment the positive and you prevail on april 5th and then you prevail in november and it is now you're now officially the congressman from the first district in minnesota what committees do you want to be on well agriculture committee would be primary southern minnesota the you know agriculture is the backbone of our economy it sustains our way of life and it also supports small business in minnesota so uh you know agriculture is a national security issue to me what would we be doing if we had to import our food the way we import our oil we'd be paying more and the quality would be less and then our our way of life would suffer so yes absolutely the agriculture committee okay second choice uh you know the appropriations committee very rare they're not going to put you on appropriations they do it on occasion and i have some some background they're working with appropriators to actually cut government and i think it would be really neat to put someone on that committee whose goal is to reform government as i did when i was at the treasury department and worked on capitol hill and someone that actually wants to go in there and shake things up okay we're going to take a short break and when we come back i want to talk with you about previous work experience and and we'll explore some other opportunities jim hagedorn wants to be congressman from the first district southwest minnesota this is vpu 15 minutes after four o'clock students in southwest minnesota keep listening very carefully jim hagedorn is with us he wants to be your next congressman he is one of three republicans uh trying to get the job there's a caucus type meeting up and where'd you say well we have actually a county convention in rock county uh tomorrow night and so they'll be selecting delegates to go to the albert lee district convention okay albert lee elbert lee which is april april 5th okay and then if you prevail on april 5th then you're done then you're in and life is good and you just face uh just continue what we're doing which is take the campaign right to liberal tim walls okay um how did tim walls get elected in southwest minnesota i thought there was some demarcation line about albert lee where you had to be conservative south of alberta well the first district that area in minnesota has always been a pretty much a republican district over the years but you know in politics the pendulum swings back and forth and tim walls ran in 2006. he ran a very long campaign about 18 months and the trends were with him and he ran a strong campaign of one okay you said uh during before the last break you said something about you worked for the treasury department were you one of them coming to steal my car or take my house kind of treasury guy or something like that i had some experience in the national uh in national politics i worked for a minnesota congressman named arlen stanglen a good conservative we did some important things work for welfare legislation second amendment rights right to life broad-based tax reform after that i did have an opportunity to work as an executive in the treasury department a place called the financial management service it's the part of treasury that handles the government's accounts one of their duties is to pay people you know veterans benefits or you know social security benefits things like that and i identified an area of inefficiency i thought we were making too many check payments instead of electronic payments and i asked my boss about it he said well hagedorn we need a bill to get that done and if you can get it done more power to you and three years later i got a bill through the congress and uh we we shut down four check writing centers for the treasury eliminated bureaucrat jobs and saved the taxpayers about a billion and a half dollars so you create so you're the guy responsible for direct deposit uh well direct deposit was around but it was not mandated until we passed what was called the eft 99 act so you're responsible for that congratulations oh thank you very much you saved me how much money uh the taxpayer is about a billion and a half dollars okay so with that vast experience and uh you want to be our congressman and you want to serve on ag give me uh a couple of other brilliant jim hagedorn money-saving ideas that when you're elected to congress you would be able to implement well i i think my campaign is about big ideas and what i'm talking about in our campaign is taking the power back from washington and sending it back to the states and the people and that's going to require taking the the power away from the establishment of both parties both parties have gotten us into this mess but i think we need to be block granting monies back to the states whether it's transportation education whatever and let the legislators and the governors and the people of the states make those decisions on how the monies are spent another way to take power from washington and give it to the people is through a a flat tax or a consumption tax let the people decide how to spend their money rather than the politicians and the bureaucrats telling them how to do that we've we've talked about that numerous times and we had a conversation not too long ago i was in a conversation with somebody oh um dr annette bosworth she wants to be the next united states senator uh from south dakota she's a republican and she promotes that realistically speaking is that going to happen well it did in the 80s when i worked for the congressman they passed the bradley gephardt legislation which made a very flat tax with i think two two brackets at that time that was a democrat republican bipartisan bill i think the country is ready for it and frankly we need that in order to stimulate some growth i mean the tax code is hampering uh hampering things down almost as much as regulations out in washington we talk to people all the time farmers business people especially small business people bankers and these regulations and what coming out of washington are just crushing business and driving up consumer costs okay so you're doing the typical republican mantra of getting there's too much regulation so name three or four that if you're there you want to wipe out well right now i think you're seeing a big one coming out of the epa which is going to effectively impose a cap and trade type of environment on the coal industry and when you wipe out the coal industry you're going to drive up electricity rates for the people across the country so that's in that's a proposal right now if it's will is it possible that could get enacted before your election in november and swearing in in january i don't believe that that that rule would be promulgated and implemented before then it's it's open for discussion now and uh congressman walls just last week voted to sustain that the republicans tried to block that okay um i want to go back to agriculture for a minute and i know you're southwest minnesota so i have a sense of where you're coming from can you explain to me why we are subsidizing peanuts and cotton and and i'm not asking that in a mean-spirited heartland of america thing but i just don't get that well the you know the farm bill is a very complicated bill and it's put together with a lot of different interests obviously i i'm by the way i'm from south central minnesota the city of blue earth is where i live right off uh nice little place there yeah driving along the interstate you got to allow wonderful high fencing there by blue earth because you got all those deer that try and cross the interstate yeah and the jolly green giant oh yeah we'll come over and see them sometimes but no you know the thing about the farm bill is uh i believe we have to sustain family farming as best as possible where i think you can make some inroads down the road is to take a look at uh either the size of farms or the the values that the the farmers that uh are working the land and so forth and and maybe make some changes but here's here's where i come down whatever changes we make to agriculture we have to make sure that they can be phased in over time so they don't pull the rug out from under farmers who have you know built up to a demand or gotten used to certain programs if we we have to make sure that we don't do anything to disrupt our economy here in southern minnesota because if we do it's going to it's going to have a ripple effect across the board it's going to hurt people very much one of the big catching points this last time around was whether and i'm gonna say food stamps but that's not the right term anymore but most people know what that is whether that should have been part of the the farm bill or not what do you think well at the time that when i when i started running they asked me those questions and i just predicted that ultimately the republicans would tie those the nutrition programs and the farm bill back together because they wouldn't want 500 ag groups mad at them going into the election and by golly that turned out to be the case okay so that's where it belongs well yeah i think in the future we have another farm bill in five years we can make some gains what we need for these nutrition or food stamp programs is uh work for welfare type of reforms we can go in there and make these programs work ultimately the best thing for the people is to have a strong economy and to have a strong economy we have to get the government off the bus off businesses back especially small business which is hurting right now we're going to take another break jim hagedorn is with us this is vpu no oh 26 minutes after four o'clock jim hagedorn republican conservative republican blue earth minnesota he wants to be the congressman from the first condition congressional district that is southwest minnesota he is here uh doing the flying the flag thing in sioux falls because the media is here and uh for southwest minnesota and uh so we're chatting with him about what he wants to do if he's congressman okay pointed question you have said more than once now about rules on businesses rules and regulations on businesses and how bad that is and you want to change that and get rid of that i got to ask you name two things that your people are telling you are really onerous and are messing up their businesses in southwest minnesota well i'll give you one it's out of the dodd-frank act and you're talking to if you talk to oh the finance bill oh yeah you talk to a small regional bank anything under 350 million they'll tell you that they're having a hard time making loans to consumers for either business or to help them get into homes or whatever and it's a it's a huge problem for them a lot of people think if you're under 350 million you're gonna be swallowed up or go out of business that's how bad and onerous that bill is the congressman walls voted for it i'm for its repeal i'll give you another example you want to repeal the whole bill yes we went from too big to fail to too too big to fail in my estimation i think it's just making big bank banks big banks more powerful okay another one would be epa regulations coming out either against farmers with their combines or in this case we talked to a company in jackson minnesota they make manifolds for big trucks those devices go on there they help the trucks get more power they help the trucks get more gas better gas mileage and less emissions and the epa comes in and says prove to us that you're not harming the environment and they said well no prove to us that we are it doesn't work that way and so this little company might have to spend a million dollars to stay in business well they don't have a million dollars of course not and when they go out of business what happens 13 or 14 people in the city of jackson lose their jobs and these people lose their livelihoods that's a government that is so big and so powerful and out of whack that it needs to be stymied okay final question uh and this affects everybody listening to us whether they're in minnesota uh iowa or south dakota um the lewis and clark pipeline yeah i'm sure you were up to speed on that big time so who what do what is the delegation in the three states doing wrong that they are unable to crack the bureaucracies to get that get that funded properly i i can't tell you why it's taken decades now to get that thing done but senator bill weber over in minnesota representative schumacher representative hamilton very concerned about this i've been speaking with them i you know we had a trillion dollar stimulus bill passed here a few years ago congressman wallace voted for where's the money how come things like this don't get done that's that's a disgrace and the people there are counting on this and we have to deliver that's that's a project i've been looking at for many many months okay we're out of time and you're perspiring so it did my job thank you it's been a pleasure i appreciate it jim hagedorn southwest minnesota uh they're coming up in on april 5th or actually there's a deal would you say rock county rock county and laverne tomorrow night tomorrow night and uh what wherein there's pizza ranch actually in la vernon okay where people gather absolutely okay and you'll be there

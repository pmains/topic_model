FORWARD WITH IT. I WOULD PUT IT AT THE TOP OF THAT LIST, REVERENT. WE MADE A SERIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS IN OUR REPORT ABOUT HOW TO PROTECT THE COUNTRY GOING FORWARD. URJUST LIKE THE 9/11 COMMISSION DID, AND JUST LIKE THE 9/11 COMMISSION, IT TOOK TIME TO MAKE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS LOT. IT'S VERY LIKELY WILL GET A HOUSE UNDER KEVIN MCCARTHY IN THE QANON LEADERSHIP OF THAT CONFERENCE TO GO ALONG WITH FORMS TO PROTECT US FROM ANOTHER JANUARY 6TH, SINCE THEY WERE SUPPORTERS OF THE EFFORT TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION. THAT WORK MADE FOLLOWING THE FIRST INSTANCE TO THE SENATE TO DO, WE DID OUR OVERSIGHT ON THE JANUARY SIX COMMITTEE. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT NEEDS TO BRING ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE FORM OF JUSTICE. I THINK THE SENATE CAN PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN HELPING US BRING ABOUT THE REFORMS NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE COUNTRY IN THE FUTURE. >> CONGRESSMAN, YOU MENTIONED BRAZIL. I NEED YOUR REACTION TO THE NEWS COMING OUT OF BRAZIL THIS AFTERNOON. THOUSANDS OF SUPPORTERS OF FORMER PRESIDENT BOLSONARO HAVE STORMED GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS IN THE CAPITAL OF BRASILIA, ACCORDING TO THE NEW YORK TIMES. THE PROTESTERS HAVE REACHED RESULTS CONGRESS, PRESIDENTIAL OFFICES, AND IN THE SUPREME COURT. BOLSONARO, A RIGHT-WING POPULIST WHO HAD MANY COMPARED TO FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP, HAD HIS CLAIMS OF VOTER FRAUD REJECTED IN THE RESILIENT COURTS. HIS PARTY HAS EVEN -- EVEN FIND FOR 1 MILLION DOLLARS FOR WHAT THE JUDGE CALLED BAD FAITH LITIGATION. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS? >> REVEREND, WE ARE SEEING THE PERNICIOUS AND CONTINUING INFLUENCE OF DONALD TRUMP AND HIS ENABLERS, THE DAMAGE THEY DID AT HOME AND THE TERRIBLE EXAMPLE THAT SET FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD. IT BEGAN EARLY IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WITH DONALD TRUMP CALLING FOR EXAMPLE THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE. WORDS ECHOED BY PEOPLE LIKE BASHAR AL-ASSAD. YOU SEE IN BOLSONARO, IN BRAZIL, SUPPORTERS DECIDED, IF THE U.S. SUPPORTERS OF THE PRESIDENT CAN OVERRUN GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS AND ATTACK GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS WHEN THEY LOSE AN ELECTION WITH FALSE CLAIMS OF FRAUD, THEN WHY CANNOT WE DO THAT IN BRAZIL? IT'S QUITE TERRIBLE. WE SHOULD BE THE MODEL FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD IN TERMS OF PERFECTING DEMOCRACY, A NEVER-ENDING CHALLENGE, EVEN FOR THE BEST, MOST ADVANCED DEMOCRACIES. INSTEAD, WE PROVIDED AN EXAMPLE UNDER TRUMP WHICH CONTINUES WITH THE CHAOS UNDER HIS ACOLYTES NOW IN THE HOUSE LEADERSHIP. IT PROVIDED AN EXAMPLE FOR AGENTS OF CHAOS AROUND THE WORLD. THOSE WHO ARE ATTACKING DEMOCRACY TAKE IT ONE FINAL STEP FURTHER, REVEREND. CONCERNED ABOUT WITH THIS NEW MAJORITY WILL DO FOR OUR SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRACIES LIKE UKRAINE. WE OUGHT TO DRAWN SEPARATION FROM THE COURAGE THEY ARE USING TO DEFEND THEIR DEMOCRACY, NOT JOINING WITH FORCES ATTACKING DEMOCRACY. >> ALL. RIGHT WE WILL HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE. WE ARE OUT OF TIME.

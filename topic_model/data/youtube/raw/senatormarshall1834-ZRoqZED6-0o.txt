now to the issue of business experience let's bring in kansas republican senator roger marshall he's a doctor with years of business experience running a practice and a hospital and is on the small uh business uh committee so uh let's just put this up on the screen because this is a pretty interesting report from the committee to unleash prosperity 62 of biden appointees who deal with economic policy regulation commerce energy and finance have virtually no business experience only one in eight has extensive business experience and that average business experience is 2.4 years your business owner for 25 years you went from five employees to more than 300 employees what do you make of this lack of experience at this crucial time well john it looks like the white house has about zero business experience with the exception of hunter biden's consulting business in the ukraine and russia but what being a business owner taught me and helped prepare me to be a better congressman and senator is to understand how government regulations impact a business and disproportionately impact small businesses i understand that that regulation creates uncertainty over regulation creates consolidations of industry and it hurts the economy so i think that helps me understand as i look at legislation going forward it helps me anticipate some of those unattended consequences uh senator i you know i got a flag here supporters of the president would push back right and they would say you know there's plenty of folks here in washington to represent business interests um the job of a lot of these folks is to steer economic policy you don't have to have run a business to know what's in the nation's interests we got plenty of policy wonks what do you say well would you want someone running our army that's never been in the military right i really do think it's about the economy all people talk about home back home is about inflation and every economic decision this president has made so far has been wrong i think it's good to have advisers but eventually we need a commander-in-chief that understands business i'm telling you what that's why people like president trump is that people respected his business acumen whoever's giving him advice either he's taken bad advice or he's making bad decisions he being the president you know when you take a look at people like jody powell and janet yellen they missed the cues that inflation was was on the way janet yellen said yeah we got it wrong pete boudej his answer to high gas prices is go out and buy an electric car and yet they're the ones who are tasked with for as little as 60 000 by the way but they're the ones who are tasked with trying to get this animal under control let me go to gas prices because this is what the president said pretty consistently for months about why gas prices were going up listen here today's inflation report confirmed what americans already know putin's price hike is hitting america hard food and gas prices are going to be elevated by putin's price hike let me start with the putin price hike high gas prices and energy prices 70 percent of the increase inflation inflation was the consequence of putin's price height i'm doing everything within my power by executive orders to bring down the price and address the putin price site he blamed the price of gasoline and everything else that was following it on vladimir putin in the war in ukraine that hasn't ended it's still going on and yet gasoline prices are coming down and now the white house is saying way to go joe biden you're right you're bringing down the price of gas what do you say well john i was just back home this weekend visiting with some of my classmates and all they talked about was inflation inflation inflation it's the price of gasoline so at the pump back home right now the price of gasoline is still twice of what it was when joe biden took over i grew up in the in the oil industry i understand exactly what's going on this president is creating uncertainty going back to that business acumen again this president's creating uncertainty he's declared war on the oil and gas industry so long term why would you invest 10 million dollars a hundred million dollars in a new oil patch if you if it's going to take two to five years to start seeing some return on that investment uh we'll take the little short term gain but the average kansas family is still spending seven hundred dollars a month more on base basic necessities of life and joe biden owns it he cannot fool the american public so senator i know you're a solutions oriented policy maker where does the president go from here what is the nationwide fix for inflation well i think inflation starts with the energy right that it accounts for about 25 30 percent of the inflation issues start with energy so our president needs to go to kansas and visit with the people that drill oil for an invitation it is an absolute invitation we'd be glad to have him it's a much shorter trip than all the way to saudi arabia but these folks are afraid to drill because of the lack of certainty they need some long-term uh confidence that that we're going to be still using elect using oil and gas cars in the in the future as well so we need certainty america can solve the problems right now why should we depend upon foreign decisions when we have americans that can solve the problem yeah foreigners aren't stepping up anyway in fact a lot of analysts are saying that the reduction in the price of oil now is because of uncertainty about future demand so nothing to do with it's got everything to do with high prices but nothing to do with whatever policy might have come out of the white house senator roger marshall good to talk to you thank you for coming in john thanks for having me hey you have some good news foxy

thank you mr bynum and i'd like to discuss as well the importance of rural broadband internet access as we build this infrastructure bill georgia's department of community affairs has reported that approximately 70 percent of the locations lacking high speed internet access are in rural georgia there's particular need in the rural areas around augusta uh and in rural areas of south georgia south of savannah and around valdosta for example can you please discuss the economic impact and the importance of expanding rural broadband internet access uh particularly in south georgia and rural georgia certainly and again it's very similar conditions as we find across the rest of the deep south and it will be critical for the administration to connect infrastructure resources um through with cdfis who make sure that those funds reach the most vulnerable areas as we have seen during the pandemic the lack of broadband has limited access to educational opportunities for low-income and rural communities telehealth is limited because of the lack of access to rural broadband we cannot provide adequate mobile banking services in the absence of adequate broadband infrastructure and so it is to get these needs to the communities that are so vitally underserved without being subject to the whims of um southern state policymakers that have a unfortunately deplorable track record of directing resources to the most vulnerable communities particularly communities of color it's critical that resources be directed to be funneled directly to grassroots um on the ground organizations such as community development financial institutions

thank you very much mr. chairman to you and to the ranking member today is a very good day for the House Foreign Affairs Committee because all of these pieces of legislation really speak to the moral high-ground that I think reflects American values American values of human rights American values of freedom of speech freedom of religion freedom to gather let me just point out a couple of the pieces of legislation that I think for me are personal the impacts of US leadership and responding to displacement of refugees around the world is something that as always in the past stood out for America as a beacon of light around the world and the refugee crisis that we have and our own borders is one that reminds us of the fact that we have a role to play anti-semitism sadly continues to sit still exist around the world and it's fitting and appropriate that we recognize the attack that took place in July 1994 in Buenos Aires reminding all of us that in fact anti-semitism still sadly today occurs around the world and we must call it out for where and when we see it having been to Sudan I can tell you that the resolution HR 432 is fitting and appropriate the horrific violation of human rights in Sudan has been well known and demonstrated and clearly even with the change of the horrific regime that perpetuated the violation of Human Rights we still see people suffering in Sudan we must call it out for what it is and clearly America is a beacon of religious freedom throughout our history it's appropriate that the ethnic and religious minorities in Iraq part of the world that many of us have been to in which we've expended a great deal of America and resources we must remind those in Iraq that they have a responsibility in this area finally as was noted before by my colleagues it is Gay Pride Month and the LGBTI community has had a long and difficult journey not only in our country but around the world countries in which these abilities of people to enjoy their own basic human rights to love the persons that they that they choose in consensual relations in some parts of the world we know is is punishable by death and that is simply simply unacceptable and so these pieces of legislation separately and taken together I think make a incredibly strong statement today for the Foreign Affairs Committee and a tribute to the leadership on a bipartisan basis that America is still a beacon of light and that we still as a country can come together and maintain the moral high ground and I think this package of bills reflects that sentiment and it's something that we should all be proud of today I'll yield back the balance of my time but I want to commend my colleagues and the authors of these fine pieces of legislation and look forward to supporting the entire package I yield back the balance of my time thank you Jim

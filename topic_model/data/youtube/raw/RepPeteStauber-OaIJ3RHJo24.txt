good evening everyone welcome to congressman pete sauber telephone town hall we are glad that you joined us this evening tonight you'll have the opportunity to hear about the many issues that are important to Minnesota's eight congressional districts as well as what congressman Sabra has been working on in Washington you will also be able to speak directly to his courage and sauver to ask the question we look forward to thoughtful and respectful dialogue a reminder to please press 3 to ask a question at any time during the call again press 3 to ask a question at any time thank you well good evening everyone this is congressman pete sauber i'm so glad that you all can join me for my first telephone town hall I will start this call with the brief overview of recent legislation action and then open up the floor for you to ask questions as you heard Kelsey say please press 3 if you would like to ask a question and just for reference I am fighting a bad cold so I will be checking my voice every now and then so please be patient as many of you know Minnesota is blessed with an abundance of natural resources that can and will lead us into the 21st century if responsibly developed for that reason the first bill I introduced with the lakes pure national forest land exchange acts the purpose of this bill is was to codify a land exchange between polyMet and the United States Forest Service into law so that polyMet can begin to develop the abundance of natural resources in the north pet or body even though this land exchange went through a full environmental review and was completed in June Alaska there are few anti-mining groups who hope to stop it in its final hour this makes my legislation critically important and remember if you have a question press star 3 many of us submit a soda have been eagerly awaiting for this land exchange as it would be a win-win for our state not only will it create jobs for hardworking folks here at home but it will also increase the public's access to trails and recreation timber resources wild rice waters and 2,000 acres of wetlands much like my predecessor former congressman Rick Nolan who introduced a similar bill last Congress I believe that we can respond to be mine and preserve our environment I am proud that my first piece of legislation will help to unleash the economic engine in northeastern Minnesota and I am committed to seeing it passed in this Congress I am fully committed to projects that would bring economic prosperity to our region and that's why I was incredibly disappointed by our governor Walz recent decision to appeal the regulatory approval of Enbridge lines three pipeline project we all know that line three is rapidly corroding and the safe delivery of the energy product on which we all rely is dependent on its replacement additionally the construction of this pipeline will provide thousands of jobs for hardworking Minnesotans and generate millions of dollars in property tax revenue for rural schools although governor Wallace's decision needles needlessly the phase delays are the project I'm confident that with the bipartisan support that this project holds it will go forward as planned if we are to achieve economic prosperity for every Minnesotan it has a paramount importance that we also reverse the decades of bad trade deals that have been disadvantaged in the American worker for decades to give you an example of the bad trade deals I'm talking about you know the European Union currently places a sixty eight point two percent tariff on American butter while America only opposes a 2.8 percent tariff on butter from the European Union these bad trade deals have resulted in the thousands of jobs the exodus of thousands American companies overseas in the and a failure to sell American products in the global market you know Minnesota workers can compete with anyone in the world so long as there is a level and fair playing field it's high time that we put these workers first which is why I helped introduce the reciprocal trade agreement to give president the tools to the go sheet fairer trade deals and tourism is also a huge driver of the economy in northern Minnesota and that's why it was incredibly concerning when the Boundary Waters new area reservation system crashed not long after its launch the morning of January 30th after the website crashed I held a forum up in Ely to give business owners and citizens the platform to express their concerns on how the crash would impact their businesses many express their disappointment with the Forest Service stating that the agency did not listen to their initial concerns on switching the reservation system from the successful lottery system excuse me to a first-come first-serve system after the crash the Forest Service assured us that the system would be back up and running by February 27th I along with many of you were incredibly disappointed to learn that they delayed the relaunch date to March 4th this is not the urgency we were expecting while I understand and appreciate that the Forest Service wants the relaunch of the reservation system to be a successful one we are another week closer to the busy season in the Boundary Waters my staff and I have been keeping a close eye on the unfolding situation and we are currently looking at ways in which we can alleviate the toll this crisis have had on Minnesota communities I am so honored and humbled to have the opportunity to represent you in the Congress with that being said if you want excuse me if you want to ask a question remember press star 3 and we'll get started with the questions but thanks everybody for taking the time and again it's such an honor and a privilege to represent the hard-working people from the great state of Minnesota and in particular the 8th congressional district alright well thank you again for joining congressman pete sauber hello to all don't forget to press star reach and your question in this queue up next we have keys Miller and he is from Luke he's employed to ask a question about multi-employer pension funds keep your now live on the hall I keep hi how you doing good I have a I'm a a retired Teamsters and I belong to the mall to the Teamsters union which is a multi union that is financially in trouble yes I I think you might have heard about this yes yep and I was just wondering what is your stance on this and how do you tell you feel that we can get this corrected so that we are going to lose that pension yeah the case I believe in people that work their entire lives that dedicated a certain part of their payroll to their pension how to have that pension when the time comes because you you've worked for it you've burned for it you've planned for it and I can tell you that I'm a co-sponsor and a strong supporter the butch Lewis legislation you know that make sure that these pensions stay strong and are viable for the people that paid it to them for many of you but maybe you don't know but I'm also on a pension it's the Peres pension in the state pension out of Minnesota and one of the things that you know I've always done throughout my 23-year police career was was put and save money for the pension in hopes and planning for retirement that that money would always be there so I am I am very very interested in this topic and I want to be able to do what we can to preserve and strengthen the pensions that you paid into Keith and that you deserve okay Thank You Keith so right now you're going to do a quick poll question so question is how do you prefer to receive updates from congressman pete sauber press 1 on your phone if you prefer telephone town hall press 2 if you prefer interview Town Hall again press 1 it's prefer telephone town hall and press 2 if you prefer in-person Town Hall all right thank you all right everyone just serve them just a reminder to press star three to enter a question in the heel and up next we have Jeff Larson from Hillman and he has a question on building the wall hi Jeff hi a little background on me I am a ivw member I'm also a trump supporter and I'm wondering what your status so what my status is supporting the land I think is what you you were talking about Jeff the the you know securing our our southern border is extremely important and you know from my law enforcement experience we are a nation Jeff of the rule of law and one of the things that we look at at our southern border and the Border Patrol and the Homeland Security are the experts down there and and we're seeing that you know ninety percent of our drugs are coming across the poorest southern border you know that's heroin methamphetamine cocaine fentanyl in addition to that and marijuana in addition to that Jeff is we have human trafficking victims being trafficked through that porous border along with illegal immigrants and you know we are a this nation was built on immigrants and we welcome immigrants today but come in our country legally and with reference to the wall I talked about in the campaign and the homeland security and the Border Patrol have identified really intense areas of crossing or they know that a wall would would work and it would slow down and in fact stop in certain areas much that's human trafficking that drugs being brought over and of course illegal immigration and it's a good it's an option in those very vast areas and we just had a briefing by a member of the National Guard who's a member of Congress who was down there for two weeks and the people awesome two Border Patrol are being overrun at times and this is the request for the five point three seven billion dollars that's a request that the administration is being is bringing forward because the Border Patrol and Homeland Security are requesting it Jeff so I am a supporter of strengthening and bringing credibility on our borders and the law or that physical barrier is just one part of it there's also Border Patrol agents there's also technology you know such as infrared and night vision and and and barbed wire in certain areas and there's a jet there's certain parts of the southern border that would never need a law just because of the the geography and so I will end it by this Jeff I'm a supporter of securing our southern border to reduce the illegal immigration the human trafficking that's happening every single day across that border and the illegal immigration we are a nation of law and order alright thank you again for joining colors and soldered telephone town hall again don't forget to press star free to enter a question in the queue before we get to our next question we're going to do another poll the question is in your opinion do you think we need to divorce to here our border if you say yes press key one if you think no press key to again if you give answers yep press key one and if you do get hurt no press key to okay so the next question we are going to go to is Donna and Donna from Hill City Donna has a question about broadband sonnet you are now live I got a good evening good evening I I am a senior citizen that lives in rural Hill City my children live down in the metropolitan area yep I believe it it has been said a number of times everyone should have high-speed Internet I have talked to the telephone people up here we have century tell they just laid fiber-optic down Highway 200 but that's about a mile from my house and because there's only four of us on this road they said they will not spend the money for high-speed Internet I thought that was one of the campaign promises that was said that everyone should be entitled to that data that's a absolutely great question and I want to tell you that that's a high priority of mine where I'm on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee which is many of us on the committee support rural broadband and I've said this before that rural America is just as important as a metro areas and we know that the high-speed reliable internet it's not a luxury anymore it's a necessity it's a necessity for a schools it's a necessity for rural hospitals it's a necessity for people that want to order off the internet for example or connect another way so Donna I am I am a very very big supporter of increasing the funding for it in fact the the broad the most in the most recent funding bill Donna you know that I voted for there was over 16 million dollars for rural broadband expansion and that's a good start there's still plenty of more to do and we're going to do that but I and I have to tell you that the situation you ran into we have to somehow come up with a funding mechanism that equitable that allows you and your three other neighbors even though you're you know down the road to be able to get connected because it's just it just doesn't seem right and so I want to be a and it will be a supporter for real broadband there's so many positives that can come out of it you can have business expansion in rural Minnesota like I said we can keep her hospitals and open and you know rural broadband is needed for tella telehealth and telemedicine so Donna just know that I'm a supporter and in this in this last funding bill there was over 16 million dollars for rural broadband and there's a many Ruth congressional members on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee that I'm a part of so thank you donna for that question all right Thank You Donna see you again for joining turns and keeps others color Town Hall if you would ask a question please press star 3 up next we will need to take a question from Kay from Park Rapids ok I have a question about mining ok you are now live at with the congressman good evening care how are you well pretty good thank you for anything it's just great yeah all get together thank you so much you're welcome you were talking originally that you sponsored a bill if I understood properly it was regarding mining in a transfer of land what is the name of that bill and what is the number okay thanks for the call kay and it's it's great to hear from them it's HR House Resolution HR 5 to 7 and it's the Superior National Forest land exchange act that's the it's very similar to the to the legislation that former congressman Nolan brought forward that that passed in the house but stalled in the Senate and that's a bill to codify that land exchange between polyMet the u.s. Forest Service which is a win-win for not only the Forest Service but Minnesotans in general okay okay so once again for joining on I don't forget to press r3 and your question in the queue up next we are going to take a question from this Kelly Jo her legs um Kelly has a question on the caracal right or Alive legislation Kelly you are now live at the congressman great to hear from you Kelly how are you doing Kelly can you hear it going all right one more try Helen here yes I can hear you hi Kelly okay very good thank you for the invite congressman I am just trying to find the number for the bill it's the parental rights amendment okay the it wasn't that the borderline abortion Protection Act is that the ones you referring to okay so the Kelliher WIC is talking about the parental right back and I at this point I'm not exactly sure there's there hasn't been a piece of legislation at least in 116th Congress that I'm aware of but Kelly what I will say is this I'm uh I'm blessed to be a father of four and married to my my very best friend and I believe that in almost all instances that the parents can make to make the best decisions for their kids I will say for my law enforcement background unfortunately it's not 100% of the parents because we find some dereliction in parental responsibilities and duty periodically but for the most part you know I believe that parents makes a great decision and should be the you know should be the route be responsible for decisions to other younger children but you but Kelly just so you know I have a co-sponsor of the boring life survivors Protection Act them and and I will will always stand up for you for life as you know so thanks for the call Kelly and and thanks for joining us okay Thank You Terry and we here again for joining Carson Steve Souders telethon hall don't forget to press star three to enter a question in the queue so up next we are going to take a question from Jeff free from kidding Jeffrey has a question about the viewless camp roll Jeffrey you are now live with congressman pete sauber all right yeah probably good pretty good congressman I'm good thanks for taking my call and thanks for the invite for this tonight oh you betcha my question is that I know congressman Duffy next door here and had introduced to introduced legislation to take god the timber wolf off the endangered species but it sounds like that's fizzled out as a hunter sportsmen I don't want to see the wolf go away but just try to control the mean so we can all kind of be happy I live right in Hibbing and I can tell you I found where they've been just behind my house here a little too close to town I have two little kids and wondering what is going on and where that is in the in your your chambers at this point thanks for that thanks for the call and question yep that's uh I do support congressman Duffy and and also congressman Peterson from the Western District of Minnesota 7 indeed listing the gray wolf because as as you know I am a hunter too and what we're seeing is the decline of deer population in some areas and what's happening is is that there was the delisting of the wolves and there was a President Obama appointed a judge out of DC who changed that what we wanted to do was D list the roles and allow the respective state DNR's to manage it and do we felt and I feel that the Minnesota state DNR can would manage it much better and and being able to remove those loosened wolves that are in town killing livestock killing dogs and so we're still right we still want to push that board and excuse me everyone I'm battling a cold but to jump to your point I want to be an original co-sponsor as soon as it is reduced reintroduced in this Congress because I - like you don't want to fully get rid of them that's not that's not the case but to be able to manage them so our children can enjoy deer hunting what have you and I know the Minnesota deer hunters Association which I am a member support that too so Jeff thanks for taking the call and have a wonderful evening all right up next we have Linda and with it from Lakeside Township and I have a question about pharmaceutical costs in how to provide programs to people with addiction so Linda you are now life is occurrences I limit hello mr. Stuber how are you I'm digging out on Lake Mille Lacs oh wow yes yeah we've had quite the wild weather over here but anyway my question for you sir is as you know pharmaceutical costs are a great concern for many people especially up here we've seen people who are going to have to make choices between food and medicine and I'd like to know what you're going to do to prevent that and to help pharmaceutical cost be reduce that's the first part of my question okay second part has to do with addiction and up in our rural areas here we have a large problem with addiction and with helping these people who have a serious disease to become reoriented into our society to become productive members and I'd like to know what you do to support programs to assist this Linda that is that is a great question and I want to answer both of those questions because it's so important right now I can say that and you know just recently I voted to invest almost two million dollars in funding in the most recent funding bill are two billion for the comprehensive addiction recovery reactance this Keirsey ara Act and this funding goes directly to the treatment and prevent prevention programs you know that's a good start there's more to do and we know that from my background as a law enforcement officer I saw the addiction and I saw the devastation and not only does to the individual but what it does to the family in the community and the whole plan is to get the addict the treatment that he or she needs to get them to be productive members of society and addiction crosses all spectrums and it touches almost everybody in the community and I think that many many of us know of people or families that have been affected by it for sure the addiction one of the things I looked at on particular addiction is okay let's make sure that we treat the individual and then also prevent not only he or she but others from becoming addicted and then we prosecute the criminals who are selling the drugs who are who are peddling these illegal drugs life killing drugs to our youth who have the rest of their life to long - you know enjoy life we're losing them at an early age and so the addictive and the addiction investments we make I really support them because it's the right thing to do and I've seen it firsthand and so we know that people that are addicted to drugs we know through good treatments and therapies that they can become productive members our society so let's get to the drug prices it's unbelievable the costs of the drugs that are going up in in the Duluth News Tribune I don't know if you saw it Linda and others but they had a an individual talking about what it costs for a vial of insulin 65 I think it was sixty or sixty-five dollars in the country of Canada and 365 here and one of the things that our president is stating is that we the American worker the American family are paying for other countries to have cheaper drugs and so I asked the question how explain that to me so here's what it was explained to me so let's just say an drug X let's say is it costs three hundred sixty five dollars for example well that same drug company who's got the patents will go to a socialized country like Canada and Canada will only say we can't pay 365 for it we're only paying 240 or 200 for the drug company has to accept that because Canada vote it refuses because they don't have the money to and so the drug companies are in my my estimation need to work that heavier in other parts of the world that they sell that drug to make them pay their fair share and not make the American family make up for the difference and nobody you should choose nobody Linda should choose between a drug that they need to be healthy or stay alive or food that's unconscionable that's immoral in our society and I am working every day to ensure that that those people that need those life-saving drugs or daily drugs have them at a reasonable cost so they can enjoy you know each and every day and enjoy their life so thanks for the question Linda okay so up next we are going to take a question from Liz goodra she has a question on gun control - Lin you are now live at the congressman good evening then good evening thank you for taking my call hello I would like to know how the Republicans in the Congress are going to keep control on the Democrats from pushing through gun control and also and I don't know how much you have to do with it but the red flag law that's that they're trying to push here in Minnesota yeah Lynn thanks for the thanks for the call as you may or may not know I was a victim of a violent crime in 1995 and Dalls I survived a gunshot to the head while off-duty and then while on duty a perpetrator pulled a pistol on me pointed it at my head pull the trigger and by the grace of God it malfunctioned I am still the supporter of our Second Amendment these two individuals that tried to take my life were criminals there is nobody that wants a criminal a drug dealer somebody who's going through a crisis to be in possession of a firearm and so when I look at this you know the Second Amendment the right to keep and bear arms I'm looking at to have the ability to come up with some common-sense legislation right now the speaker policy the Democratic Party are putting forth a couple of resolutions that have nothing that that would not have stopped any of the mass shootings there's going to be a resolution or what piece of legislation that's going to be brought up on the Republican side by Doug Collins congressman Doug Collins that's a mass violence prevention act and what it what it's going to do Lynn is it's going to allow law enforcement both Department of Justice FBI local police ships to have a fusion center so when the Parkland individual Department criminal who gave give us 29 and I mean us I mean law enforcement and civilians 29 opportunities to say to inter intervene we won't we won't drop the ball it's excuse me it's like all hands on deck when somebody in attends the Facebook post or social media says they want to be for example a school shooter that that gets immediate attention and I think that in in that legislation from representative Collins the MVP resolution or legislation it protects our rights while addressing the problem you know we want to make sure that we identify and get all hands on deck and I think the communication along the law-enforcement line is critically important and once we act we know that there in many of these cases there was there was evidence or there was a concern by somebody all we had to do is get it in the rightful hands and you know and go from there so the the handgun the gun control measures as stated that the Democratic Party and Speaker Pelosi are putting out have done nothing and will do nothing to prevent the mass shootings that we've seen in this country and you know I want to be able to protect the individual law-abiding citizen the right to keep and bear arms to protect him or herself from death or great bodily harm okay thank you live for that question so up next we are going to take a call from Jack from bemidji he has a question about and resist and purchase 93 Jack you are now live with congressman Thomas good good evening jack how are you and it was a great story the Badger State Beavers trying to get home from their win awesome how about that isn't it so great so thank you for taking my call up to a representative strawberry or when you were in Bemidji here last campaigning last year overnight I think you're a very good very good candidate very good representative I am and major on the Transportation Committee I thought maybe you'd be a very good one to talk to about the pipeline we have seven pipelines going through committee there's no two million dollars 2 million barrels a day going through here we've hadn't had haven't had a leak right around Bemidji for years and I don't know what the big problem is about pipelines what scares me is that the railroad dumped 40 you know what 41 car loads of old coal into the st. croix last couple years a couple of weeks ago yes a Louis and st. Louis River okay and then they about day or two later there was a 28 cars derailed in Canada was oil in it and they had leaks in them and there was leaking what would have been happening if that would've been a reverse situation that we've been oil going into the st. Croix I think see people are really reverse sinking and the thing about oil is receiving a couple hundred thousand dollars a year here in Beltrami County from the oil pipeline which i think is which is denied the railroad do not pay anything to us for for transporting across our lines for that and the dividends that they pay there's none they don't pay any as a railroad don't pay any divinity they're a dividend paid by the Umbridge which is used by myself for instance as a retired person I get a nice chunk of money every month for them or every three months yeah and I think it's about time that we get done playing games with the few people I think when ona and a few of her aides are crazy I talked to people that were at that stop down at the thing in North Dakota when you had that stop be chair and this guy said a friend of his went go down go down to there from Bismarck now you're 100 miles on yesterday he said because he could get on her and get great meals yes I didn't I didn't want a protest but he said today has the best meals in the country and yet it somebody supporting them yeah jack let me first off Jack thanks for the comments I will tell you that I support and bridge line three and here's why the experts have said that the current line isn't as safe as it should be and there's corrosion and they've been working for a number of years to get a replacement line you know purchasing land in paying you know for the line to be put in and and one of the things that we have to understand is if pipelines are a very safe way to move oil and so building they're going to bring great paying jobs for our union members and and not only to build to maintain and they're going to use a 21st century technology in that pipe to be able to monitor more so than the one the older pipe right now that the experts have said it's time we you know we redo that and you know we always I am a First Amendment supporter we always appreciate and I always support you know people in their right to peacefully protest and when I say peacefully I mean peacefully protest not not causing any bodily harm or damage to equipment or property and so Jack I'm I'm a supporter of the line three pipeline and I know that I believe it's the right thing to do bring the oil here in a safe 21st century technology pipe and bringing great union jobs not only for the development of the line but for the future so Jack thank you for calling it from the great city of Bemidji alright hey you jack and thank you again for joining congressman Pete Stoddard hello townhall up next we're gonna take a question from Carol it's or they want to know about the green new deal so Carol and norm you're now live with congressman solder hello Carol web form hi thank you don't food thanks for taking us oh I'm going to go first of course but first of all I tell you I think you're doing a very good job and I think you comments about the wall you hear me yes I can yep but also I'm glad that you support Trump because we certainly do so there are just a couple comments before I turn over to my husband I've just horrified about the green new deal in all the Democrats that support it it's just that O'Keefe person is crazy anyway also then infanticide issues in Virginia and New York I mean it's just it's just unspeakable the the issues they're talking about so those are my two comments if you want to have the comments on that that's fine dad turn it over to my husband I'll just give ya I'm work I'm work I'm worried about sorry can i I'll just give you you can I just I'm worried about the universal health care business taking over Medicare for first our seniors that means that we will not have much as older people yeah II so Carolyn or my appreciate the comical take care of comments first on the green on the green new deal you know the office a former member of the Office of Budget and Management said that that's going to cost between 51 trillion and 93 trillion that's just an ethicist initial estimates they're looking at the green new deal costing every household in this country approximately six hundred thousand dollars to retrofit that would have you now I I spoke on the floor of the house last night against this I talked about just last week in International Falls and Ely it was it was really cold like 71 below the windchill you natural gas heats our house and heats our water for our showers and we all want energy the all-of-the-above energy possibilities you know which includes so when hydro nuclear natural gas and fossil feels that that's part of where we are right now but not to have the government push it upon us force it upon us and in this particular case in ten years my colleague from New York wants to eliminate air travel in ten years wants to eliminate mining in ten years once that eliminates fossil fuel use in ten years and even a moderate Democrats don't understand where she's coming from and I think that it's not a good policy and this green new deal you talk about the one you talked about Medicare and Social Security this green new deal would devastate Social Security and Medicare those are two programs that you and Channel paid into and that this country promised you and that you deserve and I will fight for them and I will not support the green new deal there's much better ways to use alternative sources of fuel and energy and this is just not it all right Thank You Carol in North so once again please press star brief answer a question in the queue of next year were you taking a question from new who is from Ely he has a question about the Boundary Waters on permitting uh so new you are now alive I knew it hi hi a representative Stover I really want to thank you for doing this yeah well not in the Elliots really a hot topic for us that have lived here for many years and and have been fortunate enough to enjoy the Boundary Waters Canoe Area and especially the more motorized use for those of us that are older I I've been going to the Boundary Waters for sixty years and don't have a lot of years left and now we're faced with a situation where trying to get these permits is is just about impossible our our internet service is very poor here at my house anyhow and I also am NOT computer literate thankfully my wife can do some of that but I just don't understand you know we live in a democracy in the Forest Service administers the Superior National Forest and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in the most undemocratic way I could possibly imagine and I think it's just a travesty that they're allowed to do this kind of thing we had a system that nobody liked but was fair in a lottery system and now they're trying to shove this down our throats and it's just the the last the latest thing that they've imposed on the people of the Iron Range and the people that enjoy the Boundary Waters Canoe Area with motor usage and I I know you support us but is there anything that we can do to to try and make these jokers be held responsible and I go back to a lottery system it's the only fair way to do it because of so many reasons No thank you so much for the your question from the great city of Ely where with the windshield just a while back was 71 degrees below zero so do you bring up a very great topic it's it's perfect timing you know that I held that forum up in Ely because I was gravely concerned that the Forest Service did not listen to the Outfitters or the cooperatives and the citizens on this they said it was going to fail and the cease Forest Service didn't listen and sure enough if and then they said they're gonna roll on the 27th of February which is tomorrow and then they delayed it again this is just this is causing problems from Ely to Grand Marais the Outfitters in for the Boundary Waters you the Outfitters and the citizens that have used us know best and I was appalled when I helped but they're up and Ely when I think it was mr. waters said that he's been up there for 50 years in the Forest Service hasn't once listened to him I could I was appalled because I asked the people present note I said who is the federal government and I said we collectively are the federal government and for the u.s. Forest Service not to recognize and understand our wants needs and desires to make this successful is unconscionable and just so you know tomorrow I will be introducing legislation on the House of Representatives for to fix this system permanently and to go back to the lottery system because I have had it with the United States Forest Service not supporting the people in northeastern Minnesota from Grand Marais to Ely and points in between that boundary was the crown jewel and we had outfitter Crumpler and citizens saying this is what we need and they didn't listen well you know what I am very good disgusted with the Forest Service and upset that this has to happen to our small businesses and the people that use and come and referee in the great state of Minnesota I just to a congress member from Illinois who comes up every single year to fish and he expected couldn't get the hotel because they weren't sure at the time and and there was some frustration so he's going to take a chance and book and see if he gets in because he enjoys her that's a crown jewel from our state it brings economics an economic driver it's a beautiful pristine wilderness we will keep it but the forest service will start to listen to the people of this country thanks Newt that was a great question [Music] next we review questions from Gary from Varna gary has a question on polyMet twin metal gary you are now live with congressman daughter I guess hey Pete how you doing I like to say congratulations on your victory thank you order also a son of a retired Duluth a police department employee I for your service there hey thank you yes um well as a boilermaker uh you know I've had fell a union member like to hear a little bit more what your plan is for polyMet twin medals um you know the the the coal fire situation going on in a you know in the state I know your your Union member of polyMet twin metals they will generate an awful lot of jobs for uh you know all of the trades you know across the board iron workers yeah you know electricians you know I on down the line yeah myself as a boilermaker uh I know they're proposed the the the house resolution but what can you do to try to convince some of the other people across the aisle you know to see the worth yes Gary that's a great question and I'm going to answer that as you know I have been certain I have said that polyMet we have we have laws environmental laws of state and federal that Polly that has exceeded it has met or exceeded every environmental standard there is and when that happens they should be allowed to move forward so once polyMet they are waiting on the last permit the fourth or wetland replacement to permit gary and and the record of decision that will come at the same time and that will polyMet will be the first copper nickel mining permit given by the state of minnesota and you know get that it's going to be about three million hours of union work to get the LGPL t v-- plant back up and running to be able to support the process and and not only to get LTV up and running but the continuous maintenance and operation for that facility is going to be great for the men and women in our trades it's because they're going to be generational jobs right here in the great state of Minnesota and as far as twin metal schools they have to follow the same process they have to meet or exceed every single environmental standard and when they do they ought to move forward know what I can do is try to educate DD anti-mining proud and say we can do both we can mine this copper nickel complex called the Duluth complex which is the biggest precious metal find in the world we can - here in Minnesota we can mine it safely and and we can keep our environment pristine using the 21st century technology so I am a supporter as long as every environmental standard is met and I'll give you an example just today Gary against the lands bill because it did not have it did not have the polyMet land exchange in it I tried my best - let the Democratic leadership and the Natural Resources Committee grow to say this is important for northeastern Minnesota these are good-paying jobs but I was met in opposition each time by a coal legislature member of Congress from st. Paul and she wouldn't allow it to go forward and you know I did what I could but when you're not in the majority you can't get these things through and you know I'm proud of the congressman Noah last year who stood up and when the House of Representatives when the Republicans were the majority they passed that they passed that lands though because they knew it was an it was an important part of northeastern Minnesota and the economy so I'm going to continue to fight for our way of life I'm going to continue to talk about that we are blessed with these medals and that they're actually become a national security asset for us and so I would much rather have our union members mining this copper nickel gold platinum palladium then somebody in a foreign country using title labor we do it the best we have the best standards we'll follow them and getting I hope that our union brothers and sisters are for work shortly was not only polyMet for sure but Enbridge as well okay everyone we have time for one more question we are going to be taking a question from Helga pelvis from Grand Rapids Paula you're not alive congressman's daughter good evening an hour ago from the great city Grand Rapids a good evening so I just wanna I don't have a question but I just want to tell like the story and my story you know everything immigration is another in the news so I want to talk as an immigrant I emigrated in 1960 took a United States when I was 16 I taught myself delay which went to school that my high school diploma I ended up getting married moving to Minnesota learn how to deer huh I bought it on a time I've worked with veterans American residents even though my dad was a German soldier was killed my son after 40 years of war for my history my grandfather's grave and he was a little first lieutenant from the United States uh he was in Desert Storm he was in Afghanistan three four times he got the Purple Heart I work with veterans so I just want to say that lesson it it's good to be a veteran and Bill I mean a immigrant but come legally you know what I mean if you do the legal way it's a great thing to be an immigrant and come to this country thank you thank you Eric for those comments and I want to thank you you came to this country legally and and you I want to thank you and for your service in your son's service to this country this is what you just described is a great story immigrating to this country and and having children that serve this country you are you are truly you and your family health are truly American heroes and and for your son to get a Purple Heart I can't thank you enough for the service to this nation and for that matter I can't thank all the veterans enough for your service to this great nation the veterans have given us our freedom they have given us our free speech and we live we however we all live in the greatest country we call home yes we have some faults but let's work through those because our commonalities farm their differences and for me it's just a pleasure to be here so with that again I want to thank you all for participating in my very first telephone town hall I appreciated the productive discussions and really value your feedback it is an honor to serve you all in Congress and if you ever need anything please do not hesitate to reach out to me and my staff we can be reached at area code you

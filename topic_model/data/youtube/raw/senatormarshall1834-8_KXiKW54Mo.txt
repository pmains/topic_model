is one shot for all better than none for some i'm michael surconish in philadelphia president joe biden used a prime time address to the nation on thursday to lay out an encouraging timeline all adult americans will be eligible to get a vaccine no later than may 1. let me be clear that doesn't mean everyone's going to have that shot immediately but it means you'll be able to get in line beginning may 1. but seven members of the gop doctors caucus say the u.s is missing an opportunity to save lives when it comes to vaccine strategy they sent a letter to the acting secretary of the u.s department of health and human services asking that they immediately review new data to quote enhance and increase the current vaccine administration specifically they believe that the pfizer and modern vaccines were so effective that after just one dose we should give one shot to as many people as possible and come back for a second dose as more vaccines are available it's an approach already being taken by our allies across the pond while the vaccine manufacturers recommend waiting only about a month in between both doses the uk took the step of extending the interval to around 12 weeks scientific advisors there said that this would provide at least some protection to as many people as possible in the early stages of the vaccine rollout but in response to the doc caucus letter the wall street journal published this piece titled u.s government scientists skeptical of one-shot regimen for pfizer modernicovid vaccines the lead read as follows u.s government scientists are pushing back against calls for one-dose regiments for two covid19 vaccines designed to be administered with two shots saying there isn't enough evidence that a single dose provides long-term protection among those quoted peter marks the director of the food and drug administration center that oversees vaccines who said this it is essential that these vaccines be used as authorized by fda in order to prevent covid19 and related hospitalizations and death similarly paul offit of the children's hospital of philadelphia who served on the fda advisory panel that recommended the use of the pfizer and modern vaccines said those clinical trials quote found a level of neutralizing antibodies with one dose that was significantly less than what they got with two senator dr roger marshall also a signator on the original doc caucus letter fired back with a wall street journal op-ed titled one shot is better than none here's what he said after every senior citizen and high-risk individual gets their two shots applied science would suggest we could save tens of thousands of lives if we give one shot to as many people as possible and came back for a second dose as more vaccines are available consider this if you had 200 pfizer vaccines and 200 family members and it was up to you how would you allocate them the current emergency use authorization tells you to give one hundred people two shots assuming it will be ninety five percent effective only one hundred people would be vaccinated and ninety five would be protected alternatively you could give two hundred people one shot assuming 75 percent effectiveness 150 people at a minimum would be protected much of the preliminary data on the effectiveness of one dose has not yet been peer reviewed it all leads me to this week's survey question at smercondish.com do you agree or disagree give a first vaccine shot to the most people possible instead of waiting for both doses to become available to understand more about the shots for all approach i spoke with senator and dr roger marshall from his car doc marshall thank you so much for being here i think i get what you want to do you want to stretch out a limited supply of vaccine make the case well well thanks you're exactly right i want to save lives so we have a finite resource and there's lots of real world data that shows if we gave a lot of people one vaccine we've saved more lives if we gave fewer people two vaccines and i just want to be clear i want seniors to get their second shot i want people with high risk problems to get their second shot but we will reach herd immunity much much more quickly and save lives if we give everybody one shot and come back in two or three months and give them their second shot lots of real world data out there the uk is already doing this so i want to give the fda the power the authority to use this real world knowledge and and save more lives critics say we don't have sufficient long-term data to do what you're recommending look i think it's there's plenty of data out there to say that that after one shot of the pfizer vaccine the modern vaccine it's 75 to 9 75 to 90 effective um and that it's very safe to come back and give it in in three months so i think that there's enough data to consider doing that but mostly i want to give the fda the flexibility to make that decision i think even in two weeks or four weeks from now there'll be enough data for them to move along the wall street journal has been covering your idea your initiative and in coverage of this idea and the back and forth they quoted a senior scientist and adviser to president biden who said you'd be flying blind to just use one dose if you're going to do something else other than follow the study shown to the fda show me that this one-shot effect is durable in doing research the best that i could find was a letter to the editor of the new england journal of medicine from two canadian doctors is is that the best in terms of study or research that you're able to point to look i i don't know what it'll be like in six months or nine months from now but i think it'll be sufficient protection uh until we have enough to get that second vaccine into everybody and i actually think what i'm seeing on the studies i'm looking at shows that over a month after two months that the effectiveness even goes up more from just one shot so i think that there's enough real world data out there that the fda should seriously consider the best way to use this finite resource and you made reference at the outset to the fact that and i just want to make this clear this is the approach being taken in the uk true that's that's my understanding yes and i bet you'll see lots of other countries doing this as well and that's not unusual i come from the world of medicine obviously and typically the european union the uk is a little bit quicker to adjust to things you know i come from the real practical world uh there's lots of science out there how do we best apply it to my particular patient now in this case the my particular patients the the entire population of the united states but i think there's some this is a real world application and we need to give the fda the ability to make some adjustments to use real world evidence to save thousands of lives do you worry that if we were to go this route it would give a sense of beer muscles to people who've already had one shot in other words they would think well one shot has now been given to me and because of the efficacy from one shot i'm not going to show up for a second for a booster look i i think that this is why we need pharmacists and doctors involved with this process encouraging everybody to get their second shot look if america can understand the different mass mandates we've been through surely they can understand this that when it's possible get your second vaccination it's going to increase your immunity maybe from you know 75 percent up to 95 effective so i think people will get that especially if they get that follow-up email text phone call from their doctor's office from the nurse i encourage people to get that second shot i i think americans are smart enough to figure this out and you're you're definitely of the opinion that they come back for a second shot less anyone hear this conversation or read some of the back and forth about it and think that you're advocating one and done that's not what you're saying for moderna and for pfizer you are correct sir i want everybody to come back and get their second shot anybody that's had one shot needs to go ahead and get their second shot well we're sorting this out but eventually i think when we get to that low risk group we can get one shot in everybody's arm and then come back for that second shot maybe at two months or three months as soon as every we have a supply is ramped up and the ability to give vaccines is ramped up yes i want everybody to get their second shot i know this has been your opinion for quite some time i take it it was unchanged by the fact that president biden just this week said that by may 1 every american will be able to get in line and not long thereafter there will be sufficient supply i guess the question is if there's truly that kind of light at the end of the tunnel why then are you still advocating for spreading out the limited dosage that we have i think regardless of what the plan is going forward we can reach herd immunity a month sooner if you would describe if we do what i'm describing um and i think just to to president biden's point we may have enough to get one shot in everybody's arm but by may and we may not but i think that this is going to speed it up about four weeks to get that hurt immunity one way or the other and finally a critic would say well this is not the means or the use for which the fda approval was given on an emergent basis in other words you're not using them as intended and you would say what this is exactly what i why i want to empower the fda to look at this real world evidence and make the decision we don't want senators making decisions like this but the fda needs the authority the ability under the their eua to have some flexibility and i don't think that right now they have the flexibility to use real world evidence so i want them to look at all this real world evidence out their studies across the country and then see if they come to the same conclusion that i do so i i think we're on the same page doc marshall thank you so much for your time you bet thanks for having me thanks for covering this issue

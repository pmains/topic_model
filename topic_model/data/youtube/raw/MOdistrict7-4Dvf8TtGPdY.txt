what an accomplishment it is to have this historic legislation on the House floor I want to congratulate you and my energy and commerce colleagues on the hard work we are much closer to moving american medical innovation into the 21st century part of what part of that is to keep up with the ability to communicate a modern way with patients as you know i have worked very closely with you and your staff this past year to draft language to update Food and Drug Administration's oversight of health care information on the internet especially on social media millions of people use the internet to find critical health care and/or treatments and other specific health information and topics unfortunately current FDA regulations do not help communicate accurate meaningful information about health care solutions such as prescription drugs and medical devices online there is an enormous potential to improve American lives if we can get the FDA to write workable rules and guidance to communicate information where people's attention is focused after all the FDA itself regularly turns to the Internet to announce its activities and inform the public presumably in a safe and informative way I have legislation to do this and I hope to continue working with you to modernize healthcare communications and help improve the lives of all Americans I look forward to working to continue work with you in the 21st century cures to make sure this month this monumental bill ultimately meets the president's pen and is made into law I thank you mr. chairman and I yield back salmon salmon

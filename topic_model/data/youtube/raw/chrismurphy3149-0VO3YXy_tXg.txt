so to get across the state from Danielson to Dan berry in five or six days you got to walk about 25 miles a day I mean so many people on this walk who would never ever write their senator they're working full-time working overtime and they're still having trouble making ends meet and it's just a reminder to me that just because they don't have a lobbyist or a political action committee they deserve to have a strong voice in Washington too that's why I do this walk that's why I decided to be a United States Senator I'm Chris Murphy and I approve this message

madam madam president well i am still here on the floor i want to take just a just a moment and acknowledge that today march 8th marks international women's day this is a day for us to recognize the achievements and the contributions that women are making in communities across the globe and as an alaskan i'm going to start local first because i've got so many many phenomenal women in in my state who are doing incredible things and i'm exceptionally proud of them i was home over the weekend we were celebrating the start of the the 50th running of the iditarod race this is an extraordinary feat of of just strength and grit and determination and resilience there were 49 mushers that that left willow on sunday 17 of those mushers who will make the trek to gnome are women 17 women so we've got a very very strong field but running running a race like this where it is the musher and your team of of dogs going through the wilderness of alaska we've got deep snow throughout the moose are not in a very uh a very cooperative mood right now there's dangers along the trail and who knows what the conditions are going to be like a week from now and so it takes an extraordinary individual and to know the strength of women as they have have taken on the iditarod when when uh award-winning or world-renowned winner susan butcher first uh won that race she's won that race she won the race four times but when she she ran it about three decades ago there was a popular bumper sticker that was going around the state at the time it was alaska where men our men and women win the iditarod we were pretty pretty proud of susan butcher we're hoping that that our women do well and all of our mushers do well but like like these female mushers who are racing women leaders are are virtually in every field from from health care to resource development to fishing to our universities everything in between and many of us are very proud to know that they become somewhat household names some of them this year we were able to to celebrate emma broyles a young woman from anchorage 20 years old she became the first alaskan and the first korean american to ever be crowned miss america in the the 100 year history of that event so we're very proud of her was able to celebrate with her this weekend at the iditarod itself another young woman that we have celebrated this past year has is lydia jacoby lydia is from seward alaska and at 17 she competed in her first olympics she brought home the gold medal for this country winning the 100 meter breaststroke race so we were all eyes on lydia so proud of her and there's so many who deserve our our thanks and our gratitude i always like to give a shout out to to an exceptional leader in our state who has provided critical leadership and guidance throughout the pandemic dr ann zink it is it's it's so important to know that it's not necessarily uh finishing at the at the end of a race or or a crown or a medal it is just the endurance that goes with the day-to-day completion of your work i was on the floor just last month to recognize the work of native civil rights advocate elizabeth peratrovic who pushed the territory of alaska our legislature at the time to pass the first anti-discrimination act in the nation we did this in 1945 we're so proud of how she as a native woman leader made our state and our nation a more inclusive and more representative democracy so so today on international women's day it gives us an opportunity to recognize the impressive feats that women have taken on and have accomplished it's a day to thank women for their daily contributions again both big where they win the they win the awards and they make the headlines but also for those day-to-day contributions that they make to to to to raising healthy strong children to being the the fabric in the family to to be that contributor in the workplace but this isn't a day that we just look back and and recognize those who have made great accomplishments it's also a day that we look ahead at the work that we have to do to continue to advance equality and justice for all women so just just down the hallway from here in the rotunda is the portrait monument and we all see it we walk by it maybe we just don't even notice it anymore but take a look at it next time we know the pioneering women who are represented on it lucretia mott elizabeth katie stanton and susan b anthony but we need we need to look at it more carefully we need to remember there's a fourth bust that adelaide johnson did not sculpt and the base of the monument is also unfinished and it's a reflection of the unfinished struggle for women's rights and equality so for all the progress that we've made and we know it has been considerable madam president as you're sitting in that chair and this woman from alaska is addressing you we've made great progress but the struggle is unfinished the data documents the gaps in gender equality in our country and too many women feel it firsthand in their daily lives so on international women's day i also want to remind the senate of a couple important ways that we can help further women's rights and i'm pleased that my colleague senator cardin is on the floor at this moment because we've been working together we've been working together to try to to finish off to do this unfinished business when it comes to ratification of the equal rights amendment to ensure women's equality is expressly recognized in our constitution three-quarters of the states have now ratified that amendment alaska did it back in 1972 virginia most recently in 2020 i'm hopeful that its time has come and to help facilitate that senator cardin and i have introduced a resolution to remove the arbitrary ratification deadline from the era so that it can finally take effect i think the senate needs to take this resolution up and pass it like the house of representatives did last year another step a critical step that we must take now is the reauthorization of the violence against women act to help ensure that there is a path to justice for survivors of interpersonal violence i was very proud to introduce the new vawa bill with senator durbin senator ernst and senator feinstein last month i'm pleased so pleased that we have 22 total co-sponsors 11 from each party our bipartisan bill modernizes the nearly three decades old violence against women act and it reauthorizes important programs that provide services to survivors it directs resources to prevent further violence and hold perpetrators accountable for their actions and it takes needed and important steps to address domestic violence sexual assault dating violence and stalking i mentioned mentioned dating violence we have a provision that i had included that we have named after an alaskan victim of dating violence and that is brianna moore we focused on improving access to medical forensics for victims of violence including through training for medical professionals that will allow them to provide evidence-based and trauma-informed care we have a strong tribal title in this vawa bill it builds on vawa 2013 by closing the gaps in the law to protect native people the tribal title also includes an alaska pilot program which provides a targeted solution to help empower tribes in a way that recognizes the unique and complex jurisdictional landscape that we have in my state it's a recognition that tribes are valuable partners they're critical partners that can play a larger role in providing public safety while reducing the burden on my state as i have said many times before there should be nothing nothing partisan about keeping people safe from violence and our vawa reauthorization is the result of many years of hard work and negotiation by advocates advocates and stakeholders alike i hope that we can consider this and pass this very very soon i recognize the great work of senator ernst on our side and senator durbin and senator feinstein on the other side of the aisle it has been an effort that is timely is needed and is necessary so madam president i'm i'm happy to be able to to to recognize for just a few moments on this international women's day as we celebrate the the many many incredible women in our lives and in our countries we also recognize that our work for true equality remains unfinished but we've got some some good paths forward if we can just try and with that and a president i yield the floor

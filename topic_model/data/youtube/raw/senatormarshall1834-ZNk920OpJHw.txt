i want to talk about the border though that's what i'm really concerned about i just visited the border my third trip there is certainly a humanitarian crisis and i'm sure anyone that's been down there would agree with me that it's a national security crisis but i want to talk about the health care crisis going on there when i went down with a group of physicians three years ago or so i was concerned about just the doctors and nurses being overwhelmed i was concerned about tuberculosis hepatitis scabies sexually transmitted diseases and other communicable diseases but now based upon what we know the incidence of covet is 5 to 25 of the people coming across the border and then what i see is they take a group of folks 50 to 60 people they put them on one bus then they do a couple of exams and they all put them in in some type of a dorm setting so if they all didn't have the virus they soon will and then we let them go out into the public that just seems hypocritical you know the the application you're talking about for when we can let ships come to alaska those and the concern about variants from south africa that just seems it seems hypocritical to me why why i respect completely where you're coming from it seems like it's a double standard dr fauci are you comfortable with what we're doing on the border from an id standpoint the reason i i would have to hedge on that because i'm not really very deeply familiar with the details of what's going on at the border and that's perfectly honest with you dr marshall i really am not familiar enough with the situation at the border to be able to make a comment if i was i would whose job is it to know that i can chime in and say that um i am aware that at cbp sites that there's overcrowding and that we need to from an infectious disease standpoint from a covet standpoint we need to de-densify what is happening at cbp we we've been working closely with orr as our children leave cbp and move to the orr sites to uh to work towards getting them screened and tested which is why they have you you know what percent positivity they have there those are orr sites are much improved compared to the cbp sites with regard to how those children are cared for who is caring for them and we are providing technical guidance on those orr sites to to work to make sure that they are as safe as possible using mitigation strategies at their after but do you see the hypocrisy in in what we're doing to america we're saying that i can't have a barbecue with my entire family on the july 4th i can't have easter service worship together um but we're going to let let people come across the border in mass numbers and just release them into just does that not seem uh hypocritical i think there are two different situations that we have to handle we have to handle in two different ways and we have guidance and strategies for how we're providing technical guidance for the the challenges that are occurring in the density at the border and then we're trying to keep the public safe using the evidence-based strategies there thank you thank you i yield back thank you very much

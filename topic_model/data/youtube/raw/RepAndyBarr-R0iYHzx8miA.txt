um under the rules of the committee the minority is entitled to a copy of any subpoena 48 hours before it is issued and as the ranking member of the oversight and investigations subcommittee i want to thank you your staff has been diligent with respect to complying with that rule and that's very much appreciated the rules however do not ensure that the minority is made aware when a subpoena is actually formally served and who actually receives it this amendment would simply update the rules to include the minority when a subpoena is issued and served electronically electronic service of subpoenas comes with many advantages including speed and preserving a record of service another benefit is the capability to easily inform the minority after the point in time in which a subpoena is served or at the exact point in time when a subpoena is served what this would mean in practice is your staff would simply cc my staff when a subpoena is transmitted by email this simple amendment would bring additional transparency to the subpoena process and make clear whether the witness is represented by council now of course the best transparency would have been achieved with mr mchenry's amendment to give both the majority and minority joint subpoena authority which would have required consultation with the minority as a condition of issuing a subpoena however this amendment will not affect the chair's unilateral subpoena authority assuming mr mchenry's amendment is defeated i do want to just mention one point as i listen to the debate about mr mchenry's amendment the madam chair pointed out or made the argument at least that the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of subpoenas that's not the point the point is that the supreme court remanded the issue to the district court the lower court with a four-point test that subjected our committee's subpoenas to greater scrutiny so this rule had the effect the way it was written in the way that the chair used the subpoena power it had the effect of diminishing this committee's subpoena power subject to stricter scrutiny and so we want to at least with this amendment preserve as much remaining subpoena power that we have left so again as the ranking member of the subcommittee who appreciates uh collaboration with chairman greene in our very important oversight responsibilities i just want to make the argument that that this amendment would simply provide the minority with some additional visibility when it comes to the committee's most powerful oversight tool the principle of notice the fundamental idea that all interested parties should be timely and simultaneously apprised of the status of actions taken by this committee is really critical to our oversight responsibility a responsibility that is on all of us on this committee both in the majority and the minority so with that madam chair i believe that this is a matter of fundamental fairness especially given the chair's opposition to mr mchenry's amendment i would urge my colleagues to adopt this as a at least a a a modest uh overture of comity to the minority uh and certainly an amendment that i think would strengthen our collective oversight function and with that man madam chair i yield back

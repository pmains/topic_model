now over 20 members of Congress have sent a bipartisan letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan calling for a debate and vote on the multi-billion dollar war raging in the Middle East one of the co signatories barbara Lee wrote quote our nation has become increasingly more embroiled in yet another costly and endless war in the Middle East the Constitution is clear Congress has a responsibility to debate and vote on matters of war and peace the American people deserve better than a Congress that abdicates the sacred responsibility in a moment we'll be joined by representative barbara Lee Democrat of California she's the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus peace and security task force and the former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus I believe she's just run down the hall put on her microphone Congress member barbara Lee welcome to Democracy Now good morning let's be with great to have you with us so it was a year ago today that President Obama asked for a debate on war what has happened since certainly the war has expanded where is the permission yes well and we were very pleased that the president asked for an authorization because many of us several years before that even fought to try to get a new authorization understanding and seeing what was taking place as it relates to Syria Libya and and the entire new front on on this war and it's very important to recognize that we haven't had an authorization since the 2001 authorization which i voted against then I said it was a blank check and it was and now that authorization is being used to continue with these new wars and I think that it's time that Congress really do its job the president has asked us to do our job we wrote to the speaker several months ago we wrote to him again yesterday we have over 25 members bipartisan requesting for an authorization and it's time for the American people to demand that representative barbara Lee could you tell us how the speaker has responded to your repeated requests we have not to date have we have not had a response but I've heard the speaker's say he was looking at bringing forward new new authorization but we haven't had a direct response nor do we know what the latest is in terms of his thinking but I would hope that the speaker understands that under his watch he said he wanted what we call regular order he wanted us to uphold our job as members responsible members of Congress the Constitution requires us to do that so we are hopeful that the speaker will live up to his commitment to really do what the American people want so you have written a petition is that right yes we've written a petition people are signing the petition and we're asking people to really does sign on and that's the power of the people in America we want to have the voices of people heard here in the House of Representatives and in the Senate representative barbara Lee do you think that a military response is the only way to deal with the with Isis let me go back to the petition first the it's stopped endless-warr calm and I want people to know how to really sign on to the petition but I have a resolution it's HJ Res 30 which really talks about a comprehensive strategy to address Isis no one believes that Isis is not a dangerous terrorist organization and that they must be dismantled but the military first option is not always the best option to really create the reduction of tension and to mitigate against more terrorist attacks and more more Tara in the region we do not need boots on the ground we do not need to have ground troops in the region to conduct you know to be part of a civil war that's taking place and so we have to look at a comprehensive strategy a political solution an economic and diplomatic solution that would you know begin to reduce tensions and bring some semblance of global peace and security right now military first for me and for many of us that is not the way we dismantle and disable Isis so that we can have peace in the region and throughout the world let me ask you something about a news headline we just read Secretary of State John Kerry just condemned the Assad government and the Russian military's use of cluster bombs in Syria right now since two thousand eleven eleven percent of the Syrian population has been killed or maimed yet he didn't talk about the use of cluster bombs by the us-backed Syrian the us-backed Saudi bombing of Yemen that is taking place now that once again Amy what I'm saying is these wars that are taking place they're dangerous they're creating more death and destruction and they're creating more of a refugee crisis than the world really knew could even happen as a result of the bombing and the does you know the civil wars and so that's important I believe that we look at this and Congress debated and that the diplomatic initiative be increased and doubled because at this point we're going to see more refugees more more a larger humanitarian crisis and we're going to really begin to see more havoc that's being reached throughout the world and so whenever you you're talking about bombing you have to understand that they're going to there will be collateral damage there will be human at manatorian impacts and we're seeing this crisis emerged that is why we need to have a debate in Congress and look at alternatives and that doesn't preclude military action now no one is saying that's off the table we're just saying that there has got to be a way whether it's Yemen whether it's Syria whether it's Libya wherever it is there's got to be a comprehensive approach to begin to dismantle disable Isis and to create some path to pieces

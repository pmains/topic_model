hello everyone it's your US senator Catherine Cortez Masto as you well know our monuments in Nevada are being challenged right now by the Trump administration who would like to either rescind them or roll them back and as many of you that I've talked to and as you well know being born and raised in Nevada Basin and Range and gold Butte are some beautiful pristine areas in Nevada that we want to keep protect because so many so many people enjoy the outdoors in Nevada and across this country and we should make it available to them and as you well know and I said this before our outdoor recreation in Nevada is a boon to our economy creates one hundred forty eight thousand jobs billions of dollars in revenue to the economy and that's worth fighting for it's worth fighting for so families like mine and my father had two daughters and we grew up camping and hiking and fishing all over Nevada and you know my father was a hunter as well and so for me it is about the opportunity for so many people across Nevada to be able to enjoy our outdoor space and so Zinke Secretary's Enki is going to be in nevada this weekend and he is going to be looking at gold Butte and he's going to be looking at Basin and Range with the sole thought of how he can either rescind them or rollback the footprint of our national monuments let me tell you now those monuments are worth fighting for so this is a message to Secretary zenki I am here in my mail room in the US Senate and I have with me a number of letters this is representative of the 90,000 emails and letters that I have received from Nevadans who are asking the secretaries Enki and me to protect our national monuments for the same reasons that I just told you about they want to be able to enjoy them protect them for the future including some of our Native American reservations where there are some sacred sites within these monuments here is one of the letters I just wanted to read to you this is a postcard that came in from a constituent and it says dear senator I urge you to do everything possible to preserve our great wild spaces our national monuments are under threat and needs your protection thank you for your work to care for our national treasures and that's what this is about these are our national treasures these are national treasures in Nevada and they are worth fighting for so secretary thinking I'm asking you while you're out there in Nevada please please listen to the majority of Nevada's that I hear from that want to protect our national monuments please I'm looking forward to have future conversations with you about protecting our national monuments but I invite you to a great place in Nevada and listen to the constituents that I have hear from every day thank you everyone for listening

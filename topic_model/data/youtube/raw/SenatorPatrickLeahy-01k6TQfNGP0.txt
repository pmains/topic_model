senator chambliss a long-time friend and uh just as i'm a former chairman of this committee he's a former chairman of this committee we're being watched by former chairman talmadge and chairman lincoln i talked with her at length about this hearing yesterday and she has to be in arkansas in business but i i appreciate her arranging for us to have the the hearing and she and i will be talking about the results when she comes back with an area in which she's quite interested you know we talked about the foods production act there's people here in the room were part of that achievement i would not especially deputy secretary merrigan she worked with us in those when i was chairman and we worked with ranking member luger dick lugar to write the 1990 farm bill which this was a part and times it felt like we felt a little bit like sisyphus was rolling that rock but it made it we had a strong bipartisan coalition we put together but i i would deputy secretary i just do want to acknowledge the tremendous help you gave during that it's i have sometimes noted that senators are merely constitutional impediments to their staffs who do most of the work and and it's uh so i appreciate that but we're now looking forward to see what not only to celebrate these 20 years where to go the next 20 years prior to the passage of the organic farm bill the industry was growing slowly at farmers consumers retailers facing inconsistent policies and inaccurate labeling procedures across the country and it's hard to believe today with the time we had 22 different states trying to manage and four separate regulations for organic foods it made it very difficult for interstate commerce they're very difficult for consumers and the passage of ofpa brought much needed order to the industry it gave consumers a usda organic label but a label with real meaning the organic law required usda to develop a minimum national organic standard so it's on the course where we are today certified organic farms in all 50 states nearly 5 million acres of organic crop and pasture lion an industry with sales of more than 25 billion dollars and growing i i think back then when some people are asking why am i doing this organics bill you might have a handful of farms and it's not going to go anywhere and i told might listen very carefully to vermont farmers who came to me and said we're willing to meet higher standards and we'll do what's right but give us a national standard so we're competing on a level playing field as long as we follow the rules in our state we want to know everybody's following the rules in their state and i said at that time that the only way that this industry can grow if the standards are met and they're followed and they're enforced strong standards do reward farmers who play by the rules they help consumers understand what their label means when they buy some of this usda organic i mean the proof is in the pudding with a 25 billion dollar industry that is growing how many industries in america today can say they're growing the way this one is growing but consumer confidence is key the organics industry is growing it'll be the key in the future so we come from those early days and everyone thought it was just a crunchy granola program you walk in the uh you've heard that expression uh you walk in the stores and organic foods occupy a prominent shelf space in the products and dairy owls the most mainstream food retailers even big box stores we see the offerings organic meats like the delicious white oak pastures grass fed beef and eggs and breads and grains such as any cheddar bunnies i said we have the cheddar bunnies here beverages even peanuts increasing with every year and i should add i was pleased to host secretary vilsack this past february at the northeast organic farming association vermont winter meeting in burlington vermont now it's middle of the winter burlington vermont we're very small state he was welcomed by more than 1200 people who packed in to see them no surprise though since vermont leads a country in number of organic farms on a per capita basis but i also recall secretary vilsack received an interesting organic product a six-pack of organic certified and vermont brewed pumpkin ale i didn't ask him how he got that on the uh airplane afterwards text me but nor did they consume it before i got on the airplane but but today we have more farms and companies than ever participating in the organic sector but we continue to experience occasional shortage of organic products when our farms are unable to simply keep up with the consumer demand i was concerned in the past the department of agriculture had not kept up with the pace of organic agriculture i'm pleased today to see an agency that recognizes has to support a diverse menu of options for all of american agriculture including organic agriculture that strong support means strong standards and i'll look forward to hearing from our witnesses today about the ongoing implementation of national organic standards i'm interested in the recent expansion of the national organics program usda because we can look back at the success of 20 years i want to look forward to the potential success of the next 20 years and i look forward to hearing from all of you about the potential challenges you see awaiting this young and growing industry and i see the distinguished senator from michigan here senator stabenow and we certainly have it uh organic farming in her state but again i want to thank uh i want to thank senator chambliss for being here but i especially want to thank chairman lincoln for letting us have this hearing i it may be a small percentage in some of our members of the total farmland the state but it is growing it is growing and when we have all this bad news in the economy it's kind of nice to have news about something that's working and growing putting people to work and i know when i walk in farmers markets or stores and all i see people heading to the organic food senator chambliss

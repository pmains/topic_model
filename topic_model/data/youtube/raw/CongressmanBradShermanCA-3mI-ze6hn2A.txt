the sponsor of the legislation for five minutes Thank You mr. chairman I'll have some initial comments and then I will propose a manager's amendment which makes only technical changes in the bill I've been watching the jcpoa the iran nuclear deal at every stage of its discussion and negotiation there is no document I've studied more clearly there is no need for the United States to violate that agreement but there's also no need for us to over perform Iran the agreement does contain language urging both parties to act in the spirit of the agreement what Iran did just within a month of when the agreement was signed was engaged in missile testing which everyone agrees is in violation of UN Security Council resolutions but technically not exactly a violation of the agreement at least according to too many so Iran has not over performed Iran has not acted in the spirit of the agreement but arguably they have adhered to the agreement in one respect one could say they perform more quickly than expected they met implementation date more quickly than we expected showing that they have more nuclear prowess than we expected but they did that only to get their hands on the money that is to say they had to reach certain milestones they reach them more quickly and the day they reached that milestone they got their hands on what has been characterized as fifty or a hundred or of the different figures billion dollars so um what are these we're focused here on planes these planes were talk we should be concerned about the humanitarian nature humanitarianism would say ground the unsafe planes humanitarianism would not say provide the Iranian government with more capacity to take weapons and explosives and barrel bombs and Revolutionary Guard Corps soldiers to Damascus think of the picture of that one boy from Syria on the beach in Turkey dead now multiply that by the over 400,000 people that Assad has killed and his chief a lie chief supplier supplier of men and material is Iran we do not need to provide planes that will help carry that out in the name of humanitarianism not to mention the millions that have been displaced by Assad when this agreement was negotiated the furthest thing from anybody's mind was that we would provide XM financing for this transfer of planes in fact that is a violation of XMS policy as stated to us clearly before we voted to reauthorize XM so we it does make sense for us to make clear in the code that we're not going to be financing through XM Bank the transfer of these planes this is hardly a violation of the agreement it is simply a prohibition on the most extreme and ludicrous over performance of the promises that we made and certainly the American taxpayer should not be financing on a concessionary basis providing planes that bring death to Syria every day and of course in prior decades Iran airs planes have been seen have been used for terrorist actions in Europe and elsewhere documented clearly in the record so with that as to the bill itself it deals only with planes sold or leased to Iran that is its sole purpose I think it achieves that purpose well but i do have a technical amendment at the desk and would the the gentleman yield back okay the gentleman is now recognized for his manager's amendment we will pause a moment and allow the amendment to be distributed

joining me right now is Kentucky senator member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Senate homeland and Governmental Affairs committees Rand Paul and Senator it is good to see this morning thanks so much for joining us first let me get your reaction so now we know who was behind unmasking general Flynn this whole ordeal you know I think we should be alarmed by this that Joe Biden was intimately involved in basically illegally eavesdropping on an American citizen but not just an American citizen a high-ranking member of the opposite party's administration so when we talk about abusing power of government to go after a political opponent remember we talked about that for about a year this is the the quintessence of that Joe Biden eavesdropping on a private conversation now the only way you're supposed to be able to unmask someone see the target is through probably a FISA warrant a secret court says we want to listen to the Russian ambassador okay but if the Russian ambassador is talking to an American official could be a senator or a congressman or someone in the administration you don't get to listen to that conversation you're supposed to sort of say a whoops we can't listen to this because we don't have permission to listen to the American or you argue we have a national security reason so the question that needs to be asked of Joe Biden is what was the national security reason misty's task of clapper Brennan what was the national security reason that you had to listen to this conversation or was it perhaps politically motivated senator it sure looks like it was politically motivated in fact at the end of the day to me all this looks like is one political campaign trying to take down another Hillary Clinton and the Democrats paid for the dossier they used the dossier to get a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign well this is why I want to reform FISA to make sure this never happens again so I have an amendment that I'll put forward today that says the FISA Court which is a secret court intended to go after foreigners that it would be illegal to go after American campaigns I don't care whether you're a Republican a Democrat or an independent this secret court that doesn't use the Constitution it uses a lower standard should not be used to investigate political campaigns if you really think that someone's rotting in a political campaign and there spy you can go to regular federal courts that are established under constitutional rule and you can get warrants that can happen but you shouldn't use this secret Corp had President Trump not one we would still to this day not know about all these abuses because it would be secret they don't tell you that they've been investigating you ever you just serve somehow in the end wind up either in jail or not in jail but this shouldn't happen and so my amendment is the only amendment that would actually really reform FISA and say Americans shouldn't be included in the process at all and you and your colleagues in the Senate will be looking at this today in terms of the changes with FISA and there was a lot of abuse that the FISA Court there was exculpatory evidence that was not given to the FISA Court in order to get a warrant to spy on Carter page for example I mean do you think we are going to see accountability here these wrongdoings are felonies senator in a number of ways when you look at the leaking to the media when you look at the leaking classified information or lying to Congress do you think we will see jail terms you know I don't know but I don't think FISA is really fixable and Judge Napolitano has been good on this on Fox talking about this a lot that to really get justice you have to have a true adversarial process where you get your own lawyer the government has their lawyers and you argue the facts and you have to release the information the government has the evidence so the defense can put up a defense against that but the FISA Court doesn't have that the FISA Court also doesn't obey the Fourth Amendment the Fourth Amendment says you have to have probable cause of a crime the FISA Court doesn't have to use the Fourth Amendment they can give search warrants without a complete ignore completely ignoring the Fourth Amendment so I don't think we can fix it for Americans the only way to fix it to get Americans out will there be justice for those who abused it I certainly hope so and I think the president's right if this were an ordinary citizen doing this you'd be seeing large lengthy terms in jail but people like James clapper have skated time and time again he lied to Congress that's a five-year prison sentence and no one had the guts to take him down and now he leaves and it turns out he was doing much worse than even that do you want to see President Obama testify some of your colleagues in the Senate would like to see him go under oath to testify what exactly he knew about the efforts to take down Donald Trump and a sitting president President Trump yeah absolutely I'm not holding my breath for President Obama to actually be before a congressional committee but Rick Grinnell the the Director of National Intelligence declassifying this I hope he will look at more things to declassify what I want to know is was President Obama directly in charge of this operation crossfire to get the whole thing started you know using this dossier that was paid for by the Democrat committee so I want to know yes how much was President Obama I think he was because I think even they knew it was sensitive to use the apparatus of the FBI and the FISA Court to go after a political campaign so I'm sure they ran it all the way up the flagpole and I would bet my bottom dollar that President Obama approved every bit of this and now that it's come out that it was illegal that the FBI lied about the the reasons for getting the warrants and they lied to the court I think that really we do need that we do need to have a serious investigation it's all quite extraordinary senator isn't it it is great to see this morning sir thank you so much for your time we will see you soon Thanks

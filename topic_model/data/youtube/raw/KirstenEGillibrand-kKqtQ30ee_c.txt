mr. president we just marked the 25th anniversary of the Family and Medical Leave Act known to most as FMLA when FMLA passed 25 years ago it was an incredible step forward for millions of working families they finally had a legal right to step away from their jobs to take care of their families without being the risk without the risk of being fired but we now know that the law has just not kept up with the times FMLA doesn't apply to 40% of the workforce and it doesn't guarantee any pay during the time that worker is away in fact 25 years after FMLA was signed into law we are still the only industrialized country in the world that doesn't guarantee access to some form of paid leave that means that workers all over the country are losing wages and retirement savings when they take time off the economy is losing tens of millions of dollars we have to change this because FMLA is not good enough anymore mr. president we need an actual national paid leave program and I'm pleased to see the paid leave now has clearly become a bipartisan issue both parties agree the paid leave is something that our country desperately needs and urgently wants to have earlier today a group of Republican colleagues announced proposal that they claim would solve this problem but it's clear that their proposal will not help the vast majority of working Americans in fact it would not create a real pay leave program that covers all workers and not only that this plan will actually rob the Social Security trust fund this would not strengthen Social Security it would weaken at Social Security no workers should have to borrow against their own Social Security benefits which are already too low to get paid family leave when they need it to take care of a new baby a sick family member a dying parent or themselves and let's not forget Social Security already pays women less than men so this proposal would make that problem even worse so if you're watching this debate right now and you are wondering whether Congress is finally going to pass a paid leave law that actually helps working Americans don't be fooled by this Republican proposal if your son is diagnosed with cancer and you need time to bring him to his chemotherapy appointments their plan will do nothing for you if your elderly mother has dementia and you need time to be by her side this plan will do nothing for you if your husband has a heart attack and he needs you there while he recovers this plan does nothing for you mr. president right now millions of American workers are stuck choosing between earning a paycheck and leaving their job to take care of a loved one when some medical emergency happens and if this bill passes that would not change listen to what a woman named Shelby went through because she didn't have paid leave Shelby is a mother and a grandmother and she takes care of her parent she's a security officer committed to keeping her community safe we all know that we can never predict predict when medical emergencies happen and all of a sudden Shelby's youngest daughter and parent needed medical attention at the same time Shelby had to leave work because her family needed her but all she had was FMLA unpaid leave which counted as an employment disciplinary action from where she worked as Shelby put it taking unpaid leave was an enormous financial burden for her she couldn't keep up with her rent or her utility costs and it took her months to catch up on just paying her bills she was able to keep her job but she suffered far more than she should have had with an enormous amount of added stress on top of her family's medical issues because she didn't have paid leave and this Republican proposal would not help her we have to fix this even president Trump agrees he said in his State of the Union address last week my response is this actions speak louder than words our country needs a real paid leave plan if President Trump and Congress really are serious about creating a national paid leave program then I urge them to support my paid leave bill which would actually work it would cover all workers not just new moms it's called the family act the family act would finally guarantee paid family and medical leave to every working American the family act is affordable it's an accessible earned benefit that you and your employer was contribute into together it would stay with you for your entire career no matter where you worked it's universal and it's comprehensive and it's for women and for men it's for young and the elderly it's for workers in big companies or small companies or even if they're self-employed and it would only cost about the cost of a cup of coffee a week this is the kind of paid leave program that our country needs and anything else anything less is just not enough mr. president five states around the country have already stood up for what's right and given their workers access to pay leave these states including my home state of New York are doing a much better job than Congress meeting the needs of their people on this issue California for example has had their paid leave program for more than a decade I know some of my colleagues are worried about whether paid leave is good for business so I hope they will listen to these numbers in a survey 90% of business owners in California said that paid leave had a positive or at worst no negative effect on their profits or their productivity and on their retention ninety nine percent of them said it boosted morale pay lead is good for business and it's good for working families so we have to pass it and I know there is bipartisan support to do it let's start rewarding work again and give people the opportunity to earn a better life for their families and let's finally give Americans access pay leave I urge my colleagues to join me in this fight and pass the family Act

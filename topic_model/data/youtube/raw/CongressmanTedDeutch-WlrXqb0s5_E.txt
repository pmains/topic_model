we've been that was Florida congressman Ted George thanks so much for being with us um can change actually occur in the wake of something like this because I mean we have seen Newtown we have seen Aurora Colorado you know too many to even name called the pulse nightclub and so many of the kids here seem motivated to to have this be the spark to to create change you know what the Anderson what choice do we have there are there are only two one is to throw up our hands and say these just happen from time to time and it's 17 here and it's 49 in Orlando and it's over 50 almost 60 in Las Vegas and we just wait for the next one that's that's not it cannot be an acceptable response the other response is to follow the lead that these kids are setting this is this is different and you've had these kids on I've been speaking with them over the past couple of days America has seen what these kids that Marjory Stoneman Douglas are like and as they grieve and as they wail and as they struggle with the loss of their friends lives they also are very clear about one thing they want action and they're not going to allow this to simply go by the wayside but how is I mean a you know a lot of them that can't even vote they're not old enough to vote how can they really affect change well some of some of them can vote but they certainly have a voice and they're using that voice and already and we need to give them the opportunity the tools we need to give them the platform to use their voice America needs to hear from them Anderson yesterday at one of the vigils a young woman came up to me afterward to tell me that she desperately needs something to happen she can't think that having sat there and watched her friend's face be blown off a horrific the worst thing to hear that she can't sit back and just allow that to happen without someone taking action we have to work with them and follow their lead and here's the thing for all of the all of my colleagues who are now talking about how this is about about video games and this is about movies and this is about everything but the fact that this shooter fired off 150 shots in minutes there there's going to be an accounting because these kids are going to make that happen they're gonna make their elected officials respond to this they're gonna make their official elected officials explain why it is that you can buy a you can't buy a handgun unless you're 25 but you can buy an air 15 or wait if you're 18 why it is that anyone needs an ar-15 to begin with that's a debate that we have to have we can't afford to just have all of this all these cameras packed up go back to where they came from and expect that the things will change they won't change unless we make them these kids are leaving the web I think 21 is the age for buying a handgun but but I understand 21 you said 25 well but but I understand the point an 18 year old can combine ar-15 but can't buy a handgun it doesn't seem to make any sense and can't drink until their kid can't drink right can't drink can't buy can't buy a handgun but can walk in as this shooter did walk in to a gun store and walk out with an heir 15 that can fire off a hundred and fifty rounds in minutes what about the the mental health aspects which a lot of Republican Congressmen and and legislators have been talking about what I mean certainly mental health you know there's such stigma about it in this country obviously more could be done people with with window issues and and we should but and and that needs to be part of the conversation look that the reports that that people went out that the authorities went out to this shooters now over 30 times raises all kinds of alarms the social media should have raised alarms we need to find out what happened in and find out how we can use that kind of data to get people to care they need but we can't demonize people with mental illness and and that tends to be something that happens in these cases we've got to get people with mental illness treatment we need to make sure that that they get the care they need and if they're dangerous to themselves or others we have to make sure that they cannot get their hands like done yeah I mean it's a fair point to point out that most people who have some sort of mental the issue are not a danger to other people they may be a dangerous at times themselves but but not really telling their people and it and it doesn't do us any good we're not going to advance this we're not gonna there won't be action if we if we simply lay out two alternatives where we can talk about mental health where we can talk about guns the the people who say that that why are you focused on guns they're inanimate objects we need to focus on the people of course we need to focus on on people but but we also have to focus on what they're using like they used here like they used in in mass shootings in Orlando and all trafficking it is interesting that you know how after each of these oftentimes legislators say look now is not the time to talk about political issues like like gun control Anderson the only when someone says that now is not the time to be political the only one being political is that person who refuses to engage in necessary conversation about how to stop these things from happening other places and it shouldn't require it just shouldn't require you to have one of these horrific experiences in your own district as a member of Congress for you to care about it it shouldn't but when should we talk about this you bet we should talk about it now and we should have talked about it yesterday and last week and every day since every day since Newtown every day since Columbine every day is the day we need to focus on stopping this horrific gun violence that's not political it's decency that's that's what we should expect from the people that we send to watch with them well congressman I appreciate your time thank you very much

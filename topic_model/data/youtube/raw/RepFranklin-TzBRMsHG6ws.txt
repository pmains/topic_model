madam speaker i rise in opposition to the two in a trillion quarter dollar boondoggle my colleagues across the aisle are trying to pass off as an infrastructure bill sadly this bill is a socialist wish list less than eight percent of president biden's infrastructure plan goes to roads bridges waterways ports and airports what it does include is 400 billion dollars for home-based caregivers and while that may be a good issue for review it's not infrastructure this comes as no surprise considering dc democrats are trying to lump a radical progressive agenda into a so-called infrastructure bill and still the leftist fringe that has hijacked what used to be the democrat party doesn't think it goes far enough madam speaker we spent trillions of dollars on coveted recovery and unrelated measures now is not the time for a socialist wish list americans need a strong economy and real infrastructure and they need it now thank you and i yield back

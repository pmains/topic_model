Madam President I'm always please be on the floor with my good friend from Oklahoma mr. Lankford but I was particularly glad I was able to be here today early in his remarks talking about a family remembering that family in prayer and then very thoughtfully going around the world of where people are at this minute that defend us it's a good thing for us to think about it's a good thing for us to keep in mind and it's good that when we say we have remembering people in our prayers to be sure they really understand that we are but I'm glad to be with my neighbor here today and also with Senator Hoeven on the floor this will be the 60th time in a row madam president if we do our job that we passed the National Defense Authorization Act I don't think there's any other bill in fact I'm sure there's no other bill we pass every year and when we pass this bill every year we re-establish every year the defense is our number one priority defending the country is the one thing that almost everybody admits they can't do from themselves for themselves the states don't think they could do this without us this is a national responsibility and you know the threats we see today are complex they are more pronounced than any our nation has ever faced former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dunsford recently said that our military has to be ready to fight across regions to fight across domains and across functions this bill moves forward in all of those areas being sure that we're interoperable where we need to be that we're quickly mobile where we need to be that our armed services work as well together as we could possibly hope they could work together you know the president's launched policies and programs to ensure the safety and the well-being of Americans certainly the people who defend us who serve in the military are doing their part to protect our nation now it's time for the Congress to do its part led by the Senate and led by chairman Inhofe and and the ranking member Reid bringing this bill to the floor it's not a small bill and it's not a bill that gets done just without a lot of work and a lot of compromise and a lot of determination as to what's really doable at this time but this is the bill we're voting on since we do it every year a lot of us not absolutely new but all of it is in my view as updated as the committee could bring it to the floor and we're going to have a discussion of what needs to change even being that this year the Senate's version the bill provides 740 billion dollars to support the Department of Defense we see this at a critical time when our adversaries including China and Russia seek to undermine our influence around the world Russia was just accused of putting a bounty on the head of not only American service people but our allies in some parts of the world if that's true there should a price should be paid for that and we're going to be working hard in the next days to determine how deep that intelligence goes and how true that allegation is but whether it's true or not it should be no surprise that the Russians are constantly focused on things that diminish the impact of the United States of America and the Chinese are more and more focused on that at the same time this bill authorizes 1.4 billion dollars to establish a Pacific deterrence initiative that will help secure our interest in the Pacific and our friends in the Pacific the bill supports military readiness and modernization priorities it has more than 21 billion dollars for shipbuilding and best technology hypersonic weapons are artificial intelligence machine learning things we have to have to keep the current advantages we have and it recognizes the family there's four million dollars in this bill to help military spouses transfer their professional license between assignments and between states when servicemembers are reassigned I'm pleased to say that the Missouri General Assembly has been a leader in that effort when you moved our state as the spouse of someone in the military your credentials should be and I think now are able to be moved with you it's bill increases funding for impact aid by seventy million dollars twenty million of that is for children with severe disabilities but the other fifty million is just trying to make up for what would have been a taxpaying unit if that unit hadn't been there I think impact aid matters this bill once again says it matters and we're increasing it the programs are critical they're important we need to ensure their their military construction projects that will be funded later by the appropriations process or authorized here is 40 million dollars for the new hospital that the ground was broken on at Fort Leonard Wood just last week 60 million dollars for the new National geospatial facility in st. Louis of 1.3 or so billion dollar project it's well on its way now this authorizes the next moving forward of that project investments and military weapons that are made in Missouri and things that help our military that are made in Missouri such as the development of the b21 Raider that will be based at Whiteman or the modernization of the C 30 H aircraft we're Rosecrans in st. Joseph is the world training center for our NATO allies to come and understand and lift and moving things around and how those c30 work the c30 airlines work this bill authorizes 1.8 billion dollars to buy 24 f-18 aircraft that are built in Missouri and 1.3 billion dollars to buy f-15 that are built in Missouri made with a great Missouri Illinois workforce and I know Senator Durbin and I will work together again on defense approps to be sure that this authorization is fully filled these aircraft are essential and would need to be part of our continuing defense base senator Hawley not proposed an amendment in the bill that would make Silver Star service banner day annual recognition on May 1 this is to be sure we honor those who have made sacrifices of the wounded and ill members of the Air Force I urge my colleagues to recognize the addition of Silver Star banner day in this bill there are a lot of bipartisan priorities in this bill this will have a bipartisan vote when it leaves the Senate it is a bill worthy of support and Madam President I look forward to our efforts to get this done for the 60th Senate in a row

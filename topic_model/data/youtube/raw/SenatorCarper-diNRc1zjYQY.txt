if I could III let my colleagues may require I led a congressional delegation down to the hunger squad while in salvador about the very beginning of this year and we were looking at numbers through really beginning of november in terms of the illegal immigration numbers are pretty flat as you look at that chart back there pretty flat up until the beginning of november i sort of exploded and the among the things that we focused a lot and it's important that we do focus on the symptoms of the problems at the border what we see at the border but it's also critically important as my colleagues know that we try to figure out what's going on down in Honduras Guatemala Salvador sitting all these people up here it turns out Salvador the search has been a lot less dramatic and one of the reasons why they had an election there they elected a new a new president his name's Buch buchelli he's like 37 years old former mayor of san salvador and people have hope people have hoped that if there's gonna be a better day meanwhile in honduras last year the one or not does the president a country I got the Supreme Court to declare that their constitution was unconstitutional and he could run again and he won a razor-thin reelection it just really rubbed a lot of people a lot wrong way I mean really made people angry they're still angry and over in and Guatemala Jimmy Morales who's the president's but I had very high hopes for four years ago when he was elected it's turned out to be a bitter disappointment and she tried to chase ccheng out of the country the UN entity is there to try to go after the corruption and and so forth and and when they had their presidential election the best person that was could have been on the ballot was not even allowed to come into the country and campaign del Madonna the former attorney general was like death on corruption when she was Attorney General and so people are just really like that up place you've got the situation with climate climate problems and they're like the arid situation people can't grow coffee end up in the highlands and there was a real surge of people there there's a lot going on there so it's important we we focus on the stuff that we're talking about here today but also remindful some of the things that that I just mentioned I there's one of my favorite songs I love music well my favorite songs is a Kong song called hope in a hopeless world and this is this this is not an easy saw a problem to solve but there's hope and the work therefore of you and you presents here in our Chairman and ranking member hosting this roundtable today gives me hope and what for many people is an all too hopeless world Thank You senator I would add I won't sing I'm sorry I won't sing just like that would probably keep people here senator we are looking at those push factors and traveling to the northern triangle to Guatemala and Honduras as a panel that's coming up next month in the meantime now we are receiving a number of briefings from the State Department NGOs and others regarding the very matters that you just talked about with regard to corruption extortion and and other issues in the northern triangle that's affecting these flows so our report was an emergency report focusing on the pull factors and trying to stop the stem the flow quickly on the family unit side we are yet to address the push factors which will be in our final report in September where is a body the Congress House and Senate on a bipartisan way have been supporting focusing on three major causes for people who want to get out of those countries one lack of economic open opportunity number two crime and violence number three corruption that's just endemic and then what we're doing through the lines for prosperity which we get about four we dollar we invest we get five or six or seven dollars from other other sources invested to address those three major push factors

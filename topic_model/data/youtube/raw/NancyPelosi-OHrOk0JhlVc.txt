they performed historic just so heroically the crew was so magnificent and a reminder to us that the first responsibility of the crew is safety that they are trained for it and they performed magnificently and the flight attendant one of the flight the lead flight attendant was the last person to leave the plane not until everyone else was off first responders responded in characteristic fashion with bravery with valor without regard for their own safety with their sights and own set only on the safety of others their stories are so remarkable their stories are so remarkable about what they saw on the plane and how people responded and it was also fullness and the cooperation not only of the crew but of many of the passengers that enabled so many people to be saved seeing the sight of the plane in the crash it was almost miraculous to think that so many people would survive the crash they only had there was only minutes to react and within minutes the flight crew and the san francisco and san mateo police officers and fire departments were climbing up the rescue chutes running through smoke-filled aisles and leading passengers out to safety within minutes fire rescue captain torrey malloy and his team had set up a triage and treatment area so it could immediately evacuate the most severely injured within minutes the air traffic controllers and airport staff were effectively diverting traffic and travelers to secure the area within minutes local hospital staff had prepared ready made ready and visited to provide the injuries with the necessary care and support as we speak the injured or recovering at san francisco general hospital the source of pride to us in san francisco it is a major trauma center uh and if you have to go to a trauma center san francisco

medical center uh the the swift and fearless response of each of the men and women who responded each of these are heroes save the lives of many on the asiana flight their actions are a whole might mark of their professions in the testament to the testimony to the strength and selfish selflessness that defines the san francisco bay area the story of asiana flight 214 is over long after the news that the tragedy fades from the front pages in nightly news reports the national transportation safety board will continue to investigate what happened and we will all work to ensure that never happens again i want to particularly commend the board and the chairwoman deborah hersmann for being on the scene immediately with an investigative team in the most professional thorough manner we will continue to work with the federal aviation administration san francisco international airport to ensure that our planes are secure passengers are safe our u.s aviation remains the safest way to travel it's been decades since we had any incident at the san francisco air but i can't remember any uh we will honor the act of first responders the flight crew the flight crew the flight crew

this is congressman Matt Gaetz I just got off the phone with President Trump and I am as certain as ever that he is committed to securing our border and protecting our country you've all seen that a 1200 page bill was just filed around midnight last night that would keep the government open and do a few other critical things and while my staff and I have been combing through that legislation I wanted to give you a few key highlights the president and his administration will be able to keep and detain up to 55,000 people who are in our country illegally and committing crimes that's a huge win for the president more than 1.3 billion dollars for the wall now while we'll need a lot more that's a great deal more than the $1 that Nancy Pelosi originally promised in fact it's more than a billion times more than what Nancy Pelosi had originally offered but what I'm most encouraged by is that the president has made an agreement with the Senate he will use his executive authority to use billions of dollars that we need for border security and to fund the wall and so while I'm no fan of the legislation that's up for a vote this evening in the Congress I will vote for it for the 1.3 billion dollars for border for the wall for an additional upwards near of 25 billion dollars for border security and I think that in concert with the president's upcoming executive action in declaring a national emergency we will finally be able to get our border secure and we most importantly did not have to do any amnesty to get the job done at almost every other time in our nation's history to get border security we've had to trade amnesty and in this case we didn't have to I don't love this deal but I'm going to vote for it because in concert with executive action we can finally build the wall and secure our border

I grew up in India in dire poverty I worked as a janitor when I was in high school when I was in college to help my family come out of poverty and my mother who was a very strong woman and my role model she's my hero never got completed her high school but a woman that taught me how to survive how to fight back how to never let you know when things get bad I saw her stand up and took our family forward and that's how where I learn frugality that's where I learned pragmatism and that's where I learned to be how not to fear about things as I was growing this company in 1996 my older son was eight years old my younger son was four years old and my wife passed away she suffered from mental illness like today many families in Michigan suffer with mental illness and under the Republican administration the first thing you see is they cut is mental illness and you see mental illness throughout the prison system all over the effects of that are tremendous we see a lot of prescription drug addiction and Bill Schuette has treated it more like a law enforcement issue and it's not it's a rehab issue it's a compassion issue and when my wife passed away I took care of those two boys and I made sure they have you know deal with their grief and I went and attended every parent-teacher meeting I attended every there sports events raised them and three years later I met a wonderful woman got remarried and it's amazing how a woman can pull a family together and what she can do and I have seen that with my mom I've seen that with my wife and I'm so grateful to them and the four sisters that I have which are so I'm lived with strong women and I know what a woman difference a woman can make and this is really a tribute to all of you so big answer all of you and so the business then kept growing and in 2008 I had 450 employees and the recession started and the my business went complete belly-up because most of my customers were small pharmaceutical companies venture funded startup companies and they were developing medicine that the big startup companies will not develop especially women's health there are some issues because it's not profitable for Pfizer to invest in it and so I help these little companies develop these drugs and I've made I bought several companies around United State including one here in Ypsilanti and when the recession all this company started going belly-up and my bank saw that some of my companies were doing good some of my companies were not doing good and this was Bank of America they were too big to fail and they were collecting all kinds of subsidiaries from federal government but they had no problem closing me down so in 2010 the bank took position of my home and my business and sold the business and they recovered enough money that to pay for everything that they they I or them now I did not declare bankruptcy like somebody we know in vital Washington DC I did not ship the my suppliers I did not stick my bank they had the right to I had signed the paper I had made the commitment they I let them sell my assets and pay them self-full but I had lost everything that I had worked hard to achieve and in September of 2010 almost seven years ago a day before my home was to be foreclosed my wife and I put on us belonging in a budget rental truck and started driving from st. Louis Missouri to Ann Arbor Michigan we were tired but we started we took terms to drive on that truck and we reach Ann Arbor Michigan at 3 a.m. we put all of our belonging into a rented place next day I found a small commercial space about this big that was for for rent and it used to be a lab which had also gone out of business during the recession and I rented their space next day morning and restarted my business before the I gave the keys to the bank the bank gave me a box cardboard box and said mister tanada if you like to take some of your personal belongings feel free to and so I tried collecting my pictures my kids pictures and my wife's picture and then I was walking out the lobby and I saw there was a trophy and Entrepreneur of the Year trophy that had won in 2007 this was a trophy that was given by Ernst and Young and I asked him if I can take that and I took that trophy put it in my box and I was walking out I said I'm gonna win another one of these I came to Ann Arbor this company grew rapidly and last year I won that award Entrepreneur of the year [Applause]

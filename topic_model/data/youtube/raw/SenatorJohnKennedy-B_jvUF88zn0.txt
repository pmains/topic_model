senator kennedy uh professor you're on leave from the faculty at virginia law are you not i am senator um one of your colleagues professor paul stefan tells me you are a rock star but that is very kind of him to say that senator professor stephen is a is a a wonderful person he uh i went to law school with him he may be the smartest guy i've ever met he uh he deserves to be on the federal dance frankly um i've been listening to you carefully you don't sound to me like you're much of a politician i like that i'm going to ask you a couple questions i i want to stipulate up front professor you're going to follow president uh and i know you've been coached i'm not blaming the biden white house and trump white house did it to you know coach all of our nominees to just say we're going to follow preston i think you'll follow president anyway but but i'm not going to ask you to to tell me how you decide a case that would be unethical it might be illegal but it'd be unethical but i do not want to know how you think let's take a new right let's let's uh i'm not going to try to talk to you about the relationship between a fundamental right and a suspect classification because you'll beat me on that one but but but we both know that they both use to create new rights let's take wealth wealth as a suspect classification do you think heightening the scrutiny of wealth as a social economic policy socioeconomic policy is a decision for the voters through their legislative body or the courts senator kennedy i believe the supreme court has already confronted the question of whether wealth is a suspect class no yes but they could once again i'm not talking about i know they said no and but i'm just asking as i'm asking you to put your professor at him well i guess senator kennedy i think that the supreme court in deciding rodriguez has essentially said that it is a matter for the legislature not a matter for the courts and if i were confirmed as a lower court judge i would follow that guidance from the supreme court okay we know you've probably taught it we know that the right to use contraceptives is a penumbra of the i see you correct me if i'm wrong first third fourth fifth amendments to the constitution now you don't find the words right to use contraceptives in the constitution and i personally think people ought to have the right to use the conversation by the way but uh we know that that right was found as a penumbra of those amendments in griswold v connecticut but we can't see it in the constitution is that pretty fair statement senator kennedy i would agree that the word contraception is not in the constitution and like you my understanding is that the supreme court decision that recognizes that right is griswold versus connecticut yes okay are there other penumbras that we can't see senator kennedy i'm not aware of any supreme court decision other than griswold that used the specific word penumbra do you think there are other penumbras out there working out there that we can't see senator kennedy i'm not sure that i think there are other penumbras out there that we can't see because as i think i've said i think the only time the supreme court has ever used that specific word is in griswold versus connecticut the supreme court has for at least 130 years concluded that this that the constitution protects certain rights such as the right to marriage the right to travel um the right to raise children that are not expressly set out in the text of the constitution professor i don't really care about your politics i care about your intellect which is they pretty well established i i care about your analytical abilities i care about your integrity and i care about your understanding of the role of the judiciary and um some of the nominees that have appeared before us i believe see it as their see their role as a federal judge to try to rewrite the constitution and or our statutes every other thursday to advance a social agenda that they can't get by the voters through their elected representatives and i don't agree with that um i don't get the impression that you're like that i'll give you the last word well thank you for that senator kennedy i think the role of a judge is very important but i think it is a limited one um i think it is the i do not think it i think it is the role the judge has the important role to apply the law to the facts before him or her in the cases that come before them thank you mr chairman

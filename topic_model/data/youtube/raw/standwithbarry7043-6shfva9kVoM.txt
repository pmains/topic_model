we're on Interstate 81 in Virginia on our way to Washington DC and I was listening to the President's speech to Congress on the radio that I was infuriated by the distortions of the truth that was coming out of the White House several times in that speech the president said that raising our debt ceiling would not increase the federal debt but the entire reason he's asking for Congress to increase in debt ceiling is so he can borrow more money which will increase the death if we're going to restore America we must have true and honest representation in Washington DC

if you're an American watching this hearing come here you need to be reminded it's true we can never forget and the thought that went into this place is we walk down into this chamber the way those first responders did what really struck me were those pictures of the people that day in New York all fixated on the exact same thing as we were told two billion other people around the world watched in real-time the tragedy of that day we had we had a great dinner last night and we all went around the table I think was senator Peters and Senator Romney's idea let's just all go and describe what you were doing 9/11 those of us rely we all remember it and for my part Isis and I scratch Wisconsin in our office looking at the TV and making probably the exact same comment that probably two billion people made or thought this changes everything but then in the days that followed that the pictures that emerged of the firefighters that the Port Authority that the cops in New York City the responders walking up the steps rushing into danger to save their fellow Americans as we watched the finest among us the men and women of the military also respond and volunteer and go halfway around the world to not only defend our freedom but literally try and develop freedom and liberty and democracies for people they have no idea who they were that is something pretty unique about America we're not perfect but I happen to think we are phenomenal force for good in the world and in the midst of tragedy and not just 9/11 every mass shooting every hurricane every national disaster seems to always bring out the examples of the goodness or the American people to me that's what this hearing is about this is what our responsibility is to not only preserve this good nation for future generations to make sure it's thrives that's our responsibility yeah I want to thank everybody for their service and really just conclude by saying god bless america

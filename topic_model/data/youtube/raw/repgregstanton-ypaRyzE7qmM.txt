good afternoon everyone my name is larry san diego and i am the director of outreach for congressman Greg Stanton we are thankful that you have joined us today for housing webinar for tenants and homeowners unfortunately congressman Stanton could not be here today he was he wanted to welcome everyone personally and thank you all for participating but he's on the flight right now to DC and so he asked me if I could read a few words on his behalf good afternoon everyone this is congressman Greg Stanton I want to welcome everyone joining us today for our housing webinar for renters and homeowners so many joining us this morning and many more in our community amazing challenges we never imagined possible every single day my team and I hear from folks who are hurting they're worried about making ends meet they're worried about how they're gonna pay rent or the mortgage maybe they've lost their job or closed the door of their small business and they need financial relief so before I turn it over to our experts I want to briefly give an overview of the work we've been doing in Congress at the very beginning of this crisis our number one priority was testing and public health we allocated 8.3 billion to immediately increase our medical response and ramp up state and local efforts to combat this pandemic then we passed the families first act which ensured coronavirus would be free to anyone in need regardless of medical insurance it provided emergency paid sick leave enhanced emergency unemployment insurance it allocated more than a billion to expand food assistance programs and much more in late march we passed the latest and largest of three stimulus packages the carers act with a two trillion price tag it was the largest spending package of American history it just gives you a sense of for how serious this moment is for our country one of the main provisions of this bill throughout was to give relief to American families that included passing measures that protect tenants who are in federally subsidized programs and who live in properties with federal subsidized mortgages these tenants will be protected protected from the dictions during this time period and during the recovery period many aspects of housing law and tenant land are controlled by the state however I thought it was important that you have this information there's a lot of misinformation circulating and I want to make sure that my constituents have access to accurate and reliable information that's why I've asked experts from Community Legal Services a Southwest Fair Housing Council and from the Maricopa County Justice courts to answer your questions about housing evictions foreclosures and other relevant matters I'm going to keep working and fighting to meet your urgent needs and make sure we all come out of this as secure and stable as possible we're already working on a fourth stimulus package that will include more support for families and mean I'm sorry I couldn't join you but I hope you find this information helpful so that was on behalf of congressman Stanton I just wanted to quickly go over today's agenda and do brief introductions so the first part of the webinar will cover tenants and homeowners rights and obligations and resources under code of 1910 we'll turn it over to hear about fair housing issues during koban 19 then we'll hear about how to access justice courts during koban 19 and lastly we will answer some of the questions that were submitted beforehand so with that I want to turn it over to Pam bridge who's the director of litigation advocacy with community legal services thank you we'll go to our first slide I want to thank congressman spins office for inviting me to speak about these issues today it is complicated so we hope we clarify some issues and and are happy to answer questions after this presentation and a later date about about these other things I will present so Community Legal Services is a nonprofit law firm dedicated to advocating litigating and educating low-income individuals concerning their civil legal needs we help individuals with housing family law consumer benefits and employment today I'll be focusing on housing though next we assist individuals in five main areas Maricopa Yavapai Mojave La Paz and Yuma although those are the areas that we can advise and represent clients we provide statewide assistance and today I will be going over a law that is applicable to our entire state I will be discussing the governor's executive order 20 2014 and as Larry also stated will be discussed in the cares Act which is a federal protection for tenants and homeowners so next let's start with the governor's order 20 2014 so what the main thing this order does is in certain situations that we will go over it stops a constable or sheriff from locking a tenant out tenants must still pay rent it does not excuse tenants from paying rent tenants must still pay rent to their landlords and landlords can still get judgments against the tenant and in fact even if the constable sheriff does not lock the tenant out the judgment stays on the tenants record and it can impact finding other housing or being accepted into subsidized housing programs so let's get down to what the executive order allows next so what it says is that a tenant can stop from being blocked out by a constable or Sheriff if the tenant gives to their landlord or property manager I notice if any of the following circumstances apply the tenant has been diagnosed with koban 19 and must be quarantine the tenant has been ordered to self quarantine by a medical professional because of the symptoms as defined by the CDC if someone in the household has been done no swith coded 19 and they must be quarantined the tenant has a health condition by the CCC that makes a tenant more at risk for Koba 19 than the average person those health conditions are listed on the CDC website and they can they include asthma and pregnancy and other conditions or you have the tenant has suffered a substantial loss of income as a result of Kovac 19 such as they lost their job or that they have reduced pay or the workplace is closed or they require to stay home now because our schools are closed and they have reduced hours at work or relate off so what has to happen in order for this protection to apply is that the tenant has to give the notice to the landlord and it can be by email or text and the order says that when they give this notice of to the landlord that they also attach any supporting available documentation of the above situation so next just so you know a copy of this notice that tenants can give their landlords is on the community Legal Services website I want to point out that at the top it says July 25th that is just until the order applies the tenant this only keeps the tenant from being locked out this one time the next month if the landlord again wants to evict the tenant and gets a judgment the tenant again would have to prove these conditions and that they still apply so even though the law is effective until July 25th that this protection only applies to the actual complaint that was filed against the tenant if the landlord files a new complaint against the tenant and the tenant gets a new judgment they are once again again to have to show this information to their landlord next so couple things so let's say that a tenant gets a copy of an eviction notice the first thing is that the tenant should do is call the court I'm gonna allow judge Driggs who's going to talk about the current the manner of accessing our courts right now however it's really important that if the tenant does give a notice to the landlord or manager and then the landlord or manager gets a judgment against the tenant the constable can still come to the tenants house it's really important that the tenant have a copy of that notice and available documentation to show the constable when they come to their house because that way the constable knows that they complied if that happens the constable will not lock the tenant out at that point and that is happening right now throughout the state that the constable is coming to tenants home sees the notice and the available documentation and for one reason or another is deciding to lock out the tenant at that point the tenant should call an attorney like community legal services even if they contact us the very next day there may be things that we can do about it but it's important what we're seeing throughout the state not just in Maricopa County is that tenants are not providing this notice to the landlord before the constable comes so just make sure as soon as you as soon as you know you have these qualifying conditions you hand a copy of the notice and any available documentation that you have for instance maybe you have the last paycheck from your employer on our website we are giving sample documentation that you can have from your doctor or your employer that can assist you in having available documentation but again make sure you keep a copy of what you gave the landlord so you can show the constable that you did this and that will keep the constable from locking you out at that time you still have the judgment on your record at the end of this order you will be locked out you can be locked out and so this is just delaying you from being locked out so that you don't have to look for other housing at this moment briefly before I go on to the cares Act I want to just touch on the fact that the governor also ordered an executive order for commercial tenants commercial tenants have a protection if they are most types of small businesses as long as they have less than 500 employees that until May 31st if they have any financial hardship related to k√∂ppen they can again tell their tell their landlords and they can show any available documentation and for them the landlord cannot lock them out or even begin to give them a notice to vacate and that's an important factor so if a commercial tenant gives a notice to their landlord of a financial hardship related to koban 19 the landlord cannot begin to evict the commercial tenant through May 31st the order also says that commercial tenants are encouraged to reach out to landlords to try to get lower amounts of rent and the landlords are encouraged to take that however that they are not ordered to do so now going next we'll move on to the cares act so we talked about the governor's order that applies that's a state protection for all tenants the cares act as Larry said is a federal protection and it applies to tenants and many of our federally subsidized programs and also tenants who live in properties with federally subsidized mortgages landlords cannot charge any of these tenants late or file eviction complaints against them for non-payment of rent so as I mentioned under the governor's executive order landlords can still file eviction complaints against tenants however under the cares act for these tenants tenants living under federally subsidized programs and tenants have a federally backed mortgages landlords cannot even file eviction complaints against them for non-payment of rent this applies for 120 days beginning March 27th it's important to know that tenants still these tenants still need to keep paying rent although they can't be evicted for non-payment of rent that obligation continues and at some point they're going to be required to pay that so next slide let's talk about who this who this applies to first of all it applies to all tenants that are living in these listed types of federally subsidized housing and we've listed the types it applies to and that includes public housing section 8 vouchers which is very common in Arizona tenants who live in low-income housing tax credit housing and you can see that list that list is also on our website sometimes tenants don't know if they live in federal subsidized housing so they can they can look at their lease to find out under section 8 programs there will be a hack contract there's a hack contract involved there'll be attachments involved it'll be listed in their lease if they look live into low-income housing credit launched you won't see anything about HUD but you will see in the least something mentioning IRS Code section 42 so this is really important this applies to all of these tenants who are living in federally subsidized housing programs because there are thousands of tenants in Arizona who are participating in these programs it also applies to federally-backed mortgages any Chinese living in a property in which there's a federally backed mortgage next so a couple things as I said the tenant they get it if they get a complaint and they are in a federally subsidized program for non-payment of rent they should appear at their hearing and make sure they tell their judge that they are in a federally subsidized program also they also they they can look on their complaints complaints in Arizona have to say whether it's subsidized or not that doesn't tell us what type of subsidy it is because there's state subsidies also but lease it's a clue if the landlord does give them makes them try to pay bleep cheese or tries to evict them we really encourage them to call committee legal services or our other legal services programs in the state Saul on your Tucson and GNA up north again tenants must keep paying rent and and also if the tenant is living in a federally subsidized federal Rhys back to mortgage sometimes it's really difficult for tenants to know that or not how many tenants know what type of mortgage their landlord has however they can go online to a federal database which states whether they have this one other thing they can do is ask their landlord if they haven't federally backed mortgage again there if they look at if they go on to the federal mortgages website there's a database of states for those properties that have fairly back two mortgages next so how do we get rental assistance the Department of Arizona has a rental assistance currently for tenants who are unable to pay rent because they have kovat related hardship it has to be related to covert 19 you know a lot of tenants and Arizona have problems paying rent but this this protection is for tenants who have kovat 19 related hardship if they want to as soon as they know that they're having problems paying rent first of all a tenant should always contact their landlords and talk about that communicate with their landlords to make sure that perhaps there is a payment plan something they can enter into in writing I mean they're going to reach out for this type of assistance they should go on to this website that we've shown and they should look at the ethic fa Q's because there are some eligibility requirements to get this money next for instance tenants have to their income has to fall at or below a hundred percent of the area median income adjusted for the household size this is this chart that I've listed is also available on an apartment of housings website but you can see that your income and your household size have to be under the amount listed importantly tenants will still need to pay part of their rent they will be required to pay 30% of their of the income for the month before they apply so let's just say that you apply in April and you lost because you lost your job in April because of koban 19 the Department of Housing will look to March want your income in March and require you to pay 30 percent of your rent 30 percent of your income from rent that's really really important because because a lot of tenants don't have it so they should try to save that amount the Department of Housing website I there's thousands of people per week that are trying to receive this money so the first thing you want to do is tell your landlord you're applying for the money you need to make sure that you pay your part of the right on time because there is been a significant delay in getting money from the Department of Housing right now just because there's so many people who are applying so make sure that you pay your 30% the amount that apartment housing says that you're going to need to pay and you pay it on time because you're still required to do that and if the landlord accepts you're part of the red without asking you to sign the waiver then they can't terminate you for non-payment of rent next so mortgages we're going to move on to homeowners right now mortgage protection state and federal the governor has an agreement with the banks that they will not foreclose currently and there are a couple of huge protections under the cares Act for individuals have mortgages that are federally backed first of all for the next 60 days actually I think we're at day number fifty fifty-one now that they cannot be foreclosed if you have a federally backed mortgage you cannot be foreclosed for this period of time it began on March 27th for the next 60 days after that and that's regardless of whether the homeowner has anything any problems related to code 19 so that's a huge protection so if the homeowner if the homeowner is having problems for if the homeowner is having problems what they should do is go and they can ask for 180 day forbearance and that is for all federally backed mortgages you know federally Mac FHA VA hug USDA they need to ask for the hundred and eighty day forbearance they don't need to show any documentation they just have to attest that they are having a problem paying their mortgage and they can get that a hundred and eighty day delay so what happens if you have other types of mortgages through private lenders then the homeowner should reach out to their mortgage servicer and you can find that number on your mortgage statement or your coupon book and you should find out if they have a hardship program so the protections that I'm talking about are only for the federally backed mortgages if you have a private mortgage you're going to have to reach out and talk to your mortgage servicer and see if there's a plan that you can you can receive next there's also on the state of Arizona is also offering mortgage assistance again you can go back to the housing AZ gov website it's under save our home easy before you apply for these funds make sure you look at the eligibility requirements you can't be within 30 days of a trustee sale your mortgage can't be more than five hundred thousand dollars but you can receive mortgage assistance through this program too sherry from southwest Fair Housing great can you do now okay yes we can hear you okay perfect alright so Southwest Fair Housing Council is a nonprofit grant funded fair housing organization which serves all Arizona communities through grant funds we work to eliminate all forms of housing discrimination through education outreach and enforcement our enforcement department investigate discrimination claims and helps people file complaints but before I get into the Cova 19 pandemic and fair housing protections I wanted to give you a quick base on the federal fair housing protected classes fair housing is the right to live where one wants without being discriminated against because something about as a person and that is where the law specifically lays out the federal seven protected classes if you're involved in housing in any way or an advocate for yourself or others you must know these protected classes and what they mean so know that we also at our organization have free fair housing classes that you can sign up for next most commonly when people think about discrimination they think of intentional discrimination or purposely treating someone differently based on one of the seven protected classes however in certain instances it would be possible for even unintentional discrimination to be considered unlawful knowing and understanding the rules in fair housing along with its nuances is definitely key and preventing housing discrimination under the law so let's talk Cobin nineteen in fair housing next fair housing laws protect people who are infected with kovat 19 and those who are perceived as being infected next the state and federal forcing laws prohibit discrimination based on national origin so it is illegal to deny you housing or shelter because you're from one of the countries most affected by koba's 19 or are perceived you're perceived as being from such a country it is illegal to have different rules for you than everyone else because you're from one of the countries most affected by the kovat 19 or again perceived by being from that country it is also illegal for a housing provider to send you a notice to quit or try to evict you because you are from one of those countries most affected by kovat 19 or even if they perceive you as being from well those countries is illegal for your neighbors to harass you because you're from one of the countries most affected again by the Cova 19 or the perception is another protection in their if they perceive you from being from such a country next additional protections may be there for persons who are defined as disabled the state and federal fair housing laws prohibit discrimination based on disability if you're infected with kovat 19 you may be considered disabled under the state and federal fair housing laws and you may be protected from discrimination if you do not have COBIT 19 but a housing provider denies you housing or shelter because they believe you have the virus this is illegal and you should call Southwest Fair Housing Council or go online to report it if you do not have Co bed 19 but a housing provider warranties you or imposes different rules on you because they believe you have the virus this too is unlawful and you should call Southwest Fair Housing Council next if you are disabled or on or unable to perform such tasks as walking or breathing or going up and down stairs or other important life activities because koban 19 has left you permanently disabled you may be able to get a reasonable accommodation from your housing provider a reasonable accommodation is the change in the rules policies or practices like allowing you to have a home health aide or allowing you to park closer to your unit because of a disability or maybe even having an animal which is connected to a particular disability in a place that doesn't allow pets so how do you get a reasonable accommodation next there are a few principles that will help anyone requesting and receiving a reasonable accommodation easier if the disability is obvious and the need is not clear or the disability is not obvious and the needs not clear it is not unlawful meaning it is permissible for a house provider to ask you about the nature of the disability and how the request is connected be sure that you talk to your health care provider about any means that you may have put all your requests in writings as well as a precaution so who is a health care provider next this is not an exhaustive list of health care providers or / professionals the mistake here made most often in fair housing is people are told that their letter must be from a medical doctor and that is incorrect it has to be from a healthcare provider or what the new 2020 in shows they're using the term professional but this is about a reliable third party who is in the position to know about the individuals disabilities and the change is necessary to afford a person with a disability the equal opportunity and use to enjoy dwelling and not only the dwelling but the amenities associated with that dwell so if your reasonable accommodation gets refused please contact our office next next can you hear me how does your life yes oh I thought there was one more okay oh there is okay so meeting disability related inquiries without a legitimate non-discriminatory reason could violate the Fair Housing Act on the basis of disability be sure before providers before making any housing related decisions on the basis of disability to seek legal advice be aware that the Fair Housing Act and other fair housing laws prohibit the eviction turning away or harassment of persons in housing because they are profiled on the basis of race national origin or other protected classes to be associated with kovat 19 and I believe you're right now this is my light last slide and I will turn it over to judge Driggs Thank You Shari Judge tricks thank you so much for joining us judge Riggs is the justice of the peace in the Maricopa County Court for the Biltmore Arcadia Precinct we are fortunate to have her here to talk about how to access justice courts during this time period judge Riggs hi thank you for having me all right so I'm going to follow on some of the questions we'll follow along with the questions on the slide so the first way to for tenants and landlords to find out about the temporary procedures that we have during kovin 19 and the best place would be to go to our website Maricopa um Campus oh sorry it's justice courts at Maricopa and so we have a website and it has all the procedures and it's updated daily weekly whenever we have changes as it's being updated for you to know how we're handling things and right now the best thing is to look at the website or call the courts um the court that's listed at the top of your paperwork that you have if you're a tenant and eviction was filed against you that paperwork work would be at the top or if you know which precinct you're in for the landlord you would call your justice court there are 26 of us in the Maricopa County Justice Court and then tonight question is how to tenants file Hiba furled that's a good question a lot of tenants don't know about fee deferrals and we try to train our staff members to offer that at all times anytime that you answer in lawsuits in the courts or you want to file anything there is a fee but you can always apply for a fee deferral and the staff at the window will give you that paperwork and notaries are not required and original signatures are required but I believe at this time we're allowing faxes and emails with your signatures on it and then the next question is how do you tenants and landlords file complaints motions and exhibits if hearings or virtual um we're still allowing people to come in and file complaints a lot of landlords have attorneys the attorneys will send runners we're doing this all in your own you know we're allowing limited numbers of people to come in and file what they need to file at the windows but the best practice first would be to call from your home just to be safe so that you can stay at home and avoid any exposure to the virus and call the court and ask the court what do you need to do a lot of things are being allowed to be emailed mailed and faxed and that's how the telephone hearings work so what we have now are virtual courtrooms and when you're getting sent paperwork for a court hearing the paperwork should tell you a number to call and what times are called to be in that virtual courtroom all the some of the judges aren't using the virtual courtroom but most of us are and once you call that number then you'll get be given an access ID and dial all the numbers that they instruct you to do and you'll be put in a courtroom and you just need to wait sometimes there won't be any sound because people are waiting for the judge to come in call the court secession and then once you hear the judge just listen for your name I know they've been tuitions where you know if you're on hold for a long time or you're just you know doing other things while you're on mute and you're waiting for your name to be called you might miss your name generally you're given the time frame and it should be a time frame of about an hour and courts are trying to you know stick to that time frame if you know we're going over and we know that you were there on the phone call some judges will call your number if you have provided us with your phone number so that we can say you know we called your name you weren't there but we knew you wanted to be heard and some judges will actually make that extra effort to call you if you weren't there and they knew that you had once been in there or you had called the court to say you were planning to appear I know I've done that with people that I know had called but it seemed like maybe they were having difficulty being in the virtual courtroom so I went ahead and called them and on a conference call that they could appear I would I know that I am and I know that the other four courts in this downtown Justice Center we are working really hard to be helpful to both parties and you know because we know that it's a difficult time for everything should be telephonic we're all doing our best to make the courts accessible and not make it more difficult because of the virus and we have seen now that in the eviction actions more people are appearing and being represented where before there'd be a lot of default judgments because people just didn't appear now we are seeing a lot more appearances by telephone so that's a good thing the next question is can a tenant or landlord request a jury trial or trial right now and how will that work but this point they spend it all jury trial I'm not sure how it would work I haven't had a jury trial request at the moment that's a that's a good question and I think because we're not having juries it would either have to be suspended or you know continued the case would be continued for a while it would depend on the plaintiff in the defendant if the plaintiff is represented by an attorney in have certain requests if the tenant or the defendant ask for a jury trial you know we would hope that they bill it just worked something out since it would be very difficult right now to get a jury we aren't even calling juries at the moment and I guess you know we would just have to continue that roland juries are starting to call them you know with the governor's executive order a lot of things are being delayed as far as eviction the constables and forcing musicians so you know sometimes waiting anyway and then some tips for litigants appearing by phone so I've kind of covered it you know call in make sure that you know there might be silence and you may be in there if you want to you know speak up and say can anyone hear me then you can at least know that you're in there there may be someone else who's waiting and they can let you know yes you're in the right courtroom maybe call the day before I know that sometimes people aren't sure they're in the right courtroom or if they can be heard they're a little bit confused and then they might hang up and then call the regular line for the courts and those lines are very busy right now right now don't many people are calling the courts that you can be on hold for a long time and if you call the courts regular phone number you might get put on hold for 20 minutes and then you might miss your hearing so don't make that mistake just try to call the day before make sure that the court knows you're planning to appear for that hearing and then provide your phone number that way the judge will know where the clerk's will know that you were planning to be there and that they have a phone number for you so that if you happen to miss your name being called or if you dial the wrong phone number or you just you can't make it work to get into the virtual courtroom and the judge that the clerk will call you and say you know you haven't appeared but we know you wanted to appear do you want to talk to the judge now and then we can reach out to you if you're not there and we knew that you're planning to be there and I think that that Driggs thank you so much for that really helpful information we are now going to go over to the questions part of our presentation and many of the questions that our constituents submitted have already been answered through this webinar but folks you know have a lot of questions about how this works and so we're really thankful that you are all here to answer our questions and so I'm going to ask the questions as they were submitted and any of the three of you can feel free to jump in and answer the question are there protections for landlords who rely on rent payments to make ends meet I can take it this is Pam first of all landlords have all of the protections under the landlord tenant Act so if a land if a tenant does not pay rent as long as they're not in a federally subsidized program are federally backed mortgage they landlords can file complaints against them for non-payment of rent and so also if if a tenant doesn't pay rent then that is related to koban 19 then a landlord if they have a federal mortgage could ask for their mortgage payments to be delayed so they have that federal protection also but all the protections under the landlord can attack for tenants and Lorre and landlords continue so in that situation if a tenant doesn't pay rent again if they're not along is there not a federally subsidized program the landlord can file a complaint for non-payment of rent against the tenant okay let's say the tenant is in some sort of federal program or federally subsidized what recourse does the landlord have um so let's say that first of all in that situation they can't file and they can't charge late fees but that tenant so we'll owe the rent because they're in the federal subsidized program that that landlord is if they they are going to be able to get a deferment if they have a more a federal mortgage which is something they should probably should do but at the end of this this the cares Act only runs again until July and then it's extended to August the landlord will be able that rent still due to the landlord no matter what so if landlords in that situation right now the federally subsidized tenant first of all I would encourage the tenant to reach out to Department of Housing to see if they can get rental assistance the landlord should then see if they if they have a mortgage get their mortgage deferred but they can still get at the end of this a judgment of against the tenant for that that monetary amount that the debt to the landlord is not going to go away just because it's then delayed okay thank you a question about rental assistance our renters eligible for rental assistance if they are not passed - yes as long as they're having hardship related - Kovach 19 they can't they can get rental assistance in fact as soon as they know that there's a problem they should start seeking out that rental assistance and not wait to their past due just because as I mentioned it takes so long to get it right now and no matter what they should make sure that they are paying at least part of what the red that they can pay on time okay another question should landlords be offering rent reductions since they have closed common amenities like the gym pool Clubhouse etc should well they're not required to again the landlord Canada Act continues so a landlord doesn't have to reduce any fees or payments right now to tenants under the governor's order or the cares Act but again what I would say if tenants are having problems paying fees that they communicate with their landlord we've heard that many landlords are trying to work with tenants and reduce fees because they don't want their tenants out so in that situation if the tenant can't pay types of fees for extended things that they go and talk to the landlord thank you we had a few constituent submit questions around that they filled out an application for rental assistance due to a kovat 19 job loss and they've received a case number but it's been we have one person who isn't waiting for three weeks another one who's been waiting for two weeks and you know they're wondering is that standard you know what how does that part work and what do you do if you have a problem with I think and I think because this was a new all this money came to the Department of Housing they are having some growing pains so it's it's not that this was a situation for them before they received this money and before the Kovach 19 money we've heard about many problems like that in many delays so what we suggest that they do is to don't if you're if the caseworker if the person is not calling you to continually to call them and make sure that you have the right community agency sometimes they get confused and you get assign the wrong one so you want to be proactive in contacting the Department of Housing assigns a Community Action Agency to work with you you want to then continually be proactive with the Community Action Agency to make sure that you've got all your documents in if you haven't heard from them continually call them and then you also again at the same time communicate with your landlord that you are doing this and you are making these accounts okay thank you sure we have a couple of questions for you is a housing provider required to care for a service animal for a tenant with a disability who is unable to care for the animal because of COBIT yeah a housing provider is not responsible for the custody or control of a service or assistive animal if the tenant is not able to care for them the new guidance that was out from animals and housing in 2020 states that makes it very clear that person with the disability is responsible for me for feeding maintaining you know providing care and control over their assistive animal a related question to housing is what special precautions should be taken by maintenance workers when doing a work order for a resident who has code 19 or they think might have code 19 well precautions should never be special they should be a standard for the type of work order and not for the residents so for example if anyone's working on a toilet it doesn't matter whose toilet it is it must it makes sense to wear gloves and spray with beat with bleach if you're worried about catching airborne diseases from residents feel free to wear a mask just wear it around everyone Eric communities should have its own work order protocol as to how each type of situation would be Han but not treat it because of the person okay thank you and one last question for you sherry is does the FHA require a housing provider to provide a transfer or a tenant who is living near someone who has symptoms of code 19 this type of request could be considered a reasonable accommodation if the individual is requesting the transfer for another permanent or chronic condition that compromises their immunity so it could be a reasonable accommodation request thank you so unfortunately folks though that's all the time that we have for questions but for those who submitted questions and it did not get answered our office we'll do our best to have it answered and sent to you and before we wrap up I wanted to ask if the three panelists could just say you know if there's one thing that you wanted folks to take away for what you said what would it be so let's start with you Pam go to Sherry and then judge strikes I guess the first thing I want to make sure is that everyone's communicating so that if the tenants having problems paying their rent that they don't just give up give up they reach out to their landlord they look at the different resources they make sure they understand their rights if the if a landlord a homeowner having problems paying their mortgage they also need to reach out the only way they get deferment if they have a federal mortgage is taking the time to talk to their mortgage lender so I would say what I would take away is for everyone just to try to communicate as much as possible right now in hopes that we can work out things that don't involve the courts um I say let's do our part and know the facts when it comes to mid-nineteen and stop help stop the spread of rumors be sure as she's already said communication is paramount sysm time to talk and it's an important time to make sure that your communication is understood so if you have troubles in their housing reach out to our agency but let's not worry about where this disease came from and treat people differently let's look at it as equality and that everyone has the rights to be able to live together and harmoniously as much as possible and there are lots of things on the CDC website that you can post that will help keep the rumor mail down thank you and I would agree with Tim communication is key to the same with the courts be sure to be in communication with the courts and don't wait until the last minute you don't want to miss your hearing call the courts make sure that they're able to call you back and one thing to remember is whenever the courts call you it's going to look like a private unidentified number or it may look like all zeroes so if you know the court is going to call you just answer the phone if it says unidentified caller or all zeroes because that's that's us thank you just as we wrap up I wanted to put on here the contact information for the two agencies there are websites and their telephone numbers for folks who are experiencing difficulty both of these organizations are here to help and they will you know do their best to help you and here's website again what our community legal services for Southwest Fair Housing Council and for our office Stanton house gov we are trying to put as many resources as possible and continuously update our website with new and relevant information we know that this is a fluid situation and that things can change new order is gonna come down new laws can be passed and so we will do everything we can to keep you updated so that you are in the best position possible and just a reminder is that the office of congressman Greg Stanton is here to help if you have any follow-up questions if something didn't get answered or something wasn't clear we are here to help our phone number is six oh two nine five six two four six three because our caseworkers are working from home no one will pick up the phone but you'll leave a message and someone will call you back you can also submit an online inquiry at Stanton house gov and someone will respond to you I want to thank our panelists

we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created as a member of congress i get to have a lot of really interesting people in the office experts on what they're talking about this is the podcast for insights into the issues china bioterrorism medicare for all in-depth discussions breaking it down into simple terms we old we hold we hold these truths we hold these truths with dan crenshaw let's dive into this mike thanks for being on congressman mike waltz on the show i prefer colonel but that's okay congressman too uh did you vote for what you did vote for my amendment to make uh the space force use navy ranks i did yeah i did i did i think they need a big break from the air force they think total cultural birth they think they've escaped me on this one they have not just because the senate's a bunch of boring old senators and doesn't want to put my amendment in but i'm coming for you space force hey i'm pro-space force it was the first bill i put in no such thing as a colonel kirk captain kirk yeah it's got to be captain kirk that's all right well we agree army and nate we got to get them out from under the thumb of the air force though they do need a whole separate culture on this great note i agree um so mike waltz um what what district in florida florida six northeast florida suburbs of jacksonville down to cape canaveral daytona is the is the hub so gotta love nascar gotta love beaches and gotta love motorcycles and you're you're still in the reserves still in the national guard okay national guard yeah um still jumping colonel uh special forces green beret yeah right uh now you have an interesting background we came into congress together um but you would you would sort of because you were in the reserves you would switch between active duty going to afghanistan and the special forces which group uh 20th group and what was what was unique about the experience is my day job so 20th group is you know reserve component special forces seals also have have a reserve component but that meant i had to have a day job and for many years it was as a policy director under rumsfeld and then secretary gates and then eventually in the bush white house and i had this fascinating there i was in the in the west wing mr president this should be the policy then i had to be the only idiot in washington to go do it and you know better make sure the strategy is right if your butt's on the line but the fun part would be what you could appreciate then coming back to washington putting the coat and tie back on and saying hey boss uh what you said to do was not what we're doing out on the ground and and to try to fix things that's awesome um and uh look let's get right to it wokism ruins everything it ruins dr seuss it ruins paw patrol it ruins aunt jemima and um frankly it's ruining the military um wokism might also be defined in this sense as uh excessive political correctness uh now i think wokism probably means a lot more than that um you know critical race theory identity politics but frankly that's infiltrating the military too uh we're going to talk about that you you and i have both received plenty of letters um from active duty personnel telling us what's really going on kind of reminds me of the kind of letters that i get from parents um talking about what's happening in their schools this is really bad um because it's kind of funny when aunt jemima gets canceled i mean it's not it's it's not funny but it's it's a little funny um but this is serious i mean like the priorities of our military is supposed to be war fighting and that's literally it is the department of defense um it it is not the the department of social engineering um this stuff really matters for the safety of our country for for the protection of a very very sacred institution i mean the military has the highest credibility um in the public right now and we're seeing all sorts of nonsense like the tucker carlson thing like we saw that this week everybody's blown up over that we'll get to that later i think you and i both kind of think that one's a bit silly but you know there's some there's some things to unpack there's some important things in there there's some things to unpack but like a lot of people are missing a lot of other stuff some of the training going on um the the funding of transgender reassignment surgery although i just heard the joint chiefs actually put a pause on that because they're like whoa biden take your uh so thank you for that joining chiefs um uh you know but there's a couple seals that are you know coming out this way um we're gonna have a hard conversation about women in the military or in the combat roles specifically i think people need to understand that a little bit more um that they don't hear from from people who understand combat all that often and so let's have a candid conversation about that i think so do you guys have an ethos in this special forces you do you know we do you know you haven't memorized oh it's um yeah it's like bear yeah i know it's latin so it's hard for seals to understand don't speak multiple languages yeah but it's to free the oppressed which is so the green bracelet that's a saying but actually it was under was under kennedy but you have a whole like list of things i forgot oh it's like um yeah soft truth can't mass produce yeah that's that's some good stuff um so we have an ethos right it's definitely better than anything you guys have um but uh you know there was an uproar because it says it says things like i am that man right like it's gendered right because there's only men there's only male navy seals uh always has been the currently always is now you can try out if you're a woman but nobody only one ever has and she was injured before she even got into training sure um you know and the question is like it doesn't matter this is always the debate right you know would it just give an inch like what does it matter and i don't know i mean is there validity to that because on the other hand it's like once you give an inch they take a million more miles yeah for me it's always been an issue of of standards not necessarily gender right i mean the standards are what they are the artillery round weighs what it weighs you know that rucksack is 90 pounds throwing a 200 pound man on your shoulders uh which you need to be prepared to do and get you know uphill to the helicopter under fire those are the standards uh and and we've gone through an evolution in the military to say all mosses not just the supporting roles um all military occupational specialties should be open okay i'm fine with that everyone should be able to compete and if a woman meets the standards that that we've set to to be in combat as an infantryman or as an artilleryman or tank uh or a tank operator fine but what i found over time is that we open up those specialties there are plenty of women there are plenty of athletic women that will out outperform the average male but there are physiological differences and we recognize those that's why we have men and women sports and and you know that's why we have those various differences what i find is the same groups pounding the table to allow women access to all of these uh all of these roles then a couple of years down the line are then pounding the table and saying well why is only a certain percentage getting through you must be you must have systematic discriminatory policies and then it becomes that's where it gets taught and then it becomes a pressure to lower the standards right and now it's equity-based rather than equality-based and i know you've talked a lot about that yeah and that's that's the real danger is the lowering of our standards uh within our what our most demanding and our most elite forces yeah the the reason actually i guess i didn't even explain to the audience what i was talking about the reason the ethos caused a stir was because like it's it's gendered or it was it says man like um if you look up old versions of it it uses the word man and then they change it to not use the word man maybe they use seal or or some gender-neutral term and because i want to get to everything you talked about about just you know women in combat and everything but um i'm actually starting you know a softer approach to that which is like again again does it even matter when you change little things here and there is this political correctness run amok or does it matter and like look because i've had conversations with flag officers about this when i when i'm like what are you guys doing like why why did you let that transgender seal go on cnn that's that's politicizing the military he's an active duty seal um you know he is not even out of seal command anymore now it turns out seal teams did not let him go on cnn the navy did because um the he her she can't even be um in the seal teams anymore because they want to transition anyway the point is is i have this honest conversation with people which is look they're like hey we're trying to do an honest job here like we're because our my goal is still to to man quip and a train man equip and train my force and make sure they're ready to go to combat yes i realize there's this whole other political world out there they want me to do this and if i have to give a couple inches fine if it gets them off my back and on my side i'm like look you can never give a couple inches because as you do they ask for another mile they always do the woke brigade always comes for you and frankly i i kind of think both sides are right in a way and i'm not sure how to balance that yeah i actually don't have a problem with the kind of the the neutralization in terms of of the language if you're going to open it up to everyone i at the end of the day i just want the best i want the best pilots the best cyber warriors the best seals the green beret is already the best but i want the best of the best yeah right um you know what we say about green berets nothing handsome [Laughter] great beards great great yeah sometimes good hair beards oh please please oh you're projecting great shots you're projecting what you but the point is but the point is we want the best americans out there fighting our wars and i think the the point that a lot of people are trying to make is that the military needs to be about winning our wars not social experimentation period because i guarantee you outcomes because i guarantee you that's what the russian military is about as as poor as it is they're putting the best they possibly can and it's definitely about what the chinese military is about right now as we speak there's social engineering with genetic crispy and experimenting with how to create super soldiers well one thing that's important to point out to people is women have always had a very robust role in special operations like there's there's this idea that all of a sudden they're allowed in and it's going to like open it up to women women have always been part of special operations in a very profound way um look if if you're looking at like there's a whole other side of special operations um you know that let's let's call it the sneaky peaky stuff women are very particularly on the clandestine yeah clandestine sides women are highly suited for this because this is what is what is involved in this it's talking to people um it's it's eliciting information um you know maybe you need to play a role um maybe that role needs to be a woman's role and um and and look the transgender navy seal just can't play the role it's just not gonna work um so women have always played that role also there's female engagement teams i i've done many operations um in iraq and afghanistan where you have to bring women out well men are preclude i mean men are precluded you're not allowed to engage with half the populace right there right yeah so we did it at hawk i mean we would pull in nurses military police women uh pilots you name it anybody that that could go out and and had the physicality to go on the mission and they were invaluable my fiancee was a military intelligence officer with more combat tours than i have in the in both invasions right so this notion that they don't play that women don't play a critical role i i do disagree with and they i mean whether it's pilots cyber warriors intel officers you name it but i think where as you were talking about where the crux of the bait comes down is in the areas that where physicality is so important and in that biological differences and in that mission so there's there's a woman on the mission so your average your average person listening right now who knows nothing about what we do is probably thinking well if they're already out there then why can't they just be a seal and here's my answer to that because a seal has to do everything required of us in in the heat of combat at any given moment and and it and it gets really really ugly yep really really fast and if you have a trident on your chest it means that you have to be able to to to engage in that and to activate right away so you might just be again like or a special forces tab but i take your point yeah i mean yeah you know if you want to operate at that standard but the point is is like if you're wearing the tab if you're wearing the trident some things are required of you um you have to be able to take over the squad you have to take over the platoon like right away and lead people in combat you have to be able to fight a 200 pound man off of you who just jumped on you you have to be able to pull your buddy out of off the x is what we call it if they just got blown up and they're missing their legs and screaming and you have to be able to fight while you're doing that and so no not just because you're on the mission and people don't realize just because you're you're an innate we call them enablers you're in addition to the mission but i want to be clear too i am absolutely confident there are women out there who can do those roles there might be yeah it's how do we how do we do that as how do we take that to scale right and cross across the entire special operations force and and my point has been and will continue to be what are the standards to be a seal to be a green beret to be a ranger and whoever meets them meets them but what if whether that's two percent of women or 58 of women it doesn't matter and but that's where we have to toe the line the problem is if it's only 15 or 20 or 30 then those same groups come back around later and say no you're being discriminatory you got to lower the standards to let more in that's the problem and we've seen that over the years um certainly uh hints of it in the obama administration especially i i i'm still not sure if we're gonna see that now i i haven't seen hints of it and the other thing is at least in at least in the seal teams those standards have been have been set in concrete um it wasn't always the case that all the crazy crap we did in training and buds was was justified and attached to an actual mission requirement now it is like that like this is why we carry logs up and down sand burbs this is why we freeze ourselves i don't think you're seeing it in the seals yet but the army a much bigger force they are starting to see it it's always driven me nuts that we have men's physical fitness standards and women's physical fitness standards i'm like wait a minute the tank the artillery round you know the the um uh the rucks act they're they're all the same regardless of gender uh so the army's now moved to which was a big move in the last couple of years to say you know what the standards for physical standards for infantry is very different than say a personnel clerk and we're going to make those standards different and we're going to combine it's all it's it's all one standard regardless of gender well now here we are a couple of years later and and various activist groups are coming back and saying wait a minute you can't you can't a woman can't get promoted in the infantry or in the arm or artillery because these physical standards are too high so therefore you need to lower them so actually we are we're seeing that in the combat arms i don't think it's it's really happened yet in special operations yeah but i fear it's coming yeah well special operations i think has inoculated itself better because we saw it coming um but you're absolutely right about what you're saying you know who agrees with you is uh captain kristen geist so she wrote an op-ed in february of this year where she talks about the first female rangers yeah so she got a ranger tab in 2015. so just to be clear people need to understand like ranger school frankly probably should have always been open to everybody because it's it's not a um it's not a selection course people don't realize that you don't you don't graduate ranger school and you're a ranger that's not how it works you go back to whatever unit you're from so a lot of best f guys go to ranger school pilot i think she was a pilot uh i'm not sure i think actually she was infantry in the national guard she was in so right infantry but there was another pilot woman who it's a it's primarily a leadership school it is yeah that starves you i mean i lost 31 pounds yeah that's sleep to provide you i probably should it's a good diet but you know it puts you under the most extreme duress and says lead your men and women who are also starving sleep-deprived sleep-deprived you know hallucinating over that mountain across that stream conduct the mission to standard right get the job done it has a very high attrition rate but at the end of the day it is about finding you know digging deep within yourself finding your own flaws and then and being able to dig deep and lead in the most extreme conditions that you probably find in training and yeah like it's a leadership course again i think females always should have been in it um but anyway they have been for a while now um a few have made it through and um but she argues like one of the worst things you can do is these different standards for men and women in combat roles like i i in the navy i i kind of get it because there's a lot of jobs like warfighting is 95 logistics like there's a lot of jobs where um you're out of you're at a radar the entire time like so so i kind of get the different standards for men and women to to allow everybody to see but i think those are different standards by what kind of job you're doing sure regardless i mean but men are a woman for infantry this is different this is the point that that that she is making here that you agree with that i agree with which is for these kind of roles you have to be the same and like she makes it from a feminist standpoint she's like look i don't want to be ostracized because people think i have a lesser standard than they do i want to operate at the same standards so that i'm not ostracized i need to be part of the team this is extremely important for unit cohesion for mutual respect like that's an emphatically reasonable thing to say she's she is she's speaking out against tokenism and tokenism is is demeaning to women it really is um you know it's it's worth pointing out some of the stats on this this stuff has been studied quite a bit um socom did look at it marines looked at it um look all all male all-male rifleman squads outperformed mixed mixed gender squads by some kind of margin um injury rates are double for women than they are for men so look there's there's things that you can't escape in the data interpret that how you will i i do tend to agree with you that the best way out of all of this mess is to simply standardize it and like the standard doesn't change it has to be very very high because our lives are at stake and the defense of our country is at stake and whatever happens as an outcome based on those standards happens um maybe maybe a woman will make it through buds i don't know um one woman just made it through sf training through the q course that's right yeah yeah that's right and i think that's a i'm i'm fine with that uh as long as you know there's been no downward pressure on the standards and if whether it's one or whether it's 100 that's okay now it is worth pointing out i mean you know people are like well look there's there's a lot of women out there who could kick most guys as butts that's true but that's also not the question you know the question is can they kick most navy seals butts in in every single category right like there's a lot of female power lifters that would absolutely destroy me um but they certainly can't outrun me and outswim me you know and the question is is like you know is it a matter of all three and you get to a point where there's a lot of overlap between men and women but but the question is what's happening at the at the tail ends of the spectrum um and is there really overlap there and but but again it's like just standardize it to standardize and you're good all right let's move on um but i i think i think that helps the audience understand like you know from from an operator's perspective like what we're really dealing with and and frankly what the solutions are um i want to go back to some woke-ism because there's so much to talk about well there's so much to talk about um i tweeted about this recently um the navy reading list the navy official reading list um had on it um a book in the fountain this is different sections in the reading list and one of them is you know foundational like foundational to your character and um on this list with with jocko's book um with uh with a book about stoicism is ibrahim x kennedy's how to be an anti-racist what on earth do we do about that is the army doing anything like that actually i just had um i just had someone send me a screenshot from a west point cadets computer um where they were doing a course on how to the the title across was dealing with white rage uh so so critical race theory and things along those lines have infused our academies uh have infused uh our force uh and we're now seeing the defense secretary come out and say his top priority is dealing with extremism in the ranks oof what have you gotten have you dove into that so we'll we'll get to the reading list well actually let me take real quick on the reading list um this is a bunch of crap like you know that pure and simple how to be an anti-racist is an extremely divisive book right it basically tells you that the only way you're at anti-racist is if you acknowledge your racism admit you're a racist and then acknowledge your privilege yeah and see everything through a lens of race but where is critical race where it's where it's so dangerous is that he takes the the next step and says and you also must admit that america is inherently misogynistic colonialistic and racist and there's no escaping it there's there's no out there that's right there's no way to there's no solution here and and there's no you know there's no redeeming things that the united states has done like lifting billions out of poverty but so you must admit all of those things and therefore to be you have a duty to be anti-american this is what we have our new sailors uh reading as they come into the united states navy as a foundational foundational book so that the country that they're going to risk their life to defend is fundamentally flawed and therefore you have a duty to be anti-american it's a great way to put it and um you know i called on the cno to immediately address it you know it's do they not know what they're seeing is is it happening under their noses like it's i don't know the explanation but i want one um i'm on the armed services committee and we're gonna get one yeah let's ask when they come asking for their budget yeah that's gonna be a question right what's your priorities because because you guys have a budget full of um you know bombs and missiles and and and pay raises and personnel and it seems all good but it doesn't seem like it's priority public what has me so what has me so concerned aside from the system you know how they view the the country that we're asking them to defend but you know dan you and i know when you're on the black helicopter in the middle of the night going after al qaeda on the other side of the world nobody's asking you you're not looking at your teammates and saying are you black white brown jewish nobody cares you certainly don't care about political party right it's about mission it's about country it's about our values it's about getting the job done and and what he talks about in that book is antithetical to the mission based mission mission-focused merit-based military that that you and i came up in is what and it's what made us the best military in the world goal of that book is to make it about race right like that's the literally the stated goal of the book it's like you have to stop looking at people as the contents of their character you have to stop being colorblind we need you to see color at all times i can't imagine a more toxic thing to do to an institution that relies on social cohesion and and seeing each other as a fellow marine or a fellow sailor or a fellow man i mean the old adage the enemy's bullets could care less about black white or brown all they care about is whether you're american or not i mean the enemy doesn't care it's like the soviet union came back to life and and populated the navy reading list because this is exactly what they talk about about demoralizing i mean did you ever seen that interview with uh it's this old kgb agents the interviews from 1984. this amazing interview everybody should watch i can't remember what the guy's name is but if you like google kgb agent 1984 you'll find it he talks about the steps the soviets took to demoralize americans and it's basic and that's what's kind of started the 60s revolution it's what the north koreans did in their brainwashing camps where they had multiple american soldiers you know get on on international television and sign statements you know denouncing the united states but they use societal wedges the biggest one being race right uh and and now we have um you talk about north vietnam no north korea and north vietnam yeah both both yeah yeah yeah that's exactly right it's um like it's it's easy to screw with us um and and we can't feed into it you know i think that's the point okay what were you saying about the west point uh we'll finish that well it's it's it's a a parent of a west point cadet that sent me a screenshot from one of their classes uh that said uh how to deal with your white rage that's the class you know the critical race theory class that they're taking but i think at a bigger level we now have a you know when a new secretary comes in and you know this dan just as a new commander of a unit the first couple of things you do really sets the tone in terms of your priorities yeah so secretary austin um has ordered an operational stand down across the entire force to deal with extremism in the ranks and and i want to be very clear we always want to root out extremists in our ranks but it's all kinds of extremists he said in his memo specifically white supremacists we should root out all extremists whether you're anarchists whether you're a west point cadet so we didn't mention antifa yeah whether you're in antifa anarchist communist you name it but he didn't say that he said extremists particularly white supremacists and like the question i have for him if he was sitting right here right now what evidence do you have that we have a white supremacy problem in the military if you're going to accuse hundreds of thousands of people of of being a part of this because that's what you're doing by saying you're going to root it out whether you like it or not or that it's that it's of such scale that's infiltrated the military i mean it has been there it is there and it should always be dealt with and there's regulations defining what an extremist is and all commanders should upload should uphold those regulations but is it of such scale within our military that it has to be one of the first things that you do as a new defense secretary so i'm looking at it in terms of priorities right yeah we have the chinese navy that's larger than ours now they're building ships every other month at a rate five to one outbuilding us they launched more into space last year than the rest of the world combined they're literally biologically making super soldiers their president is telling their military to prepare for war uh in invading taiwan and this is the first thing right and the most important thing uh that he's focused on so it just really caused me to raise an eyebrow in terms of his priorities and what do you think they're doing to like quote unquote rooted out i mean are they are they just looking through social media posts like i'm not exactly sure what they're doing at this point it doesn't seem like a whole lot i think that's the good news you and i know it an operational stand down in terms of a training problem if you have a fracture side if you have a maintenance problem say in your aircraft but an operational stand down so you're stopping training and yeah everything you're doing is military to then root out extremism yeah i mean that's a great question what does that might look like in the past it looks like is that a powerpoint yeah no it really is in the past so but but you know that just drives people apart right like when you when if that's if that's it's just it's gonna lower morale considerably i bet if we i bet if we took the temperature on morale in the military a few months ago versus now i i think i know exactly what would be happening right because everybody feels like they're being the other and i think that you know a lot of people are are really concerned about is the line that the administration is drawing the very fine line between uh between ex white supremacist extremist conservative and trump supporter is very very thin oh yeah what they've been doing very thin right and but to now have the leader of the united states military kind of seeming to maybe slip down that road i it's not clear to me yet uh is concerning it's extremely concerning i'm going to read some i'm going to kind of summarize i've gotten so many letters uh along these lines and so i'm going to kind of summarize all of them but they've basically people emailing me about the officer training that they deal with so so you know in the navy probably is the army too at about the oh for not before he gets to do anything uh the 405 level you do like you know kind of um you know mid mid-level intermediate um training you know just learning how to be that next level of leader right is how i would describe what is usually a couple weeks of training you kind of retreat out there it's mixed people pilots might be like seals do a specific one actually a couple of weeks and drinking tea and we're already such better some trumpets than the army that it's we don't need it but we do it anyway um but you know what i never did was unconscious bias training um one of the reasons i don't think we ever did it was because unconscious bias is voodoo pseudoscience crap it doesn't actually mean anything but this is what we're doing apparently in our military now unconscious bias training i i did i got some of it at harvard i remember that right um and they put you through this sort of debunked it is it is totally debunked right there's there's no evidence that that shows there's a link a causality between unconscious bias and actual behavior actual choices that are made but anyway we do it anyway because everybody's everybody's bad and everybody needs to be told that they're racist right and then they need to read how to be an anti-racist in order to redeem yourself this has become almost like a religious doctrine and we're putting it in our military and they're going through this and they're asked like certain questions like okay you see somebody on a train like what are you thinking about them like what would you would you do this what would you do here this is evidence that you're a racist this is evidence that you are biased and this is this has the potential to affect your decisions even if you don't know it and so you're guilty no matter what yeah well and here's you play that forward into a combat scenario right and and you're in a situation where where you've got to run through the hail and machine gun fire to go get your buddy uh and to drag him back and you know darn well you may die before you ever get there or you see someone take that action or not take that action in that instant i mean i've seen someone literally curl up into a ball and start crying uh it was in the face of fire it was not it was not me it was an awful awful night uh in all seriousness but here's in in all seriousness here's where that so so we're now going to start planting that seed in our soldiers sailors marines of maybe maybe they didn't go get that guy because he was black or he was brown yeah that's toxic right i mean that is truly truly toxic because everybody reacts in different ways in those scenes in those scenarios and some far better than others but what we can't have seeping in at a very basic level i mean this is in basic training this is in intermediate office training this is at the academies is that race or religion has something to do with that uh and it is that is that it will eat away like termites at the foundation of our military like we have to get back to basic liberal principles of logic and due process wherein you know if if you indeed are going to accuse somebody of this there has to be some amount of evidence and linear reasoning to get you there you can't just say well it's unconscious you don't know you're doing this wrong but you are well then how can i ever get better like you just you literally can't and in fact it's it's like it's like the movie inception like that idea is in there so you're probably thinking about it much more than you otherwise would have and and if you're a minority well now you're constantly thinking about it now you're attributing every single action to this this really toxic idea demanding officers your your squad mates to your left and to your right it creates suspicion and everything that we are trying to do and should be trying to do in the military is overcome all of that and build that unit cohesion and say leave all of that aside it's all about merit it's all about performance in training and then on the battlefield and this is this is heading in the exact opposite direction it really is and it's all bs i mean they you know they'll throw unconscious bias studies out of court because look this is this science has been completely debunked and um if you're listening to this instructors who are putting this on you better have some answers we're coming for you we're coming mike's on the armed services committee pentagon um all right let's uh i've got we've got so many topics of politicization in the military we're gonna i think we're almost done though well maybe let's go ahead and get to the oh transgender stuff okay let's talk about this quickly um because i already did a whole podcast on it but i'm just going to read some non-deployable medical conditions right if you have this you can't deploy asthma seizure disorders diabetes heat stroke dental problems can't forget the day so dental i mean dental problems you don't get a dental oh my god that was like everybody's nightmare um something you can you can be super seal if you've got if you've got bad teeth you're not going anywhere uh musculoskeletal conditions all sorts of um uh sleep apnea you know i mean flat feet are an issue non-deployable psychiatric conditions psychotic bipolar disorders suicide attempts substance abuses any kind of psychotic hospitalizations um you know of course there's a lot of different things under psychotic and bipolar disorders like there's there's obviously a lot of categories there um look there's there's and to be clear before before you deploy for combat we go through all of these evaluations right you go through a whole series of them through dentists through psychological through physical evaluations if you have any of these body mass index i mean just a lot of things if you have any of these you're not going to deploy and eventually if you can't deploy you get thrown out of the military and so let's go over real quick what trump's transgender ban actually was um it wasn't like a complete ban that a lot of people think it was okay it's a history of diagnosis of gender dysphoria unless stable for 36 months no gender change stay deployable and retainable or your grandfathered in between obama opening and new policy so the disqualification was mainly surrounding um an actual medical transition and um those without history or diagnosis may continue to serve in their biological sex so so let's break that down in layman's terms it basically says that mike look if if you're part of my team and the next day you come to me and you're like i am not mike i am i am uh you're gonna do this i'm mandy okay and i say michelle can we go with michelle you're mandy all right and um you're randy you just kind of i like mandy's all right and i say mandy just get back to work right that's it that's the policy get back to work mine mandy and you're like whoa whoa i'm gonna go get a medical transition i say you can't do that okay you have to you have to serve as mike but there's no don't ask don't tell policy like you can't be fired for it you get to be you um but but but just like you can't get tattoos on your face okay like if you're mike still and you're like hey uh dan i want to get tattoos on my face you can't get tattoos on your face and i want a ponytail down to my butt you can't get a ponytail down well seals can because we're cooler than you but but you can't all right because like there's there's a lot of aesthetic standards in the military there's behavioral standards and i think this is the right way to talk about the transgender issue um i think that we should love every human for who they are right if when i see a trans person i'm like you're just a person to me you're a person i see you as a person i do not want to dehumanize anybody but if you behave differently now i judge you according to that behavior and if you're definitely behaving vastly different than you were yesterday okay you can't expect me to to simply tolerate that right because now you're infringing like now you're interacting with me in a different way um i hope that makes sense for people and i think it's the right way to think about these difficult policy discussions when um when we're discussing this but in the context of the military i mean the medical stuff and the medical side and that's why i started off reading that list of of reasons you can't be in the military and reasons you can't deploy is because medical complications in the transgender with somebody who's transitioned are extreme and like i don't say that lightly i mean extreme uh we again we did a podcast on that where we had a woman who transitioned to a man and the complications that you know that that she talked about or just or sorry he talked about because i'm not trying to misgender anybody right like he's a he now and they're extreme like they're extreme and he's like there's no way that somebody in my condition could possibly serve in the military you just can't you know i for me the answer on this one is is relatively so it's a complicated issue in terms of what they have to go through but the answer to me continues to be in the kiss principle keep it simple it's about mission and it's about standards and if you can hit those standards and you can accomplish the mission then fine i don't care what race religion social economic background gender in between gender that you are i think there's a real question of whether the taxpayer needs to put the bill for you to get there that's the question that's one uh but but number two because you're putting you're footing a bill to make you undeployable you know and it's like you just read a whole list of medical conditions that the military is determined if you have those conditions you can't do the job that the military needs you to do and that's it what we can't have in this slippery slope that we're going down is starting to change the standards or um or adjust the mission so that we can check a box right and that's the bottom line the standards the standard the mission is the mission it can't be discriminatory you know the on the same the other side of that is the military can't modify those because they don't want certain people in i mean they did that in the past whether it was on race they've done it in the past uh at times on on gender we need to decide what the mission is what the standard is and that's it and whoever fits that fits it yeah we need a military to fight and win wars and but but i will say that that is true but i would also say we should not deliberately um allow somebody to to undergo a a medical procedure that makes them that ensures that they cannot meet this absolutely yeah if they don't meet the standard after that procedure that's it right okay let's let's hit the target carlson thing um so he got in hot water um because i mean let's quote one of the things he said and and kind of the whole spiel was sort of along these lines so so we've got new hairstyles and maternity flight suits pregnant women are going to fight our wars it's a mockery of the us military um i didn't yeah so i i'm trying to see his broader point i think he was just trying i think he was obviously well he started provocative he started out the piece with the threat that is the chinese military right and how they're creating super soldiers how they're you know i mean they really are kicking our butts across the board when it comes to the new drone fight you know the new stealth fighters they're rolling out the ships that they're building uh it's we we need a wake-up call to the cold war that we're in as a military he's right about meanwhile and he's absolutely right about that i disagree with them the role of women have been i think fantastic uh in the military but we can't have a military that's more about social engineering than it is about winning wars i i think i think that's what he's trying to get at i think it's very an artful the way he got there i think he would and i don't agree with what he said to be clear um because again you know as we said earlier cyber warriors pilots logisticians intel officers and ones that meet the standards uh special operators infantry infantry men and women fine right but we need the best of the best to deal with this threat yeah yeah i'm definitely of multiple minds about this entire controversy uh and we're gonna unpack the the military's response to it but like he would have been better off sort of being like look the chinese are over here prioritizing this and then he should have listed all the things that we've literally talked about on this podcast um like you know we're concerned about when a trans when somebody can transition uh we're concerned about our reading list being woke enough you know we're concerned about all this nonsense and the chinese are talking about supersonic missiles and and and satellites that can you know zap us like you know an invasion from mars or whatever that movie did i get there they just signed an accord with russia to have a man station on the moon and they're on track to do it why is the why is that comedy show space force so foretelling and pressing it i mean jesus okay um so yeah he's definitely an artful and i don't think he realizes that like um you know like congress funded different uniforms for pregnant women and i think that's wholly understandable like because they have to buy different clothes i actually i actually co-sponsored uh an initiative on maternity uniforms because the military was wasting so much money and these women were literally buying a new uniform as their pregnancy progressed every month and we said hey military why don't you just loan them some for a month and take it back and loan it to another woman save millions and millions of dollars but it's the wrong example to choose if you're going to choose why the military's screwed up like there's one over a bunch of things to be clear there's all kinds of reasons where our military is falling behind the chinese women isn't one of them and pregnant women isn't one of them either like you know again that's that's not the issue but he i think he was in artfully getting at what we have yeah this woke me that's what i want to do social engineering uh and and that focus and i go back to where are our priorities i want us focused on building more and better ships launching more and better rockets having the best soldiers i don't care what race religion background they come from that can beat the other guy or deter them this is what the left never understands about a strong military's the peace through strength concept right they think like if they think they can beat us that is actually going to lead them uh and that's going to lead us closer to war yeah yeah i think that's right okay so let's talk about the the military's response all right this is where it all got interesting and there was a lot of outrage over it and like so the so the claim is that well there's a politicization of the military because the military's now going after a conservative journalist now um there's there's there's again there's kind of some truth to that um and i would also say like taking another step back like biden is the one who made this a big deal by having a press conference about the new uniform he's done other press conferences that are very woke in nature regarding he's just tripping over himself right like look at me i i i i made two women um and i think a minority woman like in charge of this command doesn't that that's really annoying actually because it takes away from that woman's accomplishment yeah it's tokyo treat her like everybody else how about you stand up and say this general is the best general in the military to lead this command oh by the way happens to be a minority woman but and i'd love to ask she's the best general how would that make her evaluation yeah because it would make me feel like crap you know um it would make me feel like i didn't get it out of my merits and i bet i bet she did i bet she honestly did get it out of her merits on the merits and you know but that that should be the story well i know the two women that he was referring to uh i know them by reputation their reputations are fantastic they are fantastic leaders they are great generals and i think you're absolutely right by having the first thing come out of your mouth that they are a minority or they're a woman is frankly insulting i think it's extremely insulting okay so i forgot i wanted to make that point um okay but then every then the pentagon started talking um look some of these responses strike me as as commanders kind of just defending their people like in defending their institution and i'm like you know what if somebody was talking crap about the seal teams and i was still active duty yeah i might hit back um so so some of it strikes me as that however on the pentagon's website um it it leads with um what does seem like a highly politicized response let me read it real quick so you know this is right on the pentagon's website it says press secretary smites use the word smites smite's host that dissed that's a navy word i think smith i think that's one they use a lot in the navy is it he's an admiral the press secretary so it must be a big time navy it's pretty funny on the reading list like it's again can they are they allowed to defend their institution yeah but this is how it leads the united states military is the greatest in the world it is the greatest the world has ever seen because of its diversity pentagon press secretary john kirby said during a news briefing this morning so that's where he got woke brother that's where he got woke so look he he's absolutely right that it is kind of it does seem true that tucker degraded the role of women in the military i i do see that um and i think it's wrong and we've already talked we've we've hit that point women have played a very exceptional and important role in the military but this press secretary is absolutely wrong it is not the greatest because of diversity that is that is a completely false statement and if it is if that is your position then i want you to back that up very clearly with facts and explain how we got there because i would actually point you to some harvard sociologists that have really studied this and show that it's really the opposite it actually you know the more diverse a community is the more problems they tend to have they tend to they don't they don't like mix up and get to know each other that's not what happens they end up they end up going into different cliques it causes more issues so that's on the that's on a kind of sociological level but there's but there's no there's no even there's no way to reason your way through that right like why would diversity within a sealed platoon make it better you know standards make it better everybody from all diverse backgrounds having to go through a certain selection course and and kind of trial by fire to make it to a certain standard and then train together that makes you an excellent force and we've proven that over and over and over again so that's proven but this guy's saying diversity and now now we all know it's just buzzwords right this is just what it's it's kind of like this sort of you know religious mantra that is repeated over and over again we're stronger because of diversity and if you repeat it enough times it becomes totally true well i want to know why it's true i mean i really do so i mean so just to take a step back i mean i think there's two fundamental sacred aspects to our military one civilian control with the military and in our republic that makes us different than many countries in the rest of the world and two is an apolitical military so i think you're i agree with you i think you're right in kind of defending the role of women as we've talked about and the great contributions that they make in our service but i think where he crossed the line is then going after a journalist or opinion leader or or what have you on on a political point if you want to take a defensive stance fine but that's not what that headline is it leads with press secretaries smites smites navy word journalist yeah right yeah they could have handled it better like i defend your institution i i get that but like don't get all silly about it um so i think both sides you know if we had a grade had this whole controversy i'd say like that both sides kind of screwed up on this one a little bit yeah um okay so the way the one i want to end this is let's talk more broadly um what do you think about flag officers in general just voicing their politics um you know active duty obviously off-limits yeah not in uniform but non-active duty i mean um you know retired a lot of retired admirals writing letters against trump um retired generals and admirals supporting trump um same with by you know doesn't elicit that kind of attention just generally speaking but um we have a long history of former military officers being fantastic continuing that service and and continuing to lead the country and bringing all of the things that they learned in their military service not just the experience overseas but leadership followership teamwork mission focus a perspective on how this you know maybe a country that always needs to approve but truly is an exceptional country i mean that's why you know you and i have talked a lot about how we need more veterans in our politics yeah i i don't i'm not only fine with that i encourage it yeah in uniform absolutely off-limits once you're out of uniform roll up your sleeves and continue to serve you can't just sit at the vfw and and tell war stories or write books in your case and and uh and uh i have one too you wrote a book yeah yeah i knew you were going there but um so not only fine with it encourage it from zachary taylor to grant to eisenhower we can go down you know we can go down the list i i could argue it both ways um you know i because it kind of depends on how they do it i think it might be maybe the better answer like it sort of depends um some some do it well and honorably and others you know especially when it's like a a list of generals writing a political letter because now you're not really speaking as a civilian you are speaking with the rank of general or admiral because because you all grouped together danger there and the danger there is now with so few people serving as compared to previous generations a lot of people frankly don't understand the difference to your point uh and i think you have to be very clear when you're retired and when you're out of service and when you're in yeah there's um you know a lot of people think like the military politics and the politics of former officers are kind of interesting like the military leans conservative generally speaking i think that's because the conservative disposition is risk-taking i've done i've done like written a lot about this i've got some research to back we just take physical risks it actually kind of explains the lockdown controversy um why do why do red states prefer to be open and free and take that risk and why do blue states not we're just more comfortable with physical risk taking yeah i think there's some institutional things but i also think there was a lot to do with where we were in history and anti-trumpism and just reacting to anything there's a whole slew of explanations sure um and it's it's an interesting conversation a psychological one but but uh but you know people who are already conservative tend to say okay i'll join the military i'll join law enforcement i'll be a lumberjack i'll do physically risky things this is born out in the data so that might be why they end up dispositionally more conservative but there's a lot of very liberal people in the military too and i think one of the attractions of the of the military is that it's the largest bureaucracy in the world and there's this sense of like i can just decide to do things i can centralize this control and i can do things and i love that so people ask is because i'll get that question from constituents sometimes like how they're from the military how are they so liberal and i'm like well think about it because because the bureaucracy is so extreme and so it really lends itself to a more um liberal set of policy making let's get the code out get it out okay got it her direction um uh anybody's so that's my theory anyway you know and i think that again again because it's a mix right like you see um liberal i i i don't see a lot of flag officers in congress which is interesting there's a lot more people like mid-career types like us why do you think that is because i think that they've since invested so much you've drug your family around for so long in the army's case to so many horrible places in the middle of nowhere where you can run around in tanks and and you know in the countryside where the town is typically built up around the base so you sacrificed so much uh at that point whereas i think for for us um we got out of the military for a lot of our frustrations where we see like-minded individuals with confirmation bias promoting like-minded individuals really what it takes the sacrifice and the all-volunteer military to get to that flag officer rank where um and and really the corporate letters are ladders that you have to climb you know the boxes that you have to check and i think frankly folks like you get frustrated with that well i lost my eye that's the only reason well there's that too you said the word corporate and that reminded me i did want to bring this up um maybe to wrap us up which is one of the problems and with um with the way i see too many flag officers acting is they act too much like ceos and actually that's one of the reasons i think they don't even get into politics is because they've they've become very corporate i'm gonna use that word difference in a manager and a leader right yeah and and sort of highly risk averse um which is very corporate right the the goal this is why this is why corporations give in to woke canceled culture so fast because they're like what do i have to do just to have nothing else happen yeah now i think that's bad long-term thinking because um yeah it's going to be painful for like a few days and oh my god all the tweets but then then it's over right and everybody's buying goya okay like it worked standing up to cancel culture actually works and i see too many flag officers and the reason we're doing this podcast is because i think there's way too okay fine let's put it on the reading list okay fine just do the do the confirmation or the unconscious bias training just do it it's fine like if we do it then we'll look they'll they'll think we're one of them and we can it's like it's like the walking dead where you like drape blood and guts all over you and the zombies around you think that you're one of them that's like the same with woke culture but no no but you raise a great point in the terms of risk aversion and i actually have a whole chapter that in my book you can talk about it no it's all good um but i have a chapter about it in combat where you know where that one-year deployment on an otherwise very promising career you're just on the cusp of promotion the driving forces don't screw it up don't have a base overrun don't have your soldiers losing sensitive items don't have you know any kind of sexual harassment charges or anything along those lines the the default reaction to controversy becomes inaction right or becomes lack of action and risk aversion and it is i think it is because in an all-volunteer for well think about it the draft force where you're pulled out of your life pulled out of your career your business and sent over there you're incentivized to take every risk necessary to accomplish the mission win the war so you could get back home but now in the volunteer force or the career force it becomes don't screw up the promising career that i've sacrificed so much for my family and become and risk aversion has seeped through our entire force and i think you that's that's a great point to draw that line connect the dots between that and the wokism it's just keep giving because otherwise i don't want to get blown up i don't want to get cancelled and i don't want my promotion ruined yeah it's it's the safe route and frankly one of the reasons i want to do this podcast the reason i've been speaking out this week is because i don't want it to be safe anymore right no more safe spaces for for wokism in the military it's not safe on the armed services committee at least not on behalf good it shouldn't be and um you know it's time we step up that that's why we're doing this um and it's it's it's gonna get fought for like we have to fight for our institutions that protect our country they're the most it's one of the most important um we have train fight and win wars that needs to be the focus and be a navy seal not a green beret okay that's it all right thanks everybody thanks mike that was awesome appreciate it hey go army beat navy all right i'll give you that last word

thank you first of all let me just say thank you to the chairman for holding this hearing today I know senator Lee and I and a number of committee members had requested this so appreciate the conversation today and then like my colleagues I want to echo thank you all for being here your voices will make that change will make a difference and help others and that's one of the things I want to talk about you know I've spent prior to coming to Senate my gosh 10 years as a prosecutor working to protect children from sexual predators what I have seen and heard here today unfortunately is a system failure that has allowed these predators to thrive and you've talked about it the grooming that occurs the keeping the parents out and one issue that I want to talk specifically about cuz I only have about five minutes is this notion that of children sometimes there's this thought they should be asking for help but when you're a child and you don't know any different this becomes your norm so you don't know that you need to ask for help and when you do figure that out is there somebody that you can reach out to for help that's what I see happening here and so what I would love from the four of you your thoughts what I have found is sometimes it helps to have an advocate somebody who is there with the athlete somebody that the particularly our child athletes become familiar with knowing that it's somebody that is going to advocate on their behalf for everything that you've just talked about do you think if we were looking at implementing and working with the USOC that we were looked at having child advocates amongst the system that that would be helpful and that would have helped you and or will help other children that are coming through the amateur sports to help them address their needs and let me just open it all all of you I absolutely think that's necessary with the USA Gymnastics we had what do they call it an athlete representative who was also on the selection committee so she was supposed to be our advocate but she was also the one deciding whether we made the team or whether we would you know go compete for Team USA so even if she wasn't she would be there to advocate for us we didn't want to tell her anything because we were scared is gonna ruin our chances which right we know it probably would have so I feel very strongly but that has to be somebody who's who doesn't he's not on a selection committee who is totally on athletes side and that's their main role was making sure that we can trust them and they'll they'll stand up for us maybe even because I had a similar experience with my athlete rep not that I don't think she was on the selection committee at the time but we definitely couldn't trust her everything we told her she would just run back and tell them and we would just get in more trouble so maybe it may be an athlete rep could be somebody from a different sport because I do think it is it is a good idea but somebody that's not so close because it seems like in our experience if they're working for them they're working with them but I did I did want to mention this might be a little off your question but real quickly and one of the other issues I found so as I was working with another coach I was coaching with him and I started seeing things that I wanted to be in denial about and I saw that he was touching the kids and appropriately when he was spotting and I I didn't know what to do and when I finally decided to report it to the police I wanted to be anonymous and they wouldn't they wouldn't allow me to be anonymous and they wanted to interview the children and I was like that's not gonna work these some of these kids are five and it's like it's like five to 16 years old and they don't even know they were not even aware that they're being abused right now and so I just I wanted to bring that up because they think that's another avenue to look into it is how when it is reported how does the invest go down because you know these these are highly skilled manipulators and you know this one had a family and it's like it's his word against theirs and if you can't prove it you know it destroys a lot of lives and that's that's just something I wanted to point out because I I couldn't go through with the full report because because of that thank you no and I agree and I think and just for my experience I know many law enforcement agencies have specific units that just focus on on child sexual abuse so that the investigators and the prosecutors know how to talk and and and relate and do that type of investigation but not all have the resources to do so but I agree that is part of the the issue here that I have seen is this willingness to come forward but at the same time law enforcement needs enough information so that they can take action because once you go to law enforcement it's a criminal action so they have to be able to investigate it from a criminal perspective and that means going through all of those hoops so there is there is a disconnect and we've got to figure out how we connect that you're absolutely right let me ask you this on on the another question very quickly because I'm actually I'm out of time I just realize that so I have other questions to follow up on but I will submit those for the record but let me just say this thank you again I look forward to the opportunity to work with you I am committed to making change however we can systemic change and I am looking forward to the USOC coming here along with the national governing bodies and folks from Michigan they should be at the table here and they should be answering our questions so thank you again for being here

a tribute to bruno mars put on by the valley cultural foundation in fact we'll have a constituent service booth there so come on by talk to me personally and uh talk to john talk to kimberly talk to our other constituent service team if you have a any an issue with any federal agency uh in fact uh our booths will be there every one of the next five sundays and i will be there every one of the next five sundays so i look forward to seeing you in person once again you can dial star three to get in the queue um i wanna why i originally thought when we scheduled this town hall that there wouldn't be much happening in congress and so we invited an outstanding leader from both the the city and the state level and they will have their reports as well but just in the last couple of days there have been significant developments here uh today we passed the chips bill which is designed to make sure that we bring back to the united states of the production of computer chips there are semiconductors if you will right now only 12 of what we use is made here in the united states this makes us particularly vulnerable and frankly a a huge portion of the chips we use come from taiwan and there is the possibility that the people's republic of china interferes with taiwan in one way or another that's a foreign policy problem we have to make sure that it's not also a domestic economic problem and this will make a huge investment in our chip and computer manufacturing capacities what you may not realize is these chips are in everything and we have thousands of automobiles just sitting there at gm and ford that can't be completed because they have to put in one of what hundreds and sometimes a thousand ships in uh in each car and uh whether it's uh you know your any of the appliances in your home any of the devices and of course all the things that you expect computer chips to be in those chips are critically important even more recently just last night we saw an agreement on the inflation reduction act now the people are saying well this isn't quite as big as democrats were trying to pass it is a a transformative piece of legislation um and it will do a number of things first and foremost it will reduce our carbon emissions by roughly 40 percent between now and the end of the decade uh that by itself will make not only the biggest um effort toward reducing carbon uh from the united states made anything in our history but it's also the biggest single thing that's been done by any country in the world now that's a little unfair to countries like denmark because obviously we're much bigger and per capita denmark has done more but um in terms of a single action designed to reduce carbon nothing is bigger than this it will also extend the subsidies for those buying obamacare affordable care act insurance over the next three years it will allow medicare to negotiate for prescription drug prices we pay double or triple with the rest of the world even the developed world pays for the same drugs this will drive that cost down by about half for medicare and in doing so it's what isn't mentioned in the summaries of the bill is that it will also drive down the cost for other consumers as well because i think it'll establish the the new fixed price for each drug that's negotiated the bill will reduce our deficit over the next uh 10 years by 300 billion dollars it'll do that by imposing a 15 percent corporate minimum tax by the prescription drug uh pricing uh negotiation uh through additional irs uh enforcement uh particularly on wealthy individuals and corporations the audit rate in that group has declined precipitously and uh there are as well over 600 billion perhaps a trillion dollars a year that is not being collected and uh it deals with the carried interest loophole which i'll describe if somebody asks a question it has an enormous uh 369 billion dollar investment in our clean energy future and and to mention a detail or two um the 15 corporate minimum tax is on taxable income uh so the bill doesn't go as far as we have agreed with 20 other countries or 19 other countries to go to impose a 15 percent tax minimum tax on the book income the income that they don't put on their tax return but that they put in their shareholder reports i talked to chuck schumer about this today and there is a good chance that we'll be able to comply with our agreement and raise an awful lot more revenue from large multinational corporations in the next tax bill if we can set a 15 minimum so those are the two big bills the one passed today uh one where we have an agreement and i'll i'll add a footnote senator christian cinema of arizona has not officially said that she'll vote for the inflation reduction act i think she will and i and i think it'll be the most important bill that we passed certainly in the last five years so with that i want to introduce the first of our guest speakers and that is uh dr lynn goldman um she has um joined us she this is the 18th time she has contributed her time to these town halls and she's backed by popular demand she is a member of the national academy of medicine and i i could go on and on about all the things she's done she's an epidemiologist and the pediatrician and i know a lot of us are concerned about the children in covet 19. and it's particularly good to have her on because just today it was announced that los angeles county will not be reimposing the indoor mask mandate so we have big news regarding kovid just in our own area dr goldman where do we stand on this vendetta hi it's so great to be with you again for a town hall meeting we are at a point now in the pandemic where it's seeming to have hit kind of what i would call a steady state and and the good news being that things are not increasing to the point where for example in la there's a need to reimpose the mask mandate and the bad news being that we still have pretty steadily every day a few hundred people in the united states who are dying from coven 19 somewhere in the range of about 400 to 450 right now which is up a little bit from where it was a couple of weeks ago as well as a lot of people across the country who are in the hospital or in the icu i should say that most of those people are people who don't have good immunity to covet and most of that is due to the fact that so many in our country have not been fully immunized and and haven't gone on to get the booster shots as well and i do think that the most important thing that i could say to everybody who's on the line today is that it is very important to sustain our immunity to copin 19. we are seeing that even though the vaccines that we're using right now are for the original variant that was first circulating back in 2020 and there certainly have been a lot of changes in the virus that's been circulating over that time that so far the vaccines are holding a wall that is preventing most of us from if we do get the the disease from having to go to the hospital from having to be in the icu and from dying and that is a really almost miraculous thing and the new vaccines that are being developed right now the boosters that we're hoping will be delivered in full will come a little bit closer to the current variants that are circulating and i think do an even better job of protecting us from the most severe outcomes so everybody if there's if there's anybody on the line who still is doubtful about the value of getting vaccinated we not only see this this amazing ability of these vaccines to save our lives but also there's still a very high level of safety that we're experiencing and that i think is very important as well that people can feel confident that they will be safe that their family members and especially their children will be safe if they receive the vaccines so you know in terms of other updates i i the the only other thing i would say is that and we saw it with the president president biden and that is that even among those who are far more susceptible such as people in their 70s such as our president that this medication paxlova that's available we saw that he did not have to be hospitalized he did not have any severe outcomes and receiving the tax loaded i think probably made a big difference in his case and others who are more fragile because of being older because of having underlying health problems or maybe even having weakened immune systems for one reason or another and and i think that's another piece of good news and at the same time that pexlovic probably isn't enough if people haven't been vaccinated at all so i thank you um for for having me tonight and that doctor i do you have one question um that 400 to 450 people a day who are dying that's like five times the number of people we lose to automobile accidents i know most of us wear the seat belt most of the time um is it true that just a very tiny portion of that 450 people who are dying each day are people who are fully vaccinated and boosted that's true it's it's relative it's mostly people who either have not been vaccinated at all or who received the primary vaccines but didn't get boosted and and then there are a few unfortunately who are in that group because they do have weaker immune systems or other underlying problems but that is very true the vast majority you know it's only about one in five people in in most of the the country who have not been vaccinated people 65 and up um 92 percent of people over the age of 65 in the country got the primary vaccines but unfortunately only about two-thirds have had a booster and we just need to stay the course with not only getting um the boosters but as you know it's been estimated that the boosters are good for probably something like six to nine months and so when the next boosters are available to just go and get the booster is the most prudent thing thank you i want to point out that in addition to those who ask questions from the floor everyone will be given an opportunity to express their opinion because we're going to have survey questions you can answer by just pressing buttons on your phone and we'll announce those answers as we go forward but before we do anything else let's take a couple questions from the floor don i'm not sure that people can hear you can you hear me now now we hear you okay good megan from rocita you are on hi um my question is about the uh i'm worried about sending my kids to school um we're right now our leading indicator is showing that we have higher covid in our um in our waste water than we did back in february 15 times higher and i'm seeing a lot of kids and a lot of friends are getting sick and covered still what can we do what can we do to make me feel safer about my kid going back to school doctor first and foremost uh your kids now can be immunized and i think that's a good idea just in terms of protecting them from coded but second i you do need to be concerned if there are adults with whom they interact who are vulnerable because they either refuse to get immunized or because they have some kind of a problem with the immune suppression and by that i mean for example uh somebody who has received an organ transplant who's on the immunosuppressive therapy or has a disease that you know it's where a doctor has said that that there is an immune deficiency and um and in that case you would want your children to be masked and you'd want those adults to be a mask when they're together but doctor in the in the regular circumstance where there's no one in the home that's immune compromised i mean very few people have gotten organ transplants etc um if you'd advise the kids to get properly immunized but not necessarily wear masks at school well the kids can wear mask at school if they if they prefer i i think i think that we all have the right to do that and remember there are kids also who have underlying health problems so they need to mask and other kids may want to wear masks in solidarity with those kids so that they don't feel singled out there's nothing wrong with wearing a mask but i but kids do not have to mask in school right now and i and i think that's important i think that there is important learning that uh that that that kids um need to experience in terms of really being able to learn learning how to interpret facial expressions you know learning emotional confidence that it is important for kids to be able to be in situations where everybody isn't masking but they are certainly entitled just like anybody to wear a mask if they wish and if a family feels that everyone in their family should be masculine school i think that's okay too um but um again we're not saying that they have to do that i've been told by several people that i look much better wearing a mask but that's a separate point let's go on to one more question from the floor okay congressman i'm sorry i don't know if i'm giving a last or a first name here uh bradley from northridge about infrastructure bradley you are on now yes hello hello hi can you hi can you hear me i can hear you yes hi there congressman sherman i've always vote for you oh we have a brilliant caller please continue yes yes so i'm really curious what happened to the infrastructure bill one's going to be funded what was that again when will the infrastructure build those paths will it be funded well the bipartisan infrastructure bill is a 10-year program and so parts of it has been funded already but the it's a big bill that will be funded over a long period of time um and uh so what whatever improvements in transportation and whatever jobs it provides is spread out over a decade so it uh oh i see it's not like we pass a bill and uh and and all of a sudden there are three extra lanes on the 405. oh no uh but uh i uh uh i i i many of you know i've you know i've been working for for a long time to try to see us uh have rail through the sepulveda pass but uh there's nothing specific in the bipartisan infrastructure bill that says the money has to be spent between now and the olympics to build the rail through the sepulveda pass but that would be a good thing um at this point let's do a let's do a survey question uh do you approve of president biden's performance as president so far press one if you approve press two if you disapprove and press three if you're unsure or kind of rate them as in the middle and with that why don't we take one more question from the floor all right one more uh transit question specifically on the sepulveda pass there's been a few of those in the queue this one is greg from sherman oaks greg you are on thank you hi bret hi brad um thank you thank you for doing this it's fabulous um i think my wife and i have been thinking about this for a long time and uh you know i'm part of soha and um i go to the neighborhood council meetings particularly the vision the sherman oaks homeowners association for those correct not blessed believe in america's best name city go on yeah indeed and we live here and love it um but um i i'm a big fan i don't know what your take is on this but i i really do think that we should because we already have the right of way as far as i understand it in the county use the uh 405 and put a monorail down the center of it rather than put something underground our city is so beautiful you know and i've taken the subway from north hollywood to downtown and i have to tell you i don't love it it's basically a new york subway with steel wheels loud raucous um and i just don't understand why we can't use the existing right-of-way down the center of the freeways for this kind of thing and not yeah i'll review the the the there are four proposals really they come down in a way to two proposals one is as you describe a monorail um uh above the 405 freeway that could be built a little sooner in part because it would cost less money there are some ridership groups that think oh you'll be breathing all the air from the cars the fact is a lot of us drive the 405 freeway and uh we're much more upset about the the traffic and the bumper-to-bumper than the fact that we're on the freeways matter of fact the freeway is moving fast we i think i'd be fine um and as you point out i think you know uh it's uh it would be a great experience to uh to be whizzing by on the 405 and see the getty and see as you point out a beautiful city the chief disadvantage of the monorail and using the 405 is that it doesn't create a stop right at the middle of ucla now the fact is we don't have many ucla students who live in the valley a lot more who go to northridge and those students don't necessarily have to arrive at campus at nine o'clock right when they face the the worst rush hour but there is a fair number of ucla staff and medical staff that live in the valley so ucla strongly believes that it ought to be a subway the subway has some disadvantages that point out it's going to take longer to build it's going to cost more money it's going to take longer to assemble all that money to go forward uh and um there are people in bel air who will sue to stop it they are somehow convinced that it will hurt uh bel air uh i haven't seen any reason to you know i i haven't seen the analysis of that and a lot depends on how deep uh it it it's the boar is on the other hand if you have to go deeper to avoid hurting the people above then that adds a bit to the cost and most subways like the the west l.a line goes under not people's houses but goes under say wilshire boulevard but we do have in our city some subways that go under people's houses so um the i i want to see something built it's a benefit not only to the people who write it but it's a benefit for those who stay in their cars and don't have another car in front of them because the person who is going to be in that red toyota in fact is chosen to be on the train so or the or the monorail so um there the mta is having a number of discussion groups on this and i think the the monorail has general support except from those who are focused on on ucla which might be the most used stop uh now there would with a monorail you would of course have a stop in westwood or near westwood probably be you know right there at the the federal building there would be a shuttle bus to ucla uh and uh that may be uh that may be good enough uh uh to to attract a lot of uh ucla staff to to use the to to use the train but uh or the monorail so with that let's uh announce the uh first question we've got uh do you approve of biden's performance 61 percent of you say approved 22 percent disapprove and 17 or unsure at our last town hall um we had 71 percent approved 20 percent disapprove and 8 percent unsure so we've seen a number of valley residents move from the approved to the unsure category and with that i want to introduce our next guest speaker and that is senator robert hertzberg who has served as speaker of the assembly went on to serve as uh believe it was majority leader in the state senate um he was unanimously elected i might add as uh as a speaker by both republicans and democrats the los angeles daily news has described him as uh his relentless dedication and indefatigable energy and his reputation for integrity and perseverance um oh but i'm told that bob is not with us yet and so uh when when he does come on i won't repeat that introduction uh but we will take another question from the floor okay congressman uh another question for for for the doctor uh mary from reseda regarding when to get the second booster um mary you should be lived now i think he could now you know now you should be live sorry about that am i on you there mary yes hi hello hello yeah senator hertzberg calling okay hello hello hello mary is there uh if senator hertzberg is on i gave you a great introduction uh but uh uh they told me you weren't on yet so we've moved on to a question and uh we'll have you uh speak in just a second if you're on miss hertzberg okay thank you so let's let's uh let's hear the question for the doctor oh sure uh should i get a second covert booster in august or wait till fall to get the new variant vaccine hi yes i think if it's been at least six months since your first booster and you haven't had that second one i would go ahead and get the second one because i think that we're looking at um it's it's still um it's still july almost august and we won't see the new boosters probably until something like october or november so that shouldn't be too close in time for you to go ahead and get that when that's available as well so as i understand you doctor it's go ahead and get the booster now and when that refined uh new shot becomes available in the in the late fall as long as it's been a couple of months since you got your last booster you can get that as well absolutely and those of you who have already had two boosters you don't need to get a third one until that new one comes out but if you've only had one i'd go ahead and get the second one for sure with that i believe we have uh senator robert hertzberg with us um and uh at the state level many things are happening none are more interesting than the new uh inflation relief checks that are being sent out by the state and uh hopefully uh bob will tell us about those that they can go as high as one thousand fifty dollars for a family so uh bob why don't you tell us a little bit about uh those checks and uh anything else is happening in sacramento well good thank you so very much i rich lee apologize a friend of ours so i apologize oh yes my friend as well yeah after 40 years so here's here's the thing for those you know so i served in government some years ago a speaker and then i left for 12 years came back and majority leader of the senate represent along with congressman the san fernando valley and i just want to start because i think this is really important to say this you know we have money in california to be able to do these things but we don't have it on our own it's in partnership with the federal government so much money that puts us in this situation is because brad congressman sherman voted for a lot of this money and so my view is that when we look at these programs we implemented some things but the money you know it's not appropriate in my judgment to look and say federal government state government city government county government we're all in this together it's all your money and the federal government was a huge part of this so i want to give a lot of accolades to the congressman for this program now what is the program and what does it look like and who does it affect what we know so far because not everything has been determined first 9.5 billion dollars is being returned back to taxpayers a lot of money that captures approximately 17 million tax filers and some non-tax filers and as the congressman said families can recover receive as much as a thousand fifty dollars per household which will go out in the next coming months there's two types of things i want to talk about that i can certainly uh answer questions on i guess i can't answer questions but i think that will be helpful the first is what's called the middle class tax refund eligibility okay that middle-class tax fund eligibility rebate you must meet the following requirements one you have to file a 2020 tax return so it's not people who are not filing tax returns second you have to meet certain income requirements depending upon on you know how much money you're going to get you must be caliber california resident resident and you must not be claimed as a dependent on the tax filing now per the franchise tax board that the congress needs to serve on together with the department of finance if an individual did not file a 2020 tax attorney they're not eligible for a tax refund that's program one program two is the state's it is the state supplemental list if i have the numbers on this yeah the state supplemental payment increased in this instance you don't have to worry if you didn't file a tax return uh the state did this basically increase the state the state supplemental payments the program is which is augmented by the federal supplemental security program individuals are 65 or older or blind or disabled are eligible how much money are they going to get of each of anybody who's on this line will get how much will this this mean we don't have a final number because the franchise tax board and the department of finance is finalizing the numbers but i had my chief of staff call over and basically what they told me pursuant to the legislative analyst's office which is what who works for the legislature current maximum payments were 199. 120 nine dollars and 21 cents the projected max maximum um is 246.92 for a couple the maximum was 504 and it's projected maximums to go up to 625. so if you're a couple you get 120 more if you're an individual you'll you'll be getting about uh fifth round numbers fifty dollars more as a result of these additional dollars to help a little bit with respect to inflation first program you gotta be a tax filer second program you don't that's kind of where we are there's a number of other things that we've done at the state with some of the money the federal governments have given us uh for example an eviction defense the entire program that was that we paid for which is 5.4 billion dollars to help people to cover their rents all of which came from the federal government we didn't put in an extra dime we might have put a little bit more just recently but i can't remember it wasn't much but 5.4 billion dollars in the federal government that's where you got those checks from we administered it on behalf of the of the federal government and and there's a number of other things in the budget because if i just i'll end here but just to give some people context you know we got oh a couple hundred billion dollars in various forms from the federal government it was just extraordinary to help us during the down times during the during the during the pandemic and um you know so some of those things for the people on the phone that are business people that we're worried about is as you had employees who were had unemployment insurance we're paying for the space now with federal money is basically paying for for the first few years before having to be added to your payroll tax we also gave you a 50 000 for businesses a 50 000 grant against sales tax that you collect that you didn't have to repay so there's been a number of efforts both with respect to folks that are impacted and with respect to small businesses which um so much you know inform our our valley uh community so that that's kind of the in addition you know i've been fortunate enough because of my leadership roles and experience to bring a lot of money to the san fernando valley we got uh two million dollars for the skirball museum 5.7 million dollars for jewish family services to do homeless issues uh uh five million dollars for the discovery queue about enhancement damn seven million dollars for water projects in in city of san fernando uh a million dollars for trust for public land for environmental issues uh uh and just you know another 30 million 40 million dollars of other kinds of programs that we were able to help in terms of the valley which has just been really really quite extraordinary and we're not done yet there may be an additional supplemental budget where we're able to bring the fair share which is such a critical issue to us in in this in the san fernando valley so hopefully that helps congressman and i do want to give thank you credit for this you know and i really really appreciate hope i didn't go on too long that fine and uh uh senator hertzberg has been serving us for a long time he's got an outstanding office that helps people on snarl problems with state agencies and we did a mass email we'll have it up on our web page as well that describes these inflation relief checks if you believe that you're entitled to it and didn't receive it that's why that's why bob hertzberg has a constituent service office in the valley to help unstar all those problems just call me give my number yep what's your number bob the the um give him my number for my office uh you know i know my personal number but i know my office number excuse me for a second i apologize all right let me pull up my glasses here and look at my car embarrassed by that that question what's your number uh um the the office you know it says the sacramento office but that's better because the staff are better at getting that information is 916 650 and um for those that care i'll give you my personal self because like like the congressman i to him is accessible he's unbelievable in terms of what he does my cell phone is eight one eight three seven one six seven six four and uh we'll help you in any way we can anybody needs help thank you uh we now have a couple of written questions that came in from those who rsvped early by going to bradsherman.house.gov the first is from robert lenz who asks about voting on selling food to cuba i have voted consistently that we should sell food to cuba but i voted against the idea of loaning money to cuba on concessionary terms in large part because there's a very good risk that cuba will not ultimately pay us back and also because um there are a lot of people in the san fernando valley who would love to get a low interest loan to buy food at ralph's so our policy toward cuba has been we're happy to sell food and medicine but we don't have a government program to lend the money at a low rate the next question is from allison carter of west hills who wants to know how i voted on the respect for marriage act i was one of the co-sponsors of that act the entire democratic caucus voted for it we got 47 republicans about a quarter of the republicans to vote for it just on july 19th what it does is it repeals the defense of ameri of of marriage act and requires the u.s government to recognize the validity of same-sex marriages in the united states now you'd think why do you need to do that it's been well established by our supreme court that same-sex marriages are legal nationwide and the reason is that supreme court justice clarence thomas in his uh overruling of roe v wade also had in his concurring opinion a sentence saying that the court should revisit over uh overfeld versus hodge which is the supreme court decision that legalized marriage for the lgbt community nationwide and so uh in advance of any uh possible uh supreme court decision we in congress uh need to uh to have it be the law of the land uh that we have marriage equality um with that let's take one question from the floor and then we'll hear from paul koritz about the city okay congressman harry uh has a question about ukraine uh harry you are on now thank you hi hello congressman sherman can you hear me yes okay good thank you hi this is harry gilson i've had some great speakers on tonight um my question has to do with um ukraine i think it's great how we've been supporting him but the ukraine the news on ukraine which was all over the cable network in in the spring in particular um you know it's sort of evaporating now and what what can we be doing through this country um a great united states to support uh the people um of ukraine further to try i don't know i mean we we don't want to get into a nuclear war obviously with russia but um and i know you're not on any of the military committees i believe congressman but i'm the second most senior democrat on the foreign affairs committee so i'm very involved in the admission all right good i'm glad to hear that i apologize i was thinking strictly of the military though so on foreign affairs let's talk about that then so what is going on what have we done to try to bring in other nations i mean i know the world is united here in a lot of ways i'm surprised israel but i don't understand why israel has had to kind of back off a little bit but um president zielinski has done an amazing job and i'm so glad president biden is in office because i don't think we would have had this response from the united states that we've had had president trump still been in office um i think we can all agree on that so what what first of all okay uh ukraine is not just about ukraine if russia could have [Music] could have just marched into eve and taken over ukraine and that's although the ukrainians have uh have fought gallantly if there had been no support from the west that might have happened then not only would ukraine fall but if the west isn't going to do anything to help ukraine what about poland what about lithuania uh these countries are in nato so you have to believe in international law we don't believe that one country can just go conquer another country just because it's bigger or more powerful our response was i think the right one and that is to support ukraine but not send american forces and not take the kinds of actions that could have americans shooting at russian soldiers because the number one goal here is to avoid thermonuclear war and ultimately uh wars are fought because both sides think that they can win at least some of their objectives on the battlefield uh russia thinks it can take more ukraine territory and uh the ukrainians think that they can push russia back out of territory that russia currently occupies perhaps even out of the territory that they've been occupying since 2014. uh we need to provide ukraine with the the weapons it needs and the financial support it needs and unfortunately until the sides are ready to compromise and uh and reach a peace agreement um this war will continue and if it's going to continue let's hope that ukraine is able to advance rather than retreat the most important weapons that we've provided recently uh have been the long-range uh artillery that has uh has changed the battlefield significantly and giving the ukrainians what they believe is a good chance to take back territory in the south particularly the southeast that russia currently uh occupies um and i think that this war will go on for a while until putin realizes that it's it's time uh it's it's time for uh for a peace deal getting a peace deal is is so important because not only of what happens in eastern europe and in europe but also food and fertilizer comes from russia and ukraine to a significant degree and the there's a recent agreement we hope it holds but as long as the war goes on it could this other agreement could break at any time to allow ukraine to uh to ship its grain out that's critical for the ukrainian economy but it's also critical for food security in asia and especially africa and uh if if i if if that food is blocked and if fertilizer exports from russia are blocked more people will die from this war in africa and and asia they will die in eastern europe because when food prices go up the very poorest people eat less and while they may not die of starvation with your if if you're not getting enough food um you're vulnerable to disease so we need to keep this this food export deal we need to move forward toward a a peace deal but we can't abandon ukraine and watch uh watch putin take over the whole territory and uh i will say that uh uh at one of i think it was in our april uh town hall i had uh was the the first member of congress to have the uh ambassador of ukraine uh address people from the san fernando valley i think she did an excellent job and some of the people on this line now uh were there um with that let's uh hear from la city council member paul kords he was born in the san fernando valley represents the central southern san fernando valley uh has been a champion uh for environmental protection has uh fought for uh uh solutions to the homeless problem and uh is really a national leader by authoring laws to protect animals from cruel practices uh he's worked hard to pay valley streets trim valley trees uh and improve valley parks and uh i know that uh he'll be serving the city of los angeles for uh for a long time councilman paul courts well thank you can you hear me okay great i'm council member paul koretz and thank you congressman sherman for inviting me to your town hall i appreciate the opportunity to talk about a few items that are of interest to l.a city residents and some particularly of interest to valley residents and you may want to have a pen and paper handy to write down a bit of information later first of all we heard a lot of good information from dr lynn goldman about covid and my priorities as a council member have always focused on public safety and this unique time in the covet era has proven that public safety isn't just about protecting oneself but also about our society and that's why tomorrow in coordination with l.a county supervisor hilda solis i'm introducing a motion and resolution looking at the rise of monkey pox and starting the process to make sure that we get ahead with ample resources for supplies of monkey pox testing vaccines and insurance coverage reimbursement for those public protections also i want to talk about the drought and extreme heat obviously we've already been faced with several heat waves this summer that seemed every year to start earlier and earlier due to climate change that's also burdening our diminishing water supply as for reasons like these that i created the climate emergency mobilization office in the city of los angeles the director of that office has recently been named the chief heat officer as well as these are inextricably linked conditions and the drought has already exacerbated dry conditions and there's no relief in sight in fact high temperatures are expected across los angeles county bringing elevated fire conditions and excessive heat conditions and that's why the department of public health and la's heat officer are reminding everyone to take precautions to avoid heat related illness especially older adults young children outdoor workers athletes people with certain health conditions and our pets we want to be sure that the most vulnerable aren't harmed or dying from heat exposure especially in the valley which is much hotter than other parts of the city and you can find tips on staying cool by visiting emergency.lacity.org backslash heat now i'll give that once again emergency.lacity.org backslash heat if you need to cool off the city of la offers cooling centers where you can beat the heat and these cooling centers are in la city facilities where you can enjoy recreation programming or a good book while you cool off and you can call 311 from within l.a city or call 211 within l.a county to find out more about cooling center locations and hours of operation in addition back in 2015 at the previous height of the drought i asked the dwp to identify our top water users in the city and contact them and help them dramatically reduce their use and most of them weren't even aware of their high water use and just needed education and advice and so since we're once again facing a tremendous shortage i asked dwp to do the same thing again i don't want to see some neighborhoods doing a a lot on this issue and others very little and since june 1st dwp has been restricting outdoor watering with sprinklers to two days a week so to learn more about the new rules and restrictions and to find water saving incentives and rebates please visit ladwp.com backslash save and we've been calling it a drought but more accurate accurately due to our overheating planet we've entered a new era of permanent water scarcity i wish i could say it's going to get better but it's probably not we no longer reliably can store our water as snowpack in the high sierras and the high rocky mountains because it melts too quickly now so we have to work together to adapt to this new normal normal and one final thing you may have noticed there was a measure bb on the ballot in june seeking to amend the city charter to include the city of los angeles in the definition of local to allow us to add a bid preference for businesses located in the city of la and that's important because we have a preference for bidders who are local but because of our charter local is only defined as businesses in the state of california or the county of los angeles but businesses operating in the city were costs with costs that are a lot higher receive no advantage and so la city businesses actually received a fraction of one percent of contracting dollars which is absolutely ridiculous so this past and and yesterday i requested city staff and a motion to report back to council with a proposed implementation plan i expect a report back very soon and this should provide a lot of opportunities for contracting for la city businesses to access l.a city dollars which wasn't happening before so just a few things that are going on in the city i hope you found the information that i provided useful once again i want to thank congressman sherman for allowing me this opportunity to provide a few quick updates and again i'm council member paul koretz if you have questions on any of these items you can call my council office at 213-473-7005 and thanks again so much congressman councilman paul koritz thank you and uh people should know that uh i think we've been friends for about 49 years since our days uh at ucla i now have yes uh the next question uh for survey questions so be ready to hit the buttons on your phone do you support the inflation reduction act of 2020 with its substantial investment in renewable energy and dealing with the carbon crisis its reduction in deficits and allowing medicare to negotiate with the drug companies if you support the bill please press one if you do not support it press two and if you're unsure please press three with that let's take another question from the floor okay congressman we have stanley from northridge stanley you are on now thank you congressman uh two questions related to electric cars one i've done some reading that the spent big batteries from the electric cars are as toxic as nuclear waste and we haven't dealt with how to get rid of them and the second is that i also read that if every house in california had an electric car there would not be enough electricity to power the lights and the air conditioners and those kinds of things how can you respond to that well i don't think the batteries are near as dangerous as spent nuclear waste it is an issue that we have to deal with but with a a climate heating up it's i think something that we can deal with as to the electricity i um we're not going to go to all electric vehicles right away it's going to be phased in there may be some uh situations where we will have to provide uh more transmission lines and obviously we're moving toward cleaner sources of electricity most of the cars are charged at night in people's garages and um that's at a time when uh uh you know the the industrial parts of the city are not operating uh i believe we'll develop timers uh well i'm sure we already have timers that so that instead of recharging your car right at 7 pm or 6 pm when you get home the charging is done between midnight at 6 00 a.m when electrical usage is is much much lower so um i i think that these are are issues that we can accommodate but uh we if if we went immediately uh overnight to electric vehicles um uh i think we'd face a greater problem with that we're going to do another question survey question here it is following the striking down of roe v wade do you support federal statute stating that which is found in the women's health protection act which makes roe v wade part of federal statute even though it's no longer in effect on the books of the supreme court if you want to make roe v wade law press one if you think no press two and if you're unsure plus press three let's go on to another question from the floor okay congressman uh we have um uh shlomi from tarzana you're on now hi congressman i've been uh fortunate to vote for you for the last almost two decades i appreciate what you do for our community i'm a member of tarzana community and uh i have a few questions and kind of responses but i'll try to keep it short obviously uh mainly uh concern i think more importantly than kovid and anything else is our personal safety and while i know this isn't you know you're on a national level but you i'm sure have a lot of influence on a local level as i've seen on your website you've you know posed with karen bass which unfortunately supports the current d.a george gascon who's i believe single-handedly destroyed los angeles and we have a serious crime issue here we have a serious homelessness issue here and none of these topics are ever properly addressed you know we keep getting taxed to contribute more and more money towards these crises but there always seem to be groups taking a piece of the pie but not actually doing anything productive with it so i guess first question is do you support karen bess who seems to support george gascon because unfortunately that's the only thing i disagree with you with hopefully you do support caruso who seems to be a better candidate for this problem in la number two with the situation in ukraine i uh very proud that the fact that you guys are helping them out if we don't i don't know who will that if ukraine would potentially choose to exist so commend you guys for doing your efforts there i also commend you for all the support for israel of course and i think in terms of energy uh while it would be ideal for everyone to go electric as the previous caller just said it's probably not possible right now as you also clarified but more importantly we've seen gas prices through the roof and unfortunately it's due to a president that doesn't seem to be on the oil industry side you're you're raising a lot of issues so let me let me respond to the ones so far we're going to try to squeeze in two more questions karen bass and i have worked together here for decades as it happens i do support her i don't agree with what garcon is doing on a number of of cases but that's not as a congress member that's just as a resident of of of los angeles uh as to um the high gas prices that is not a matter of how much oil is produced in any one country canada produces twice as much oil as they burn and their prices for gasoline are considerably higher than those in the united states it is a worldwide price that is constrained by opic and then the big thing has been uh russia and and ukraine and uh it it certainly hurts us that we have been somewhat successful in preventing russian oil from reaching the market um given the blood and treasure that we spent last time there was a major war in europe um this is a lot easier than what uh we faced in the 1940s uh but uh it you can't have sanctions on russia for free um as to um uh the president preventing oil production in the united states in in biden's first year we produced more oil in the united states than we had in trump's last year and next year we're going to produce more oil in the united states than we have at any time in our history now it's true if you look at the rhetoric you'll see that you know biden sees a future for us without fossil fuels but that's that's in the long term uh future it's something we move toward and in the meantime uh it is i think better to see oil produced in the united states if we're going to burn it here than to see it produced in saudi arabia it's better for the environment because when the saudis produce oil they are much more likely to vent methane and methane is as we learned as a result of the porter ranch gas blowout uh is 60 to 70 times more potent in raising temperatures than is carbon dioxide so the key is not preventing oil production in the united states it's reducing the amount we burn and finally i'll give the environmentalists a lot of credit for helping us economically um the yeah uh you know my first car got nine miles to the gallon and if it hadn't been for environmentalists and frankly democrats uh i everybody would still be driving a car that gets nine miles to the gallon so that would mean you'd be buying three times as much gasoline and since your neighbors would also and everybody be burning three times as much gasoline there'd be much much more demand and so you might be paying double or double or triple the price per gallon and using double or triple the number of gallons so um the fact that the environmental movement has pushed us toward a much higher mpg uh is very important but um yes there's a a a belief in the democratic party that we have to move past fossil fuels but the fact is we produ will produce more oil in the united states next year than we have at any time in history we have some results to our questions uh do you support uh oh first we'll do the uh the inflation reduction act 76 percent yes nine percent no 15 percent unsure and do you support codifying uh abortion rights uh as defined in roe v wade as part of our con our federal statutes 83 yes 10 no 7 unsure we have time for one more question don okay congressman we have uh again i apologize not sure if this is a first or a last name but spalding from winnetka you're on hello congressman hello um i i have a question for you about uh renewable energy we we seem to be making a big push for it in this country which is a good thing it definitely helps our environment however people that are blessed enough to make enough money to be able to afford solar panels on their houses are given tax incentives to do so those of us that are on fixed incomes i'm i'm disabled can't afford to put solar panels but there there's no help for us to be able to do it and instead we just pay the the higher utility bills and i'm wondering if in this new bill that's being backed if passed if there's anything to help those of us on fixed income to be able to do that i would have to to check i'd point out that at this point you get a solar panel and some tax relief to incentivize it i don't know how much lower per kilowatt your bill is um i mean this is still a uh an industry that's uh that's in development so at least without uh the the the subsidies and incentives uh most for most people in most parts of the country um it's it's hard to say you know it's hard to say those solar panels will pay for themselves if they're not if you don't get an incentive that's why you might need instead so i'm not sure that if you drive by a house and you see a solar panel that you know that person's paying you know only a third per kilowatt or two thirds per kilowatt what you're paying and we're all benefiting from the fact that that person is using less electricity off the grid uh but i i do want to see um whether uh you know i i mean what what is in this bill uh to uh to allow those those who are on fixed incomes to move toward the toward clean energy in their homes um with uh uh and of course uh we all benefit uh if we uh produce less carbon um i think that was a good question um that the uh we're going to have to uh to wrap this up if i go more than another couple minutes the vendor's going to charge us an extra fortune so i'll quickly say um look forward to hearing from you in another town hall meeting we expect that to be in early september to find out about it go to bradsherman.house.gov submit a question in advance at the end of this town hall you're going to be connected to our voicemail system i'm going to ask you to do two things first give us your email address even if we already have it if you want to be kept informed and get congressional updates including the exact time of the next town hall there are rules here in the house if you don't give me your email address the fact that i have it doesn't mean i'm allowed to use it at certain times but if you give it to me then i can and second if you didn't get a chance to express yourself today leave a message i'll listen tomorrow and we'll listen to your comments then if i haven't heard them during this last hour uh so i want to thank especially dr lynn goldman i want to thank councilman paul caretz and i want to thank senator bob hertzberg i want to thank everyone for being involved and look forward to talking to you at the warner center park at the sunday evening concerts and on our next town hall thank you very much hello this is congressman brad sherman live from washington dc and we're about to

with us on so many of these calls uh then we'll move on to a couple of questions and then i'll introduce senator bob hertzberg who will tell us about what's going on in sacramento and then councilman paul koretz who will be telling us about what's going on at the city level uh now you may want to uh to be involved in our next town hall go to bradsherman.house.gov you can submit a question and that's where you'll find out when our next town hall is it'll be in early september but we haven't set the exact date now uh you'll want to dial star 3 to get in the queue if you dial star 3 you'll be connected to our staff if it's just a personal matter something that we can help you with then you can talk to the staff privately but almost everyone who dials star 3 will want to be in the queue to answer a to ask a question and be heard by thousands of valley residents we're going to go on until about 8 10 p.m and a number of people have submitted their questions in advance by going to bradsherman.house.gov and we'll be reading and taking some of those advanced questions as well now i want to put in a pitch for my constituent service team several of them are on the line we've got john alford and kimberly caceres and i want to describe their work imagine a federal government agency makes a mistake it could happen it could affect you could be uh someone who's not being given a visa by one of our embassies who needs to travel here for personal or business reasons it could be social security it could be the irs you call our team at 818-501-9200 [Music] you talk to john or

john and kimberly are working hard enough now although i say i'm brad sherman from sherman oaks my district encompasses uh the west and south san fernando valley if you live in the 30th congressional district feel free to dial star three so that you can get in the queue to answer good question uh if you don't live in our district feel free to just uh sit back and listen uh now i'm in washington dc now i get back to the san fernando valley on saturday and on sunday i'll be at the concert in the park there in warner center where we'll hear a tribute to bruno mars put on by the valley cultural foundation in fact we'll have a constituent service booth there so come on by talk to me personally and talk to john talk to kimberly talk to our other constituent service team if you have a any an issue with any federal agency uh in fact uh our booths will be there every one of the next five sundays and i will be there every one of the next five sundays so i look forward to seeing you in person um once again you can dial star three to get in the queue um i wanna well i originally thought when we scheduled this town hall that there wouldn't be much happening in congress and uh so we invited um an outstanding leader from both the uh the city and the state level and they will have their reports as well but uh but just in the last couple of days there have been significant developments here today we passed the chips bill which is designed to make sure that we bring back to the united states of the production of computer chips there are semiconductors if you will right now only 12 percent of what we use is made here in the united states this makes us particularly vulnerable and frankly a a huge portion of the chips we use come from taiwan and there is the possibility that the people's republic of china interferes with taiwan in one way or another that's a foreign policy problem we have to make sure that it's not also a domestic economic problem and this will make a huge investment in our chip and computer manufacturing capacities what you may not realize is these chips are in everything and we have thousands of automobiles just sitting there at gm and ford that can't be completed because they have to put in one of what hundreds and sometimes a thousand ships in in each car and whether it's you know your any of the appliances in your home any of the devices and of course all the things that you expect computer chips to be in those chips are critically important even more recently just last night we saw an agreement on the inflation reduction act now um the people are saying well this isn't quite as big as democrats were trying to pass it is a a transformative piece of legislation um and it will do a number of things first and foremost it will reduce our carbon emissions by roughly 40 percent between now and the end of the decade uh that by itself will make not only the biggest effort toward reducing carbon uh from the united states made anything in our history but it's also the biggest single thing that's been done by any country in the world now that's a little unfair to countries like denmark because obviously we're much bigger and per capita denmark has done more but in terms of a single action designed to reduce carbon nothing is bigger than this it will also extend the subsidies for those buying obamacare affordable care act insurance over the next three years it will allow medicare to negotiate for prescription drug prices we pay double or triple with the rest of the world even the developed world pays for the same drugs this will drive that cost down by about half for medicare and in doing so it's what isn't mentioned in the summaries of the bill is that it will also drive down the cost for other consumers as well because i think it'll establish the the new fixed price for each drug that's negotiated the bill will reduce our deficit over the next next uh 10 years by 300 billion dollars it'll do that by imposing a 15 percent corporate minimum tax by the prescription drug pricing on negotiation uh through additional irs enforcement particularly on wealthy individuals and corporations the audit rate in that group has declined precipitously and there are well over 600 billion perhaps a trillion dollars a year that is not being collected and it deals with the carried interest loophole which i'll describe if somebody asks a question it has an enormous uh 369 billion dollar investment in our clean energy future um and uh and to mention a detail or two um the 15 corporate minimum tax is on taxable income uh so the bill doesn't go as far as we have agreed with 20 other countries 19 other countries to go to impose a 15 percent tax minimum tax on the book income the income that they don't put on their tax return but that they put in their shareholder reports i talked to chuck schumer about this today and there is a good chance that we'll be able to comply with our agreement and raise an awful lot more revenue from large multinational corporations in the next tax bill if we can set a 15 percent minimum so those are the two big bills the one passed today uh one where we have an agreement and i'll i'll add a footnote uh senator kristen cinema of arizona has not officially said that she'll vote for the inflation reduction act i think she will and i and uh i think it'll be the most important bill that we've passed uh certainly in the last five years so with that i want to introduce the first of our guest speakers and that is uh dr lynn goldman um she has um joined us she she this is the 18th time she has contributed her time to these town halls and she's backed by popular demand she is a member of the national academy of medicine and i could go on and on about all the things she's done she's an epidemiologist and a pediatrician and i know a lot of us are concerned about the children in covet 19. and it's particularly good to have her on because just today it was announced that los angeles county will not be reimposing the indoor mask mandate so we have big news regarding kovid just in our own area dr goldman where do we stand on this video hi it's so great to be with you again for a town hall meeting we are at a point now in the pandemic where it's seeming to have hit kind of what i would call a steady state and and the good news being that things are not increasing to the point where for example in la there's a need to reimpose the mask mandate and the bad news being that we still have pretty steadily every day a few hundred people in the united states who are dying from coven 19 somewhere in the range of about 400 to 450 right now which is up a little bit from where it was a couple of weeks ago as well as a lot of people across the country who are in the hospital or in the icu i should say that most of those people are people who don't have good immunity to covet and most of that is due to the fact that so many in our country have not been fully immunized and and haven't gone on to get the booster shots as well and i do think that the most important thing that i could say to everybody who's on the line today is that it is very important to sustain our immunity to copin 19. we are seeing that even though the vaccines that we're using right now are for the original variant that was first circulating back in 2020 and there certainly have been a lot of changes in the virus that's been circulating over that time that so far the vaccines are holding a wall that is preventing most of us from if we do get the the disease from having to go to a hospital from having to be in the icu and from dying and that is a really almost miraculous thing and the new vaccines that are being developed right now the boosters that we're hoping will be delivered in full will come a little bit closer to the current variants that are circulating and i think do an even better job of protecting us from the most severe outcomes so um everybody if there's if there's anybody on the line who still is doubtful about the value of getting vaccinated we not only see this this amazing ability of these vaccines to save our lives but also it's there's still a very high level of safety that we're experiencing and that i think is very important as well that people can feel confident that they will be safe that their family members and especially their children will be safe if they receive the vaccines so you know in terms of other updates i i the the only other thing i would say is that and we saw it with the president president biden and that is that even among those who are far more susceptible such as people in their 70s such as our president that this medication paxlova that's available we saw that he did not have to be hospitalized he did not have any severe outcomes and receiving the pax logan i think probably made a big difference in his case and others who are more fragile because of being older because of having underlying health problems or maybe even having weakened immune systems for one reason or another and and i think that's another piece of good news and at the same time that pexlovic probably isn't enough if people haven't been vaccinated at all so i thank you um for for having me tonight and that doctor i i do you have one question um that 400 to 450 people a day who are dying that's like five times the number of people we lose to automobile accidents i know most of us wear the seat belt most of the time um is it true that just a very tiny portion of that 450 people who are dying each day are people who are fully vaccinated and boosted that's true it's it's relative it's mostly people who either have not been vaccinated at all or who received the primary vaccines but didn't get boosted and and then there are a few unfortunately who are in that group because they do have um weaker immune systems or other underlying problems but that is very true that the vast majority you know it's only about one in five um people in in most of the the country who have not been vaccinated people 65 and up um 92 percent of people over the age of 65 in the country got the primary vaccines but unfortunately only about two-thirds have had a booster and we just need to stay the course with not only getting the boosters but as you know it's been estimated that the boosters are good for probably something like six to nine months and so when the next boosters are available to just go and get the booster is the most prudent thing thank you i want to point out that in addition to those who ask questions from the floor everyone will be given an opportunity to express their opinion because we're going to have survey questions you can answer by just pressing buttons on your phone and we'll announce those answers as we go forward but before we do anything else let's take a couple questions from the floor don i'm not sure that people can hear you can you hear me now now we hear you okay good megan from rosita you are on hi um my question is about the uh i'm worried about sending my kid to school um we're right now our leading indicator is showing that we have higher covid in our in our waste water than we did back in february 15 times higher and i'm seeing a lot of kids and a lot of friends are getting sick from covered still what can we do what can we do to make me feel safer about my kid going back to school doctor well first and foremost your kids now can be immunized and i think that's a good idea just in terms of protecting them from coded but second i you do need to be concerned if there are adults with whom they interact who are vulnerable because they either refuse to get immunized or because they have some kind of a problem with the immune suppression and and by that i mean for example somebody who has received an organ transplant who's on immunosuppressive therapy or has a disease that you know it's where a doctor has said that that there is an immune deficiency and and in that case you would want your children to be masked and you'd want those adults to be a mask when they're together but doctor in the in the regular circumstance where there's no one in the home that's immune uncompromised i mean very few people have gotten organ transplants etc if you'd advise the kids to get properly immunized but not necessarily wear masks at school well the kids can wear mask at school if they if they prefer i i think i think that we all have the right to do that and remember there are kids also who have underlying health problems so they need to mask and uh other kids may want to wear masks in solidarity with those kids so that they don't feel singled out there's nothing wrong with wearing a mask but i but kids do not have to mask in school right now and i and i think that's important i think that there is important learning that uh that that that kids need to experience in terms of really being able to learn learning how to interpret facial expressions you know learning emotional confidence that it is important for kids to be able to be in situations where everybody isn't masking but they are certainly entitled just like anybody to wear a mask if they wish and if a family feels that everyone in their family should be masculine i think that's okay too um but um again um i i we're not saying that they have to do that i've been told by several people that i look much better wearing a mask but that's a separate point let's go on to one more question from the floor okay congressman i'm sorry i don't know if i'm giving a last or a first name here uh bradley from northridge uh about infrastructure bradley you are on now yes hello hello hi can you hi can you hear me i can hear you yes hi there congressman sherman i've always vote for you ah we have a brilliant caller please continue yes yes so i'm really curious for what happens with the infrastructure bill one's going to be funded what was that again when will the infrastructure build those paths will it be funded well the bipartisan infrastructure bill is a 10-year program and so parts of it have been funded already but the it's a big bill that will be funded over a long period of time and [Music] so what whatever improvements in transportation and whatever jobs it provides is spread out over a decade so it oh i see it's not like we pass a bill and uh and and all of a sudden there are three extra lanes on the 405. oh no uh but i uh uh i i i many of you know i've you know been working for for a long time to try to see us uh have rail through the sepulveda pass but uh there's nothing specific in the bipartisan infrastructure bill that says the money has to be spent between now and the olympics to build the rail through the sepulveda pass but that would be a good thing um at this point let's do a let's do a survey question uh do you approve of president biden's performance as president so far press one if you approve press two if you disapprove and press three if you're unsure or kind of rate them as in the middle and uh with that why don't we take one more question from the floor all right one more uh transit question specifically on the sepulveda pass there's been a few of those in the queue this one is greg from sherman oaks greg you are on thank you hi bret hi brad um thank you thank you for doing this it's fabulous um i think my wife and i have been thinking about this for a long time and uh you know i'm part of soha and um i go to the neighborhood council meetings particularly the vision the sherman oaks homeowners association for those correct not blessed beloved america's best name city go on yeah indeed and we live here and love it um but um i i'm a big fan i don't know what your take is on this but i i really do think that we should because we already have the right of way as far as i understand it in the county use the uh 405 and put a monorail down the center of it rather than put something underground our city is so beautiful you know and i've taken the subway from north hollywood to downtown and i have to tell you i don't love it it's basically a new york subway with steel wheels loud raucous um and i just don't understand why we can't use the existing right-of-way down the center of the freeways for this kind of thing and not yeah i'll review the the there are four proposals really they come down in a way to two proposals one is as you describe a monorail um uh above the 405 freeway that could be built a little sooner in part because it would cost less money uh there are some ridership groups that think oh you'll be breathing all the air from the cars uh the fact is a lot of us drive the 405 freeway and uh we're much more upset about the the traffic and the bumper-to-bumper than the fact that we're on the freeways matter of fact the freeway is moving fast we i think i'd be fine um and as you point out i think you know it's uh it would be a great experience to to be whizzing by on the 405 and see the getty and see as you point out a beautiful city the chief disadvantage of the monorail and using the 405 is that it doesn't create a stop right at the middle of ucla now the fact is we don't have many ucla students who live in the valley a lot more who go to northridge and those students don't necessarily have to arrive at campus at nine o'clock right when they'd face the the worst rush hour but there is a fair number of ucla staff and medical staff that live in the valley so ucla strongly believes that it ought to be a subway uh the subway uh has some disadvantages that point out it's going to take longer to build it's going to cost more money it's going to take longer to to assemble all that money to go forward and there are people in bel air who will sue to stop it they are somehow convinced that it will hurt uh bel air i haven't seen any reason to uh you know i i haven't seen the analysis of that and a lot depends on how deep uh it it it's uh the boar is on the other hand if you have to go deeper to avoid hurting the people above uh then that adds a bit to the cost and most subways like the the west l.a line goes under not people's houses but goes under uh say wilshire boulevard but we do have in our city some subways that go under people's houses so um the i i want to see something built it's a benefit not only to the people who write it but it's a benefit for those who stay in their cars and don't have another car in front of them because the person who's going to be in that red toyota in fact is chosen to be on the train so or the or the monorail so um there the mta is having a number of discussion groups on this and uh i think the the monorail has general support except from those who are focused on on ucla which might be the most used stop uh now there would with a monorail you would of course have a stop in westwood or near westwood probably be you know right there at the the federal building there would be a shuttle bus to ucla uh and that may be uh that may be good enough uh uh to to attract a lot of ucla staff to to use the to use the train but uh or the monorail so with that let's uh announce the first question we've got uh do you approve of biden's uh performance 61 of you say approved 22 percent disapprove and 17 percent are unsure at our last town hall um we had 71 percent approved 20 disapproved and 8 percent unsure so we've seen a number of valley residents move from the approved to the unsure category and with that i want to introduce our next guest speaker and that is senator robert hertzberg who has served as a speaker of the assembly went on to serve as uh believe it was majority leader in the state senate um he was unanimously elected i might add is as a speaker by both republicans and democrats the los angeles daily news has described him as uh his relentless dedication and indefatigable energy and his reputation for integrity and perseverance um oh but i'm told that bob is not with us yet and so uh when when he does come on i won't repeat that introduction uh but uh we will take another question from the floor okay congressman uh another question for for for the doctor uh mary from reseda uh regarding when to get the second booster um mary you should be lived now i think you could now you know now you should be live sorry about that am i on you there mary yes hi hello hello senator hertzberg calling okay hello hello hello mary is if senator hertzberg is on i gave you a great introduction uh but uh uh uh they told me you weren't on yet so we've moved on to a question and uh we'll have you uh speak in just a second if you're on mr okay thank you so let's let's uh let's hear the question for the doctor oh sure uh should i get a second covert booster in august or wait till fall to get the new variant vaccine hi yes i think if it's been at least six months since your first booster uh and you haven't had that second one i would go ahead and get the second one because i think that we're looking at um it's it's still um it's till july almost august and we won't see the new boosters probably until something like october or november so that shouldn't be too close in time for you to go ahead and get that when that's available as well so as i understand you doctor it's go ahead and get the booster now and when that refined uh new shot becomes available in the in the late fall as long as it's been a couple of months since you got your last booster you can get that as well absolutely and those of you who have already had two boosters you don't need to get a third one until that new one comes out but if you've only had one i'd go ahead and get the second one for sure with that i believe we have uh senator robert hertzberg with us um and uh at the state level many things are happening none are more interesting than the new uh uh inflation relief checks that are being sent out by the state and hopefully uh bob will tell us about those that they can go as high as one thousand fifty dollars for a family so uh bob why don't you tell us a little bit about uh those checks and anything else is happening in sacramento well good thank you so very much i apologize a little bit late i'm at a celebration for the new chair of the board of the greek board of regents university california rich lee who's a friend of ours so i apologize oh yes my friend as well yeah for 40 years so here's here's the thing for those you know so i served in government some years ago a speaker and then i left for 12 years came back and majority leader of the senate represent along with the congressman the san fernando valley and i just want to start because i think this is really important to say this you know we have money in california to be able to do these things but we don't have it on our own it's in partnership with the federal government so much money that puts us in this situation is because brad congressman sherman voted for a lot of this money and so my view is that when we look at these programs we implemented some things but the money you know it's not appropriate in my judgment to look and say federal government state government city government county government we're all in this together it's all your money and the federal government was a huge part of this so i want to give a lot of accolades to the congressman for this program now what is the program and what does it look like and who does it affect and what we know so far because not everything has been determined first 9.5 billion dollars is being returned back to taxpayers a lot of money that captures approximately 17 million tax filers and some non-tax filers and as the congressman said families can recover receive as much as a thousand fifty dollars per household which will go out in the next coming months there's two types of things i want to talk about that i can certainly uh answer questions on i guess i can't answer questions but i think that will be helpful the first is what's called the middle class tax refund eligibility okay that middle-class tax fund eligibility rebate you must meet the following requirements one you have to file a 2020 tax return so it's not people who are not filing tax returns second you have to meet certain income requirements depending upon on you know how much money you're going to get you must be a caliber california resident resident and you must not be claimed as a dependent on the tax filing now per the franchise tax board that the congress needs to serve on together with the department of finance if an individual did not file a 2020 tax return they're not eligible for a tax refund that's program one program two is the state's it is the state supplemental homelessness if i have the numbers on this yeah the state supplemental payment increase in this instance you don't have to worry if you didn't file a tax return the state did this basically increase the state the state supplemental payments the program is which is augmented by the federal supplemental security program individuals are 65 or older or blind or disabled are eligible how much money are they going to get of each of anybody who's on this line will get how much will this this mean we don't have a final number because the franchise tax board and the department of finance is finalizing the numbers but i had my chief of staff call over and basically what they told me pursuant to the legislative analyst's office which is what who works for the legislature current maximum payments were 199.129 21 cents the projected max maximum um is 246.92 for a couple the maximum was 504 and it's projected maximums to go up to 625. so if you're a couple you get 120 more if you're an individual you'll you'll be getting about uh fifth round numbers fifty dollars more as a result of these additional dollars to help a little bit with respect to inflation first program you gotta be a tax filer second program you don't that's kind of where we are there's a number of other things that we've done at the state with some of the money the federal governments have given us for example an eviction defense the entire program that was that we paid for which is 5.4 billion dollars to help people to cover their rents all of which came from the federal government we didn't put in an extra dime we might have put a little bit more just recently but i can't remember it wasn't much but 5.4 billion dollars in the federal government that's where you got those checks from we administered it on behalf of the of the federal government and and there's a number of other things in the budget because if i just i'll end here but just to give some people context you know we got oh a couple hundred billion dollars in various forms from the federal government it was just extraordinary to help us during the down times during the during the during the pandemic and um you know so some of those things for the people on the phone that are business people that we're worried about is as you had employees who were had unemployment insurance we're paying for the space now with federal money is basically paying uh for for the first few years before having to be added to your payroll tax we also gave you a 50 000 for businesses a fifty thousand dollar grant against sales tax that you collect that you didn't have to repay so there's been a number of efforts both with respect to folks that are impacted and with respect to small businesses which um so much uh uh you know inform our our valley uh community so that that's kind of in addition you know i've been fortunate enough because of my leadership roles and experience to bring a lot of money to the san fernando valley we got two million dollars for the skirt ball museum 5.7 million dollars for jewish family services to do homeless issues uh uh five million dollars for the discovery queue about enhancement damn seven million dollars for water projects in the city of san fernando uh a million dollars for trust for public land for environmental issues uh uh and just you know another 30 million 40 million dollars of other kinds of programs that we were able to help in terms of the valley which has just been really really quite extraordinary and we're not done yet there may be an additional supplemental budget where we're able to bring the fair share which is such a critical issue to us in in this in the san fernando valley so hopefully that helps congressman and i do want to give thank you for this you know and i really really appreciate hope i didn't go on too long that fine and uh uh senator hertzberg has been serving us for a long time he's got an outstanding office that helps people on snarl problems with the state agencies and we did a mass email we'll have it up on our web page as well that describes these uh inflation relief checks if you believe that you're entitled to it and didn't receive it that's why that's why bob hertzberg has a constituent service office in the valley to help unstar all those problems just call me give my number what's your number bob the the um give him my number for my office uh you know i know my personal number but i know my office number excuse me for a second i apologize all right let me pull up my glasses here and look at my car embarrassed by that that question what's your number uh um the the office you know it says the sacramento office but that's better because there's staff that are better at getting that information is 916 651 4 and um for those that care i'll give you my personal self because like like the congressman i to him is accessible he's unbelievable in terms of what he does my cell phone is eight one eight three seven one six seven six four and uh we'll help you in any way we can anybody needs help thank you uh we now have a couple of written questions that came in from those who rsvp'd early by going to bradsherman.house.gov the first is from robert lenz who asks about voting on selling food to cuba i have voted uh consistently that we should sell food to cuba but i voted against the idea of loaning money to cuba on concessionary terms in large part because there's a very good risk that cuba will not ultimately pay us back and also because there are a lot of people in the san fernando valley who would love to get a low interest loan to buy food at ralph's so our our policy toward cuba has been we're a you know happy to sell food and medicine uh but we don't have a government program to lend the money at a low rate uh the next question is from allison carter of west hills who wants to know how i voted on the respect for marriage act i was one of the co-sponsors of that act the entire democratic caucus voted for it we got 47 republicans about a quarter of the republicans to vote for it just on july 19th what it does is it repeals the defense of ameri of of marriage act and requires the u.s government to recognize the validity of same-sex marriages in the united states now you'd think why do you need to do that it's been well established by our supreme court that same-sex marriages are legal nationwide and the reason is that supreme court justice clarence thomas in his uh overruling of roe v wade also had uh in his concurring opinion a sentence saying uh that the court should revisit over uh overfeld versus hodge which is the supreme court decision that legalized uh marriage for the lgbt community nationwide and so in advance of any possible supreme court decision we in congress need to to have it be the law of the land uh that we have marriage equality with that let's take one question from the floor and then we'll hear from uh paul korwitz uh uh uh about the the city okay congressman harry uh uh has a question about ukraine uh harry you are on now thank you hi hello congressman sherman can you hear me yes okay good thank you hi this is harry gilson um had some great speakers on tonight um my question this has to do with um ukraine i think it's great how we've been supporting him but the ukraine the news on ukraine which was all over the cable network in the spring in particular um you know it's sort of evaporating now and what what can we be doing through this country um a great united states to support uh the people um of the ukraine further to try i don't know i mean we don't want to get into a nuclear war obviously with russia but um and i know you're not on any of the military committees i believe congressman but i'm what i've i'm the second most senior democrat on the foreign affairs committee so i'm very involved in the admission all right good i'm glad to hear that i apologize i was thinking strictly of the military though so on foreign affairs let's talk about that then so what is going on what have we done to try to bring in other nations i mean i know the world is united here in a lot of ways i'm surprised israel but i don't understand why israel has had to kind of back off a little bit but um president zielinski has done an amazing job and i'm so glad president biden is in office because i don't think we would have had this response from the united states that we've had had president trump still been in office um i think we can all agree on that so what what let me just go to the issue first of all okay uh ukraine is not just about ukraine if russia could have [Music] could have just marched into eve and taken over ukraine um and that's although the ukrainians have uh have fought gallantly if there had been no support from the west that might have happened then not only would ukraine fall but if the west isn't going to do anything to help ukraine what about poland what about lithuania uh these countries are in nato so you have to believe in international law we don't believe that one country can just go conquer another country just because it's bigger or more powerful our response was i think the right one and that is to support ukraine but not send american forces and not take the kinds of actions that could have americans shooting at russian soldiers because the number one goal here is to avoid thermonuclear war and ultimately wars are fought because both sides think that they can win at least some of their objectives on the battlefield uh russia thinks it can take more ukraine territory and the ukrainians think that they can push russia back out of territory that russia currently occupies perhaps even out of the territory that they've been occupying since 2014. uh we need to provide ukraine with um the the weapons it needs and the financial support it needs and unfortunately until the sides um are ready to compromise and and reach a peace agreement um this war will continue and if it's going to continue let's hope that ukraine uh is able to advance rather than retreat the most important weapons that we've provided recently have been the long-range uh artillery that has uh has changed the battlefield significantly and giving the ukrainians what they believe is a good chance to take back territory in the south particularly the southeast that russia currently uh uh occupies um and i think that this war will go on for a while until putin realizes that it's it's time it's it's time for uh for a peace deal uh getting a peace deal is is is so important because uh not only of what happens in eastern europe and in europe but also food and fertilizer comes from russia and ukraine to a significant degree and the there's a recent agreement we hope it holds but as long as the war goes on it could this other agreement could break at any time to allow ukraine to uh to ship its grain out that's critical for the ukrainian economy but it's also critical for food security in asia and especially africa and uh if if if if that food is blocked and if fertilizer exports from russia are blocked more people will die from this war in africa and and asia they will die in eastern europe because when food prices go up the very poorest people eat less and while they may not die of starvation with your if if you're not getting enough food um you're vulnerable to disease so we need to keep this this food export deal we need to move forward toward a a peace deal but we can't abandon ukraine and watch watch putin take over the whole territory and i will say that at one of i think it was in our april uh town hall i had was the the first member of congress to have the ambassador of ukraine address people from the san fernando valley i think she did an excellent job and some of the people on this line now uh were there um with that let's hear from l.a city council member paul kords he was born in the san fernando valley represents the central southern san fernando valley uh has been a champion for environmental protection has fought for uh solutions to the homeless problem and is really a national leader by authoring laws to protect animals from cruel practices uh he's worked hard to pay valley streets trim valley trees and improve valley parks and i know that you'll be serving the city of los angeles for uh for a long time councilman paul courts well thank you can you hear me okay great i'm council member paul caretz and thank you congressman sherman for inviting me to your town hall i appreciate the opportunity to talk about a few items that are of interest to l.a city residents and some particular of interest to valley residents and you may want to have a pen and paper handy to write down a bit of information later first of all we heard a lot of good information from dr lynn goldman about coven and my priorities as a council member have always focused on public safety and this unique time in the covet era has proven that public safety isn't just about protecting oneself but also about our society and that's why tomorrow in coordination with l.a county supervisor hilda solis i'm introducing a motion and resolution looking at the rise of monkey pox and starting the process to make sure that we get ahead with ample resources for supplies of monkey pox testing vaccines and insurance coverage reimbursement for those public protections also i want to talk about the drought and extreme heat obviously we've already been faced with several heat waves this summer it seemed every year to start earlier and earlier due to climate change that's also burdening our diminishing water supply as for reasons like these that i created the climate emergency mobilization office in the city of los angeles the director of that office has recently been named the chief heat officer as well as these are inextricably linked conditions and the drought has already exacerbated dry conditions and there's no relief in sight in fact high temperatures are expected across los angeles county bringing elevated fire conditions and excessive heat conditions and that's why the department of public health and la's heat officer are reminding everyone to take precautions to avoid heat related illness especially older adults young children outdoor workers athletes people with certain health conditions and our pets we want to be sure that the most vulnerable aren't harmed or dying from heat exposure especially in the valley which is much hotter than other parts of the city and you can find tips on staying cool by visiting emergency.lacity.org backslash heat i'll give that once again emergency.lacity.org backslash heat if you need to cool off the city of la offers cooling centers where you can beat the heat and these cooling centers are in la city facilities where you can enjoy recreation programming or a good book while you cool off and you can call 311 from within l.a city or call 211 within l.a county to find out more about cooling center locations and hours of operation in addition back in 2015 at the previous height of the drought i asked the dwp to identify our top water users in the city and contact them and help them dramatically reduce their use and most of them weren't even aware of their high water use and just needed education and advice and so since we're once again facing a tremendous shortage i asked dwp to do the same thing again i don't want to see some neighborhoods doing a a lot on this issue and others very little and since june 1st dwp has been restricting outdoor watering with sprinklers to two days a week so to learn more about the new rules and restrictions and to find water saving incentives and rebates please visit ladwp backslash save and we've been calling it a drought but more accurate accurately due to our overheating planet we've entered a new era of permanent water scarcity i wish i could say it's going to get better but it's probably not we no longer reliably can store our water as snowpack in the high sierras and the high rocky mountains because it melts too quickly now so we have to work together to adapt to this new normal normal and one final thing you may have noticed there was a measure bb on the ballot in tune seeking to amend the city charter to include the city of los angeles in the definition of local to allow us to add a bid preference for businesses located in the city of la and that's important because we have a preference for bidders who are local but because of our charter local is only defined as businesses in the state of california or the county of los angeles but businesses operating in the city where costs a little cost that are a lot higher receive no advantage and so la city businesses actually received a fraction of one percent of contracting dollars which is absolutely ridiculous so this passed and and yesterday i requested city staff and a motion to report back to council with a proposed implementation plan i expect a report back very soon and this should provide a lot of opportunities for contracting for la city businesses to access l.a city dollars which wasn't happening before so just a few things that are going on in the city i hope you found the information that i provided useful once again i want to thank congressman sherman for allowing me this opportunity to provide a few quick updates and again i'm councilmember paul koretz if you have questions on any of these items you can call my council office at 213-473-7005 and thanks again so much congressman sherman councilman paul koritz thank you and uh people should know that uh i think we've been friends for about 49 years since our days uh at ucla i now have yes the next uh question uh for survey questions so be ready to hit the buttons on your phone do you support the inflation reduction act of 2020 uh with its substantial investment in renewable energy and dealing with the carbon crisis its reduction in deficits and allowing medicare to negotiate with the drug companies if you support the bill please press one if you do not support it press two and if you're unsure please press three um with that let's take another question from the floor okay congressman we have uh stanley from northridge stanley you are on now thank you congressman uh two questions related to electric cars one i've done some reading that the spent big batteries from the electric cars are as toxic as nuclear waste and we haven't dealt with how to get rid of them and the second is that i also read that if every house in california had an electric car there would not be enough electricity to power the lights and the air conditioners and those kinds of things how can you respond to that well i don't think the batteries are near as dangerous as spent nuclear waste uh it is an issue that we have to deal with uh but with a climate heating up uh it's i think something that we can deal with uh as to the electricity i um we're not gonna go to all electric vehicles right away it's going to be phased in there may be some situations where we will have to provide more transmission lines um and uh obviously we're moving toward cleaner sources of electricity um most of the cars are charged at night in people's garages and um that's at a time when uh uh you know the the industrial parts of the city are not operating uh i believe we'll develop timers uh well i'm sure we already have timers that so that instead of recharging your car right at 7 00 pm or 6 pm when you get home the charging is done between midnight at 6 00 a.m when electrical usage is is much much lower so um i i think that these are our issues that we can accommodate but uh we if if we went immediately uh overnight to electric vehicles um uh i i think we'd face a greater problem uh with that we're going to do another um question survey question um here it is following the striking down of roe v wade do you support a federal statute stating that which is found in the women's health protection act which makes roe v wade part of federal statute even though it's no longer in effect on the books of the supreme court if you want to make roe v wade law press one if you think no press two and if you're unsure plus press three let's go on to another question from the floor okay congressman uh we have um uh shlomi from tarzana you're on now hi congressman i've been uh fortunate to vote for you for the last almost two decades i appreciate what you do for our community i'm a member of tarzana community and uh i have a few questions and kind of responses but i'll try to keep it short obviously mainly a concern i think more importantly than kovid and anything else is our personal safety and while i know this isn't you know you're on a national level but you i'm sure have a lot of influence on a local level as i've seen on your website you've you know posed with karen bass which unfortunately supports the current d.a george gascon who's i believe single-handedly destroyed los angeles and we have a serious crime issue here we have a serious homelessness issue here and none of these topics are ever properly addressed you know we keep getting taxed to contribute more and more money towards these crises but there always seem to be groups taking a piece of the pie but not actually doing anything productive with it so i guess first question is do you support karen bess who seems to support george gascon because unfortunately that's the only thing i disagree with you with hopefully you do support caruso who seems to be a better candidate for this problem in la uh number two with the situation in ukraine i uh very proud that the fact that you guys are helping them out if uh if we don't i don't know who will that if ukraine would potentially cease to exist so commend you guys for doing your efforts there i also commend you for all the support for israel of course um and i think in terms of energy while it would be ideal for everyone to go electric as the previous caller just said it's probably not possible right now as you also clarified but more importantly we've seen gas prices through the roof and unfortunately it's due to a president that doesn't seem to be on the oil industry side you're raising a lot of issues so let me let me respond to the one so far we're going to try to squeeze in two more questions karen bass and i have worked together here for decades as it happens i do support her i don't agree with what uh garcon is doing on a number of of cases but that's not as a congress member that's just as a resident of of los angeles uh as to um the high gas prices that is not a matter of how much oil is produced in any one country canada produces twice as much oil as they burn and their prices for gasoline are considerably higher than those in the united states it is a worldwide price that is constrained by opic and then the big thing has been uh uh russia and and ukraine and uh it it certainly hurts us that we have been somewhat successful in preventing russian oil from reaching the market um given the blood and treasure that we spent last time there was a major war in europe um this is a lot easier than what we faced in the 1940s but it you can't have sanctions on russia for free um as to the president preventing oil production in the united states in in biden's first year we produced more oil in the united states than we had in trump's last year and next year we're going to produce more oil in the united states than we have at any time in our history now it's true if you look at the rhetoric you'll see that uh you know biden sees a future for us without fossil fuels but that's that's in the long term uh future it's something we move toward and in the meantime uh it is i think better to see oil produced in the united states if we're going to burn it here then to see it produced in saudi arabia it's better for the environment because when the saudis produce oil they are much more likely to vent methane and methane is as we learned as a result of the porter ranch gas blowout uh is uh 60 to 70 times more potent in raising uh temperatures than is carbon dioxide so the key is not preventing oil production in the united states it's reducing the amount we burn and finally i'll give the environmentalists a lot of credit for helping us economically the yeah you know my first car got nine miles to the gallon and if it hadn't been for environmentalists and frankly democrats uh i thought everybody would still be driving a car that gets nine miles to the gallon so that would mean you'd be buying three times as much gasoline and since your neighbors would also in every way be burning three times as much gasoline there'd be much much more demand so you might be paying double or double or triple the price per gallon and using double or triple the number of gallons so the fact that the environmental movement has pushed us toward a much higher mpg uh is very important but um yes there's a a a belief in the democratic party that we have to move past fossil fuels but the fact is we produ will produce more oil in the united states next year than we have at any time in history we have some results to our questions uh do you support uh oh first we'll do the uh the inflation reduction act 76 yes nine percent no 15 percent unsure and do you support codifying uh uh abortion rights uh as defined in roe v wade as part of our con our federal statutes 83 yes 10 percent no 7 unsure we have time for one more question don okay congressman we have uh again i apologize not sure if this is a first or a last name but spalding from winnetka you're on hello congressman hello um i i have a question for you about uh renewable energy we we seem to be making a big push for it in this country which is a good thing it definitely helps our environment however people that are blessed enough to make enough money to be able to afford solar panels on their houses are given tax incentives to do so um those of us that are on fixed incomes i'm i'm disabled can't afford to put solar panels but there there's no help for us to be able to do it and instead we just pay the the higher utility bills and i'm wondering if in this new bill that's being backed if passed if there's anything to help those of us on fixed income to be able to do that i would have to to check i'd point out that at this point you get a solar panel and some tax relief to incentivize it i don't know how much lower per kilowatt your bill is um i mean this is still a an industry that's that's in development so at least without uh the the subsidies and incentives most for most people in most parts of the country um it's it's hard to say you know it's hard to say those solar panels will pay for themselves if they're not if you don't get an incentive that's why you might need an incense so i'm not sure that if you drive by a house and you see a solar panel that you know that person's paying you know only a third per kilowatt or two thirds per kilowatt what you're paying and we're all benefiting from the fact that that person is using less electricity off the grid uh but i i do want to see um whether uh uh you know i i mean what what is in this bill uh to uh to allow those those who are on fixed incomes to move toward the toward clean energy in their homes um with uh uh and of course uh we all benefit uh if we uh produce less carbon um i think that was a good question um that the we're going to have to to wrap this up if i go more than another couple minutes the vendor's going to charge us an extra fortune so i'll quickly say look forward to hearing from you in another town hall meeting we expect that to be in early september to find out about it go to bradsherman.house.gov submit a question in advance um at the end of this town hall you're going to be connected to our voicemail system i'm going to ask you to do

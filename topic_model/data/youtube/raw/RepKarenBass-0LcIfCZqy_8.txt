congresswoman bass what does it say that just a week after derek chovan's conviction for the murder of george floyd the nation finds itself in a tragically familiar situation where there are serious questions being raised about how and why police killed another black man well i think it just shows you the extent of the problem and remember there are three cases that we're dealing with that happened within hours of the verdict and there was also a girl a 17 a 16 year old who was killed as well and a 13 year old boy so actually that's four cases on average about three people die a day at the hands of police so i think we're just really becoming aware of a problem that has been there for more years than i can count so investigations are obviously important and there are things that police can sometimes justifying and not releasing to the public while an investigation is ongoing but in the specific case in north carolina do you think there's any justification for the police to withhold the video of andrew brown jr being killed i mean i am shocked at the way they have mishandled this situation and i think i don't have a doubt in my mind that this is a complete cover-up they literally invited the family to come in and see the videotape and then when they got there they decided they needed to redact it or edited so how could that possibly result in any trust not just from the family but from the entire community and then just to show them the last 20 seconds of their relative's life was cruel so you obviously sponsored the george floyd act which passed the house twice i believe but you're now in negotiations on what could be a bipartisan bill with republican senator tim scott um what's the status of those negotiations and what are the specific holdups at this point well let me just say that actually conversation started right after march 3rd in the house with the problem solvers caucus under the leadership of josh gottheimer pete stauper and other members and so they started off at on bipartisan and we do have certain issues that that are difficult such as qualified immunity um and reducing the um the the requirement to prosecute an officer so right now we see case after case where an officer is involved in a shooting or something else that resulted in great bodily injury or death and then we will see a d.a not even prosecute not even bring charges well that's because the bar to bring charges is so high officers are rarely prosecuted and then they don't have to worry about having any civil liability which is why you saw derek chavin look at the camera while he was murdering george floyd so that's what we need to address that's a difficult area that we're trying to grapple with right now any progress yes i think there's significant progress as a matter of fact i feel very confident that we're going to get a bill a bipartisan bill on president biden's deaths within the next few weeks well that would be something the nation would certainly like to see that uh as you know president biden will address a joint session of congress tomorrow night to mark his first hundred days in office you won the lottery you will actually be one of the you know not few but but several dozen or hundreds of members who are actually be in the crowd there he is expected to speak about police reform what do you hope to hear from him well i am really honored that the speaker pelosi did um invite me to attend i want to hear president biden really tell the congress that he wants a bill on his desk in short order i want to hear the push and the pressure from him and we know that he has called for this and if he elevates it to the point of being a key part of his address i think it will give us the momentum we need to get across the finish line congresswoman karen bass we appreciate your time thanks so much for joining us thank you

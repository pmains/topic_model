with me now is one of these senators responsible for getting the oil ban legislation into the budget deal you'll know it when I say it because he comes from the state of North Dakota Senator John Hoeven senator thank you for being here there's good to be with you okay so let's get right to the numbers because you actually crunched some numbers and you believe you have numbers on a how many jobs it will create and be what it'll do for the US economy let's talk about jobs first how many jobs will this create well there's industry studies out there that show that by 2030 lifting the oil export ban will generate another 750 billion dollars in new investment more than 400,000 jobs and those are some of the lower end estimates other estimates are even higher well how did you crunch those numbers and that's a huge number when it comes to jobs in what sections because right now all of these stocks are tanking on low low oil prices and just the belief that maybe perhaps the taste for this is changing why an energy and related field so everything from equipment petrochemicals to a whole range of industry sectors remember energy is a foundational industry and those numbers come from in this case IHS but there's been other studies by harvard business school by brookings institute by the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration and that's the point there's a lot of information out there that shows lifting this oil export ban will be good for economic growth for job creation and for really for national security through more energy security in our country well let's also bring up the fact that Ukraine has to buy Ukraine has to buy all of its energy from a very hostile resource and that would be Russia maybe this just exes out that that requirement and perhaps a lot of countries who would love to buy from a from a friendlier nation like the US will then buy that have you thought about that Liz great point remember as our oil and gas industry grows it also helps us in terms of supplying our allies with product to reduce their dependence on countries like Russia or OPEC or Venezuela and that consumer benefits at the pump because more supply means lower prices at the pump over the long term for our consumers so it's about in security for us here at home but also helps our allies well it's great two dollars a gallon for people I love filling up these days because it doesn't hurt the wallet as much let me just quickly play devil's advocate here senator sure we are drawing down a valuable commodity that not every country in the world has some would say we shouldn't be exporting that we should be hoarding it and saving it for a very rainy day that may come great question Liz but just the opposite is true if we don't allow our industry to compete it will shrink we're fighting for market share right now with countries like OPEC that are trying to reassert their dominance if they put our industry out of business then they're back in the driver's seat and they raised prices on our consumers and what we're finding as we develop new technologies that investment in that new technology and deploying those new technology is producing more energy than ever before and we're finding more energy here at home and we're producing it with better environmental stewardship we've got to go but I want to quickly ask you are you a guy coming from North Dakota where there's a lot of fracking gee do you hate the idea of people driving electrical vehicles look I'm for energy from all sources but we want to make sure that we have competition out there that produces more energy and that competition reduces the price for our economy small business and consumers senator happy holidays thanks so much for joining us thanks Liz Merry Christmas and thank you John Hoeven is the senator from North Dakota

hello everybody Anthony Gonzalez here with another weekly update a while ago I mentioned that we have somebody in our office who focuses almost exclusively on bringing federal grant dollars back into the 16th district and I was happy to see that we had for more Awards this this week come through two of the awards are going to go towards providing adaptive sports programs for veterans in particular wounded when wounded veterans and so two different grants going towards that initiative which are outstanding right in our community has so really excited about that and another one is for two more grants for combating domestic violence so for grants in total close to a million dollars going back into the community on those two very important initiatives additionally this week we were back from our in the district work period to our back in DC I spearheaded a letter with some of my freshman colleagues bipartisan letter based on a New York Times story on Child Exploitation that's taking place online and so a story came out and basically what we found of what's been reported over ten million images of child pornography being shared online on Facebook and on different platforms I think the numbers actually much higher than that that's just what was actually reported and so we sent a letter out to the Judiciary Committee and a homeland security committee asking them to hold hearings to look into this very serious issue I can't imagine as a new parent just the horror that that you would feel knowing that your child has been put in that situation just absolutely repulsive what's happening online in so many different ways and so hopefully we'll get some hearings on that and we'll continue to keep pushing that the dialogue on that specifically and then finally we introduced a bill to combat suicide rates so suicide rates are spiking all over the country over an 80 percent rise in certain populations in our community over the years and and again I think there's a lot of decay happening across the entire country and in various sectors and I think you're seeing that filtered down into some some pretty terrible actions like suicide and so this really hit home for me you know in a variety of ways I have a lot of conversations when I'm back home meeting with different groups about mental health issues and things like that and we all know we have a mental health crisis in this country but where this really hit home was was actually one of my last visits I was talking to somebody from the Farm Bureau typically when we when I meet with constituency groups like the Farm Bureau you're talking about trade and us MCA and things like that primarily economic issues and as the meeting was ending the the young lady I was talking to I handed me a card and said this is actually a big initiative for us as well which is farmers committing suicide and it was the first I'd heard of that specifically in the agriculture community and I think it really hit home for me that this is hitting every single area of our country and our region and so we as a team got together and said okay what can we do to look into this to study it and to hopefully combat these these spiking suicide rates we have to have this going in the other direction right now what is happening is unsustainable and it's sad and so so that's kind of what we've been working on this week again as always thank you for allowing me to be a representative and I hope everybody has a great weekend

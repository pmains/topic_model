PLEASED -- THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE SENATOR FROM DELAWARE. MR. CARPER: MR. PRESIDENT, I'M HONORED TO FOLLOW MY COLLEAGUE FROM WISCONSIN, AND RISE AS WELL REGARDING THE NOMINATION OF JUDGE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON TO SERVE AS AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE ON THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES. AS SOME OF YOU WILL RECALL, ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES FROM NEW JERSEY, SENATOR BOOKER, DELIVERED UNUSUALLY POIGNANT AND UNSCRIPTED REMARKS RECENTLY IN THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ABOUT JUDGE JACKSON'S NOMINATION AND CREDENTIALS AND CHARACTER. HE MOVED MANY OF THOSE WHO WERE PRESENT TO TEARS AND SPELLED OUT, AS ONLY HE CAN, WHAT THIS NOMINATION MEANS FOR OUR NATION, IN PARTICULAR FOR THE MILLIONS OF BLACK AMERICANS WHO LOOK AT JUDGE JACKSON AND SEE THEIR OWN MOTHERS, THEIR OWN DAUGHTERS, THEIR OWN SISTERS, AND THEIR OWN FRIENDS. UNFAZED BY THE UNFAIR ATTACKS THAT DAY ON JUDGE JACKSON, OUR COLLEAGUE SAID THESE WORDS -- NOBODY, NOBODY'S GOING TO STEAL MY JOY. MR. PRESIDENT, I SECOND THAT EMOTION. THIS HISTORIC MOMENT AND THIS HISTORIC NOMINEE BRING ME GREAT JOY AS WELL. OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MINUTES, I AM GOING TO TALK ABOUT JUDGE JACKSON'S IMPECCABLE QUALIFICATIONS, I'M GOING TO DISCUSS HER STERLING RECORD AS A PUBLIC SERVANT, INCLUDING NEARLY A DECADE AS A FEDERAL JUDGE, THAT MAKE HER SUPREMELY QUALIFIED TO SERVE ON OUR SUPREME COURT. I ALSO WANT TO TALK FOR A BIT ABOUT THE HISTORIC NATURE OF THIS NOMINATION, ATTEMPT TO PUT IN CONTEXT JUST WHAT IT MEANS FOR OUR NATION AND FOR ME PERSONALLY, TO CAST A VOTE TO CONFIRM THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN TO SERVE ON THE SUPREME COURT. BECAUSE TODAY, INDEED, IT BRINGS A LOT OF US REAL JOY, IN THIS BODY, TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY, THE PRIVILEGE TO PLAY A SMALL PART IN JUDGE JACKSON'S CONFIRMATION. SIMILAR TO PRESIDENT REAGAN DELIVERING ON HIS PROMISE YEARS AGO TO NOMINATE THE FIRST WOMAN, JUSTICE SANDRA DAY O'CONNOR, TO THE SUPREME COURT, PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS DELIVERED ON HIS OWN PROMISE, HIS NOMINEE TO BE THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN TO THE HIGHEST COURT IN OUR LAND, AND THE NATION CAN BE PROUD OF THE NOMINEE THAT WE'RE HERE TO DEBATE AND TO CONFIRM. LET ME BEGIN, HOWEVER, BY TAKING A MOMENT TO THANK JUSTICE STEPHEN BREYER FOR HIS EXEMPLARY SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY. AS MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES KNOW, JUSTICE BREYER WAS NOMINATED TO THE SUPREME COURT BY PRESIDENT CLINTON IN 1994, WHEN I WAS SERVING AS GOVERNOR OF DELAWARE THEN. THE PRESIDING OFFICER WAS AN ASTRONAUT UP IN THE ETHER ABOVE OUR PLANET. JUSTICE BREYER WAS CONFIRMED, SOME WILL RECALL, BY AN OVERWHELMING BIPARTISAN VOTE, 87-9. 87-9. JUSTICE BREYER SERVED OUR COUNTRY WITH DISTINCTION FOR OVER SIX DECADES, INCLUDING AS A CORPORAL IN THE ARMY RESERVE, THE FEDERAL SIRVEGHT COURT JUDGT JUDGE, AND FOR NEARLY THREE DECADES ON THE BENCH IN THE HIGHEST COURT IN OUR LAND. JUSTICE BREYER IS KNOWN AS A CONSENSUS BUEHLER ON THE BENCH, A TRAIT -- CONSENSUS BUILDER ON THE BENCH. A TRAIT I ADMIRED DURING MY TIME AS GOVERNOR OF DELAWARE, WHEN I NOMINATED LITERALLY DOZENS OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS TO SERVE ON DELAWARE'S HIGHLY RESPECTED COURTS. OVER THE PAST THREE DECADES, JUSTICE BREYER HAS HELPED FORGE PRINCIPLED COMPROMISES TO PROTECT THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF ALL AMERICANS AND TO UPHOLD THE RULE OF LAW. DURING A SMALL CEREMONY AT THE WHITE HOUSE IN JANUARY, WEB JUSTICE BREYER FIRST ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD BE RETIRING, HE BROUGHT WITH HIM A POCKET COPY OF THE U.S. CONSTITUTION. AND IN HIS BRIEF REMARKS, JUSTICE BREYER REMINDED US OF HOW LINCOLN AND WASHINGTON AND SO MANY OTHER GIANTS OF AMERICAN HISTORY HAVE DESCRIBED THAT DOCUMENT, OUR CONSTITUTION. THEY DESCRIBED IT AS AN EXPERIMENT AS JUSTICE BREYER REMINDS US, DURING THE TIME OF WASHINGTON AND LINCOLN, THERE WERE PLENTY OF FOLKS WHO DOUBTED OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT COULD EVER WORK, WHO SAID THAT'S A GREAT IDEA IN PRINCIPLE, BUT IT WILL NEVER WORK, AT LEAST NOT FOR LONG. AS JUSTICE BREYER SAID THAT DAY, IT'S OUR JOB TO SHOW THEM THAT IT DOES WORK, AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK. MR. PRESIDENT, OUR CONSTITUTION IS MADE -- IS MAYBE POSSIBLY THE GREATEST EXPERIMENT IN DEMOCRACY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, I'VE SPOKEN ANY NUMBER OF TIMES ON THE SENATE FLOOR ABOUT THE WISDOM OF THE FRAMERS OF OUR CONSTITUTION. IN THE HOT SUMMER OF 1787 THEY MET IN PHILADELPHIA AND DESIGNED AN INTRICATE SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES. ARTICLE 1 DEALT WITH THE CONGRESS. ARTICLE 2 DEALT WITH THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF OUR GOVERNMENT. ARTICLE 3, THE JUDICIARY. AMERICA IS THE LONGEST-RUNNING SPAIRMD IN DEMOCRACY -- EXPERIMENT IN DEMOCRACY AND IS MORE REPLICATED THAN ANY OTHER CONSTITUTION IN THE WORLD. OUR CONSTITUTION HAS NEVER BEEN PERFECT. THE FRAMERS NEVER PRETENDED THAT IT WAS PERFECT. THIS PAST WEEKEND I WAS PRIVILEGED TO GIVE THE KEYNOTE ADDRESS DURING A COMMENCEMENT CEREMONY DURING THE PORT OF WILMINGTON WITH THE NUCLEAR SUBMARINE BEARING THE NAME DELAWARE, THE FIRST VESSEL NAMED AFTER THE STATE OF DELAWARE IN OVER A HUNDRED YEARS. AT THE END OF MY REMARKS, I LED A CROWD OF ABOUT SEVERAL THOUSAND PEOPLE GATHERED ON THE DELAWARE RIVER RIGHT BESIDE THE SUBMARINE AND ITS CREW. AMONG THE FOLKS IN THAT CROWD INCLUDED THE PRESIDENT OF OUR COUNTRY, THE FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES, DR. JILL BIDEN, WHO WAS THE SPONSOR OF THE BOAT. I ASKED EVERYONE THERE TO STAND AND HOLD HANDS AND JOIN ME IN RECITING THE PREAMBLE TO THE CONSTITUTION, WHICH BEGAN SOMETHING LIKE THIS -- WE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES, IN ORDER TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION. IT DOESN'T SAY A PERFECT UNION. RATHER, IT SAYS A MORE PERFECT UNION. WHY IS THAT? BECAUSE OUR FRAMERS UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS WOULD BE AN EXPERIMENT AND THAT IT WILL BE UP TO EACH GENERATION THAT FOLLOWS TO DECIDE NOW THIS EXPERIMENT WILL PROCEED AND IF SUCCEED. UP TO EACH GENERATION TO FACE THOSE WHO SAY THAT THIS GREAT EXPERIMENT IN DEMOCRACY WILL NEVER WORK. AND IT'S THROUGH OUR ACTIONS ON DAYS LIKE THIS THAT WE SHOW THEM THAT IT DOES STILL WORK. JUDGE JACKSON'S NOMINATION IS PROOF THAT INDEED WE HAVE MADE THIS NATION MORE PERFECT OVER TIME, AND DESPITE OUR DIVISIONS, AND WE HAVE THEM. GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE WORKED TOGETHER, OFTEN ACROSS PARTY LINES, ACROSS STATE LINES, ACROSS PHILOSOPHICAL LINES, TO MAKE A NOMINATION LIKE THIS POSSIBLE. LIKE MANY AMERICANS, I'VE SEEN REMARKABLE PROGRESS IN MY OWN LIFETIME. WHILE MY SISTER AND I WERE BORN IN A COAL MINING TOWN IN BECKLY, WEST VIRGINIA, WE WERE RAISED IN DANVILLE, VIRGINIA, RIGHT ON THE BORDER, NORTH OF GREENSBORO. DANVILLE WAS KNOWN AS THE LAST CAPITAL OF THE CONSPIRACY. FORCED TO FLEE RICHMOND AFTER UNION VICTORIES PILED UP IN EARLY 1865, CONFEDERATE PRESIDENT JEFFERSON DAVIS HELD HIS CABINET'S LAST MEETING IN DANVILLE WHERE I GREW UP. HE DID THAT A FEW DAYS BEFORE LEASE SURRENDERED TO GRANT AT APP MAT OBJECTION -- APPOMATOX. THOUGH IT WAS NEARLY A CENTURY AFTER THE CIVIL WAR ENDED WHEN MY FAMILY MOVED TO DELAWARE, NEARLY A CENTURY, RACIAL PREJUDICE AND DISCRIMINATION STILL PREVAIL THERE. GROWING UP, MY SISTER AND I WITNESSED RACISM UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL. EVERY MORNING, FOR EXAMPLE, OUR SCHOOL BUS WOULD TAKE US TO AN ALL-WHITE HIGH SCHOOL TEN MILES FROM HOME, AND ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR LATER ANOTHER SCHOOL BUS WOULD COME BY AND PICK UP BLACK STUDENTS WHO'D BEEN WAITING, ALONG WITH US, AND TAKE THEM TO THEIR SCHOOL, PAST MY SCHOOL AND ANOTHER TEN MILES TO THEIR SCHOOL, WHICH WAS NOT A BETTER SCHOOL. IT WAS A SCHOOL THAT NONE OF US WOULD BE ESPECIALLY PROUD OF. IF MY SISTER AND I WENT TO LUNCH WITH OUR FAMILY, WE WOULD SIT AT THE LUNCH COUNTER, BUT BLACK FAMILIES WERE DENIED SERVICE. IF WE WENT TO THE MOVIE THEATER IN DANVILLE, VIRGINIA, WE SAT ON THE GROUND FLOOR. THE BLACK PATRONS HAD TO SIT IN THE BALCONY. THAT IS THE AMERICA MANY OF US LIVED IN NOT ALL THAT LONG AGO. SAME AMERICA THAT JUDGE JACKSON'S PARENTS, JOHNNY AND ELLERY BROWN, WERE BORN INTO. AS AMERICA, WHERE DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF RACE WAS SANCTIONED BY STATE GOVERNMENTS, AN AMERICA WHERE THE JUDICIAL DOCTRINE OF SEPARATE BUT EQUAL WAS STILL ENSHRINED INTO OUR LAWS BY THE SUPREME COURT, WHERE ARBITRARY LITERACY TESTS KEPT BLACK AMERICANS AWAY FROM POLL BOOTHS. AN AMERICA THAT TREATED BLACK AMERICANS LIKE SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS. DESPITE ITS CIVIL WAR, AN EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION, AND RATIFICATION OF THE 13TH, 14TH, AND 15TH AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION, IT WAS AN AMERICA FAR FROM PERFECT. THROUGH DECADES OF STRUGGLE AND THANKS TO THE HEROES OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT, OUR NATION BEGAN TO CONFRONT INJUSTICE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND INEQUALITIES IN OUR LAWS AND THANKS TO JUSTICE MARSHALL, IT WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE SUPREME COURT. PERHAPS THE GREATEST DECISION IN SUPREME COURT HISTORY, BROWN VERSUS BOARD OF EDUCATION DECLARED TO THE NATION THAT SEPARATE BUT EQUAL COULD NEVER TRULY BE EQUAL. BROWN VERSUS BOARD OF EDUCATION DID NOT MAKE OUR NATION PERFECT, BUT IT WAS PROOF THAT WHEN THE SUPREME COURT IS AT ITS BEST, AMERICA AND OUR CONSTITUTION ARE AT THEIR BEST. THE SUPREME COURT CHANGED THE AMERICA MY SISTER AND I LIVED IN, THAT JUDGE JACKSON'S PATIENTS LIVED IN FOR THE BETTER. COMBINED WITH THE LANDMARK CIVIL RIGHTS BILL, INCLUDING THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1964 AND THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 1965, IT MADE THE AMERICA THAT JUDGE JACKSON WAS BORN INTO MORE PERFECT THAN IT WAS IN THE GENERATIONS THAT IT WAS BEFORE HER. AND I HOPE AND PRAY THAT EACH GENERATION RECOGNIZES THE UNIQUELY AMERICA OPPORTUNITIES AFFORD US. AS JUDGE JACKSON STATED IN HER CONFIRMATION HEARING, HER PARENTS TAUGHT HER AND I WANT TO QUOTE HER. UNLIKE THE MANY BARRIERS THAT HE HAD -- THAT THEY HAD TO FACE, MY PATH WAS CLEARER, SUCH THAT IF I WORKED HARD AND BELIEVED IN MYSELF IN AMERICA, I COULD BE ANYTHING THAT I WANTED TO BE. AND MY GOODNESS, DID SHE WORK HARD. THE DAUGHTER OF TWO GRADUATES OF HBCU SCHOOLS, SHE WAS THE STAR OF HER DEBATE TEAM AND ELECTED MAYOR OF PAL MATEO STUDENT -- PALMETTO STUDENT BODY. SHE GRADUATED CUM LAUDE FROM HARVARD LAW SCHOOL. SHE CLERKED FOR NOT ONE, NOT TWO, BUT THREE FEDERAL JUDGES, INCLUDING SUPREME COURT JUSTICE STEPHEN BREYER. JUDGE JACKSON COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING SHE WANTED WITH HER RESUME, INCLUDING WELL-PAYING OPPORTUNITIES IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION. INSTEAD, JUDGE JACKSON CHOSE PUBLIC SERVICE, IN PART BECAUSE SERVICE WAS INSTILLED IN HER BY HER PARENTS, BOTH OF WHOM WERE PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS AND PUBLIC SERVICE NO DOUBT RUNS IN HER FAMILY. HER YOUNGER BROTHER FELT A SIMILAR CALL TO SERVE. AND AFTER GRADUATING FROM ANOTHER FINE HBCU UNIVERSITY, HOWARD UNIVERSITY HERE IN WASHINGTON, D.C., HE ENLISTED IN THE U.S. ARMY AFTER THE 9/11 ATTACKS. HE WAS DEPLOYED TO IRAQ AND ENDED UP GOING TO EGYPT AND FOLLOWED IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF TWO OF JUDGE JACKSON'S UNCLES AND BECAME A BALTIMORE POLICE OFFICER. WHEN I MET WITH JUDGE JACKSON IN MY OFFICE LAST MONTH WE TALKED ABOUT THE DIVERSITY OF HER PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE, INCLUDING HER TIME AS A PUBLIC DEFENDER RIGHT HERE IN THE NATION'S CAPITAL. AS MOST OF US KNOW, PUBLIC DEFENDERS WORK VERY LONG HOURS FOR VERY LITTLE PAY. THEY REPRESENT CLIENTS WHO CANNOT AFFORD AN EXPENSIVE LAWYER AND IN SOME CASES CANNOT AFFORD A LAWYER AT ALL. OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT AFFORDS EVERY PERSON CHARGED WITH A CRIME THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE, THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL AND THE RIGHT TO A COMPETENT DEFENSE. IT'S A TESTAMENT OF THE CHARACTER OF JUDGE JACKSON THAT SHE IS SO COMMITTED TO EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW, SHE WAS WILLING TO COMMIT THE EARLY STSTS IMPORTANT WORK. IF CONFIRMED, JUDGE JACKSON WILL BE THE FIRST SUPREME COURT JUSTICE TO SERVE AS A FEDERAL PUBLIC DEFENDER IN THIS COURT'S LONG STORIED HISTORY AND THE FIRST WITH SIGNIFICANT CRIMINAL DEFENSE EXPERIENCE SINCE JUSTICE MARSHALL. MR. PRESIDENT, IN 2005, I VOTED TO CONFIRM CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS TO THE SUPREME COURT. NOT EVERY DEMOCRAT DID THAT. AND AS YOU MAY RECALL, HE WAS APPOINTED BY FORMER PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH, A REPUBLICAN. SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES MIGHT REMEMBER BEFORE CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS WAS EVER NOMINATED TO A FEDERAL JUDGESHIP, HE WORKED IN A PRIVATE PRACTICE WHERE HIS FIRM REPRESENTED AN INDIVIDUAL APPEALING A DEATH PENALTY CONVICTION FOR THE MURDER OF EIGHT PEOPLE. DURING HIS 2005 CONFIRMATION HEARING TO THE SUPREME COURT, CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS WAS ASKED ABOUT AND STATED AND I'M GOING TO QUOTE HIM RIGHT NOW. HERE'S WHAT HE SAID. IN REPRESENTING CLIENTS AND SERVING AS A LAWYER, IT'S NOT MY JOB TO DECIDE WHETHER THAT'S A GOOD IDEA OR A BAD IDEA. THE JOB OF A LAWYER IS TO ARTICULATE THE LEGAL ARGUMENT ON BEHALF OF THE CLIENT. CLOSE QUOTE. CHIEF ROBERTS LIKENED THIS TO JOHN ADAMS DEFENDING BRITISH SOLDIERS AFTER THE BOSTON MASSACRE, THAT ADAMS SHOWED US THAT THIS IS ABOUT DEFENDING THE RULE OF LAW. THAT PRINCIPLE THAT YOU DON'T IDENTIFY A LAWYER WITH THE PARTICULAR VIEWS OF A CLIENT OR THE VIEWS THAT THE LAWYER ADVANCES ON TO THE CLIENT IS CRITICAL TO THE FAIR ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE. LIKE CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, JUDGE JACKSON HAS LIVED UP TO THE VALUES SET OUT OVER 230 YEARS AGO AND IN DOING SO SHE HAS PROTECTED AND DEFENDED OUR CONSTITUTION. AFTER A TIME AS A PUBLIC DEFENDER, JUDGE JACKSON SERVED AS VICE CHAIR WITH THE U.S. SENTENCING COMMISSION. SHE WAS CONFIRMED UNANIMOUSLY BY THE UNITED STATES SENATE. JUDGE JACKSON WAS THEN NOMINATED TO THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. SHE WAS CONFIRMED UNANIMOUSLY BY THE UNITED STATES SENATE FOR THAT POST. AND LAST YEAR PRESIDENT BIDEN NOMINATED JUDGE JACKSON SO SERVE ON THE D.C. CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS, OFTENTIMES REFERRED TO AS OUR NATION'S SECOND-HIGHEST COURT. YET AGAIN SHE WAS CONFIRMED BY THE U.S. SENATE WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. DURING THE DECADE THAT SHE SERVED AS A FEDERAL JUDGE JACKSON HAD A TRACK RECORD AS A CONSENSUS BUILDER JUST LIKE JUSTICE PRYOR. DURING THE -- BREYER. DURING THE DECADE SHE SERVED, JUDGE JACKSON HAS BEEN EVENHANDED AND SHE HAS BEEN IMPARTIAL. DURING THE DECADE SHE SERVED AS A FEDERAL JUDGE, JUDGE JACKSON HAS RULED FOR AND AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT, IN FAVOR OF PROSECUTORS AND FOR CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS, AND FOR BOTH CIVIL PLAINTIFFS AND DEFENDANTS. AS JUDGE JACKSON TOLD OUR COLLEAGUES IN A JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HEARING, SHE SAID A DUTY TO DECIDE CASES BASED SOLELY ON THE LAW WITHOUT FEAR OR FAVOR, PREJUDICE OR PASSION. JUDGE JACKSON IS ALWAYS GUIDED BY OUR CONSTITUTION AND IT'S WHY SHE RECEIVED THE SUPPORT OF JUDGES NOMINATED BY DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ALIKE, BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE CIVIL RIGHTS COMMUNITY AND BY DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS IN THIS BODY ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS. THESE PAST FEW WEEKS I HEARD SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE USE THIS FIRMINGS PROCESS -- CONFIRMATION PROCESS TO TALK ABOUT UNFAIR TREATMENT OF NOMINEES IN THE PAST. EACH OF THE NOMINEES THEY REFERRED TO RECEIVED A HEARING AND A VOTE. THE SAME CANNOT BE SAID OF GARLAND MERRICK WHO WAS NOMINATED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA TO SERVE ON THE SUPREME COURT. JUDGE GARLAND DID NOT RECEIVE A HEARING. JUDGE GARLAND DID NOT RECEIVE A VOTE BECAUSE OUR COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE DECIDED TO INVENT A NEW RULE AND MOST OF THEM EVEN REFUSED TO MEET WITH MERRICK GARLAND, ONE OF THE FINEST SERVANTS I HAVE EVER KNOWN AND IT LED TO A BLOCKADE MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES SIGH AS A -- COLLEAGUES AS A STOLEN SUPREME COURT SEAT. FOUR YEARS LATER, OUR COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE BROKE THEIR OWN PRECEDENT AND INVENTED YET ANOTHER NEW RULE TO CONFIRM A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE EIGHT DAYS BEFORE ELECTION DAY WHEN TENS OF BILLIONS OF BALLOTS HAD ALREADY BEEN CAST. WHILE I WILL NEVER FORGET THIS TRULY SHAMEFUL BEHAVIOR, THIS WEEK WE HAVE A CHANCE TO MOVE AWAY FROM POLITICS AND PLACE AN EXTREMELY WELL-QUALIFIED NOMINEE WITH EXTREME SUPPORT BY SENATORS FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. IN THE END, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED TO TRUST THE SUPREME COURT TO MAKE DECISIONS ON QUESTIONS THAT IMPACT EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN. AND WHETHER WE HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN AIR IS ONE OF THOSE ISSUES, WHETHER WE HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER, WHETHER WE HAVE ACCESS TO GOOD HEALTH CARE, AND WHETHER WOMEN HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE THEIR OWN HEALTH CARE DECISIONS. WE NEED A SUPREME COURT THAT STAYS ABOVE THE POLITICAL FRAY. WE NEED A SUPREME COURT THAT CALLS BALLS AND STRIKES AS CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS ONCE SAID. A SUPREME COURT THAT MAINTAINS THE TRUST OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AS THE ARBITER OF A CONSTITUTION THAT PROTECTS THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF ALL AMERICANS. JUDGE JACKSON WILL BRING A BREATH AND A DIVERSITY OF EXPERIENCE TO THE SUPREME COURT NOT OFTEN SEEN. JUDGE JACKSON'S RESUME OF HARVARD LAW, CLERKED FOR THREE FEDERAL JUDGES, INCLUDING JUSTICE BREYER, A PUBLIC DEFENDER, FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT JUDGE AND FEDERAL CIRCUIT JUDGE IS EVIDENCED THAT SHE IS AMONG THE MOST QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS IN OUR COUNTRY FOR THIS ESTEEMED RULE. HER CHARACTER AND INTELLECT ARE BEYOND REPROACH. SHE WEATHERED A GRUELING SUPREME COURT NOMINATION WITH DIGNITY. JUDGE JACKSON'S NOMINATION IS PROOF THAT TODAY IN AMERICA ONE'S QUALIFICATIONS AND UNRELENTING WORK ETHIC EARN YOU YOUR SPOT. THAT PUBLIC SERVICE IS VALUED AND COMMITTED TO THE PRINCIPLE THAT PROTECT OUR COUNTRY DO MEAN SOMETHING. THAT THE SACRIFICES OF ONE GENERATION SLOWLY BUT SURELY MAKES FOR A BETTER AMERICA FOR THE NEXT GENERATION. COUNT ME AMONG THE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO ARE INSPIRED BY JUDGE JACKSON'S LIFE STORY, A UNIQUELY AMERICAN STORY THAT'S PROVIDES PROOF THAT OUR NATION CAN BE MADE MORE PERFECT OVER TIME. AND IT BRINGS THIS SENATOR FROM DELAWARE WHO GREW UP IN DANVILLE, THE LAST CAPITAL OF THE CONFEDERACY A MUCH DIFFERENT AMERICA, IT BRINGS ME GREAT JOY TO BE ABLE TO CAST A VOTE TO CONFIRM JUDGE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON TO SERVE AS AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE ON THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND, WITH THAT, I

hi I'm state representative Eric Burleson I've we're doing another Capitol report today I wanted to talk about house bill 1534 represented by representative curb bar from the st. Charles area of Missouri and it and it was an interesting discussion because last year we sponsored i sponsored House bill for 23 which was the healthcare compact that bill was was it was designed similar to yours as a pushback against Obamacare the recently passed Patient Protection and affordability care act on the federal level and there's been a lot of efforts to to stop that legislation and wanted to kind of explore the three different ones one has been initially safe states have sued the federal government right Missouri is a preliminary lieutenant governor has participated in that lawsuit well we last year we forced the Missouri Attorney General to actually participate in the loss yeah our own attorney general wouldn't participate until we forced them to yeah and then so there's several states I think 25 states participating in ozone in the lawsuit that's being discussed on the in the Supreme Court now not there that's that attempt is to basically say to the court that this law this federal law does is not constitutional and they're using the court system to determine that so then there's the other aspect which which was a bill that i sponsored last year which was the healthcare compact House bill for 23 we did pass it in Missouri and and then other states have also passed it and so which it's neat that Missouri is kind of setting a trend in that regard we have but that bill is essentially doing what the Constitution was the very beginning which is creating a an interstate compact of several states coming together and saying this is the way that we're going to do things and then what the interstate compact does is it's actually a mechanism of the Constitution in article 1 section 10 in Clause 3 it says that states can compact with one another with congressional consent so the interstate compact that we passed last year is really using the framework of the Constitution in article 1 and saying basically the program and we politely disagree and we would like to go our own way as states and that's using the framework of the Constitution this year we're working with my house bill 1534 and the idea of this bill is the the idea of the concept of nullification it's a very little used and pretty much misunderstood concept in constitutional law the idea of notification actually started in 1798 under the John Adams administration there is two bills that were passed they're known as the Alien and Sedition Acts and then a number of states said they were unconstitutional they basically band criticism with federal government is what the Sedition Act did and so James Madison who is the author of the Constitution wrote The Virginian Kentucky resolutions he was at that time in Kentucky and then Thomas Jefferson the author of the equation dependents are they see a stylist wrote sponsored the Virginia resolution these two bills basically said the alien sedition acts are unconstitutional federal government has no power to to do this it's an abridgment of the First Amendment rights of free speech therefore we in our state's will not abide by these laws we will not enforce them and we will now allow them to be enforced is in essence what they said they also use the language to say that we as states as a compact we have States created the federal government and then as as Co equal partners in this compact we have a duty right and obligation to determine what is Constitution was not Constitution what is part of the compact yeah I mean that's really it's a fascinating discussion because we were talking about this earlier that it's very similar to if you have a landlord agreement so if you if you're renting from me and we we put together a contract and and you and both of us sign it then if if the contract says that you you can only have that the you know that the you can only have so many cars parked in the in the driveway well if in the contract you can only have two cars and your parking three then then you're violating the contract right so but if if we never had language at all related to that that's another discussion all together it would be outside of the contract so what it's kind of interesting thing there's things that are called unconstitutional because for example if I if if we violate free speech that's considered it's not it's unconstitutional because it's explicitly stated in the Constitution but when you have discussions that are completely outside of the Constitution what is there something that is that still called unconstitutional it's kind of what we call it unconstitutional for lack of a better term but but really you look at the ninth and tenth amendments and the tenth amendment is very clear that any power that is not delegated specifically to the federal government is reserved to the States or to the people respectfully so the idea is people the citizens have have sovereignty have power the idea of John Locke's concept that we all band together to do collectively what we can't necessarily do individually and that we create then government to protect our nuts because it's easier as us as a collective to protect our rights then is for us to do it individually so then we have created a government to protect our rights and so the purpose the whole purpose for government is protection of rights and then the states are the sovereign entities that create the federal government for the same idea that together the 13 states at the time of ratification now the 50 was we as a group of states can work together for national defense for free trade for for certain specific things can do a better job collectively than we could as 13 individual states and so we created a compact between the people at least 13 different state creating the federal government and our founding fathers just getting done fighting a war from a totalitarian government decided we need to be very specific what powers are we giving to the federal government right and so the concept was that was house bill 1534 is here the federal government has created an unconstitutional law by creating a mandate that says you must purchase health care nowhere in the federal and the Constitution does the federal government have that power they have exercised outside the bounds of the Constitution so it is our duty because we United both sworn an oath to protect the Constitution of both our federal government as well as our state government and as our duty as representatives to then say that is not a power to the federal government we must protect our citizens from this abridgement of their rights and so we have created this this bill 1534 to say that bill is unconstitutional and we use the language that madison and jefferson used in the Virginia and Kentucky resolutions to to explain how it is why it is that states as co-equal members of this union of this compact have a right and duty in order to to push back against unconstitutional mandates and so then we do three things with a spill the first thing we do is we say that no state agents specifically really the governor his agents the executive branch has the ability to implement Obamacare right which the governance and try to do we had to prevent him from doing it and run around the legislature last year second it says that any federal agent who tries to implement Obamacare is guilty of a misdemeanor so this is the the teeth to the bill saying you know we're not going to allow the federal government to do to go make it in round around the state and the third thing that we do is we give standing to the average citizen so the citizens the regular Missourians can consume in court if they're being forced to comply with Obamacare so these three things are really giving teeth to this bill because in essence what 1534 does is is it it it gives support use teeth enforceability to what we try to do with proposition see last November yeah that passed by an overwhelming majority one percent across our state of Missouri and saying we do not like we do not accept this affordable affordable care / yeah right you know and I was talking with the members of state I have you know just in interactions with people that are that are either on boards or commissions and they really feel in a box because they eat while they may not like the federal bill they feel that they are required to implement it and so they often a lot of the boards are looking for direction and this is the legislature saying that if you're if you're working for the state or if you're on a state board we you no longer have the direction to do that to participate in the federal executive protection of we are giving protection to all these businesses within Missouri because they don't want to implement this Obamacare there's there's company after company asking for relief from the provisions of the Affordable Care Act and those are in good favor with the current administration are getting relief and those who aren't a good favor aren't getting relief which is a whole nother issue but as regards cronyism is run rampant in today's culture there so what we are doing as a state is giving relief to the entire state we're not saying this business we like we're going to give you relief we're gonna protect you and the rest of the state has to comply we're saying the entire state is exempt we as a state are protecting these legislature protecting the decisions and I think it's a great bill I supported the bill and and and very glad that you were able to sponsor it and we were able to get it passed out of the house we got actually we got a hundred and eight people to vote so we actually got bipartisan support because there's a few can almost a supermajority almost a super majority in the house and so the next step is it goes to the Senate and and hopefully will be taken up by the Senate and passed I already have the sender who wants to go ahead here in committee and and speak on on the Senate floor so we have support in the Senate for this bill as well well great thank you for taking time to join me in and it's great to be able to bring ideas like this to to Missouri and

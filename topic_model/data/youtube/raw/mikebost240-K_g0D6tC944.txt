to add from Democrat Brendan Kelly attacks congressman Mike Bosse for his record during his time as a lawmaker the ad says boss works for himself not his constituents even voting himself a pay raise news three's andrew feather checks that claim in tonight's truth test when I served in the Navy I learned it's not just about service it's about who you serve a new ad in the race for Illinois's 12th congressional district where Democrat Brendan Kelly is looking to unseat incumbent Republican Mike bossed in the ad Kelley attacks bossed sang he's a career politician who works for himself not southern Illinois my opponent Mike bossed has been an Illinois politician for almost 35 years even voted to raise his own pay that claim goes all the way back to 2007 when basta was a member of the Illinois General Assembly he did vote for a supplemental budget that included a race for lawmakers but that one vote doesn't tell the full story the supplemental budget wasn't just a race for lawmakers it also included funding for schools and infrastructure improvements in addition basta boated for a resolution the year before rejecting the proposed race in fact vos has a long history of voting against a lawmaker races during his time in Springfield in Washington while in the Illinois General Assembly vos devoted against pay increases for lawmakers more than a dozen times and even voted to require furlough days for legislators actually reducing compensation and since being elected to Congress basta svatah against pay increases 12 times including a vote earlier this month while in Washington he is never voted for a pay increase did boss'd vote for a pay raise in 2007 yes so the claim is true but because it doesn't provide context and leaves out important parts of boss record the claim is also misleading to voters andrew feather news 3

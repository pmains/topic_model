Thank You Madame chair and mr. Telus I just want to follow up you indicated you graduated from a Middlebury College I believe that is correct what was your undergraduate degree oh you mean what did I study yeah English and and then a Columbia MBA did you have a concentration of Colombian finance or human resources and marketing and finance huh and then you indicated you didn't have a pharmacy or medical background you not had a separate training and in pharmacy science or any allied health field that is correct and mr. Smith tell me about you where'd you go to college I went to Fordham University and what was your undergraduate major finance do you have a graduate degree no have you had any separate training in any pharmacy or allied health field none other than professional experience okay and then my understanding is the same who is probably true about mr. Crowley that he didn't have a background in pharmacy or medical studies academically I'm not sure of Martin's educational background but I do know that early on one of the things that are normally impressed me is that he had developed on his own a treatment for pica and I found that fascinating that I think he has a patent on the on the disease so to me he seems to have been self-taught you you first started working with him when he was at a hedge fund is that correct I met him when he was there he is okay mr. Smith you answered a question to Senator Casey that I want to follow up on you asked kind of how you came upon daraprim and determined that it was undervalued and he asked you how do you determine a drug is undervalued and I think your testimony was that I was trying to write it down quickly you look at drugs and you assess the value of the drugs based upon the value that they have to patients and if you notice that that I think the extension was if the value to patients is high but the cost isn't very high then there's some kind of a mismatch and that's what undervalued means is that a fair characterization your testimony I think to expand on my testimony I was referring to the fact that some drugs there's also an opportunity to increase units as some physicians that have mentioned the typical patient that takes daraprim is generally pretty non-compliant with their medicine so putting a product like daraprim into a specialty pharmacy where there's you know refill reminders and the druggist will work right to their door there's a number of steps that we take to ensure that patients take drug which increases units and also that leads to better patient outcomes well how does that relate to the your answer to the question whether daraprim was undervalued that those items add to the value that those things were not currently being as addresses aggressively as we currently are so you concluded that daraprim was undervalued in part because you thought that there was a mismatch between the pricing event drug and the significant and intense need that particular patients had for that drug because it was the gold standard treatment for the medical condition I believe the drug was underutilized yes right so this this notion of kind of what undervalue is that it's if if patients really need it that they have an intense need for because it's the gold standard but the price is low I mean it's basically a profit opportunity it is the patient as a hostage the patient as a profit Center if the patient really needs it because it's the gold standard and the price is low then there's the finance opportunity that suggests wow this is an undervalued drug what a what a what a great business opportunity for us I mean that sounds like I've kind of got the business model can provide some clarification yeah I mean and your testimony is already on the record what you said to Senator Casey but please yet clarify when I said utilization I meant that the patient's because this is such an important man actually your answer didn't when you answered senator case you said nothing about utilization what you said is you viewed this as an undervalued drug because the value to patients was very high and that was very different than how the drug was being priced so my read of that quick testimony was you saw a gap between patients who had a tremendous need to have this drug because it's the gold standard in treating a difficult condition and a pricing mechanism that frankly wasn't extracting enough for them giving given the value that it had to the patients who needed it so as I responded to your initial request for clarification on undervalued I used the word utilization and by utilization I meant the use of the drug within the patient population you know it's my understanding that there and so the notion will be if it was underutilized to one of the way be you could more utilize it is is expand access to it have more people I've access to it right by utilization I mean patients taking sick patients taking drug and so more and so the idea would be you would want to expand utilization and the way to expand utilization would be to expand access right by investing in patient access so I know that you've indicated that you have no responsibility with respect to pricing decisions but how could it conceivably be an expansion of utilization or facilitate expanded access to increase the price of a pill from 17 bucks to $750 well access is just a component the additional research and development in the next-generation drug that we could market worldwide is also a significant you would agree with me so you you went to Fordham and had a degree in finance and I had to have a degree in economics I can barely remember but as a as a general matter if we see this drug we don't think it's utilized enough and we want it to be utilized more that jackin the price from 17 to 750 and entering into a sole source distribution agreement those two things actually cut against the expansion of utilization I mean wouldn't you agree with that no you don't think increasing the price from 17 to 750 dollars would reduce the expanded utilization of this product no raising the price allows you to make all these significant investments in the different areas I spoke about the commercial patient outreach and research and development and has the subsequent experience in terms of you know dramatically expanding the quantity of this that patients have been taken born that out I don't know familiarity with the exact figures but Nancy Brett's laughs our chief commercial officer would be able to tell you what was the tell me about the genesis of the sole distribution agreement with Walgreens that's an agreement that we inherited from impacts what was the fact that that agreement was in place a business factor in your decision that daraprim was an undervalued drug and a promising opportunity for investment by turing we had planned to make setup a similar system so it in some ways they already set it up right so so you would have done that if it so it was that was a positive factor as you were looking at whether this was an undervalued drug that you might want to purchase that they had a sold distribution agreement with Walgreens their agreement is a I believe there's been a number of amendments the agreement but yeah but but you're you get what I'm asking if you are gonna do it anyway the fact that they had already done it was a positive as you looked at this investment yes okay and there were concerns raised with turing about the sole source agreement with walgreens and the effect that it would have on access and utilization I'll just refer to the record exhibit 23 emails from the health resources and Services Administration that show that HRSA reached out directly to turing with concerns that this limited distribution network would have a significant impact on patient access and i'll just state that for the record i don't think we need to go into it further it's it's in the record I managed sure I don't have any other questions but I just think that the two fundamental kind of core aspects of this undervaluation determination we see this is undervalued because patients really need it and the cost and maybe the access to it suggests that we need to expand utilization and then we take steps to dramatically jack up the call and we take steps to put this drug or we at least find positive to put this drum in a limited distribution channel that raises questions about access it just seems to me that you know this is a business model that is about patience as hostages it's about patience as profit centers and it's a decisions that are made by executives who have no training in pharmacy no trading in medicine no training in in allied health fields at all and you know that this just seems okay Fordham is a Jesuit school correct

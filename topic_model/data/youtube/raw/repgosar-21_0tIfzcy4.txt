mr. Gosar mr. Pendley mr. Gabriel reclamation has an ownership interest in the Navajo Generating Station and Western we sees a significant amount of power from the station's energy production furthermore recent Arizona State University study found that 3400 jobs are connected to the station's operation do either of you know or have a ballpark of how much revenue to the taxpayers is being lost due to delays caused by the EPA regulations mr. Gabriel first no I do not you'll get back to me with that we'll get back to you mr. family I'm sorry delays by the EPA yep not sure I understand her oh I know that we're working we have worked with other Department of Interior and local stakeholders to evaluate the only better than Bart was like you and I talked about in my office earlier you know regional Hayes's is is a state primacy issue not a federal oversight and so all these delays are actually causing cost prohibitive for uh problems to the taxpayer so I'd like to have what these delays are actually causing the taxpayers the lost revenues okay okay mr. Finley Reclamation's 24.3% participating interest in the Navajo Generating Station is used to provide power for the central Arizona Project and as you know c.a.p is the federal water project that delivers Colorado River to agricultural water users in central Arizona and many of the state's large municipal water users including the cities of Phoenix and Tucson in fact Phoenix 50% in Tucson 80% of their water comes through CA P excessive and overreaching regulations by the EPA threatened to close NGS do you believe that we need to restore some common sense to this dialogue and can you touch on the importance of keeping NGS open NGS is a critical component for the central Arizona Project as you as you well know sir it was a we we have about a quarter of the capacity that the CA P wanted users pay power rate for we reserved about a quarter that entire unit generating stations capacity as I mentioned we looked at the EPA's best alternative retrofit technology recommendation and and they opened up the gave us the opportunity to work with other stakeholders to come up with something that was much more palatable to our water users and to the the reclamation to stretch out our are the applications of the haze and nitrous oxide reductions and we think we've got a better plan to to do that EPA seems to agree we're getting credits for some of the work we're doing elsewhere in reclamation for some of the nitrous oxide emissions at NGS that were identified in their Bart proposal so I think we've we've made a lot of progress with our partners and with the EPA to have a way more useful approach to tepees rule let me ask you a question since you brought that up I mean I did Congress ever pass the carbon tax footprint no they didn't I don't know the answers now okay and to see the the executive branch ik and the Interior pushing this forward is actually egregious absolutely egregious and so um you know from that standpoint it's been very clear that we're not going to have an alternative to to NGS and there without that we've got a problem and the fact that we've had the federal government overstep Arizona's primacy issue on NGS is just outrageous now absolutely outrageous that contract was actually outrageous I mean it's pretty much like putting a loaded gun in front of C APs and then GS has had so I will tell you we're very a lot of people that are very upset I'm mr. friendly I'm troubled that the Bureau of Reclamation has spent 1.5 million dollars on toilet exchange grants from the years 2005 to 2011 2011 at this rate we might be well flushing taxpayers dollars down these upgraded toilets literally how much does the bureau plan to spend on toilets changes in the fiscal year 2015 our water smart program is at 52 million for this year I don't know how much of that goes to the to the low-flow toilet issue but it has it has produced wet water the water smart program the 840,000 acre-foot target is is real water drought proof water so from that standpoint it has been a very cost-effective program okay you know I got one real quick question you know we've seen a number of people like the Bonneville customers have paid an average of an estimated 800 million per year in indirect and direct costs to comply with the endangered species do you believe that customers have the right to know on their energy bill of the related costs incurred by the result of my environmental regulations mr. Gabriel first I don't have an answer that sir why wouldn't you transparency we ought to be sharing what the taxpayer is actually paying for don't you think yeah we do not measure or manage the those costs of environmental regulation but that's a problem I don't know gentleman's times expire but now recognize mr. Gosar for his Thank You mr. chairman mr. Gabriel I received reports and comments from several Arizona electric cooperatives about the manner in which Western has excluded its customers from providing input into westerns decision-making process I'm troubled alone of westerns abandonment of historical informal explanatory protocol and westerns willingness to pursue and implement initiatives without substantial customer involvement as you may recall the house energy and water appropriations subcommittee included language in its FY 2014 appropriations bill and mawkish in western for some of their questionable managerial tactics the report language stated the committee is concerned that the Western Area Power Administration has not been fully responsive in its efforts to work with us customers and implementing its access to capital A to C initiative the committee believes a Western has relied too much on a top-down approach and could be missing innovative proposals from its customer base accordingly accordingly the committee hopes to see improvements in the approach Western takes and we'll continue to monitor further developments to ensure that customers concerns are addressed now I will continue to be a strong advocate of unobtrusive yet diligent congressional oversight of westerns operations and management to ensure their compliance with congressional intent and adherence to their original mission so mr. Gable can you briefly address some of my concerns and describe any specific efforts that Western has undertaken to fulfill its responsibilities to its customers and to incorporate their insights into Western policies initiatives please cite specific examples where customer input was utilized in developing a final rule or policy certainly since my arrival eleven months ago one of the things were that I have prided myself on as well as the rest of the organization is meeting regularly and frequently with customers this had to do with everything from access to capital to the strategic roadmap which was broadly endorsed by customers December 6 specifically we had a meeting with all of the the western preference customers concerning the access to capital question that's was the development of the ten-year plans each one of the region's has had meetings with the customers including the desert Southwest and they developed the 10-year financial forward picture for Western for that region which was ultimately rolled up into the Western plan and in fact on the strategic roadmap which I'd be happy to get your copy of a we took specific comments from customers including the desert Southwest vector especially the desert Southwest that changed and modified the way we were looking at that roadmap and the and the ten-year vision that we had we have had significant outreach to customers I've attended at least half a dozen meetings myself and in fact I think the letter that that was has been entered into the testimony is a testament to that that was actually generated by folks in the desert Southwest so I believe we are more than fulfilling our responsibility to engage stakeholders preference customers and the changes are fairly obvious from our perspective looking at our state of the assets report our strategic roadmap and our commitment to a financial openness and transparency so I'm going to continue with that line questioning Western must explore aggressive partnerships with customers to help improve construction minimal cost of operations and stabilize rates what efforts has Western undertaken to utilize the next it's partnership relationships with customers and how has this led to operational efficiencies and stabilization of rates please cite specific examples specific examples are in a number of our substations that have been upgraded with participation of the customers in fact we have several activities going on right now we're looking at activities in the Gila substation and several others I can get you certainly a broader list of that at the Shiprock where we've had to have phase shifters added that was done in partnership with the customers and in fact through that partnership we took an original estimate of 20 million dollars for the phase shifters did some negotiations working with the customers working with the vendor and got that down to twelve and a half million dollars that lowered the cost in fact working with the Arizona Power Authority and several other customers in Arizona we were able to help effect a refinancing of the Visitor Center at Hoover Dam that's going to save customers a significant amount of money in addition in our Colorado River storage project part through some negotiations we've managed to save customers enough money so that the crisp customers as we call them will have an additional two years of rate stability which means seven years where they will have not have had a rate increase so we're partnering very directly all the time with our customers I got one more question why did Westar not conduct a public information forum or a public comment forum in the current Parker date and Davis Parker Davis rate proceeding by not following historical and customary process several of westerns customers were not aware that he had taken away their right of contract contract cancellation upon a rate increase when we're in how did western conduct an open public hearing with his customers telling him that you were planning to take this away from them well again I there's a matter of interpretation as whether we took things away from them or not our rate increases were not based on any fundamental rate change which is when we have to go back to the customers we certainly engage with them discussing the issues they're really chose not to have a public comment in Parker not in that particular case why not I mean good stewardship good customer service just you know me in it that's a pretty defiled economically you know area why wouldn't it be no I can't answer that question for you now would you give me back that answer I will surly um for the record I'd like to submit two letters from the Navajo Electric Cooperative in Arizona's G&T cooperatives for the record please like to be those included thank you I yield back with

♪♪ >> Brennan: WELCOME BACK TO "FACE THE NATION." WE NOW WANT TO GO TO ADAM SCHIFF, A DEMOCRAT FROM CALIFORNIA, AND HE JOINS US FROM THE LOS ANGELES AREA. GOOD MORNING TO YOU. >> GOOD MORNING. >> Brennan: I WANT TO START ON UKRAINE. THE UNITED STATES PURCHASES ABOUT 600,000 BARRELS OF RUSSIAN PETROLEUM PRODUCTS A DAY. SPEAKER PELOSI SAID THAT OIL SHOULD BE BANNED. THE WHITE HOUSE SAYS IT IS LOOKING AT OPTIONS. WHAT IS THAT OPTION? DOES THE SOLUTION COME FROM CONGRESS? OR IS THIS SOMETHING PRESIDENT BIDEN NEEDS TO ACT ON? >> I THINK IT COULD COME FROM EITHER PLACE. I THINK THERE IS A VERY STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT TO CUT OFF RUSSIAN OIL AND GAS SALES TO THE UNITED STATES. IT IS TO MANY OF US IN CONGRESS THAT WHILE WE'RE SANCTIONING THEM AND TRYING TO CRIPPLE THEIR ECONOMY, THAT WE WOULD HELP THEM IN ANY WAY BY PURCHASING THEIR PETROLEUM. BUT I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO MAKE SURE WE WORK WITH OUR ALLIES. THIS WILL HAVE AN IMPACT POTENTIALLY ON GLOBAL OIL PRICES, INCLUDING HERE AT HOME WHERE IN LOS ANGELES GAS IS OVER $5 A GALLON. SO HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTANDS THE IMPACT ON THE GLOBAL SUPPLY. BUT I THINK THERE IS STRONG SUPPORT TO SHOW A SOLIDARITY WITH UKRAINE, BUT ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT AMERICAN DOLLARS ARE NOT SUPPORTING THE RUSSIAN WAR MACHINE IN ANY WAY. >> Brennan: HOW QUICKLY DOES THAT NEED TO HAPPEN? THIS IS PUTIN'S LIFELINE. IT IS A CASH COW. >> I THINK WE WOULD LIKE TO ACT ON IT VERY QUICKLY. AT THE SAME TIME, WE HAVE TO BE CIRCUMSPECT THAT RUSSIA WILL PROBABLY FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE TO SELL THAT OIL AND GAS, TOO. SO THE IMPACT ON RUSSIA MAY NOT BE AS POWERFUL AS WE WOULD LIKE. WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE TO EXPLORE ADDITIONAL WAYS TO REALLY CRUSH THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY. BUT I HAVE TO SAY I'M ENORMOUSLY IMPRESSED HOW THE WORLD HAS COME TOGETHER, AND HERE IN CONGRESS, A VERY PARTISAN CONGRESS, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ARE UNITING AROUND THIS TOUGH SANCTIONS PACKAGE, AS WELL AS PROVIDING MORE DEFENSE DEFENSIVE SUPPORT AND THERE IS SOLIDARITY WITH THE BRAVE PEOPLE OF UKRAINE. >> Brennan: THERE IS SOLIDARITY, BUT IT SEEMS THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN IS WILLING TO SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES OF THOSE SANCTIONS, AND THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE ARE. THE MILITARY IS NOT STOPPING ITS ADVANCE, AS LEAST THAT WE CAN SEE. WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF, AS PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY IS PREDICTING, HE LOSES HIS LIFE IN THIS RUSSIAN ATTACK? WHAT WILL THE UNITED STATES DO THEN? >> WELL, HE HAS BEEN, I THINK, AN INCREDIBLY COURAGEOUS WAR-TIME LEADER. THIS WAS ANOTHER MISCALCULATION BY PUTIN, WHO BELIEVED THAT ZELENSKYY WAS WEAK, WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO LEAD A COUNTRY TO WAR. BUT IN FACT HE HAS PROVEN TO BE ENORMOUSLY COURAGEOUS AND HE RALLIED NOT ONLY PEOPLE IN UKRAINE, BUT PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD. I DON'T WANT TO CONTEMPLATE WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN HIS ABSENCE, BUT I THINK THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE WILL CONTINUE SUPPORTING HIM. WE ARE PROVIDING INTELLIGENCE TO PROTECT HIM, AND GIVING UKRAINIANS WHAT THEY NEED TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. >> Brennan: WHAT WE SPOKE TO ANTONY BLINKEN ABOUT IS A RENEWED VERSION OF THIS NUCLEAR PROGRAM WITH IRAN. SHOULD THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION PRESENT THAT TO CONGRESS FOR REVIEW? DO YOU WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT? >> I'M CERTAINLY GOING TO WANT TO LOOK AT IT AND STUDY IT AND ASSESS THE MERITS OF IT. IT WILL COME DOWN TO WHETHER IT IS ESSENTIALLY RE-ENTERING THE DEAL THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION pPULLED AMERICA OUT OF, OR IT IS SUBSTANTIALLY A NEW AND DIFFERENT DEAL. IF IT IS THE LATTER, I THINK IT WILL REQUIRE A VOTE IN THE CONGRESS. IF IT IS THE FORMER, THEN THE ADMINISTRATION MAY BE ABLE TO DO THAT ON ITS OWN. ULTIMATELY, I THINK THE DECISION TO PULL OUT WAS DISASTEROUS. IRAN HAS MOVED FORWARD, BOTH IN TERMS OF ITS ENRICHMENT, BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF ITS EXPERTISE. AND ULTIMATELY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WEIGH THE IM OF IMPACT OF THAT ON ANY AGREEMENT. >> Brennan: YOU KNOW THE AGGRESSIONS THEY ARE ATTEMPTING ON AMERICAN SOIL, INCLUDING THE ATTEMPT TO KIDNAP A NEW YORK JOURNALIST. AND THE THREATS AGAINST MIKE POMPEO AND OTHER TRUMP OFFICIALS. SHOULD THIS DEAL WITH IRAN INCLUDE A PROMISE TO STOP CARRYING OUT THOSE AGGRESSIONS ON U.S. SOIL? >> I WOULD LOVE A NUCLEAR DEAL TO INCLUDE A CESSATION OF ITS MISSILE AND DRONE PROGRAM. BUT THE QUESTION IS NOT WHAT I WOULD LIKE, BUT WHETHER A DEAL THAT IS CONFINED TO CURBING IRAN'S ABILITY TO GET A BOMB IS A GOOD DEAL. I THINK IF WE CAN TAKE OFF THE TABLE ANY PATHWAY FOR A BOMB TO IRAN, THAT IN AND OF ITSELF IS WORTHWHILE. THE OTHER MALIGN ACTIVITIES OF IRAN, THE PLOTS AGAINST U.S. PERSONNEL OR AMERICANS AROUND THE WORLD, WE CAN DEAL WITH AND HAVE TO DEAL WITH SEPARATELY. AND WE SHOULD DEAL WITH THEM AGGRESSIVELY. BUT I WOULDN'T SAY THAT WE SHOULD NEGLECT TO STOP THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM BECAUSE OF THESE OTHER ACTIVITIES. WE NEED TO GO AFTER ALL OF THIS, NOT NECESSARILY IN ONE AGREEMENT. >> Brennan: BEFORE I GO, I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE JANUARY 6 COMMITTEE. THERE WAS A DEVELOPMENT THIS WEEK, A COURT FILING CLAIMING THERE IS NOW EVIDENCE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP BROKE THE LAW IN HIS EFFORTS TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION IN 2020. DO YOU THINK THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS MOVING FAST ENOUGH WITH HIS ENFORCEMENT? >> WHAT WE MADE CLEAR IN OUR FILING TO THE COURT IS WE BELIEVE THERE IS A GOOD FAITH BASIS TO CONCLUDE THAT THE FORMER PRESIDENT AND HIS CAMPAIGN MAY HAVE VIOLATED ANY NUMBER OF FEDERAL LAWS, INCLUDING OBSTRUCTING AN OFFICIAL PROCEEDING, THE JOINT SESSION, AND DEFRAUDING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I DO THINK THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OUGHT TO BE LOOKING AT THESE ISSUES AND OUGHT TO BE INVESTIGATING, IN PARTICULAR TO GIVE ONE VERY GRAPHIC EXAMPLE, THE FORMER PRESIDENT ON THE PHONE WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE IN GEORGE, DEMANDING HE FIND THE PRECISE NUMBER HE WOULD NEED TO OVERTAKE PRESIDENT BIDEN. IT SHOULD BE NO DIFFERENT FOR THE FORMER PRESIDENT. I BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT IS DILIGENTLY PURSUING THOSE WHO ATTACKED THE CAPITOL THAT DAY, BUT THER

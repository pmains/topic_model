joining me now is california democratic congressman raul ruiz he is chair of the congressional hispanic caucus he's also a medical doctor who today is administering covid 19 vaccines which i think helps explain uh your backdrop congressman thank you for that and i want to get to it in just one second but let's start with the situation uh at the border uh because while we're obviously seeing a political display here i i want to keep the focus on the humanitarian challenges that are facing uh people who clearly are making an incredibly gut-wrenching decision to in so in many cases have their children try and cross the border alone because the situation the place where they're coming from is so uh that the risks are so terrible to their own uh health so i i'm wondering for you what are the action items that you think need to be taken right now is bringing fema in a good first step what more do we need to be doing casey it's very important to understand that this is a humanitarian uh issue uh because children are fleeing persecution and violence we hear stories about how if the children aren't joining these gangs or other uh criminal activities that they would rape their family their sisters or they would even be killed so parents are scared they're trying to get their children to safety and what we need is a humanitarian response that puts the welfare of the children first and that's what the biden administration is doing by ensuring that first fema uh is there uh and they will also increase staff with caseworkers social workers child specialists with psychology psychiatry and they're and they're looking at expanding short-term housing for children in order to expedite their ability to get to a loving uh safe and caring relatives home in the united states while their cases is being processed through the courts so congressman i want to show you something that the the department of homeland security secretary said earlier uh this month about how the new administration's tone toward this may or may not be affecting what we're seeing let's watch what alejandra americas had to say and then i'll ask you about it we are not saying don't come we are saying don't come now because we will be able to deliver um a safe and orderly process to them as quickly as possible so congressman i mean should the bible administration be telling people not to come look i think whether the biden administration says it or not we know that this has nothing to do with who's in office and more to do with environmental and and the failed states in their nation and the violence there this happens every so often usually in spring it happened during the president and look what we just witnessed for the past four years is a policy of hate fear cruelty family separation intimidation and a useless border wall that was ineffective and it still didn't work so i think that the focus here is to follow our own asylum and refugee laws and to ensure that the children are safe to treat them with dignity unlike the last administration that that contained them and detained them in inhumane subhuman standards which led to several deaths under their responsibility in cbp so the approach is the right one but it is very clear that this is not the time to come to the united states because the system has been dismantled by the trump administration and therefore it needs to be built in a way that can process the claims as quickly and efficiently according to our laws as we possibly can so congressman the house is set to consider a couple of immigration related pieces of legislation including one that could offer a path to citizenship for migrant farm workers this is something that there has been some republican support for in past congresses do you think now is the right time to be moving legislation like that through the house absolutely it's it's absolutely the right time because we're in the middle of a pandemic and mind you casey i'm the son of farm workers that grew up in a trailer park as well i know how hard they work and i understand the risk they're taking in getting infected and dying from covet 19 in order to feed america and so this bill will stabilize the workforce it'll help our economy and it'll help us rebuild uh uh during this pandemic and for dreamers we know that dreamers are doctors and nurses in fact there may be some dreamers here administering vaccines to save people's lives uh in this event so this is the right time to pass the dream and promise act and the farm workforce modernization act and i'm proud that the congressional hispanic caucus have been leading the way to defend these human rights and to create pathways to citizenship for our hard-working immigrants who want nothing more than to work hard contribute to america keep america safe and to contribute to our economy and so this is a great accomplishment and it is a bipartisan effort we're going to pass it out of the house and we're going to give it to the senate to make sure that they also pass it this year all right congressman you mentioned uh vaccinations and i know uh you are a physician who's there administering doses now i mean what have you seen in terms of how these uh vaccinations are getting into arms the logistics of that have you learned any lessons uh and in fact i'm particularly curious if you've had any conversations with people who've been reluctant to take the vaccine where you've had to reassure them that in fact it is safe and how how we're doing that especially in underserved communities casey there is no doubt that we're in a turning point under the leadership of president biden and here in california under the leadership of governor newsom where we're seeing uh an incredible increase in the amount of vaccines that are hitting our communities and we're going to do that even more so as as as the weeks and months go on for many different reasons one is that we have a president who understands what the word equity means uh and a governor who understands what equity means and so the vaccines are getting to the people who need them the most right here for example in coachella and throughout the entire county of riverside county 47 percent of the population are hispanics they represent 65 percent of the cases of infections but yet have only received 19 of the vaccines these are gross disparities that put lives and communities in jeopardy so president biden's focus on on giving vaccines to community health centers to write to the retail pharmacy programs uh and governor newsom's focus on making sure 40 go into medically underserved areas like coachella my hometown is very important and this is the manifestation of the hope and transformation that we're seeing now what i'm hearing from individuals when i've been out in the fields or into these vaccination clinics into the community is some questions about the vaccines but there's nothing extraordinary that would prevent them from getting the vaccines for example once you explain to them that the vaccine does not cause infertility or that the vaccine doesn't cause people to get sick with covet then they are willing to get the vaccine what's more important and it which is a bigger factor of why the hispanics and african-americans and native americans haven't been vaccinated are not because of peasant pkc it's very important to understand that the disparities exist primarily because of systemic barriers there are no doctors there's no nurses there's no vaccines in their communities once you bring the vaccines here you see the the rooms full yesterday in two hours we vaccinated 700 individuals who work in the fields because they're desperate to get protected to help their family and their community so this is where public health on the ground needs to needs to get organized and take the vaccines into the community in programs like this

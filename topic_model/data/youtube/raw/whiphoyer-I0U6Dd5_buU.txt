the gentleman from Maryland's recognized for one minute mr. speaker a moment of silence is not enough I did not respond to the invitation of the gentleman from Texas to come and stand here I lost a young woman at great Mills High School in my district I visited with her parents I went to her funeral and I grieved with our community but coming to this well and spending but a moment for the thousands who have lost their lives is not enough we need to act the governor of Texas thinks we ought to do something the governor of Florida thought we should do something and he did something we should bring to this floor legislation to try to stem this violence we'll have disagreements as to what that may be but a moment of silence is not enough for what purpose does the gentleman from Texas seek recognition

yeah okay let's talk about your program because i i'm really really into this yes the 10th annual uh foster youth shadow day in dc when you see these kids getting this opportunity tell us about this how it started sure and obviously what the importance is of of this program going forward sure well one of my goals uh in being a member of congress was to really impact the transformation of the nation's child welfare system because so many problems occur when we do not take care of these children properly i mean in our own city we know we have tens of thousands of people who are homeless and there are thousands of young people many of them former foster youth who are in those tents and so i started this i started a committee within congress and then i also started a non-profit organization outside of congress called the national foster youth institute and our signature activity is to bring foster youth here once a year they actually are here for a week but they shadow their member of congress for a day and the point is is to help them understand how to strategically tell their personal story in a way that educates members of congress so they will understand the significance of transforming and improving the system you know that's so interesting you say that because look i i remember as a high school student um we had i think it was called boys day in government and i got to sit on the bench with a judge by the name of harry pragerson a federal judge and it really cemented my decision to go to law school i was so moved by it so on the one hand you're trying to educate members of congress about the importance of the but there's something that comes back to the students right about inspiring them absolutely and and you know what what happens because you're talking about a very vulnerable group of children who get moved around a lot and and just have a lot of individual trauma well you bring them to the halls of congress and they walk down the hall with their member of congress they leave this week feeling like if i can talk to congress and educate a person i can certainly improve my own individual life and we've followed a number of these young people over the years and they're doing very well and it is an experience that impacts them it is transformative the other thing that's great about it is is that many of the young people actually stay in contact with their members of congress some of them have been hired some of them have been given paid internships but they develop long relationships with members of congress and their staff and it is absolutely transformative to the individual both the congress person and the former foster youth as well as the institution yeah of course this program you've got it's really great i mean i'm just thinking back and uh how it's changing lives yeah and can change lives going forward as long you know as because you impressed make this point on uh members of congress so

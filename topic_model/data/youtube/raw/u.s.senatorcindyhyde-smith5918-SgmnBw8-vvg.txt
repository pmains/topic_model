unfortunately catfish producers are not eligible for any of these losses under elab and are any other USDA disaster program for that matter they just have to take the losses and this is a genuine crop loss here that's out of their control but the U.S farm-raised catfish industry is a major con contributor to rural economies in the Southeast and provides thousands of jobs in some of the most Rural and underserved parts of this entire country so saying all of that I would love to amend elap in the 2023 farm bill to address the issue and uh I guess my question Mr secretary is would you commit to working with me and my staff in the Senate AG committees to provide technical assistance and feedback on several proposals that we're looking at related to this issue that I'm working on and I want to be sure that any changes made to elab work and are easily implemented by USDA but we have a really major problem with this and it is you know it's a southern thing but I just want your commitment if you can give that to me to help me with these issues absolutely and I know I might turn to Zach as well I know he's been engaged on this issue as well we'll absolutely commit to work with with you and and uh but but let me turn it to Zach uh thank you senator for the question and growing up on a ranch driving an H tractor in a field with a jumbled up toolbox and a messy garage that we didn't have the money to put the electricity in I learned how to use tools very well and learned how to improvise elap is our best tool for that flexibility and we were able to use that tool to extend some flexibility to the aquaculture industry broader the the causes of loss that you mentioned we do have some challenges with those particular causes of loss under the program but absolutely we'd love to work with your staff to help get to some solutions that work better for your producers

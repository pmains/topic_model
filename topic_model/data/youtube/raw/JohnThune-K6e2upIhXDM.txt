president last Tuesday President Biden was asked why he wasn't taking the opportunity to visit the Border while traveling to Arizona his reply because there is a more important thing going on a more important thing going on Mr President no offense to new investment but if President Biden thinks that visiting a plan to celebrate New vest investment is more important than the security and humanitarian crisis raging at our Southern border then his priorities are seriously out of order but of course we already knew that this is hardly the first time the president has made it clear that he think what he thinks of the crisis at our Southern border he thinks of it as just an annoying distraction from what he'd rather be doing as president in fact he's shown a remarkable ability throughout his presidency to ignore or minimize crises that he isn't interested in dealing with there's a more important thing going on Mr President I venture to suggest that for overwhelmed border communities struggling with an apparently never-ending influx of illegal immigration there isn't anything more important going on and the president's trivializing of our border crisis is a serious betrayal of the responsibility he he owes to these Americans and to all Americans the situation or Southern borders out of control and has been that way for most of the president's Administration over this past weekend alone Customs and Border Protection encountered more than 16 000 individuals attempting to cross our Southern border illegally that's an average of eight thousand per day higher than the daily average in May which posted the highest number of attempted illegal Crossings ever recorded October saw a staggering 230 678 attempted illegal Crossings along our Southern border all told U.S Customs and Border Protection encountered nearly 2.4 million individuals attempting to cross our Southern border illegally during fiscal year 2022. that is the highest number ever recorded exceeding the previous record set the Year by four year before by roughly 640 000. and of course these numbers just refer to individuals the border patrol actually apprehended there have also been almost 1 million known godaways over the past two fiscal years and an Untold number of unknown gotaways Mr president President Biden's comment doesn't just trivialize the scope of this crisis it also trivializes the human misery that has resulted at least 853 migrants died crossing the southern Border in fiscal year 2022 the highest number ever recorded it's hard to imagine that that number wouldn't have been smaller if President Biden had gotten serious about addressing this border crisis instead of inviting illegal immigration with his Lacks border policies I mentioned overwhelmed border communities I should also mention the incredible strain the past two years have placed on the border patrol which has been forced to divert Agents from border enforcement to the overwhelmed humanitarian mission and then of course there's the very real danger represented by unchecked illegal immigration including the risk of dangerous individuals entering our country undetected and the potential for increased drug trafficking illegal drugs are flowing across our Southern border and contributing to violent crime not just in Border communities but in communities around the nation and that's not to even mention our nation's fentanyl crisis which is being fed by drugs trafficked across where else our Southern border and our current border crisis is an open and defeat invitation to increase illegal drug activity but the president has more important places to be than the southern border even though I should point out he's never actually visited the southern border not once the closest he got was literally driving by the border on the way to a campaign rally in 2008. Mr President for Border communities and strained border patrol agents I ventured to say that there is nothing more important than getting our nation's border crisis under control but I guess they'll just have to keep waiting after all the president has more important things to do Mr President in other tone deaf comments from the bite Administration last week white house chief of staff Ron Clane said and I quote fiscal responsibility is very important to us in the Biden Administration we're very well aware that we have to stay within our means economically I think you see that in everything we've tried to do these past two years end quote that from the President's chief of staff well Mr President when I read that I wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry or just be angry on behalf of the millions of Americans who are currently suffering as a result of Democrats lack of fiscal responsibility over the past two years Mr President we're currently in the midst of the worst inflation crisis in 40 years my daughters who are married with their own children now weren't even alive the last time inflation was this bad November inflation numbers came out this morning and they just confirmed what we already know that we are still very much in the midst of this crisis currently inflation is up 13.8 percent since January of 2021 when President Biden took office and even if our inflation crisis ended tomorrow the inflation we've already experienced will cost the average household more than nine thousand dollars over the next 12 months nine thousand dollars now for a lot of families that's the difference between prosperity and just getting by for many others it's the difference between just getting by and not being able to get by at all and how do we get here Mr President well and substantial part thanks to the Presidents and Democrats fiscal irresponsibility Democrats took office in January 2021 Congress had just passed a fifth bipartisan covet bill that met essentially all current pressing coveted needs but Democrats just wanted to keep spending and so despite being warned that the size of the package they were contemplating risked overheating our economy under the guise of covet relief Democrats passed a massive impartisan 1.9 trillion dollar spending Bill filled with unnecessary spending and payoffs to Democrat Eastern interest groups and the economy not surprisingly overheated as a result inflation began climbing and climbing and climbing again but what's almost worse Mr President and what makes the White House's claim that they care about fiscal responsibility so incredibly ludicrous is what Democrats in the presidents did next even as became clear that their massive spanning spray had helped set off a serious inflation problem Democrats in the president kept pushing for more spending in fact their goal which they were fortunately prevented from achieving was passing another massive spending spree in the neighborhood of five trillion dollars and even after that plan was foiled Democrats in the president kept right on pursuing more fiscally irresponsible legislation in August Democrats passed in legislation their so-called inflation reduction Act again filled with hundreds of billions of dollars in Green New Deal spending partially financed by tax hikes that will raise Energy prices and slow job creation Democrats tried to clothe the bill in an aura of fiscal responsibility by claiming dubiously I might add that it would reduce the deficit by 300 billion dollars you want to know how long that purported deficit reduction lasted once the bill was signed into law eight days eight days that's how long it took for President Biden to completely wipe out any deficit reduction in the bill by implementing his massive student loan giveaway a giveaway that not only wipes out any possible deficit reduction but will also according to the committee for a responsible federal budget and I quote meaningfully boost inflation end quote and yet we're supposed to believe that the Biden Administration values fiscal responsibility well Mr President when it comes to fiscal responsibility the bite Administration has demonstrated that it could not care less vital Administration is interested in implementing the big government priorities of the far left will matter how much they cost and unfortunately the American people are the ones paying the price and I yield the floor and I

and at this point we will begin our first round of questions the chair recognizes herself for five minutes well thank you again to all the witnesses for being here today according to the fourth National Climate Assessment projected increases in inland flooding over the coming century is estimated to result in an average annual damages of 1.2 to 1.4 billion each year by 2050 and as a result of sea level rise coastal storms and high tides have already amplified coastal flooding and erosion the Pacific Northwest and my home state of Oregon which I noticed on your map mr. Branford didn't have a lot of green in your lidar mapping we have a challenging history of flooding some as a result of early snowpack melt increased precipitation and warm temperatures in the spring the mighty Columbia River in fact completely engulfed the community of Vanport in 1948 it crested 15 feet higher than the flood plain jeopardized the livelihoods of thousands of residents than in 1996 I remember this one the Willamette River flooding saturated the region resulting in evacuations mudslides and significant property damage in rural Columbia County in 1996 and in 2007 there was serious flooding from the Nehalem River in Vernonia it destroyed homes and schools in 2007 and then they had another major flood in 2015 and just earlier this month Oregon declared a state of emergency in several counties as a result of flooding that had already occurred this year we can only expect that these events will become more extreme and more frequent with a climate crisis so first according to the National Academies report from last year titled framing the challenge of urban flooding in the United States fema mapping methods for a river and coastal flood hazards do not currently consider distinctive urban flood hazard hazard so mr. Burton is how could FEMA better address the growing urban flood risk urban flood risk is a topic that's evolving very significantly actually when and I go out and talk to our chapters one of the things that has stricken has struck me over the last couple years as almost everybody says you know it's one thing we would design our infrastructure for one to two inches of rain an hour but we're seeing rainfall events that give to you three to four inches in a half hour how do we how do we deal with that and the National Academies study is one of three studies actually that came out in the last 12 months or so there's also one by the University of Maryland and the ASF PM Foundation just released a report a couple weeks ago on that and and I mention those because they're exploring different dimensions on it right now in the practitioner community there actually isn't a lot of agreement on how we address urban flooding there's a couple takeaways that we have I think on the practitioner side one the federal government can probably provide tools and resources but there is a clear preference of not having something that emerges from the federal government that's regulatory so because a lot of the stormwater management and the land use management associated with urban flooding is really done at that local yeah exactly so that would be I would say that would be about the area of consensus right now as kind of tools and resources but not regulatory they could and mr. Rossler how could federal science agencies including NOAA helped FEMA better incorporate climate trends into urban flood risk assessments I think one of the key areas where we can collaborate I think more closely is that we see connections in the day to day at the practitioner level but organizationally we have a greater need to be directed I think to have direct linkages a lot of our programs between FEMA and NOAA are complementary and they have grown up in recognition of each other and yet that is a that's people just paying attention to good government as opposed to a strict mandate of how that linkage should happen and might happen thank you I'm gonna get another question and the climate crisis is changing the frequency and intensity of flooding floodplains are no longer as static as perhaps they were when the National Flood Insurance Program was created in 1968 so mr. burr Jonas is focusing on whether a property is or is not in the 100 or 500 year flood plain and accurate use of the best available science or is the 1% annual chance flood the most appropriate indicator of high flood risk areas today well again there's a lot of debate and interestingly there is a trend that we're starting to see some communities especially those that are feeling the effects of climate change moving to a higher standard such as the 500 year flood elevation most recently Houston and Harris County have done that the city of Austin is doing that temporarily until they get new flood maps that reflect the current conditions thank you and I'm gonna try to set a good example and yield back the balance of my time I have an additional question also

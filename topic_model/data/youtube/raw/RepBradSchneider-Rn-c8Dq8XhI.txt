Mr. Speaker, just a month after the U.S. national
debt surpassed $20 trillion for the first time, today this House passed an irresponsible
budget that will add a shocking additional $1.5 trillion to that sum. This additional debt threatens our future
prosperity and constricts our ability to respond to the challenges of today. The cynical purpose of today’s budget is
to pave the way for partisan tax reform that can be fast-tracked through the Senate. But financing tax cuts that overwhelmingly
benefit those at the very top by ballooning our nation’s budget deficits is exactly
the wrong approach. We all agree our tax code is broken and needs
reform. But true tax reform needs to be fiscally responsible. Rather than crafting plans behind closed doors,
I urge my colleagues to reach across the aisle. Together we can pursue reform of our tax code
that focuses on the middle class; promotes the entrepreneurship, job creation, and private
investment; and supports public investment in our infrastructure. Let’s bring this tax reform debate into
the open, and get this done for the American people.

A SENATOR: MR. PRESIDENT. THE PRESIDING OFFICER: THE SENATOR FROM VIRGINIA. A SENATOR: I HAVE NINE REQUESTS FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET DURING TODAY'S SESSION OF THE SENATE. THEY HAVE THE APPROVAL OF THE MAJORITY AND MINORITY LEADERS. THE PRESIDING OFFICER: DULY NOTED. MR. WARNER: MADAM PRESIDENT, I RISE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE ENDLESS FRONTIER ACT, A LONG OVERDUE BIPARTISAN EFFORT TO INVEST IN OUR COUNTRY'S INNOVATION AND COMPETITIVENESS. I'M PLEASED TO SEE THAT CONGRESS IS FINALLY TAKING ACTION TO SHORE UP U.S. INVESTMENT IN THE RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND MANUFACTURING OF CRITICAL TECHNOLOGIES. BECAUSE WITHOUT THIS KIND OF INTERVENTION, CHINA IN PARTICULAR WILL CONTINUE TO OUTPACE AND OUTPERFORM US IN THE GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY RACE IMPACTING OUR COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC WELL-BEING, OUR GLOBAL INFLUENCE AND OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. LET ME NOTE WHEN I REFERENCE CHINA, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT ANY POLICYMAKER OR BUSINESS LEADER DRAW THIS DISTINCTION. I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT MY BEEF IS WITH THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA AND THE POLICIES THAT THE PRESIDENT PERCENT CUTES PEOPLE, CREATES A SURVEILLANCE STATE THAT WOULD MAKE US BLUSH. MY BEEF IS WITH THOSE POLICIES AND NOT WITH THE CHINESE PEOPLE OR PARTICULARLY CHINESE AMERICANS, ASIAN AMERICANS. BUT IN RECENT YEARS, CHINA HAS RAPIDLY BEEN EXECUTING ON A PLAN WORKING PARTICULARLY TO RAMP UP ITS DOMESTIC INDUSTRIES AROUND TECHNOLOGY THAT CONFER POTENTIALLY TO THEM LONG-TERM STRATEGIC DOMINANCE AND A WHOLE HOST OF INDUSTRIES THAT TRADITIONALLY THE UNITED STATES OR THE WEST HAS DOMINATED. ONE OF THE TOPICS I'M GOING TO COME BACK TO IS SEMICONDUCTORS. CHINA CONSISTENTLY INCREASES ITS INVESTMENT IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY. WITH A COMMITMENT TO INVEST $150 BILLION AND A GOAL TO PRODUCE AT LEAST 70% OF THE SEMICONDUCTORS IT CONSUMES, ONE OF THE WORLDEST FASTEST GROWING ECONOMIES BY 2030. ON THE ISSUE OF SEMICONDUCTORS, IT'S NOT JUST CHINA. LOOK AROUND AT SOUTH KOREA WHICH HAS PLEDGED TO INVEST OVER $130 BILLION OVER THE NEXT NINE YEARS WHILE TRAINING 36,000 NEW MICROELECTRONICS ENGINEERS AND TECHNICIANS. EVEN OUR ALLIES IN EUROPE, GERMANY AND 18 OTHER MEMBERS OF EFFORT U. ANNOUNCED INVESTMENTS UP TO $60 BILLION IN KEY HARDWARE IN SEMICONDUCTORS OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. IF WE LOOK BACK AND SEE HOW WE'RE DOING IN AMERICA, BY CONTRAST OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS ONLY 17 MAJOR SEMICONDUCTOR FABS OR FOUNDRIES -- THESE ARE BASICALLY THE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES -- HAVE BUILT IN THE UNITED STATES WHILE WE'VE SEEN OVER 122 BUILT ELSEWHERE. AS A MATTER OF FACT, RIGHT NOW THERE'S NOT A SINGLE NEW FABRICATION FACILITY BEING CONSTRUCTED IN AMERICA. AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FACILITIES, FABS, FOUNDRIES THAT ARE IN PRODUCTION HAVE GONE FROM 81 DOWN TO 76 AS SOME OF OUR OLDER FABRICATION FACILITIES, FRANKLY THE TECHNOLOGY HAS MOVED FORWARD -- LEAPED FORWARD AND IF YOU DON'T CONTINUE TO MAKE THE INVESTMENT, YOU END UP WITH A LARGE EMPTY FACILITY. WE EVEN HAVE ONE RIGHT OUTSIDE IN RICHMOND. AS A COUNTRY OUR SHARE OF SEMICONDUCTOR MICROELECTRONIC PRODUCTION HAS GONE FROM 37% TO JUST 12% TODAY. AND IF YOU LOOK AT CHINA, IT'S ALMOST THE EXACT INVERSE, GOING FROM SINGLE DIGITS TO NORTH OF 30%. NOW, THE TRUTH IS IN THE UNITED STATES THE COST OF A NEW FAB IS ABOUT 25% TO 50% HIGHER. PARTIALLY BECAUSE OF THE LOWER FINANCIAL INCENTIVES WE PROVIDE, THE APPROPRIATE ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS, BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT WITHOUT INCENTIVES, WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE IN THE GAME. RIGHT NOW. PARTIALLY BECAUSE-OF-DECISIONS MADE -- -- BECAUSE OF DECISIONS MADE AT THE BEGINNING OF COVID, PARTIALLY BECAUSE OF A SEMICONDUCTOR SHORTAGE, WE HAVE FACTORIES SITTING IDLE IN THE UNITED STATES NOT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE WORKERS, DON'T BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE DEMAND FOR THE AUTOMOBILES, BUT BECAUSE THESE PLANTS CAN'T OBTAIN THE SEMICONDUCTORS THAT ARE INTEGRAL TO AUTOMOBILES AND FOR THAT AS A MATTER OF FACT EVERY DEVICE WE OPERATE. ON THE SAME TIME, IF WE LOOK BACK AGAIN AT CHINA, IT HAS NO PLANS TO TAKE THE FOOT OFF THE PEDAL ANY TIME SOON. AS A MATTER OF FACT, LAST YEAR PRESIDENT XI JINPING ANNOUNCED A $1.4 TRILLION COMMITMENT TO DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES JUST THROUGH 2025, $1.4 TRILLION. YOU THINK ABOUT THE NUMBERS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY WHICH ARE BIG BASED UPON TRADITIONAL AMERICAN STANDARDS, BUT THEY PALE IN COMPARISON TO WHAT CHINA IS INVESTING. AND YOU DON'T NEED TO LOOK VERY FAR. YOU ONLY NEED TO LOOK AT THE CHINESE DOCUMENTS THEMSELVES, MADE IN CHINA 2025 PLAN AND THE CHINA 2035 PLAN IN TERMS OF STANDARDS, PROCEDURE, AND PROTOCOLS TO SEE WHERE BEYOND SEMICONDUCTORS AND 5G AND SOME OF THE THINGS I'VE TALKED ABOUT IN THE PAST, THERE ARE A HOST OF OTHER AREAS THAT IF WE DON'T INVEST, WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO STAY AHEAD. NOW, IT'S NOT ALL BLEAK. U.S. SEMICONDUCTOR FIRMS IN AREAS LIKE PACKAGING, METEOROLOGY STILL LEAD THE WORLD. THE MACHINE WE STILL LEAD. HOWEVER, MANY OF THE KEY INGREDIENTS TO OUR SUCCESS INCLUDING FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR R&D, INVESTMENT IN BASIC RESEARCH, AND SUPPORT FOR ADVANCED MANUFACTURING HAVE ACTUALLY DECLINED ON -- OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS. SIMPLY PUT, WE'RE JUST NOT KEEPING UP. BETWEEN 1995 AND 2018 CHINESE R&D INVESTMENT INCREASED BY OVER 15% PER YEAR. COMPARED TO THE UNITED STATES INCREASES OF AVERAGING ABOUT 3% GROWTH PER YEAR. WE STARTED WITH A HIGHER BASE. I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. BUT ON RELATIVE AND SHORTLY ON ACTUAL REAL TERMS, CHINA WILL SOON PASS. AS A MATTER OF FACT, AFTER WORLD WAR II, THE UNITED STATES FUNDED 69% OF THE ANNUAL GLOBAL R&D. TODAY WE FUND LESS THAN 28%. WITH ONLY 7% GOING TO NONDEFENSE TECHNOLOGIES. AGAIN, LIKE WIRELESS, SOMETHING THAT I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT AND WILL SPEAK TO AGAIN IN A MOMENT. TO GET BACK TO WHERE WE ONCE WERE AND REASSERT THE UNITED STATES TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP, WE NEED TO REPRIORITIZE FOUNDATIONAL TECHNOLOGIES TO MAINTAIN NOT JUST OUR COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC LEADERSHIP BUT TO ALSO MAKE SURE THAT OUR VALUES ARE BUILT IN TO THESE INCREASING TECHNOLOGY AREAS. THE TRUTH IS FOR SO MANY YEARS, NOT ONLY DID WE INVENT MANY OF THESE BREAKTHROUGH TECHNOLOGIES HERE. EVEN IF WE DIDN'T INVENT THEM HERE IN THE UNITED STATES, WE WOULD THEN SET THE RULES, THE PROCEDURES, THE PROTOCOLS, THE STANDARDS AROUND THESE NEW TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT. WE'VE SEEN THAT IN SEMICONDUCTORS FOR A LONG TIME. WE SAW IT IN COMMUTING. WE SAW IT IN THE INTERNET. WE SAW IT IN WIRELESS. WE SAW IT IN SATELLITES. BUT TIME AND AGAIN NOW, WE'RE SUDDENLY SEEING CHINA FLOOD THE ZONE OF THESE STANDARDS IT EMBODIES AND WHEN YOU SET THE STANDARDS, YOU ALSO REFLECT YOUR VALUES. SO VALUES THAT WE BRING TO THE TABLE LIKE TRANSPARENCY, LIKE RESPECT FOR PIEWM RIGHTS, THOSE GO OUT THE WINDOW WHEN CHINA SETS THE RULE AROUND 5G THAT BASICALLY ALLOWS TRAFFIC TO ALWAYS PASS THROUGH BEIJING, EVEN IF YOU'RE MAKING A PHONE CALL BETWEEN ST. LOUIS AND SAN FRANCISCO, WHY DOES THAT TRAFFIC HAVE TO BE ROUTED THROUGH BEIJING UNLESS THERE'S MALICIOUS INTEREST AT STAKE. IF YOU SET THE RULES, YOU DRIVE NOT ONLY TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT -- THE TECHNOLOGY, YOU DRIVE SO MANY OTHER THINGS. AS CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE, I HAVE LONG BEEN BANGING THE DRUM ABOUT THE WAY THAT THE P.R.C. IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF WHAT OUR COUNTRY -- WHAT MAKES OUR COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC SYSTEM SO GREAT. OUR OPENNESS, OUR TRANSPARENCY, OUR FREE MARKETS. THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT, UNFORTUNATELY, PLAYS BY A DIFFERENT SET OF RULES. THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT STARTS WITH THE WILLINGNESS TO USE ALL THE TOOLS OF ITS INTELLIGENCE SERVICES, SOMETIMES ITS STUDENT POPULATION THAT HAS ADDED SO MUCH VALUE TO OUR COUNTRY, AND ENORMOUS THEFTS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. SOME PUBLIC ESTIMATES ARE NORTH OF $500 BILLION A YEAR. THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT AS WELL IS USING ALL ASPECTS OF ITS SOCIETY TO INCREASE CHINA'S DOMINANCE, FROM THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEFT THAT I TALKED ABOUT TO OPAQUE SUBSIDIES AND FINANCING THAT ALWAYS FAVORS A CHINESE VENDOR. AND, UNFORTUNATELY, FOR MANY OUR TRADING PARTNERS, THE DEAL THAT IS OFFERED BY THE CHINESE FIRM IS OFTEN EITHER TOO GOOD OR LINKED TO ANOTHER DEVELOPMENT -- I'M GOING TO BUILD YOU A ROAD, I'M GOING TO BUILD YOU A PORT, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO BUY AT HUAWEI AS THE PRICE OF THAT -- WE, AS AMERICA, OR EVEN THE WEST, FOR THAT MATTER, HAS NOT KEPT UP ON A FINANCING BASIS. THAT'S WHY IN THE ENDLESS FRONT TEARS BILL THAT WE ARE DEBATING RIGHT NOW, A BILL THAT WILL MAKE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, OUR NATIONAL LABS, BOTH GREAT NATIONAL ASSETS, IN THIS BILL AS WELL WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING MORE THAN AUTHORIZING NEW IDEAS AND NEW ADVANCEMENTS; WE'RE ACTUALLY FINALLY -- FINALLY -- PUTTING OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS. THAT'S WHY I INCLUDED THE UTILIZING THE STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS ACT, WHICH IS BASICALLY $2 BILLION TO INVEST IN MAKING SURE THAT IN AMERICA WE HAVE AND IN THE WEST WE HAVE A COMPETITOR AGAINST HUAWEI. I'VE COME TO THIS FLOOR AND TALKED ABOUT THE NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT HUAWEI PRESENTS TO AMERICA AND TO A LICE. IF YOU DON'T HAVE A -- AND TO OUR ALLIES. BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A COMPETITOR PRICED ON A FAIR BASIS, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO DO? WHAT DO YOU EXPECT AN ALLY COUNTRY TO DO? OR FOR THAT MATTER, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT MANY OF THE RURAL TELCOS TO DO? I WAS PROUD TO WORK WITH TWO OF MY COLLEAGUES, SENATOR BURR AND SENATOR RUBIO. WE PUT UP A PUBLIC WIRELESS SUPPLY CHAIN INNOVATION FUND TO SPUR INVESTMENTS TOWARDS OPEN ARCHITECTURE, INNOVATIVE, LEAP-AHEAD TECHNOLOGIES IN OUR DOMESTIC MOBILE MARKET. AND WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT DOING -- AND I KNOW I'VE TALKED TO THE PRESIDING OFFICER ABOUT THIS AND OTHERS -- IS, YOU KNOW, IN 5G WE'RE ALMOST SO FAR BEHIND AT THIS POINT THAT WE HAVE TO LEAPFROG AHEAD. ONE WAY WE CAN LEAPFROG AHEAD IS BY DEVELOPING OPEN RAM, OR OPEN RADIO ACCESS. LET'S MOVE AWAY FROM A HARDWARE BASED SYSTEM TO A SOFTWARE BASED SYSTEM. WE MOVE TO AN AREA WHERE THERE ARE A HOST OF AMERICAN AND OTHER ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS WHERE WE'RE ALREADY FAR AHEAD. WHAT WE'VE GOT TO ALSO DO AS WELL IS COMBINE THIS INVESTMENT -- AND WE'VE GOT CLOSE TO $500 MILLION ON THIS -- TO ALSO INVEST IN A MULTILATERAL FUND. THE TRUTH IS, NO SINGLE AMERICAN COMPANY ON ITS OWN CAN TAKE ON THIS ENORMOUS CHALLENGE THAT THE WHOLE CHINESE STATE, BACKING THEIR CHINESE CHAMPION, THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN TAKE THAT ON ON OUR OWN. SO HOW DO WE THINK, WITH OUR OTHER DEMOCRATIC ALLIES AROUND THE WORLD, THE G-7 BUT ALSO OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE ISRAEL AND TAIWAN, THAT WE CAN COLLABORATE ON THIS TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT, THINK ABOUT HOW WE COMPETE ON AN ECONOMIC BASIS AND STATEMENT MAKE SURE THAT WE -- AND AT THE SAME TIME MAKE SURE WE INSTALL THAT'S VALUES AROUND TRANSPARENCY, AN OPEN AND COMPETITIVE SYSTEM, THAT THOSE ARE BUILT INTO TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT. SECOND ITEM IS THIS -- CRUCIALLY, THIS BILL ALSO ADDRESSES THE ESSENTIAL NEED FOR US TO INVEST IN SEMICONDUCTORS. WE ARE FINALLY PUTTING OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS. THIS APPROPRIATE ONAGE EMERGENCY BASIS $-- THIS BILL WILL APPROPRIATE ON AN EMERGENCY BASIS $52 MILLION. THIS BUILDS UPON LEGISLATION THAT WE ADDED TO THE DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL LASTED YEAR. IT IS BIPARTISAN P SENATOR SCHUMER, COTTON, KELLY ARE ALL WORKING TOGETHER ON THIS WITH A HOST OF OTHERS BECAUSE THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY, WHILE WE'VE SEEN SOME SLIDING, STILL REPRESENTS ONE OF THE SHINING LIGHTS OF OUR COUNTRY'S INNOVATIVE ECONOMY. AND AS A WIDER AWAY -- AND AS A WIDER ARRAY OF SERVICES DEPEND ON SOFTWARE PROCESSING, THE DEMAND FOR SEMICONDUCTORS HAS ONLY GROWN. AS I OUTLINED AT THE TOP, UNFORTUNATELY THAT LEADERSHIP POSITION WE'VE HAD FOR SO LONG IS AT STAKE. SO THE CHIPS ACT, WHICH WAS BUILT IN -- BAKED INTO THE ENDLESS FRONTIERS ACT, DIRECTS AGENCIES LIKE THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, IN CONSULTATION WITH OTHERS LIKE OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN MICROELECTRONICS R&D PRIORITY. IT BRINGS GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO SUBSIDIES. IT ALLIANCE POLICIES TOWARDS NON--- OUR POLICIES TOWARDS NONTRANSPARENT NONMARKET COMPETITORS LIKE THE CHINESE. AND IT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE CONCERTED ACTION WITH OUR ENEMIES ON SUPPLY CHAIN, SECURITY, AND INFERRING GRIT. IT INVESTS BILLIONS IN BASIC RESEARCH RELATED TO ADVANCED SEMICONDUCTORS, VIA D.O.D. AND A NEWLY CREATED SEMICONDUCTOR TECHNOLOGY CENTER. AND IT MAKES AN UNPRECEDENTED INVESTMENT IN TRYING TO BUILD NEW FOUNDRIES, FABS, BASIC MANUFACTURING FACILITIES HERE IN THE UNITED STATES SO WE HAVE THAT SUPPLY SECURITY CHAIN -- SECURE SUPPLY CHAIN FOR THE FUTURE. $39 BILLION IN THAT FUND I BELIEVE WILL HELP US BUILD SEVEN TO TEN NEW FABS RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. AND WHETHER THEY'RE IN THE PRESIDING OFFICER'S STATE OR VIRGINIA OR ELSEWHERE, YOU KNOW, OUR STATES WILL HAVE TO INVEST AS WELL. MANY OF THESE FACILITIES COST ANYWHERE FROM $12 BILLION TO $15 BILLION BY THE TIME YOU BUILD THEM AND KEEP THEM OPERATING UNTIL THEY HIT SOME LEVEL OF PROFITABILITY. SO SOME LEVEL OF AMERICAN NATIONAL INVESTMENT IS NEEDED TO MAKE SURE AT LEAST SOME SOME OF THESE WILL BE BUILT IN THE UNITED STATES. WHETHER IT'S CHIPS FOR AUTO MOTIVE, AEROSPACE, OUR CELL PHONES, YOU NAME IT THE BILLIONS OF INTERNET THINGS/DEVICES, ALMOST ALL RELY ON SEMICONDUCTORS. LET'S MAKE SURE THOSE CHIPS ARE BUILT, DESIGNED, AND PRODUCED HERE AND THAT THOSE ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD ARE OFTEN DONE IN COUNTRIES THAT ARE ALLIES. SO THE ENDLESS FRONTIER ACT, WHICH INCLUDES BOTH THE INVESTMENT IN 5G AND O-RAM AND OBVIOUSLY THE SEMICONDUCTORS, SERVES AS A ONCE-IN-A-GENERATION OPPORTUNITY TO SOLIDIFY LEADERSHIP. IT WILL STRENGTHEN OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AND REINVIGORATE AMERICAN INGENUITY. THE TRUTH IS, COLLEAGUES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE I KNOW ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THESE EFFORTS. I HOPE NEXT WEEK THAT WE PASS THIS BILL WITH A MASSIVE MAJORITY. THEN IT WILL BE QUICKLY ACTED UPON BY THE HOUSE. BECAUSE I KNOW OUR DOMESTIC INDUSTRIES ARE WATCHING US. I KNOW OUR ADVERSARIES ARE AS WELL. AND IT WILL BE WONDERFUL IF WE CAN FINALLY MOVE BEYOND SIMILE TALKING ABOUT -- SIMPLY TALK ABOUT THE CHALLENGES CHINA PRESENTS AND MAKE THE KIND OF TANGIBLE INVESTMENTS THAT AMERICANS HAVE

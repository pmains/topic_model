gentle from Pennsylvania is recognized for two and a half minutes Thank You mr. speaker let's think about where America was prior to the enactment of the Affordable Care Act 30 40 million of our citizens without insurance people with pre-existing conditions either couldn't get insurance or had to pay so much they couldn't afford their insurance women being charged twice as much as men people against that had insurance had annual and lifetime caps did you ever wonder when you see families holding fundraisers to raise money for their kids drugs so that a kid has a cancer and they're trying to reach these were people that had insurance and come up against annual caps or lifetime caps in the insurance company didn't pay any more half the families in America filing bankruptcy people with insurance up against caps no more payments families losing everything we put an end to that with the Affordable Care Act and how do we do that we come up with a private system that required everybody to participate young and old rich and poor healthy and sick because when you put everybody in that risk pool healthy people help us enable the insurance industry to keep rates at an affordable way for those people who have pre-existing conditions and who have chronic diseases that's how the system works what my colleague mr. Upton is proposing today unravels that system make no mistake about it if we continue to allow private insurance companies to sell policies that discriminate against women that set annual caps and lifetime caps if we continue to allow all of those practices that every American eighty ninety percent of americans said they want their healthcare system then that risk pool goes away then rates go sky-high and you will have raised premiums for every American in this country

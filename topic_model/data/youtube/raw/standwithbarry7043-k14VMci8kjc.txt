hello friends you know this campaign season is gonna be a lot different than anything that we've seen before but the stakes are very high because Nancy Pelosi the radical left and the big Democrat donors are putting millions of dollars into Georgia because they want the expansion of their radical left ideology to begin here but we cannot allow that to happen that's why we have to begin our campaigns earlier than before to get our message of freedom and liberty and economic prosperity for everyone out to the voters in the Georgia 11th district that's why I need your help because midnight tonight is a key deadline for us it's a reporting period that will give us an idea of how much money we'll actually have to begin this campaign and get off on the right start I'm asking you please consider giving a donation by midnight tonight to help us to make sure that we keep in America and especially a Georgia that is free safe and full of opportunity god bless you god bless america

chair now recognizes the ranking member mr barr for five minutes for questions thank you mr chairman um let me ask mr nadler first about market performance during the pandemic and the municipal liquidity facility i was somewhat surprised that there wasn't as much uptake you know there was there's been so much conversation about the plight of states and local governments during the pandemic and the decline in revenues and uh of course we we did find out that large municipalities revenues actually went up during the pandemic but uh we were somewhat surprised after supporting the mlf that uh there wasn't as much uptake and and throughout the pandemic really the the municipal bond market uh proved to be very resilient the market certainly benefited from support from the federal reserve through the mlf but maybe that was more psychological uh than actual actual actually uh through utilization but it did perform well we avoided the worst case scenario some feared so mr nadler where do you see the municipal bond market moving in the future uh how has the market changed and can you speak to whether or not we actually needed the bailout to the state local governments if we had just encouraged municipalities to utilize the mlf maybe maybe they would have just been as well off uh thank you representative barr i i think that you mentioned a couple of things that are true i do think that the we were surprised as well by the uh the few number of people that that took advantage of the uh of the facility i do think that the mere fact of the facility along with very aggressive monetary policy did have an a very large impact on the psyche of both municipal issuers and municipal investors and so i think that that had much to do with how quickly the we saw the municipal market move back to some somewhat some semblance of normalcy second thing i'll say is that the the impacts going forward are going to be uneven uh there were structural issues uh before the the the great the pandemic and we're going to see those exacerbated after the pandemic and they're going to be in towns with that were primarily uh vacation destinations it's going to take a while for those to come back i mentioned towns that have uh that have where they have a lot of commuters coming into the city it's gonna be a while before commuters so comfortable getting on mass transit again in large numbers and so i think the the recovery while it's been re been great and been i think faster than most participants thought it will we will see an unevenness to it going forward let me ask you about materiality a bond rating is a significant factor that affects the interest cost of a security and helps inform investors demand for bonds what is the process mr nadler for evaluating a municipal bond for the purposes of issuing a rating what criteria go into assigning a rating for municipal bond in other words what factors does kroll consider to be material to a bond rating and why is materiality so important materiality is huge and i think that that is one of the one of the most important factors is so when you're thinking about a bond rating and an actual credit rating on a whether it's a municipality or a company you really need to make sure that what you're analyzing really does have an impact on the the fiscal health of that entity whether it's a whether it's a city or a state importantly i i think that we found that disclosure along these lines is probably one of the most important aspects the second thing i'll say is that there are aspects of municipal uh bonds that are impacted by that impact the uh liquidity of that bond going forward and they may not necessarily impact the uh credit worthiness today they may not have a material impact on it but they would be interesting to investors and investors are asking for that type of information and so we are advocates of more disclosure particularly the type of disclosure that may align with investor preferences over time and may also give investors information insight into the liquidity around or liquidity issues around some aspects of bonds well in my remaining time let me just turn to mr hall very quickly i'm a co-sponsor of bipartisan legislation investing in our communities act which would reinstate advanced refunding for municipal bonds mr hall could you detail how reinstatement of advanced refunding especially with low interest rates how that would uh help municipalities and issuers absolutely we we are an unprecedented time of low interest rate environment and budgetary stress on state and local governments the ability to refund existing debt with lower tax exempt debt is viable to and really needs to be reinstated thank you i yield back uh the gentleman's time has expired

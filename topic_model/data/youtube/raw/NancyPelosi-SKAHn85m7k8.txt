in October 2012 we received a phone call that would forever change our lives on the other end of the phone was the adoption facilitator calling to tell us that our daughter's birth parents chose us to be her parents I've never felt the type of joy I felt that day only three days after I brought her home she was admitted to the hospital and we were told she needed cardiac surgery within the next week and they explained to us despite the fact that we have TRICARE we couldn't get her on the policy soon enough they needed a deposit equal to one tenth of the estimated cost and they estimated that cost me a million dollars in order to do my daughter's hurt surgery and by the way we don't think she's gonna make it another week thanks to the ACA my husband was able to go down to Medicaid and get her daughter placed on a plan she had hope in heart surgery and today despite being told she'd never walked she'd never talked not to expect much from her she's here running and playing and being a five-year-old having a good time and enjoying her life the little Robbie had been a force for a while now and protecting our care Charlie and I had been out there with her mom on the lawn on the phone all the rest one of the little lobbyists told me one day that despite the fact that not despite maybe because he had several pre-existing conditions that he was going to be President of the United States these families and families like them have been with us from the start they helped us push open the gate when there was an obstacle to our passing the Affordable Care Act Republicans must join for constructive bipartisan talks to improve and update the Affordable Care Act in the battle to protect our care nothing is more eloquent than the stories of the families who suffered from the court would suffer from the cruelty of Trump care what would Trump care mean to the innocent children of America you

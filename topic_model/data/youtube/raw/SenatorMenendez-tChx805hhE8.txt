from new jersey is recognized thank you mr chairman under current rules public companies are not required to disclose political spending to shareholders and as a result corporate executives can spend investor money on political causes without any consideration of shareholder views of the company's public commitments dr coates should shareholders of companies that make public pledges expect their company to act in a manner consistent with the stated company policy yes and we saw in the wake of january six insurrection many public companies pledged to suspend or reevaluate political donations to members of congress that sought to stop the certification of president biden's victory proving that these donations are a business decision that affects the company's reputation and therefore their bottom line however since then many of these companies resumed their political donations in direct contradiction to their public pledges so dr koch do you believe that corporate political spending is material information that should be disclosed to investors on average yes i'm a supporter of the disclose act and have been since it was first introduced a long time ago and i'm also a fan of getting rid of the micromanagement of the sec with the budget writer that has forbidden the sec from taking up this topic for the past 10 years it's um clearly for some companies their political involvement is first order to their strategy and for them to not even be possibly asked by the sec to make some disclosures related to that political strategy to me just seems like an obvious mistake from an investor perspective has nothing to do with politics per se it has to do with corporate strategy connected to political involvement well i appreciate that and i fully agree that's why i've been pushing for years to strengthen the sec's political spending disclosure rule we've also introduced the shareholder protection act to allow investors to more directly influence the uh political spending of publicly traded companies but enhanced disclosure of relevant information like this in my mind is another way to empower investors the key to empowering investors in my mind is a strong disclosure regiment that includes and informs i should say consumers and allows them to vote with their wallets when it comes to voting many investment fund managers voluntarily issue proxy voting guidelines that outline for investors how the fund tends to vote proxies as well as general principles that are considered so dr koh do you think this type of disclosure is useful to investors i do and i think if you think about the premises of this bill as backed by the various co-sponsors it's that individual investors will lean into their rights as economic capital providers and use them presumably on an informed basis to make governance choices the only way they can do that the only way this bill could possibly work even putting aside my worries about cost would be if they actually had full information about what they were voting on and if they can't get information about what companies are doing with their money because remember this capital flows down to the index fines which is the focus of this bill but then it flows down to corporations so it's their money all the way down if they want to have if you want them to have the ability to reasonably exercise governance rights over their capital then you need disclosure about how that money is being used and that includes political activity well thank you to me this type of disclosure is exactly what investors need to make informed decisions while still maintaining the accessibility and cost effectiveness of index funds however it's also important for investors to be able to verify that the funds are actually voting in line with these principles how can we make disclosures regarding votes that have been taken more informative and digestible for investors well the sec currently has a rule pending that if adopted will help it will improve the detail with which funds have to disclose their votes i'm also in favor for the big index funds the ones that are the focus of this bill to repeat to report more frequently than they're currently required annually is all that's required now they actually do it quarterly on a self enforced basis they choose to do that i think they could do it even more frequently because the proxy season lasts for many months and i think having more real-time disclosure and better disclosure would be the first place to start that is how we have markets work rather than having law direct operations of companies thank you very much

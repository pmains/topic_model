mr president i've come to the floor to speak in support of the postal service reform act which is now pending before the senate so the mission of the u.s postal service since the continental congress appointed benjamin franklin as our nation's first postmaster general in 1775 has been to quote bind the nation together so it sounds kind of like a pretty quaint outdated idea but it's actually serious it's actually statutory 39 usc tasks the postal service with binding our nation together by delivering all of our mail to every american promptly reliably and efficiently no matter where we live the postal service reform act will improve the agency's ability to meet that requirement including in large geographically remote places like alaska where it certainly has a significant impact on our lives we count on the postal service to deliver not only the letters and the magazines and the bills but also necessities of life food medicine business inventory spare parts just about anything you could possibly think of for daily life comes to us in alaska through through the through the mail service the postal service is unique in its universal service obligation and the fact that it delivers both mail and packages to americans in every community whether you live in in key west florida or uttgavig alaska no other federal agency or commercial enterprise does this but it's becoming more and more difficult for the postal service to accomplish the swift completion of their appointed rounds as we recall and believe me i certainly hear about the postal service's decreasing ability to provide its services promptly reliably and efficiently i hear from it when i as soon as i get off the the airplane when i get back home i hear from individuals all over the state telling me the concerns that they have about about mail that is late or perhaps not delivered at all our phone rings in our offices around the state because a small post office has been closed for a period of days because the postmaster has left there's no replacement available i hear about the long lines to pick up mail the long lines to just even buy a stamp in some of our our smaller communities that get that get inundated by tourists in the summer so we we know we hear the strains on our postal service despite postal workers dedication the fact the matter is is the agency is in trouble and it needs the reforms that are contained in the bill that's pending before us while many americans believe the postal service is supported by the american taxpayer that's not the case congress only reimburses it from mailing audio books to the blind and ballots to overseas voters that's that's it the postal service has to meet its payroll and fund retiree health benefits maintain its facilities equipment and vehicles deliver the mail to its destination on time with its own revenue from the sale of postage but their financial instability is making those responsibilities harder and harder to fulfill so we're debating this legislation on the floor today to give the postal service the tools that it needs to be successful and fulfill its essential mission and to hold the usps accountable for improved performance because we all want to see that so this legislation that we will hopefully vote on later today not without controversy reform legislation is never without controversy but that's why i appreciate the opportunity to outline what i think are some of the positive provisions importantly the bill increases the postal services accountability for on-time delivery and requires greater transparency in achieving the goal the bill requires that mail delivery not only be prompt and economical but also consistent and reliable and provided in a manner that increases operational efficiency it requires the usps to develop a new searchable public performance dashboard that's updated weekly so both congress and the public can keep a close eye on whether or not they're living up to our expectations it also requires new regular reporting to the postal regulatory commission the prc and the congress on a variety of indicators including the impacts of price changes and information about reliability efficiency and cost effectiveness postal workforce recruitment and retention and how investments in equipment and infrastructure are impacting service in addition the prc and the postal services inspector general must identify why there are inefficiencies in the collection sorting transportation and delivery of large envelopes newsletters and magazines these findings will be reported to congress and the postmaster general usps would then have six months to put in place prc-approved changes that will fix whatever faults may have been found the bill will also do what many of us have advocated for which is reform the cost of health care for usps employees and their retirees so it provides needed stabilization for the usps health benefits system and hopefully we'll relieve the pressure on their budget and supporting sustainable benefits for employees and retirees this is a key provision the bill also codifies an appropriations writer that has long required it required the usps to integrate the delivery of letters and packages for six day delivery and includes a fair compromise on the attribution of costs for processing and delivering packages one of the one of the i guess top complaints that i hear from alaskans is that the cost of shipping via commercial package services is oftentimes more than the price of the item itself integrated mail delivery of mail and packages saves the us postal service money by allowing it to be more efficient and while ups and fedex charge most alaskans extra for delivering their packages these companies then drop their packages off in in anchorage as that hub and let the postal service take care of what we call last mile delivery well in alaska that often means the last several hundred miles now some are concerned that usps subsidizes the cost of packages with revenue derived from delivering letters but in fact the law that we passed in 2006 the postal accountability and enhancement act forbids the postal service from subsidizing revenue to make sure that it's competing fairly with commercial package carriers current law also requires that package delivery covers all of its attributable costs and well the uh the postal reform uh commission or the postal regulatory commission and the federal courts have examined and upheld the cost attribution methodology the postal service reform act requires yet another look which i think is is probably a fair compromise importantly for alaskans and for me this legislation will not result in cost increases for essential bypass mail program this this is it is what it says it is it's it's essential it is a program that allows rural alaskans who live in communities that are not connected by road which about 80 percent of our communities are in that situation but allows them to receive pallets of food whatever necessary mailable matter that come from stores and anchorage or fairbanks without millions of individual boxes of goods going through postal facilities and that benefits the consumer and it saves the postal service tens of millions of dollars a year in operating costs and untold millions in facility costs while the postal service reform act directs the prc to engage in another review of attributable costs i've been assured by both sides of the homeland security and government affairs committee by the prc and by the postal service that this provision will not impact bypass mail and i certainly intend to hold them to their word another concern that i want to address is over over this bill allowing usps to partner with state local and tribal governments to provide non-postal services now i understand where this comes from but this legislation specifically requires that any non-postal services must cover their own costs without any degradation to regular postal services so in my view if the u.s postal service can help deliver additional services to the american public under these two caveats then they should be allowed to do so so madam president h.r 3076 is a big step forward in helping the postal service achieve financial stability it will enable the agency to continue to bind the nation together with efficient and cost-effective universal service and allow postal employees to achieve the swift completion of their appointed rounds it's supported by a wide array of businesses both large and small all who rely on our postal service it's supported by postal employees by retired federal employees and the postal service itself it has received overwhelming bipartisan support in the house of representatives i certainly hope that it will draw the same here in the senate and i want to commend the chairman of the committee on homeland security and and government services as well as ranking member portman for the good work that they have done in in bringing this bill to us today

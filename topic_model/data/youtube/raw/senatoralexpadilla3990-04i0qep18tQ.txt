thank you mr chair uh hello we speak again um i uh for a second just wanna echo what uh senator lujan and others have mentioned in terms of uplifting and prioritizing the mental health and behavioral health elements of the proposed budget as senator sanders put it well it was an epidemic before the pandemic and it's only been exacerbated since so uh a lot more to work on there and i would ask that we particularly be mindful of how we work in partnership with state local governments particularly those who have also stepped up and committed funding through their budgets let's leverage programs that leverage precious resources to maximum effect and look forward to working with you on that now mental health needs and shortfalls across the country not just in my home state of california is not the only factor but it's a significant factor in the homelessness issues that we're experiencing today coupled with a housing affordability crisis i also want to thank you for the levels of funding for housing in the proposed budget i mean similar to mental and behavioral health the pandemic has underscored the need for affordable safe and supportive housing and over the last two years especially many have lost their housing whether they struggle to keep up with rent payments or mortgage payments despite our assistance programs and these hardships no surprise hit especially hard on communities of color low income families americans with disabilities and other historically marginalized communities now affordable housing is essential infrastructure and i know other centers have talked about housing including senator warner but i just want to underscore that we have an ongoing need for robust uh federal funding for housing programs uh more urgent now than it has ever been i'll call attention to uh my housing for all act that i introduced several weeks ago that builds on proven solutions that have been developed at a state and local level effective in terms of addressing housing but with respect to unique challenges and opportunities and communities across my state and you can apply that to communities across the country so building on proving successful models through these investments i think is a smart way to go so in lieu of asking you a question on that i just wanted to highlight uh and underscore my appreciation for that now a uh a question not unique to california but probably disproportionately to the west an issue of wildfires and disaster preparedness as we've spoken on a couple of occasions california and across the west we continue to see how the climate crisis is leading to more frequent and more severe wildfires and although we've made progress in recent years and increasing funding levels for federal land management agencies americans living in the west still need more support to truly address the growing problem and that's both financial resources as well as personnel you know do we like to try to prevent or mitigate the impact of wildfires i can't help but notice that from 2019 to 2021 the u.s forest service which is the federal government's primary wildland fire agency saw its firefighter ranks drop by more than 20 percent in california to loss of a thousand employees so i was pleased to see the budget includes a 1.8 billion for the forest service in the department of interior to strengthen our federal firefighting workforce increase capacity and improve firefighter compensation it's long overdue but we know that's just a drop in the bucket so director young can you discuss how these funds will address the firefighter firefighter workforce shortage and help chip away at the huge backlog of hazardous fuel reduction and post-fire landscape rehabilitation projects um and i'd also like to point out the 1.8 billion is a 560 million dollar increase as you say it's a start it's not a finish we also are upholding the president's commitment to make sure firefighters make a minimum wage of 15 dollars we think that will also help with recruitment and i know this is an issue of importance to senator merkley who's not here but one thing we also support is national guard being used in a lot of in a lot of these areas we know that recruitment will take a long time to build up so our national guard presence has been a life saver literally for a lot of communities so we we remain committed um to doing that as well thank you very much and uh in closing mr chair i know the topic of uh inflation and interest rates back in the 70s and 80s came up earlier in the hearing i'd just like to note for the record that from 1969 to 1974 there was a republican president from 1974 to 1977 there was a republican president president from 77 to 81 yes it was a democratic president and from 81 to 89 there was a republican president so uh happy to have these debates about the economy and interest rates

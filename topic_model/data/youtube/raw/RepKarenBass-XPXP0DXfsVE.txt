that's what that's right now Congress would thanks for taking the time what do you think well I think it was a very powerful day you know I did hear their testimony judiciary judiciary Democratic congresswoman Karen bats with us right now Congress would thanks for taking the time what do you think well I think it was a very powerful day you know I did hear their testimony a couple of weeks ago but I thought it was very important that the American people hear directly from them and that's what happened today you know you've heard requests on the part of your Republican colleagues who want at least some of their witness list called including the whistleblower him or herself what do you think well I think it would be completely inappropriate to call the whistleblower I mean if we would do something like that then you should just throw out the old concept of protecting people who can come forward to point out wrongdoing in the government so I think it would be a terrible precedent and I do believe that our side is willing to entertain their witnesses but I do think that they need to bring forward witnesses that makes sense so I know that they weren't all you know cast aside all right when you say they all were cast aside David they one hunter Biden I guess that doesn't look likely but among that that crowd any that you see could be entertain maybe it suit is next week well I haven't seen specifically I hope that they do put someone forward that makes a lot of sense but you know my Republican colleagues I think are in a bind because they have difficulty arguing the substance the the content and also the these witnesses are people who've had exemplary lives their absolute Patriots and for them to come forward really risked a lot and so I I was disappointed that in the beginning that the ranking member maligned the two witnesses who came forward and you know referred to him in the negative way that he did so I'm just hoping that they will decide that this is a very situation very serious situation for our country and not minimizing some cars early on the process are you leaning toward impeaching yourself well I do think it's important to keep an open mind but to be honest with you I think the things that have happened this to me this is different than the mullah report the mother report I thought was very very serious but the mother report was about the past this is about the upcoming election and the idea that the president would intervene or attempt to intervene in the upcoming election that's a completely different ballgame you might know Neil I wasn't one of those that had my name on the list calling for the impeachment inquiry until this happened because of the fact that it's happening right now that's what moved me over to say we absolutely need to do the employment congresswoman thank you very much for that I know you're in between both so we do appreciate it well thanks for having me on

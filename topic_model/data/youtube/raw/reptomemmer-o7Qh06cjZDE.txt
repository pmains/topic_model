questions thank you chairman greene and again thank you to our witnesses for your time in perspectives today as we examine the implications of a cashless economy while some cities in some states have enacted laws that require businesses to accept cash there are also businesses that have experimented with a cashless model there's no one-size-fits-all solution to payment options of course and cash is certainly essential to democracy in an open and free society that said professors wiki i want to dive into the reasons of business i might not want to accept cash and i'll ask several questions i'd appreciate as quick a responses as you can give to each first retailers have to pay employees to account for cash in the register and at the back of the store count the drawer nightly package it up and either hire a courier or send an employee to transport it to a bank and then they have to pay fees for processing and handling did i leave anything out professor um i think that pretty much covers all of it it's a very labor-intensive uh way to do things and there's also some risk that's associated with handling all that cash the business can be exposed to theft and the employees can be exposed to danger in the form of uh of robberies professors wiki are there costs associated with these types of risks absolutely uh um uh mr emery uh there are security costs there are the cost of hiring armored cars there's the cost of installing faults and safes um and as you said there's the cost of there's the risk to employees who work on the front lines who have a lot of cash on hand so professor is it fair to say that a federal requirement to accept cash is effectively a tax on any business that might otherwise prefer to go cashless absolutely yes businesses that stop accepting cash might boost their bottom line by reducing overhead costs saving time and creating some operational efficiencies no doubt but professor zwicky do you agree that for some small businesses that may be struggling during the ongoing pandemic those savings might actually be the difference between staying open versus going out of business i think that's exactly right and i think one of the points here is that um legacy businesses have already incurred a lot of these costs surveillance you know security systems safes all these sorts of things new businesses however they're completely unnecessary in many cases for a lot of these businesses and so it's just a cost it's a tax imposed on them by incumbents that block small businesses blocks new entrants of uh new businesses and so could really make the difference for many of these businesses well thank you i i appreciate your perspective uh technology and payments innovation provides more convenience and affordability for the consumer certainly now the privacy implications of a cashless economy however cannot be emphasized enough as far as i'm concerned so as we grapple with preserving privacy and transitioning to a digital economy i believe we must look to technology solutions in payments that preserve the privacy elements of cash and again i said at the beginning of this hearing i'll say it again stable coins and decentralized technology innovations uh are the first things that come to my mind is these are solutions that are actually open permissionless and private uh thank you again uh mr chair and all the witnesses for your time uh chair i yield back the remainder of my time uh just years back the chair now recognizes the chair of the housing subcommittee for five minutes mr cleaver for your questions

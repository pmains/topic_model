so I mentioned to you in our brief conversation before I came up to the podium here mr. president oh one of the things I I try to do every year every month or so has come to the floor usually when things are going slower is not a lot a lot going on on the floor and just to talk about some of the folks who work for us to serve our country in the Department of Homeland Security early this week is as you may recall the an outfit called the partnership for public service a released their annual report in which they ranked the best places in which to work and the federal government and the report is based on surveys that are conducted by literally by hundreds of thousands of federal law employees and this year it showed an increase in overall employee morale for the first time I guess in four or five years that's good news despite the progress that appears to have been made in a number of federal agencies not all but many components of the Department of Homeland Security continue to not all components but many components continue to struggle the Department of Homeland Security to make their employees feel good about their work and what they do for the rest of us I know that the Secretary of the Department jeh Johnson and his team have taken the number of significant steps to make the department a better place to work for current and future employees they work to a fair amount of outreach and I get input from from their employees as to what needs to be done to enable them to feel better about the work for greater job satisfaction want to come to work want to work hard and I would just say here today that the Congress those of us who serve in the Senate in the house also have a responsibility to help improve morale not just the department of homeland security but at the federal government that writ large considering the fact that we began 2015 mr. president with a fight in this body right here over whether or not we should even fund the department I don't believe that those who serve in the Senate or the house are doing all that we can do I don't know that we're doing part well and that is why I have come down to the Senate floor as i said earlier on a number of occasions throughout the year to highlight some of the extraordinary work every day by the dedicated men and women at the Department of Homeland Security today I rise to recognize no one individual you say pick on one or two people who just done extraordinary things with their lives but today I'm going to focus on a whole team of people who do important work every day to defend our nation from the growing and evolving threat our country faces in cyberspace it seems like we don't go a week without hearing about another major preach at a business or a government agency we are on your unrelenting attack from all over the world some cases from sovereign nations other cases from criminal organizations other cases just from from pranksters but these past few a few years we seen major attacks on the office of personnel management on great many banks other businesses even the email of the director of Central Intelligence Agency these attacks make clear that the threat we face online are complex and will be struggling with how to deal with them unfortunately for the foreseeable future fortunately here in Congress we've been making some progress combating these cyber threats through legislation last year we passed cybersecurity legislation for bills in fact out of the Committee on Homeland Security governmental affairs for bills they were aimed at strengthening the Department of Homeland Security's ability to perform their cybersecurity mission and those Mungo's bills was one to update how our government protects its own networks this bill included language clarifying the role that the department plays in overseeing and enhancing security and other agencies to other bills gave the department some of the tools it needs to strengthen its cyber security workforce and just last month the Department of Homeland Security announced it would hire up to 1,000 new cybersecurity employees in the next six months using the new authorities that given them we also passed the legislation that codified the cyber ops center at the department it's called the national cybersecurity and communications integration Center affectionately known as the in kick and our legislation which centered a former senator dr. Tom Coburn and I co-authored supported by many in our committee and outside of our committee the syllabus bill gave the the end kick the strong legal foundation that it needs that is lacked in order to do their job engage with the private sector in a joint effort to better secure critical cyber networks well I think we've made real progress on cybersecurity legislation this year as well and I think may be poised to do even more I'd like to use a football analogy you know your team we had a flip of the coin somebody receives somebody kicks the ball off and receiving a team takes the ball maybe deep in their own territory and their own territory and they marched down the field across the 50 yard line and the other teams territory and when they get into the 20 yard line then moving on the other team's goal line they would say that they when they're inside of 20 yard line there in the red zone in the red zone and in terms of our march on cybersecurity legislation here in the Senate in the the house thanks the good work of the the Intel committee here and they decided the Homeland Security Committee as well we're not just in the red zone we're inside the 10 yard line and it is first down and goal to go unfortunately the clock is running out and so we don't have forever to get the job done but the we do if we're smart and then don't give up we can have a real success for for the American people and strengthening our cyber workforce in cyber work defenses and in a real in a real way I am a legislation that that we have passed here this this fall is called cybersecurity information sharing and represents a collaboration on a number of cybersecurity issues in that bill the Department of Homeland Security plays a central role as the interface between industry and the government the bill also includes four visions to enhance a cybersecurity program at the Department of Homeland Security known as Einstein which uses classified threat intelligence to protect all of our civilian agencies in I mention all this legislation to show the critical role or go underline the critical well that the Department of Homeland Security plays in cyber security for our nation and at the center of the department's cyber security operation is the United States computer emergency readiness team which is also known as us-cert CRT and to my left is a picture of our president and the hands would follow these talking to there is a fella named jay johnson who is the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security role he's filled for I think close to two years now and doing I think a splendid job with the great support of volley Marcus oozes deputy secretary there and a couple hundred thousand people are committed to defending our homeland but this is a picture of President addressing along with secretary Johnson addressing the employees at us cert I think was taken earlier this year and again the US sir tis the main operational team within the the the in kick the Nash for the computer the US computer emergency readiness team there's the the operational team within the the in tickets it's itself what do they do well they pull information and they share that information throughout the federal government the the us-cert within the end kirk also shares the information with our partners in the private sector across the country and with our allies around the world it's an important job it's not a job you do for like five days a week eight hours a day it's a 24 hour a week 24 hour a day 7 day a week operation and these men and women work to keep us ahead about actors who are trying to steal our personal information trying to really harm our economy there in some cases plotting to damage our critical infrastructure like our to grid like our financial systems like our communication systems us-cert was established 12 years ago dozen years ago as the Department of Homeland Security was first being stood up and the mission of the US sir tis I think a simple ways to make the Internet is safer place for everyone by helping to improve cybersecurity across the country I'll say that again the mission of the US sir tis very simple and it's to make a not easy but simple to say to make the Internet is safer place for everyone by helping to improve cybersecurity across our country and to do this us-cert operates a wide variety of programs these programs include several information sharing and collaboration programs Incident Response Teams that provide on-site assistance to attack victims programs like the einstein intrusion detection and prevention system to protect the federal agencies education and awareness programs and deeply technical forensic analysis us-cert partners with a wide variety of organizations among them a partner with power plants until e-utilities they partner with the financial institutions they partner with software companies with researchers they partner with cert teams in other countries and other cyber operator operation centers like those over at the NSA National Security Agency and that the FBI as well when a major attack occurs in the federal government or the private sector the men and women at us-cert mobilized to travel literally to travel to the the victims location they help mitigate the attack they help to strengthen the victims cyber systems and then they communicate with their partners so that everyone everyone can secure their systems against similar attacks we learn from a bad experience and hopefully can help reduce the likelihood that someone else will suffer a similar fate earlier this year when the the office of personal management discovered a data breach affecting personnel belonging to millions of federal employees they call the the in kick they asked for the the end kicks team of experts and us-cert was deployed to play a central role in first of all investigating the attack but also in responding to that attack for the next of four months a team worked literally around the clock around the clock at OPM to assess into a monitor federal networks and to develop new protections against this type of intrusion that OPM had experienced now once the u.s. certain realized that other federal agencies are also vulnerable to this kind of breach they email immediately shared the indicators of the attack with network analyst across the federal government this allowed other federal agencies to scan their systems and to make sure that they had not been compromised by the same hacker and to be on alert for that hackers attack because of the scale and impact of the OPM breach which I think actually ended up affecting more than 20 million people the the u.s. cert team work long hours to make sure that they could provide guidance to federal agencies as quickly as possible so that they could better protect their networks from similar attacks and prevent the attacker from using the information they obtained against us the work the work Lacerte not only strengthened the OPM the office of personal management cyber security posture but it also bolstered cyber security across our entire federal government us-cert and all the cyber warriors at the end kick worked tirelessly every day throughout think and do out and ovate our cyber enemies the legislation we enacted last year and the bill we are working hard to send the president this year with great bipartisan support here in the Senate and in the house as well without legislation what's now puts the Department of Homeland Security in the spotlight and entrust them with ever greater responsibilities for the years to come we in Congress recognize the critical role that the US sir plays in strengthening our nation's cybersecurity we must continue to support these hard working man and women in their message so mr. president I would I just close by telling the story I've told this story before but it's a good one in it it's I think personally germain des are we talking about here today a couple of years ago I was listening to the radio station on my way to the train station in della early morning and I was catching the NPR news right at 7am as I made my way to the the train station in Wilmington and the other news that morning I gave a report about international surveyor was taken where they asked of people in different countries here in other countries as well but they ask them is it what is there about your work that you like what about your work that makes you like your job or not like your job and that some of the people who were asked to say well the thing that I like about my job I like getting paid hey there the not that they're in it for the money but they like getting paid so other people said the thing that they like about their job is they like I've got vacations some people said they have they had health care some people said they they like the folks that they work with other people say well they like the environment by a beautiful place like this and in which they they work but the thing that most people said that they liked to made them like their job really to two things one they knew that to work they were doing was important and two they felt like they were making progress think about that they knew the work that they were doing was important and they felt like they're making progress well it's probably nobody in our country at least working within the federal government who does that work more important than the folks at the Department of Homeland Security and this body this the Senate the house and the Senate have worked in recent years to strengthen the ability of the department of homeland security including via the US cert team to be able to do their job even better and my hope is the years to come as we hear these annual reports on best places to work within the federal government that we're going to find that the Department on security that includes the end kick that includes us-cert well one more will be saying you know I I like working here and because I know the work that I'm doing is important and that we feel like we're making progress I would just say to everyone at a US sir thank you for all the good d do for us thank you for your service to this country and to each of you when you wish you happy holidays Merry Christmas and we'd also say here's hoping that we're all have a more peaceful peaceful new year I think the American people are ready for that I know the presiding officer is and so online and with that Madam President I will note the absence of a quorum thank you

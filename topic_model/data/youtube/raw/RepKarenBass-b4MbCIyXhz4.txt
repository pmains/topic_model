good morning everyone I would like to begin the briefing and let me just say a few words to open our welcome everyone I especially want to welcome our witnesses with their time to come here today so I'm traveling very far and we're glad that they were actually able to make it and members of the broader DC community that are here this is a a briefing of the Congressional Black Caucus it's Task Force on Foreign Affairs and Homeland Security I want to welcome my colleagues here first of all the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus Cedric Richmond who is doing this today Terri Sewell who is a member of the Ways and Means Committee was also a member of the house intelligence community and then Marcia fudge who is right there former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus so once again I want to welcome everyone to this briefing that is a critically important from all of our perspectives just a little bit of background in terms of how we got here today last August when many people in the country and in the Congressional Black Caucus learned of the no that was leaked out of the FBI that was called black identity extremists likely motivated to attack law enforcement officers when we read that document to me personally it had a chilling effect now it reminded me of the past if he might even in the 70s so he invited me of the kotel program and when I thought about the activists around the country been involved in protesting bondrock officer-involved shootings thinking that black lives matter thinking of a whole new generation of activists it had an especially chilling effect because I felt like in the middle like that was distributed to law enforcement around the country then who's to say they did a lot of cities a lot of talents that the next time there was a officer and are shooting their protests then who's to say that they would say that all the protesters were black identity extremes and so we set out in the Congressional Black Caucus under the leadership of our Chairman we had a meeting with the FBI director ray and we asked him about this and we asked him where this concept came from and that's one of the issues that we want to get at today were even qualifies as a black identity extremists are there groups that are likely to attack law enforcement officers I sit on the Judiciary Committee along with the chairman and I'm just been joined by paint Johnson from Georgia we sit on the Judiciary Committee and on that committee we questions sessions ray Rosen seen all asking the same question and us receiving no answers so hopefully our panelists today will give us an opportunity to learn where this concept might have originated what its potential is and offer some recommendations to us for how we might not be able to combat it so my colleagues would like to say a few words and then he will jump right in let me just thank you for coming and I will tell you that I'm sure that they were taking my problems that I protest police silence and I'm concerned about community police relations and according to me this squad FBI analysis our services definitional black identity extremes and I think that what they did was to play to confuse intentionally or unintentionally whole bunch of unconnected things to get black identity extremes if their concern about police second thing we have here is around the field if someone will be talking about silences we wouldn't be talking about the middle category of black identity extremes so I just want to thank you all for coming because this is important and this is something that you will not let go without some checks on it because the people that out there the foot soldiers in any of deserve to be protected and identified in such a careless way and I'm not worried about the New Orleans Police Department I'm worried about a Barney Fife who got this memo that after the next shooting in a little town that everybody that comes in the protesting poses a threat of bodily form to police officers this dangerous reckless and I think we should do something about it so I think representative bass for putting this together today so thank you all comments about chairman into thank Karen bass as well as the CDC task force for organizing today's hearing we welcome all of the panelists here I also want because we so wouldn't work as you have made it to this point your body of work speaks to you and I think that's why you're here today oh thank you for that I'll make the observation that the criminal justice system in America has had a special attraction for african-americans ever since slavery Jim Crow you know pointing to the civil rights movement to today the feasting on African Americans unabated and so we can't look at this FBI report on so-called black identity extremism as if is an anomaly it's actually to be viewed as a precursor and it's African Americans move away from the consumerism of the reflection and awareness and activism then we have this report that then leads me to conclude that you take a few isolated incident six of them and put it together about how book called black identity extremism and spending sovereign citizen with sovereign citizen movement ruining a morphism come together to produce no basis for and but yet this report is released and people are act on it thank you very much we've been joined by behind Watson Coleman from New Jersey and I'm gonna move to introduce our witnesses and Danny took this five minutes with mr. questions dr. Earl Suthers of the former FBI SWAT and undercover Special Agent he is currently the director of Safe Communities Institute and director of homegrown violent extremist Studies at the price school public policy at the University of California Mike German is also undercover FBI special agent is currently a fellow can't a fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice liberty and national security at New York University Law School you mentioned in your comments nada Jaffe is a human rights and criminal defense attorney and also is a vice chairperson of the black Alliance for justice immigration and an adjunct professor in the pan-african Studies department of the California State University of Los Angeles thank you very much for coming this morning that says I'm sorry bass you see members of the Congressional Black Caucus thank the opportunity provided with statement the purpose is to offer insight into current landscape of domestic terrorism escalates the officer 2017 black identity extremist like me motivated Department law enforcement officers as a former citizen chief of police and FBI circulated out by taking the brain middle of law enforcement for their sacrifice of dedication as they protect their community every day they accept the reality of the beings that face including the possibility lose their lives and performance of their duties today the rise and finally humans of the United States doesn't care law enforcement officers and attacks have been carried out by a diverse collection of adversaries it sounded array needed by the elements even as this is the case however the FBI's assessment that black I didn't extremism with a threat last mirror yes uh stated that quote the FBI excessive is very likely black pathetic streamers reality perception of police brutality against African Americans spurred an increase in premeditated retaliatory lethal violence along culture will very likely serve as justification for such violence by other students occurs when individuals or groups openly express the ideological beliefs whose violence or cause for violence while there are groups whose ideology between principles of racially biased rates paper black supremacy and or separatist ideologies the cases excitement in the FBI assessment do not present evidence of racist ideology but instead presented consistent evidence of anti-government sentiments in as much as the FBI excesses that is very likely viu suspects acted in retaliation will proceed police mentality this further illustrates the attackers likely targeted police officers because they were representatives of the government and not due to their skin thickness a conclusion reinforced on the fact that officers who were killed or of a variety of ethnicities it should be noted that the FBI semester of the program identifies nine to wife scrum see Latin identity militia sovereign citizens anarchists proportion animal rights and primal rights the Puerto Rican naturalist consider I was black man thirty woman is weekly define while the ledges constant category of classes specific organizational groups with a defined message but I've had an issuance of the final or broader as such this categorization renders an individual identity identity more important than their ideology meaning violence committed by any african-american could be defined as laugh at their extremism the FBI assessment offers insufficient empirical data to support the alleged likelihood of so-called BIV inherits and ignore statistics as they relate often filled by extremists two data points in particular instructor businesses our first black Naturals in other levels did not kill any police officer in that 2017 me by white supremacist and anti-government extremist fatally attacked a police officer and two corrections officers second and then defamation League analysis of shops higher Ed's between law enforcement and homegrown extremists between the year 2009 2016 revealed there were 77 shots fired industry attributed to numerous extreme of schools black nationalist attack of his time for two percent of those incidents while the extreme right-wing premises and governorships accounted for eighty three percent further exacerbating the short from use the FBI assessment by the inequities of the six incidents offered in a section for suspects week which is very likely to lead to violent targeting of law enforcement upon closer examination each of these states and staffs accurately demonstrate recruited fine the alleged a nexus between bie ideology and answer their attackers left unnamed in the accessible subsequently easily I've had a well pocket litter was deemed actual intelligence two subjects were involved in an incident instead of one as reported in one case at least the term is called impairment may have been the factor instead of an extremist ideology phonological motivation the omission of failure to properly document sources organizations and individuals in an assessment such as this should be cause for concern local law enforcement has the best thing but impulsive domestic threats in our communities police see the many challenges we face every day and so they're used by extremists trends are valuable and informed in that regard key findings in the law enforcement assessment of this violence to express that in 2015 of 382 blonde personalities in the United States found law enforcement officers quote consider anti-government violent students to be the most severe threat of political violence they day affects homeland security and public safety strategy rooted in facts appropriate policies prophecies and technologies are the foundations of security those elements are most effective when informed by research and empirical data if we are to enhancement from morality responsibility and community integrity with the intended outcome facilitating community-based efforts to identify and explore solutions to the threat of extremism it begins of removing policies that cultivate unity animosity and so alienation [Music] [Music] [Music] and one of the sort of protective layers is that the FBI cannot investigate use work activities solely related to your person under drive make that sole back your test is extremely low and even if you go back to the traditional definition of racial profiling driving law why that's too fast okay so but we look at this report that he's got going clockwise investigating all this happen nah keep packing assessment is reported such an actual investigation of person or organization they require according to the Attorney General a gong to give a fire no particular factual predicate so there needs to be no investigation area navigate this is an extremely low threshold for the FBI started messaging and my concern is [Music] [Music] [Music] the identification is dangerous to black activists and organizers at serious risk of having our fundamental constitutional rights violated and our movies and live without the threat of constant evidence the FBI essentially and erroneously asserts that black activists again accurate positioning murders of black people by my folks are motivated by a dangerous experience that the FBI has defined that the black identity at any time the FBI further falsely claims that the black identity experiments are creating an atmosphere that has led the wanton murder a law enforcement officer and that the creation of this atmosphere is a threat to national security and therefore if you are protester you're an activist of the black person seeking honest issues you become in its essence of domestic terror and what you define if that domestic terrorist and my colleagues have expressed now everything goes now your Monica's now the track mavin jail now it's available and in some cases you can lose your life this doesn't just harken back to Cornell come on Sarah and we know what happened when all this survey little weasel matter now standards are being purposely in the way that Graham has pointed out black activists and organizers have already in the targets of harassment criminalization and even death the FBI's CIT classification gives the FBI a justification to take a more open and actually indeed role in a surveillance and intimidation of black activists and organizers we were looking at before at a local working with the FBI above the local with the women from the bloggers which partly with New York Police Department now it's going to be the FBI now going to be federal agents that are going to be taking that role they have a kind of survey in this historic tool that can attack black activists and organizers in more frightening and pernicious ways the federal government survey capacity is astounding you know we just found out that the sly what is hot everybody is up for activists and organizers who cookies computers in the try this one we keep swipe a FBI agents and they're paid by the FBI so they're fixing the computer and download off of it so this corporate collusion whether it be Facebook whether the airline whether it be Y also put black activists and organizers and increased danger and speaks about a student participation and invasive reach of the FBI surveillance tools so therefore not surprising that black activists and organizers report evidence of increased governmental interference with their cell and home phones and blows the internet account will being watched followed by law enforcement and marked and unmarked cars that protest at community events and even centers and at our homes where being photographed by control we don't know who are driving cars of government workers we have been threatened to bodily harm learning with death an anonymous call in May out in social media folks we are openly being called terrorists by law enforcement police chiefs at public meeting mark against a further harassment and worse by law enforcement and racist white supremacist civilians who something like this via a new classification and yes take it to town in terms of supporting their violent efforts against black protesters the first EIU prosecution had already begun and the tactics used by the FBI and the part [Music] this template reveals the malicious and constitutionally viable to the nature and intents of the be items my protection principal Daniel is being prosecuted by the Department of Justice in federal court in battle sector right now where the federal client is only conducting a firearm even though he possess the weapons according to the open carry state of Texas many lives it's clearer than the written word of the investigators and the US Attorney General prosecuting this case but the Department of Justice did not prosecute Mary Sue Daniels because we possess weapons they're prosecuting them because of his political views and it's time to turn particular destruction of both views on Facebook News which they with the legacy described as black identity experiment while there's no time for evidence that black activists and organizers are engaging in violence against police officers or in civilian there's ample evidence some white nationalists white supremacist and all wrong groups engaging in violence in their efforts to accomplish their political goal of making America white again please look at appear to community in Richmond right when it's cowboy elected by elected official and it's been pretty council meeting need armed with weapon put your calls pepper spray and you can done by the organizers and event offend me without facing the criminalization safe on nonviolent activists and protesters pit bull reporting to us that this is a the circus enacted which sports camp to even be okay for a while every single that required Rocco testing so this tells me not to rip the tactics and the charges are paper-thin I often wonder why actual hate groups are attack arrested and pursued the same way we are then I'm yellow there right and at the target central in English its usual here to be a part of the robot hate group and illegal to organize against them the man must be made that the FBI are attract women out of the atom classification and and it's treacherous and unconstitutional effort to suppress and perfectly black activism and organizing thank you very much I want to thank all of the witnesses for their testimony and now we will go to questions from the members on the panel here but let me just say that we've been joined by the ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee City Council we've been joined by a few Jefferies from New York who's also a visionary [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I love this one question then sent with an observation but the ranking under Homeland Security joined me in the letter of just yesterday because we're ready to call was have been Austin domestic terrorism and the question is whether it's based on who the victim is for our food to proceed perpetrator is so my stick my customer bed similar to Turtles on one of the next things we can do to combat it and I think the disc office and you see the hitches with so many members here that we want to make sure that we protect people who on how we're trying to protect us and what is very alarming is that in our meetings with the FBI either they didn't know autism admit that all of these things were going on and that's why I'm glad you brought up the real-life examples in the world we can find more examples we need because we're going to ask about each and every example that we have because the testimony was not getting the information from people about what's been happening to them do they feel they surveyed and they're being investigated people are afraid they're afraid to even think about that when they log onto the computer and they got a notice from Google say your computer's access their captain at that side computer in Virginia and they're like what I live in LA and I'm getting my information whimsically and they don't want to talk about it because they feel like if they speak it then the worst will come right and so we are working hard to get that information we're hoping to be able to don't nationally and do that but the key to also that help that we could get is for members to make it clear that hey we want this information and better than the fact is then in LA that helps a lot before I wrote to uh mr. Johnson let me just say that I think one of the differences maybe between the seventies and now it's a problem is that there was nobody to pop me like a sister you couldn't really come forward you just have to accept the harassment quietly and hope that you survived it but to me I think that the best way to protect people and the single new generation of activists is to shine the light of day on this it's a talk about it's a bringing forward because I think some of the things that happen to many of us in the seventies it would be hard to happen now if the public was aware of it representative Jensen thank you I would like to inquire black I think the extremists likely motivated Department law enforcement officers as a publication date of August 3rd 2017 is this a report that can be attributed to the chocolate was it any study that began prior to the administration I don't know the answer that question certainly isn't language that the FBI you used prior to that with black pepper disappear which also was not accurately right there there are really a lot of blacks out there they identify definitely black deputies define it if you're black and folk that's me we're gonna love you into a category and they're fine fine no problem that covers it all so I don't know I don't know that yeah I don't know how deep down I can't change but I will say that the railroad would say I'm a 27 to the FBI published an assessment on white roses experience those specific threats of violence but it severely undercounts the violence which is an object with the vision why they're amplify one threat and luckily like before Charlotte yes okay thank you this document is law enforcement sensitive what does that mean have access to it and how was this how did this end up in the public domain law enforcement sensitive means that it goes out toxic too long fortunately not publicly available that you cannot in a redacted format put in one that local law clerks can look at it with me that some say don't have security clearances so this doctor recovery week at some point on that's how it got out and what's interesting is that even though these law enforcement sensitive footnotes throughout the report they're heavily redacted and don't identify sources people organizations that they specifically refer to throughout the entire report and these are public sources that they finna directly as a matter of fact I have graduate students go back and look at these incidents and dates that are cited in the report make very easily found out who was involved how many people what their names were they were allegedly attached to so are you saying that these six it depends we record or inaccurate or inaccurately in the report yes there's certainly an accident or prey and I'll just say it's a cover looking at each individual one clearly each one so it seems to point to anti-government sentiment we've got incidents here where they talk about groups that they fail to identify they loosely talk about how the individual active in furtherance of a racist racial supremacy movement which is not identify this they would healing could refer to the more Sun its temple and I can tell you that it works like simple he not use those publicly just about anything activities to any government or while we've seen some sovereigns who have to be active early associated with their that's TV they disassociate themselves of that so they publicly announce them and they use that as any that's connection here throughout the report what's really interesting is how as they talked about it a couple pieces in individual or individual reportedly going back to do the research we found those people work look at it they have no connectivity to a racially supremacist or is it more visible dated analogy well it reported itself says or admits that it's been rare or before the Pope the past twenty years black identity extremist violence the report says that it's been rare over the last twenty years that being the case when you believe that we are now seeing this report that postulates that increased violence is likely why are we getting this with [Music] spitting theme from the black sorted3 and some kind of care organization and all of the organization connected and part of them the black lives in the same way and that was part of the campaign promises today we're going to stop saying we're going to deal with these terrorists that are protesting against them anything that this report is just right in line with that just quickly thank you are you saying then they don't believe that the rise of the black lives matter movement is a causal is a causal factor in the release of this report thank you very much and thank you for bringing us together then thank you for your testimony it's scary so I think many people would be FBI you gives because I'm swooping out advancing in justices in any one of us here could be and so while we have some very specific definitions of white extremist groups we don't really have that with the exception of is black lives matter identified one of these experienced groups or they just sort of associated with the destruction associated with the discussion may have expected sanity let that mean that the call correctly the answer is always said oh we're not sure we gotta look into what we gotta talk back but we know so this is very kind of especially because I served under Representative Thompson's leadership upon Homeland Security and forever and ever and ever we have been trying to get this to me directive nice that our threats come from the fund this is warden sort of any other group including so home so call jihadist feed on Islamic so this is a very timely before I guess two questions number one is how we get to know what this with the intelligence communities do as a process to correct the misinformation are they have regarding groups if they found that there were not accurate about because we'd like to introduce that to the FBI and it seems to me that justifying why it's done this report and hold it accountable and I guess the third thing is we very much need to have them give us the information upon which they make these decisions that seem to be based upon no real evidence so I'd like to ask you with German I guess about the process how do you correct me and I'll give communities corrected how did this to me ever forty withdrawing saying that reporting information please remove that table from from your system the FBI doesn't have system like that and it works once it goes out the table at the law courts that it's in the ether and we've seen similar reports that's coming out of the elements using centers all across this country and of course there the oversight is even less so you know one of the things that I think would be very important to those fusion center they're represented and make sure they're not going to dick because I've already seen this this a great artist lexicon and once they start spreading among torches that's where you're going to see the rap don't fear that's created by this dirty actual actually thank you very much you know people put Sierra you know to a lot of us this is harassment 2.0 some of us live in the sixties and in the Congress that our FBI file and so those activities that we were involved in and John personable comma students was actually identify had somehow a communist inspired subversive activities well you know I was just a city boy if I had a figured out that I was just like everybody else what my government attached another league well here we are fast-forward using another label and the dissemination of that document to a five-member Police Department and because is what is the alternative [Music] so this dr. Massoud 18,000 block works with agencies in the United States some of whom have intelligence capacity so making a document that speaks to the issue of [Music] tourism they're giving this up to Hampi with regards to people that they might come in contact with and possibly the team prosecute surveil slide so this is quite different than the seating of be on the lookout for someone this is about national security so when it goes to the police departments it's quite serious and you can decide with the Department of Sippi they've got this management briefed on it and when approximate they probably are going to go through a mental checklist thing the Zipit who accepts what we've got to get yeah it does now that crime has been elevated to something it turns over homeland with national security but the other thing is I could be targeted because I fit a description of quote a potential black identity extremist so without even committing a crime I could just get stopped the cost of my hairstyle with my dress and I think that's the danger but pushing a doctor that follow like this is the unintended consequences all intended consequence [Music] over the last few years they were white supremacist rallies in Sacramento Anaheim and completing each win and in Charlottesville where you didn't see this night leasing that exhaust and you saw here that the j-20 Federation where hundreds of people are being arrested so [Music] I can serve up places like Los Angeles which is what New York where we do have that increased surveillance capability intelligence capability and so with Ellie [Music] [Music] [Music] this ability of the MPI so you know as as legislative I know I'm torn about okay is all incredible in Zoe it point their issue I think about what would horn believe it did law enforcement in this country and we not know there's a culture that we need to address in law enforcement it would it be after we start somewhere [Music] policing is that what if we start as legislators to start addressing what leads to shift is the culture of law enforcement through this powerful something I would start with you a lady commute driver trying to give us some guys comforted Thank You members attorneys that report should be seriously like that as if the dermis is possible the FBI and Slagel I never thought I'd be a point in my life work yet because it's very unfortunate but I would say we've got some other issues here the portilex bill we had the United right movement sharing photographs and identification of people I worked with David Protess with law enforcement with hosts ability can't be arrested in our own backyard Nana in LA we have a booth they are they are very plain they are in town post volleyball players and servers and they travel they've been in Charlotte so they decrement we've been all over their country they are so bold that I'm swimming show a video about a month ago to a class from barrage mode movement and they had any lesson two weeks without a new video these are people who have other line and yet they're able to travel across the country go to protest okay putting videotapes to the people they eat I mean this isn't some very secretive group that nobody can sponsor I have to track them for my office with Brendan so so certainly why big long person isn't following up the way they are so aggressively prosecuted people well in Nice Arkansas last week was beaten to death in charge of this power arc so that they can do some of this over thank you may be using Francisco Police Department through the Joint Terrorism Task Force over issues about their without exactly which also included their participation and so I think making sure that our state and local representatives have to information so that they can do the oversight okay thank you so very much for this question but the chances you take these big monetary modified tape so when they're putting these videos up there not just putting him up for people to watch they get so much money for hits so they actually have commodified hate hateful eyes they turn down for something like a vending machine that you can get you know they made a vending machine video that's the thing that but people aren't paying to watch this and the fact that there's that I use every page oh that was the fact that they can get paid for it is pretty amazing but I wanted to say when you're talking about that kind of reforms and what can be done that other advocates where the speech long that there needs to be conversations not just with law enforcement the law enforcement is not nothing about the summation law enforcement is trying to do a certain way as a culture they train themselves so that perpetuates the culture it's hard I'm an attorney it's hard for me to think outside of my break sometimes I can work on that and how I get out of that box it's like not the people the people who are most effective need to be the people that voices that are the loudest and we're giving the greatest platform and if you ask the people who are most effective black folks that are in our communities black trans people black people that are immigrants for example you talk about African Americans but the police doctors focus on African Americans we know that and we've known that right in terms of who's been killed including flat people from the continent of Africa such as myself it includes black people in the Caribbean so it's blackness that is we and the anti blackness that is the motivation for this behavior but what are people talking about one of the most effective they're saying be built derives or please which means nothing having all these police officers that have been recruited by it from the military where they have engaged in whatever they engaged in in Iraq and Afghanistan and they come here to give them the same weapons in San Bernardino we had a helicopter officer who literally stopped tried to stop a car key personnel and don't drive weapons together they're talking about eat lunch let's take some of this money most cities have 51 percent of their budget seems like they calculate it to a fee that they are putting into law enforcement the housing situation in Los Angeles one hundred million dollars eighty five billion with alligators for law enforcement to address consulates in this over funding of law enforcement says enough we could be fun we can be they'll drive and then one day hopefully in the words of Harriet Tubman you know abolition it comes but until abolition is while we still have to deal with law enforcement we should at least have the focus you know reimagine public safety so that it's not so swath of my own courses yet picture of Stalin Mussolini and Hitler on the ship and we reported him to happens who was dismissive at that's things and this is this was a ninety eighty and this was kind of the culture and it might a lot of unearthly that needs to take place at least eternity back now most of these folks at police academy to statewide police academy from different agencies from all parts of Indiana but my a lot of the unearthing that needs to take place probably should start at police academies where we train our analyst whether safely analyst or FBI analyst or other panelists we're out of the save is coming from right we need to start ethnic having these training centers in terms of animals and fruits I think that's a perfect place to start it is obviously you know people are going through the ends of their training there's zero tolerance of that kind of container it's interesting that five minutes speaks about that time you feel each of the deep here and then hear that from a three-star general send the message and so they should be hearing this and you know there are officers that protected that certainly sounds a certain ideology with t-shirts and it's a certain ideology they don't lose that when they get sworn in and so that could be rooted out screening process which it certainly should be able to detect that and take care of I can tell you in the sweep of California is no shortage of people for babies so we should get the best people and the government earlier there needs to be transparency I to and very disappointed with the numbers of people of color and women for years for Mike and [Music] we respond you wanted me to respond to that because I think that it's not broken and so when you look at the history of law enforcement in the country this what we see with nets to do right and so as long as you this model continues all you can be ring it's thicker it's like dealing with racism dealing with poverty right this country was built on certain things if you just beat her it's not going to be in that and then this is why we advocate the abolition we start again strap that look at how we can address all the safety concern in another kind of way because the tinkering it's been tinkered with the body cameras are glad body cameras and I still get included they people are being trained they know we see videos a white person with the ax in one hand and then the other hand you know the Zuko's with the left foot and some kind of machetes with the right foot and somehow they're able to subdue this person without filming them and then you have someone pull out a lighter or pull up there along with that the black person and they're shot for in 6 - it's not a training problem it's not a leadership problem they know how to operate when they're dealing with white to see me with white folks in the country absolutely other people are not like suddenly there's all these new rules and new ways that are operating and so it's just rotten to the core and thank you thank you very much for mr. Johnson so I would like to ask a couple of questions and you know I'm gonna refer back to my comment mr. Johnson if each of you could speak to the recommendations that you might have for the Congressional Black Caucus rather than the comments as to how to proceed next so we have spoken to turn general you've spoken to the head of the FBI we've spoken to Rosie sink and yes a couple of specific questions what what part of the FBI like generates is not a net like this and then how do you get it retracted how do you get it how do you get them to say okay this is the department we're not asking for names I think you understand what I'm saying how do we get to the source of it because how do you even come up so if you start there then assuming as I keep all the physics faulty and how do you get into your traffic what do they do I think it's at 18,000 law enforcement agencies matter I think mr. German you said a couple of times that you've seen this pop up with local law enforcement what exactly does that mean how did you see that and then they told us every single person told us that there were no investigations right mr. Johnson you were there through all that energy no investigations they didn't say there wasn't surveillance because the me of course you do surveillance is if you get the information to do investigation but now we know about these individuals in Texas including incarcerated since December and black identity extremism Jews but now I hear that there might be other cases and I wanna know if you know of any other cases but going downstream yesterday they're working in the center for civil rights where black life matters and they're hiding let these where information about [Laughter] and usually some documents from the document set historically Chinese people have been involved macaroni Georgia Atlanta there was one that tracked the growth of the black population over 15 years the final box every experience this time neighborhood profiles not me the reason why I brought gray where he was identity with anybody with a white identity right you're talking about very specific versus black identity is pretty much anyway so you and I think that how they care for actually comes out the mentality that created yeah yeah that people of certain races different criminal liberties based only on their race ethnicity and that's just factually false bad intelligence is being sent out and it only contributes to this idea that of the gangsta and when yet yeah it's looking more and more like me then people [Music] well first I want to applaud you and your colleagues for the pressure off of this the pressure works I happen to be President Obama's nominee in 2009 was reported my third dude produced by the Parliament experienced adults and announced unit on right wing excuse me came out constant pressure on Secretary Napolitano that that exported he identified in it was the fact that returning veterans when Iraq Afghanistan be prime targets or recruitment by white supremacist organizations and certain members of Congress took great issue with that she apologized to veterans and remove that report and then unfortunately things that pertain to that report started come true the other thing I would like to point to other local levels let's go back 20 percent Lisa Gotthard put together the Obama administration that's one of the prime community-based documents I've seen in my career with regards to what we need to going forward there are six pillars that are clean identified it was very comprehensively put together by a group of people across the country I don't think we have to reinvent the wheel I think we should look at trying to implement it I can tell you many agencies across the are using that document to change their policies and processes engaging with both locally the campuses meet with organizers and they even have some sort of hearing where we're talking about what people feel safer to talk about their story they really feel like yes we have some kind of cover because people are afraid of retaliation even from their jobs that worked out know that they're involved in this protest works if they speak up and say I'm being surveyed okay well you don't work here anymore so they're like not me themselves and so having that I think would be very important and then the pushback pushes back against termination of protest when you have to sue you're hearing about potentially the creation of a federal crime we need to get ten years in prison for getting arrested at appropriate that is Senate be a felony the things that were clearly missing years it's bad at all I'm now become felony cases only conspiracy cases and with the FBI clicking the lead these big federal crimes until we know what that means when should be booked so you combine that with now creating it and making it a crime to do a protest and making it not a crime to run people over who are engaged in program those wait the sees need to be really helpful with that time push back in terms of legislation and policies it is clearly intended to criminalize to help with more surveillance so it's like let's switch back and cancer surveillance let's push back against the militarization let's push back against the criminalization of advocates when protesters that is black activist protesters that are really trying to move us for a war just society that this country plays it wants to eat thank you anything's something thought-provoking things that you won't have said in the first one my colleagues up here again want to thank you compliment bass for hosting this event I hope it's not the last one what did you say I hope that we take it to the people we help just here you see but we take it out into the lens [Music] lack of diversity in the FBI [Music]

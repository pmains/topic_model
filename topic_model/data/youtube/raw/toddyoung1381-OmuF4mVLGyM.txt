so I've already had some things to say about how the green new deal will not be good for my state of Indiana today I'd like to focus specifically about how the green new deal will not be good for Indiana's farmers roughly a hundred seven thousand Hoosiers depend on our farm economy for their employment for their household income bring in roughly thirty billion dollars to the state of Indiana the co-sponsors and supporters of this initiative the green New Deal have put forward ideas that would require the fundamental rethinking and reworking of long-standing and broadly adopted agricultural practices so imagine if farmers throughout the state of Indiana had to replace their combines their farm machinery with electrical vehicles and technologies imagine if they had to tear down their farm buildings and other structures and rebuild them to the green New Deal standards that are being put forward this is not good for Indiana generally certainly not good for Indiana farmers the green New Deal is unaffordable it's unattainable it is unreasonable and I will continue to fight on behalf of all Hoosiers to ensure that it never becomes the law of the land thank you

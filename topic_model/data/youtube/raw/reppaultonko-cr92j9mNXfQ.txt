Thank You representative Garamendi for leading us in what is a very important bit of discussion and you know infrastructure in a broad term is something that needs our immediate attention because of years of neglect but it comes to that water infrastructure that has been highlighted of late I'd like to call it the hidden infrastructure and it can't be out of sight out of mind that would be a very painful outcome if that's the approach that's that's taken by certainly us as legislators or by society at large for a number of years you're right we have been discussing infrastructure I have made it my goal to invest in water infrastructure for a number of reasons but also because my assignment on the Energy and Commerce Committee as ranker the the lead Democrat on the subcommittee of environment in the economy which reports to Energy and Commerce and it is through that subcommittee that the assignment of the drinking water act is housed and so it's important for us to maintain a vigilance if you will for the outcomes that are deemed acceptable and that is that we do not receive a D on our report card for water infrastructure you know when you shared that information representative Garamendi I thought to myself if any of us brought home a D on a report card that would be you know a little bit of challenge offered our way to improve that report guard with the next semester and so I believe that we have failed in this effort to maintain a strong federal partnership there's been a lot of finger-pointing going on since the Flint Michigan issue rose in the in the public's awareness as a national issue and that finger-pointing won't solve anything but if we're going to finger point we need to also internalize that we need to look at Congress and what it's done when you talked about the levels of funding in the early 70s I came out to my County Board 1976 in Montgomery County in upstate New York and I can vividly recall that we had a very lucrative revenue flow from the federal government for our water systems today what we look at is like a four percent investment on the total bill coming from the federal government that is inadequate grossly inadequate and the fact that we can turn our backs on this infrastructure and allow situations like flint michigan or sebring ohio or troy new york or los angeles california to grip us to shock our senses and not respond leaves us in a very pitiful state I believe we need to do better than that we need to form a plan of action and that plan of action must include a stronger investment in the infrastructure the water infrastructure of this country now some of that requires also I think a enhancement of the the investment made in the drinking water srf the state revolving fund that fund has not been reauthorized since 2003 and so we need to go forward and reauthorize and enhance the srf so that our state's as partners with the federal government can then go forward and have some relief in responding to the straps cities that are really impacted by declining tax base in many cases a very small bit of population in some of our rural communities that are trying to maintain systems that want to speak to public health and public safety and to offer a commodity that is not only important but essential it's essential quality of life in our homes it's essential for small business it's essential for our manufacturing base it's essential for our farming community all of this requires water and many suggest that we're transitioning from an oil-based economy to a water based economy so if we're anticipating greater use and rated greater reliance on water as a commodity let's port our act into working order that means that you invest not like we did last year where the outcome was at some 800 43 million dollars that was some 43 million dollars worth of a cut that's completely going in the wrong direction that is not listening to the needs of local government or to the basic core essential need of water sound drinking water clean drinking water it's blue infrastructure that's what we need to invest in making certain that we have in abundance and an essential supply of clean drinking water it's absolutely mandatory in a modern economy if we're going to compete effectively in an innovation economy we need to provide the essentials including water to the business and residential community to the AG community when I look at some of the neglect it is so interesting to see that we wait for crises like that of Flint does Flint require federal investment absolutely I stand ready and willing to assist Flint what happened there I would rank is immoral and so we need to move forward and assist splint but the story the saga shouldn't begin and end there we need to create a national response that empowers our communities across the country and we need to have interaction dialogue at the table to best understand where we have fallen down when we have failed we need to have officials from Flint Michigan and from the state of Michigan here to testify think it's appropriate for the governor of that state to walk away from that invitation it's important for us to go forward with the sort of communication the dialogue that will build the soundest response and if we do not respond out of necessity to flint and Troy New York and to Sebring Ohio and to Los Angeles California the list continues to grow we will then just see these issues keep rising in our communities when I last saw Troy New York's dilemma they were repairing in the worst weather conditions that were near zero where they needed to heat the site in order to weld the the the work the welding in great the materials that were completing the project a major live representative Garamendi broke their main line a 33 inch pipe shooting water 100 feet into the air 10 million gallons into the street are we going to sit back and say that's acceptable in a nation like this a nation of abundance that considers it a world leader no world leading nation can ignore its infrastructure like we have ignored the water infrastructure blue infrastructure is what we should be about providing that clean drinking water we have nearly a quarter of a million breaks annually in the systems from coast to coast a quarter of a million seven hundred some breaks per day think about it that would be acceptable to an order ordinary business plan of any type it should not be acceptable to the federal government plan to assist communities with the sound commodity of drinking water so representative Garamendi I am just thrilled to join you this evening to continue to carry the message forward that we need action we need a plan of action we need commit and we need resources and with begins now every missed opportunity here will perhaps caused the opportunity for yet another tragedy in a community that just should not happen so again it's about investing soundly effectively appropriately in what is an essential commodity that being water for our communities

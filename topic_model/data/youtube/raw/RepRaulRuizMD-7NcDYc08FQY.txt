i rise today in support of s-1511 the protecting america's first responders act this bill will go a long way in supporting the families of fallen officers and improving the public safety officers benefits program improving the psob program has been a long-standing priority of mine in fact today's legislation includes a provision from my bill the heroes leslie zeremy and guild vega first responder survivor support act which fixes the benefit determination date so that families don't lose out on thousands of dollars because of bureaucratic delays in addition to passing today's legislation we must also increase the psob death and disability benefit to get our law enforcement families the benefit they've earned and deserve i look forward to working with chairman nadler to build on today's success and passing my bill the first responder survivor support act to raise the psob benefit this congress so i urge my colleagues to support the families of our nation's law enforcement officers and vote yes on the protecting america's first responders act thank you and i yield back you

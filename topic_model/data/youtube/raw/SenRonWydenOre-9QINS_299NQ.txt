thank you all for coming today senator Murkowski and I are announcing the first Senate bipartisan campaign finance reform proposal in a decade legislation that forces all significant financial contributors and spenders to disclose where money is coming from and going to in real time and ends the flagrant abuses of federal tax laws by political operatives masquerading as tax-exempt social welfare organizations our bill provides no political advantage whatever to partisans everybody is treated the same with one exception the small financial contributor is afforded more confidentiality than the large ones the legislation is built on the same principles that make our financial markets work markets move on information and transparency and everybody's got to play by the same rules the need for information and transparency was made clear in the last election cycle with the massive outside spending that took place much of which was funded through shell organizations where there were untraceable contributors the 6.3 billion dollars it was spent was the most ever and by some accounts more than thirty percent of the outside spending was funded in secret by undisclosed donors nearly two-thirds of 2012 voters including majorities of Democrats Republicans and independents said that big donors and secret money undermine the democratic process in the last election so the follow the money proposal that Senator Murkowski and I make today offers a number of important changes that reflect what we have seen as elections election practices have evolved over the past decade first it provides for real-time disclosure so voters know where the money is coming from especially in the closing days of elections right now the quarterly political reporting system breeds cynicism by allowing a flood of anonymous late minute independent spending that people only find out much later than the election second our proposal stops what I believe are really offensive flagrant abuses of the tax laws that are intended to help charities in America bringing the strength of the Internal Revenue Service and federal election commission together as we do can provide an effective focused and an aggressive enforcement effort that's needed to stop the growing abuses by what are essentially so-called social welfare organizations our follow the money proposal requires entity any entity regardless of their tax status to identify the funders of any political activity they engage it if an organization is not engaged in independent election related activity no reporting requirements trigger to follow the money Act make sure that no political actor is left out by focusing on political activity rather than trying to define the wide cast of characters that try to influence elections to follow the money act preemptively closes loopholes that those who seek to anonymously influence elections are certain to seek out and the reason we say it is that's been the history of campaign law in addition to empowering the IRS and federal election commission to better enforce campaign laws this legislation ensures a consistent enforcement regime that spans both agencies and if the IRS and the Federal Election Commission can't agree because we've seen them essentially go back and forth and sort of look at each other we include a trigger to make sure they do act where Treasury would be made responsible for sorting out the differences in creating a single set of definitions and rules for the first time finally the follow the money Act builds on what are called the stand by your ad provisions which I authored on a bipartisan basis with Senator Collins in 2002 there's no reason corporations unions 501 C 4 organizations and any all and any and all who are funding election ads shouldn't be held to the same transparency standards as candidates the senator Murkowski myself and everyone who's running for office I don't think I could have a better partner in this effort we've been aptus we were kind of walking back to calendar for pretty much the last year and let me just turn it over to Senator Murkowski oh thank you baby and Senator Wyden I think has outlined here today what the meat of the the proposal is and I want to start my comments by acknowledging that what you're seeing in this proposal that is different then you have seen in the disclose act that was before the Senate last summer and then prior to is this is a bill that is designed to be bipartisan this is a bill that is designed to be even across the board absolutely transparent in all aspects of it and I think because of how we have designed it I think you have an opportunity for success with this legislation because of how we have approached the to itself we actually started talking about this last summer and in an effort to really try to figure out how can we build a campaign disclosure bill a set of laws that is applied equally because I think if you go back to where we were with the disclose act you had criticisms on all sides it was going to give an unfair advantage to the labor unions the Republican is declared and on the other side the the folks were saying well it's going to give an unfair advantage to to some of your friends as well whether it be the NRA because it allows for a loophole for memberships well what we've done is we look to all the objections we looked to to how the disclose act was set up and said we don't want to go there because it's not my intention I don't think it's senator Wyden's intention that anybody gets an unfair advantage it's even steven across the board and maybe that's where we'll have the opposition to this bipartisan proposal because it is going to make a little more work for some who have enjoyed the benefits of anonymity who have enjoyed the benefits of not having to disclose who have enjoyed the benefits of a tax code that is really sheltering them from from the need to be open and and full and complete in your disclosure so we've got a different proposal out there that really does focus on improving the transparency of our campaigns by by bringing bringing that money out of the shadows if someone wants to be a major player in this political process they don't get that anonymity that they presently receive the public will be able to get that real-time information that is critical we level that playing field by requiring all independent spenders play by the same rules the rules are the same for everyone whether you're wealthy whether you're the well-organized funders the tax-exempt Social Welfare organizations so what we've done is by focusing on the activity itself on political activity rather than trying to define the characters as Senator Wyden has said we we struggled with that you find out that's not the way to approach it the way to approach it is to to focus on the political activity itself so we close those loopholes we close those loopholes ahead of time by by those who would to seek to to hide from any level of disclosure and again I think when when you look to what senator Wyden and I are proposing today there is no reason that this bipartisanship that you see standing before you today should not extend to two other members of the Senate that it should not enjoy support on the house side this is this is exactly what I think the public has been asking for when they're saying what's going on within the campaign sphere that allows an individual or an organization to engage in what they all have made the assumption is is election election activity federal election activity and yet there is an anonymity out there that they don't understand well what we're trying to do again is bring about transparency bring about a truly even playing field and to meet the concerns of the public when it comes to how campaign dollars are raised and how they are spent so I'm proud to stand with my colleague today you usually see us in this room and over in Dirksen talking about energy we're branching out pushing outside of that mold into the brave new world of campaign disclosure and it's good to be there with my colleague softball questions welcome about the volume of my weird owners still be able to place seven hundred thousand dollars into a super packet then spends that money to get you elected it it treats the big donors those that effectively if you want to give a million dollars you can give a million dollars but there is disclosure there is no way around the disclosure so if you are a small donor if you're less than the thousand dollars and and our legislation does does raise that disclosure requirement level from the current FEC requirement of 202 now 1000 so if you're below 1000 you're exempt from the disclosure if you're above you're disclosing and of course the Supreme Court has said that you can't place those kinds of limits so the question you know is voters don't want to be detectives they want to know who's contributing and they want to know at a crucial time before they make election decisions and Senator Murkowski is both of us have indicated we felt that what happened in kind of past debates because people were sort of talking past each other one group said well we want to deal with this group but not that we said all actors all major spenders and all major donors are brought under this debt distant and the reality today particularly with the available availability of online communications and you know we have credit card contributions on under this they have to be made available essentially than 48 hours checks a little bit longer but it's going to be a new day where voters are actually going to be able to see where money is coming from and going to before they exercise the franchise well this is this is an issue I think that all of us here in the Senate we've all had to go through through an election some of us have been the beneficiary of some of these independent expenditure activities some of us have been on the receiving end of some pretty directed campaigns that haven't helped us in that effort so you kind of come at it from both perspectives and I think there is a recognition that the system out there as it is currently set up doesn't doesn't give the public the information that they would hope nor does it give the candidate the information that they would hope and so as much pushback as there may have been by members on the Republican side of the aisle when it came to the disclose act I think part of that opposition was due to the fact that they felt that that particular measure was chipped in favor of some of the entities that were out there and they weren't about to go for it so again what we have designed is something that is applicable across the board it is a uniform set of rules so I have had discussions with colleagues not only on the Republican side of the aisle but the Democrat side of the aisle and you know is this going to be easy no is this going to be necessary yes Peter I I'd only like to second with Senator Murkowski has said because both of us have had senators from both political parties approached us and asked us about what we're working on we basically kicked this off back in December we wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post we asked for public input so this has been percolating around and we're both encouraged by the fact that senators of both parties are coming up to us I just visited a little bit go with sheldon whitehouse for example who chairs the Democratic caucus task force on campaign finance he liked the other centers is very interested in all the efforts that can be made in order to bring together bipartisan support for the very reasons that Senator Murkowski is talking about in that the current system doesn't work for anybody it's taking a toll on the credibility of our political process senators you know often talk among themselves about this whole issue and particularly now as we've gone to these 501 C 4 is where there's no disclosure at all centers of both political parties think this is broken and we think we're coming along at the right time in order to develop I want to add one thing to what senator Wyden has just mentioned and that's the process with which we took to get where we are today we did not sit down I didn't sit down draft a bill and go to Senator Wyden and say hey join me on this we are we are really trying to be as open and transparent in building this legislation as we are with the intent of the legislation itself the fact that we put a white paper out there at the end of the year and really solicited input we were the ones that posited a series of questions saying give us feedback on this is this the right area when we started this the numbers that we were using in terms of of the the minimum disclosure requirements change we took that input and it has been a very collaborative transparent process to date so it'll say whatever but what are the questions you talked about for registration requirement receiving ten thousand dollars more in fronts and going day aloft by the donor or recipient inviolable company gives cookie Chamber of Commerce for my little penguin I'm trying to 50 back down to the labor union to spank but I don't a life for a man to hear its goals with money is fungible how does that work to guarantee that won't leave this house that muskoka also we saw especially in the last race of red LLC and RT h HQ LLC and even w Spanish LLC's that sprung up only to give a million dollars or so disappeared and we had no idea who find out how you how to make sure that those the real source that money's disclosed I think what you described sets our definition of politically related activity and let me just kind of outline it i mean we i'm not sure i followed all the the specifics of your example but the bill requires a comprehensive disclosure of independent federal election related activity with money coming out and money coming in and money going out and we define independent federal election related activity as an expenditure which is almost always money made by any person for the purpose of influencing the selection or the nomination or election of any individual by a person or an entity whose independent into candidate and i'll probably have to unpack later some of the specifics of your example but it sure sounds like what you asked meets the definition senator Murkowski and i are talking about of independent federal election related activity that money'd have to be disclosed when I think to just to add on here I'll repeat again it doesn't matter who you are but what it is that you do and so as Senator Wyden has outlined it if what you're doing is designed to play in an election either through advertisement or through fundraising polling messaging development delivery of the message to the voter then it doesn't make any difference what design you are whether you're an LLC or whether in an Indian tribe 501c3 doesn't make any difference it doesn't matter who you are it matters what you do and if you are engaged in in federal independent expenditures federal election related activity that's where you go you mentioned the registration aspect at what happens then who's held accountable that's one of the components of this bill right now the way our system is you can have not necessarily a fictitious person but a person who's here today gone tomorrow and there's nobody that is held accountable we require with the registration basically it's akin to a registered agent that is is on the hook if you will they are responsible along with that treasure so there is accountability there even beyond that election when that organization may have gone poof when we take maybe 11 more with Tom why don't you and then I will tell you about the special Bonin's that you have associated with this cause this is a bill that is under 50 pages yeah so there's a special perk Tom go ahead with your definition for the purpose of influencing an election in other words organization mentioned senator Murkowski if you are pretty much didn't mention you in any connection how do you make the judgment that that's for the purpose of influencing the election well this is where we go back to substance over form here and so it may be that it is a determination by by the FEC to decide whether or not that was just mentioning Lisa Murkowski name in an offhand way or whether it really is designed to be an independent federal election related activity so it I think the the design of this legislation is to if it if it looks like a what's the expression if it looks like a duck and it quacks like a duck then it's a duck here let's not get too caught up in whether or not it says vote for Lisa Murkowski and so what we're trying to do because so much of what we've seen in these past election cycles have been the just trying to skate close enough they're saying it's an it's an issue ad but at the end of the day we all know what it is it's designed to help the Republican candidate might not necessarily mention my name but if it if it looks like election related activity it's probably going to be determined to be so Tom let me just add add to that because I agree completely with what Senator Murkowski is talking about to put this in a little bit of a historical context I mean everybody knows people always no matter what is done try to figure out a way to get around whatever you have and so what we've seen is every election somebody comes up with a new business model it's sort of new and improved and the whole goal is to basically try to get around the lacs contribution and disclosure holes that exist so historically we went from packs to super PACs and now we're into the 501 C 4 and if you ask me LLC S & S corporations could well be next and I think that's what the gentleman's question in the front row no dealt with so what senator Murkowski and I are talking about is getting away from that kind of model and talk about political activity election-related political activity no advantage to partisans that was one of the big hang-ups before is everybody felt well we'll get more out of this than the other person we have honeycombed this debate and that's why we sort of vetted it with the public and we think now you know Sierra Club small donors NRA small donors all of these people are treated alike to essentially come under the small donor exception and what we're hoping I want to give the last word to Senator Murkowski what we're hoping is that centers will see that after 10 years of a partisan back and forth on this issue the two of us are interested in working with our colleagues we're not saying this is the last you know worry here by pass this bill into law next 48 hours we think this is something that senators on both sides of the aisle can begin to work with and we can finally turn this around last word for my colleague well last word that I will offer is we have been wrestling with with how to deal with the Citizens United case since that that that came out and and trying to understand truly what it meant now some some are going to look at this legislation and will argue that there is this First Amendment right to give millions of dollars anonymously for for political activity and they're not going to like this bill they're not going to like it because they believe that it is absolutely unlimited I think we're senator Wyden and I have come down on this argument is that where we're kind of standing with with Justice Scalia on one who said in Dover's is really says requiring people to stand up in public for their political acts Foster's civic courage without which democracy is doomed and I think this is where we are coming from there is that that certain First Amendment right you can go ahead and give that million-dollar donation if you wish or you can give that fifty dollar donation if you wish but there is there will be a process there will be a standard for disclosure which will be fair which will be uniform and which I think will help reform the process so I think we're off to a good start and we look forward to picking up some more friends along the way thanks everybody

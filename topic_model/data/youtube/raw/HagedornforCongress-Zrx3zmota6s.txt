and I looked at it and I said wait a second you know I preach this I preach that politics is not a spectator sport and that we all have to get up off the couch and do something and I looked at the election results last time here in the congressional districts and I said to myself oh my gosh if people like me had just gotten up off the couch and done something Jim Hagedorn would be our congressman today I mean he came within a whisker of winning in the last election and some people say well he should have done better you know Trump carried the district but the truth the matter is there were a whole lot of people especially and I could call him out by name on the radio station but I won't do that but there are a lot of people right here in Rochester and I put myself at the top of the list who didn't lift a finger to help Jim in the last election if we had done that we would win he'd be the congressman frankly he'd probably be a congressman for a long time in this district because he's basically a very good guy he's a solid conservative he's got great values the more I've gotten annoying and I'm not alone Rudy Boschwitz and I have been helping him helping him raise money helping him with events and so forth and it the reason is the more we've gotten to know him the more we like him the more we think he'll do a great job for us in Washington

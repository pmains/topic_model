F HOMELAND SECURITY ISSUED A STATEMENT SAYING IT WOULD TERMINATE THE PROGRAM AS SOON AS LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE. I'M PLEASED TO WELCOME THE JUNIOR SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA, ALEX PADILLA. SENATOR, AN IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY TOLD THE TEXAS TRIBUNE THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION CAN IMMEDIATELY STOP ENFORCING THE PROGRAM. BUT THE SUPREME COURT'S RULING LEAVES THE DOOR OPEN FOR TEXAS AND OTHER STATES TO CONTINUE PRESSING TO FORCE THE ADMINISTRATION TO CONTINUE THE PROGRAM. SENATOR, DO YOU BELIEVE THE ADMINISTRATION IS PREPARED TO STOP UNROLLING NEW MIGRANTS AND BEGIN THE WIND DOWN OF THOSE WHO DO STILL REMAIN STUCK IN MEXICO? >> I DO BELIEVE SO. AND I THINK THEY HAVE SAID AS MUCH. YOU REFERENCED THE DEPARTMENT'S STATEMENT TODAY, THAT THEY WOULD END THE PROGRAM, AS SOON AS LEGALLY FEASIBLE, WHICH SHOULD BE MUCH SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. ALICIA, IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK WITH YOU. AND I THINK THE WAY YOU DESCRIBED TODAY'S RULING IS RIGHT ON. [INAUDIBLE] PREPARE FOR THE WORST. THIS MAY BE A SMALL WIN, BUT IT'S A WIN NONETHELESS WITH SO MUCH MORE WORK TO DO. LET'S TERMINATE THE REMAIN-IN-MEXICO PROGRAM. TITLE 42 SHOULD BE NEXT. THERE'S [INAUDIBLE] TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ERA POLICIES THAT NEED TO BE UNDONE. SO LET'S GO ABOUT THIS IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, BOTH UNDER A DIVIDED ADMINISTRATION, AND CONGRESS, TO MODERNIZE OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS, BECAUSE IT'S OUR BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT IS LEADING TO THE TRAGEDIES THAT WE SEE AT THE BORDER, THAT WE SAW IN SAN ANTONIO AND SO MANY OTHERS. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT WE SAW IN SAN ANTONIO, SENATOR. MORE THAN 50 MIGRANTS FOUND DEAD IN A SWELTERING TRACTOR TRAILER. TODAY, FOUR MIGRANTS WERE KILLED IN TEXAS AS AUTHORITIES CHASED ALLEGED HUMAN SMUGGLERS. THE WASHINGTON POST EDITORIAL BOARD WRITES, QUOTE, THE ABSENCE OF ANY WORKABLE LEGAL SYSTEMS THAT WOULD ADMIT MIGRANTS IN NUMBERS THAT WOULD MEET THE U.S. LABOR MARKETS DEMAND IS THE ORIGINAL SIN OF THE CHAOS AT THE BORDER. THAT IS, CONGRESS CONGRESS'S BIPARTISAN FAILURE, A SYMPTOM OF SYSTEMIC PARALYSIS FOR MANY YEARS. SENATOR, WHAT IS BEING DONE RIGHT NOW TO PREVENT THESE DEATHS AND FIX THE SYSTEM? >> LOOK, ALICIA, AS YOU KNOW, IMMIGRATION FORM HAS BEEN ONE OF MY TOP PRIORITIES SINCE I CAME INTO THIS SENATE A YEAR AND A HALF AGO. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY HOURS I PUT INTO BIPARTISAN NEGOTIATIONS LAST. YEAR ONE ON ONE REPUBLICAN CONVERSATIONS WITH MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES. [INAUDIBLE] WITH THE PARLIAMENTARIAN OF THE SENATE, MOVING THE RECONCILIATION PROGRESS PROCESS THAT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. WE HAVE BEEN PUSHING THE WHITE HOUSE TO DO MORE. I GUESS, GOOD NEWS IS TALKS HAVE REOPENED BETWEEN DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. BUT WHETHER IT IS THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF DACA AND THE ONGOING LIMBO THAT DREAMERS LIVE IN, THESE [INAUDIBLE] SAN ANTONIO -- HOW BROKEN THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IS AND THE URGENT NEED FOR US TO FINALLY ACT. THE REASON YOU HAVE THESE TRAGEDIES IS BECAUSE THE LAWFUL MIGRATION PATHWAYS JUST AREN'T THERE. IT'S NOT WORKING. AND SO FOR ALL MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES WHO BEAT THEIR CHEST AND SCREAM FROM THE MOUNTAIN TOPS ABOUT, QUOTE UNQUOTE, ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION OR IRREGULAR MIGRATION -- WELL, THE WAY TO FIX IT IS TO FIX THE LEGAL MIGRATION PATHWAYS. AND DON'T JUST TAKE OUR WORDS FOR IT. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMY EACH AND EVERY DAY. EACH BUSINESS LEADER, EVERY ECONOMIST, IS TELLING US THAT THE LABOR SHORTAGE IN AMERICA IS LEADING TO HIGHER PRICES. WE NEED IMMIGRANT LABOR AND THE JOBS THAT AMERICANS JUST WON'T DO. >> SENATOR, PIVOTING BACK TO THE COURT, TODAY WAS A RARE VICTORY FOR THE WHITE HOUSE WHEN IT COMES TO THE SUPREME COURT. THERE ARE MANY DEMOCRATS DEMANDING SIGNIFICANT REFORM TO THE COURT. WHERE DO YOU STAND ON THAT? >> LOOK, JUST LOOK AT WHAT THE SUPREME COURT HAS DONE THIS SESSION AND IN RECENT YEARS. THIS SUPREME COURT HAS DECIMATED VOTING RIGHTS. IF YOU LOOK BACK TO 2013, WITH THIS SESSION ALONE, TO UNDO THE PROTECTIONS OF ROE V. WADE, WHICH STOOD FOR NEARLY 50 YEARS, TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO IMPROVE GUN SAFETY AND THEY ARE COMMUNITIES AND JUST TODAY -- I REPRESENT CALIFORNIA, ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS, FOR THIS EXTREME CONSERVATIVE SUPREME COURT TO TIE THE HANDS OF AGENCIES THAT ARE CHARGED WITH PROTECTING OUR ENVIRONMENTS, I THINK, SETS A BAD TONE AND MESSAGE FOR A LOT OF OTHER POLICY AREAS. SO, REFORM IS ABSOLUTELY NEEDED. THE SUPREME COURT -- IT'S ALSO REMIND FOR CONGRESS TO DO ITS JOB. WHEN THE SUPREME COURT STARTS UNDOING ESTABLISHED POLICY, THEN WE NEED TO ACT TO EMBED THOSE RIGHTS, STARTING WITH ROE V. WADE, INTO FEDERAL LAW. AND IT SHOULD BE A WAKE UP CALL AND AN ALARM GOING OFF WHEN JUSTICES WHO ARE COMING THROUGH FOR CONFIRMATION SAID ONE THING, BUT ONCE YOU ARE ON THE BENCH ARE SAYING AND DOING ANOTHER -- AMERICA DESERVES BETTER. >> LET ME ASK YOU, SENATOR, BECAUSE I'VE HEARD YOU TALK ABOUT MORE ACCOUNTABILITY, ETHICS FOR SUPREME COURT JUSTICES -- WHAT EXACTLY CAN CONGRESS DO ABOUT THAT? HOW CAN THEY ACHIEVE THAT? >> AGAIN, THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE HAPPENING IN REALTIME, IN THE HOPES THAT IN THE WEEKS AHEAD THERE MAY BE MEASURES COMING THROUGH. AS A MEMBER OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, TRUST ME, PEOPLE ARE PRETTY LIVID AT NOT JUST THE RULINGS AND POLICY OUTCOMES BUT THE RATIONALE THAT THESE EXTREMIST SUPREME COURT JUSTICES USED TO JUSTIFY THEIR DECISIONS. IN THE PRIOR PANEL, YOU HAD A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE CASE THAT CAME OUT TODAY. THE POLICY AREAS -- IT'S NOT JUST ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION THAT IS JEOPARDIZED AND UNDERMINED, IT'S A WHOLE LOT OF OTHER ISSUES. THE RATIONALE THE SUPREME COURT USED TO UNDO ROE V. WADE, IN THE NEAR TERM, IF YOU LISTEN TO CLARENCE THOMAS'S OPINION, HE IS CALLING ON OTHER LITIGATION TO UNDO ACCESS TO CONTRACEPTION, TO UNDO MARRIAGE EQUALITY AND SO MUCH MORE. SO YES, WE NEED TO BUTTRESS THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS, PASS ETHICS REFORMS, BECAUSE THERE'S CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AT THE SUPREME COURT
